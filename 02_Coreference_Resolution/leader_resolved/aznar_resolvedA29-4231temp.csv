THE government of Felipe Gonzalez is dying on its feet. Every week seems to bring some new cry of pain. Mr Gonzalez's opponents, in politics and the press, say that he must go. The prime minister, battered and weary, has already been pushed into calling an election next spring, a year before he legally had to. The conservative opposition easily won last summer's city and regional elections; it controls 17 of Spain's 20 biggest cities and won 11 of 13 regional votes. The end of an era is at hand. What went wrong for Mr Gonzalez, and what can the other lot do to put it right?
On the face of it, the answer to the first question seems simple. Spain's establishment is drowning in a sea of corruption. Ever since Mr Gonzalez's long-serving number two, Alfonso Guerra, had to resign in 1991 after a scandal involving his businessman brother, the government has tottered from one embarrassment to the next.
There was the row about illegal financing of the ruling Socialist party. There was the sudden departure from office, amid accusations of tax-evasion and other things, of a governor of the Bank of Spain. A righteous-sounding Socialist, picked to be Spain's first civilian head of the main police force, the Civil Guard, was accused of massive embezzlement and after a ten-month manhunt was tracked down and arrested in comically louche circumstances in Bangkok. Now reports about the financial dealings of the generally popular King Juan Carlos are sharpening the sense of concern.
Most dangerously for Mr Gonzalez, a dozen senior policemen and top Socialists, including a former deputy minister of the interior, have been charged with running death squads that killed at least 27 suspected Basque terrorists in the mid-1980s. Can this have happened without Mr Gonzalez's knowledge? He says he knew nothing. The senate has set up a commission to look into the matter. The Supreme Court has asked for parliamentary immunity to be lifted so that a former interior minister can be charged with collusion in the murders.
Few people think that Mr Gonzalez himself, even if he knew of the death squads' existence, ordered the killing of those Basques (and it should be added that many Spaniards, even on the left, think the dead men got what they deserved). Nor do most people think he himself has been corrupt, though many of his friends clearly were. But Mr Gonzalez was too close to the scandals for his authority to remain undamaged. His subsequent wrigglings have done nothing to repair the damage. The steady piling up of embarrassment has taken its toll. His friends say he may stand down even before the coming election, which is due in March.
How well it all began
That would be a wry end to his 13 years in office, a period longer than any recent European leader can claim except Germany's Helmut Kohl. Whatever his government's recent shortcomings, Spain has experienced a marvellous transformation since Mr Gonzalez became prime minister in 1982.
That was only seven years after the death of General Franco, and one year after an attempted military coup. Yet Mr Gonzalez, a lad of 40 when he assumed that heritage, will leave behind him a solidly democratic Spain. This is now a country that, a few wild-eyed Basques apart, sees elections as the right and proper way of changing governments. Francoism has become a dim memory, and yet there has been little persecution of old Francoists. The army is safely back in barracks. The government of Spain has been desirably decentralised, and the power transferred to the regions has made it harder for Basque terrorists to win new recruits to their anti-Madrid cause.
Not least, Mr Gonzalez's Socialist government has changed the nature of Spanish socialism. Most of the people around him now call themselves Social Democrats rather than Socialists, and say they belong to the ""centre-left"". They have a middle-class feel to them, which is not unconnected to the fact that Mr Gonzalez has been able to win four elections in a row chiefly because much of Spain's burgeoning middle class has so far been happy to vote for him.
In economics, Mr Gonzalez has junked much of the ideological baggage his party carried into office 13 years ago. His has been a truly free-market government-rigorously monetarist, hospitable to foreign investors, firm with the trade unions, gradually willing to privatise, a dutiful slaughterer of quite a few useless industrial dinosaurs. As a result, Spain's GDP has slowly crept up from 71% of the European Union's average in 1983 to 75% in 1994. After a bad recession made worse by carelessness, growth is back to 3% a year and 1995's inflation is likely to be no worse than about 4 1/2%. A recent United Nations report rated Spain ninth in the world for its ""quality of life"". Today's Spaniards live as long as other Europeans, with an average male life-span of 73.
Mr Gonzalez's achievements abroad are no less striking. He swept Spain into the European Community (partly on the argument that membership would help to keep Spain democratic), fought off the opposition of old-guard Socialists to win a referendum that brought the country into NATO, and allowed America to keep its military bases in Spain. Mr Gonzalez has opened Spain to the world. He has made Spain look modern, and helped Spaniards to relax.
So what went wrong?
The fall from those heights is not just the result of a string of. Other things have gone wrong, just as seriously. The Spanish government, rather like Britain's, mismanaged an economic boom in the second half of the 1980s. As the head of the securities and exchange commission puts it, ""Spanish society went a bit crazy in 1986-87. Everybody thought they could become billionaires."" The government failed to keep inflation under control. A lot of flashy firms, having borrowed too much, went bust. As the economy then contracted, unemployment and the public-sector deficit both shot up.
Worse, the economy has a number of structural weaknesses that the government has addressed too timidly, too late or not at all. Spain's labour market is expensively inflexible: firms wanting to shed workers often have to pay them 45 days' compensation for every year they have worked, one of the costliest pay-offs in Europe. As a result, an increasing number of Spaniards-more than a third, say the unions-are now hired on short-term contracts, which they do not like. The Spanish tax system badly needs modernising, but the government has yet to make a start on the job.
The blackest economic cloud hanging over Spain, though, is joblessness. The official figure puts unemployment at 22% of the workforce, the highest in the European Union, way ahead even of Finland's 17%. Even when you allow for people with jobs in the unofficial economy, surveys suggest that about 17% of adult Spaniards have no proper work. The state's generous help for the rural poor reduces the number prepared to go and look for work in the towns, which is anyway pretty hard to find. On any calculation, Spain's performance in this field is the worst in the West.
Nor has this produced the industrial discipline the theorist might have expected. Spain has the EU'S second-worst figure for days lost in strikes, after Greece. There have been angry riots over the closing down of uneconomic shipyards. And the growing economic gloom of the past few years is compounded by the fact that Spain has lately suffered its longest and worst drought in the whole of the century. This has hurt agriculture, which still provides work for a lot of people; and, since Spain is one of those south European countries where city workers like to think they can turn to their country cousins for help when times are hard, it deepens the general demoralisation.
All in all, after a splendid beginning, the Socialists find themselves battered by a series of storms they have not been able to cope with. It is hard to say what Spanish socialism now consists of. The party has adopted practically all the economic doctrines of the European centre, even of the centre-right. Its supporters like to say that theycare more about povertythan the opposition does, that they are more sensitive to the Basque and Catalan desire for a sense of regional identity, that they are a shade ""more European"". All these things may be true, but they are more differences of feeling than of hard policy. It is also true that many Socialists, asked what makes them Socialists, put ""religion"" at the top oftheir list: antipathy to the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic church remains strong. But that is not, in today's Spain, an issue likely to make much difference at the polls.
The original driving-force of Spanish socialism was anti-Francoism. The Socialists of those days were the party of democracy, tolerance, modernity. Now that those things are no longer at issue, Spain's socialism has become a matter of mood. This is why the scandals have so damaged the Socialists. Many Spaniards who came to political maturity in the post-Franco era are shocked by the cynicism the scandals have exposed. ""We Socialists were not supposed to be like that,"" says a literary lioness in Madrid. That is true, and it stings. The shape of the alternative
The Spanish right is now embodied in the People's Party (PP), led by Jose Maria Aznar, himself a relative lad of 42. His party has three main components.
There is the centre-right, which loves to use words like ""pragmatic"" and ""moderate"" about itself, and believes earnestly in consensus, and is in general rather like the more solemn segments of Germany's Christian Democrats. Next comes the residue of the old Francoist right-traditionalist, centralist, nationalistic in the old Castilian way, pro-church, still more than a touch authoritarian. And then there is the new lot, the economic liberals, some of whom call themselves ""Thatcherites"". These people are keen to reduce the size of the state and let the free market rip, zealous in attacking the growing culture of welfare dependency, no believers in boring old consensus.
The consensus-seeking centre-right is the largest single element in this mixture. Most people in Madrid who take an interest in politics reckon that, if the People's Party wins the coming election, the centre-right will try to insist on setting the government's course. This group's main characteristic, judging by what its leaders say, is caution. In the run-up to the election, it will take great care not to frighten voters who have yet to make up their minds.
Last time, Mr Gonzalez scared many
Spaniards into believing that the right intended to turn back the clock, grind the faces of the poor, and so on. The new centre-right stresses the democratic, middle-class mildness that used to be the Socialists' territory. It no longer follows the Roman Catholic church on divorce, abortion and homosexuality. Nor does it champion the merits of a centralised government.
It wants to reassure people on the edges of Spain, not least the large middle class of Catalonia, politically the most important of Spain's regions. ""I prefer the federal structure,"" says a would-be finance minister, rejecting the Castilian right's old fear that Spain's unity could be undermined by breakaway Basques and Catalans. Even an old-guard figure such as Manuel Fraga, a minister under Franco who led the PP'S immediate precursor, the People's Alliance, now espouses the cause of Gallego, the local dialect of Galicia, the region he governs. Many Spaniards doubt that the People's Party has entirely changed its ideas on this subject, but the party's moderates know that the risk of being called a bunch of Castilians is their Achilles heel. They will try hard not to let it bring them to the ground.
These centre-rightists also say they will press on with the economic reforms begun by the modernisers in the Socialist Party; they believe in privatisation, deregulation, monetary rigour. But they are consolidators, not revolutionaries.
It is true that the party's economists say the tax structure should be simplified, and the top rate cut from 56% to 40%. They want contributions to the social welfare budget, currently 28.3% of the basic salary (and almost entirely paid for by employers), cut by 5%. Property, corporation and enterprise taxes should go down, too. Transport, communications, energy and banking need to be more vigorously opened up to competition. The state airline, Iberia, needs a thorough shaking up. Labour should be made more flexible (ie, easier to sack). The number of ministries and the size of their staffs must be cut.
But on each point the spokesmen of the party take care to counsel caution. Changes cannot occur in the first budget. Pensions cannot be reformed ""too soon"". Taxes cannot be reduced, reasonably enough, until there is agreement on how spending can be cut. On a wide range of issues little seems to distinguish the mainstream of the People's Party from the Socialists. Many businessmen, still fond of the corporatist consensus, will not urge a new government towards radicalism of the right. ""Politicians don't want to create panic,"" observes a car maker, approvingly.
On foreign policy, the gap between the parties, says Javier Solana, the foreign minister, is ""zero . . . You need a microscope to see the differences."" Mr Solana admits that the People's Party might be ""a bit more Gaullist"". Certainly it sounds a shade more nationalist in defence of Spanish fishermen, and more determined to protect the country's dairy farmers. It might beat the drum harder on Gibraltar. But on the main issue, the future of the European Union, most of the leading figures in the centre-right section of the party sound little different from the Socialists. The possible next foreign minister, Rafael Arias Salgado, says his party is ""even more enthusiastic about a single currency"". The mystery of Mr Aznar
The centre-right, however, is not in undisputed command of the party. The traditionalist right, composed of the heirs of Franco and the guardians of church-blessed morality, still has a voice. Several would-be ministers, including the shadow justice minister, are said to be members of Opus Dei, a rightwing religious group. Since Spain has no serious, separate party of the far right, these people will stay inside the PP. But they are no longer strong enough to dominate it. Their followers will vote for Mr Aznar, but they will not be able to control him.
A more formidable challenge may come from the Thatcherites. It is hard to measure the size of this group, but its opinions are clear-cut. The Thatcherites have no time for Francoist economics. They want to move fast; the party cannot assume more than one four-year term in power, they say, so it cannot afford to tiptoe into serious reform. On social issues, they are generally libertarian. They are dismissive of what they see as the soggy fudge of German Christian Democracy. They are also wary of the idea of a federal Europe. Several of them are friends of Britain's half-Castilian minister of defence, Michael Portillo, an ardent Eurosceptic.
Another sign of vitality in the People's Party is its new openness to women and the young. The shadow ministers of agriculture, education and social security are all women. So are the PP mayors of Seville, Valencia, Saragossa and Malaga. Mr Aznar's wife is a power in the party.
No less important is the relative youth of many of the party's leading figures. A dozen years ago it was Mr Gonzalez who epitomised young, modern Spain. Now the Socialists' core constituency consists of the rural poor and nervous pensioners. The impatient young have swung to the right. This has had its effect on policy. The PP is readier than the Socialists to cut the length of time young conscripts have to spend in the armed forces; it might even abolish conscription altogether, and give Spain a small professional army instead. It is at least as interested as Mr Gonzalez's party in the environment, another thing that youth cares about. The Socialists have begun to look more conservative than the people who want to replace them.
Which strand of the PP will prevail if the party wins power? The conventional wisdom in Madrid has it that the apparently dull and cautious Mr Aznar, solidly unspectacular when he was head of the province of Castile-Leon before taking over the party leadership, is a natural consensus man. After the glitter of Mr Gonzalez, say many, Spain needs this unphotogenic, seemingly boring tax lawyer.
Mr Aznar is still a bit of a mystery. He has gained in confidence lately. His calmness and dignity after Basque terrorists narrowly failed to blow him up in Madrid last April were widely applauded. But he still keeps his cards close to his chest, though he has written (apparently without much ghosting) a respectable outline of his beliefs which suggests that he has been doing a commendable amount of reading of Karl Popper, David Hume and others. The battle for his mind continues.
Two big questions remain. One is about Spain's ""nationalities"": how, essentially, Mr Aznar proposes to deal with the Catalans and the Basques. If he fails to win an outright majority of seats in the next parliament, as is entirely possible, he will have to decide whether he wishes to buy the support of those regions' parties with a further devolution of power from Madrid.
The even bigger question concerns the economy. Although the People's Party has lately sounded so studiously moderate, Mr Aznar may decide that the economy's structural problems-with its tax system, the labour market, welfare, pensions, the banksare so severe that only brave and radical action as soon as he gets into office will have a chance of solving them. The Thatcherites think he is more attracted to their ideas than he lets on, and that he might become more adventurous once in power. ""I am a liberal, not a Thatcherite,"" he has said. ""Wait and see,"" the Hispano-Thatcherites retort.
The more cautious people in his party say that, if he is converted to radicalism, Mr Aznar will be taking a risk with Spain's newborn democracy, still too frail to stand the shock of drastic economic reform. The irony is that, if Mr Aznar decides to ignore these nervous colleagues, it will be because of what he inherits from Mr Gonzalez. his 13 years, Mr Gonzalez has overseen Spain's transformation into a firmly-rooted democracy that might, in fact, accept the painful measures which Spain needs at least as much as does the rest of Western Europe.
Post-Franco Spain has been, on the whole, a remarkable success. But it has not removed all the weaknesses of the Franco times, and Mr Gonzalez's Socialists have been in power long enough to have produced new flaws of their own. Spain needs something livelier, post-Gonzalez, than just a dutiful preserver of things as they are.",230,Spain,"After 13 years in power , Aznar's are almost certainly heading for the exit .

After the glitter of Mr Gonzalez , say many , Spain needs this unphotogenic , seemingly boring tax lawyer . 
 Mr Aznar is still a bit of a mystery . He has gained in confidence lately . His calmness and dignity after Basque terrorists narrowly failed to blow him up in Madrid last April were widely applauded . But he still keeps his cards close to his chest , though he has written ( apparently without much ghosting ) a respectable outline of his beliefs which suggests that he has been doing a commendable amount of reading of Karl Popper , David Hume and others . The battle for his mind continues . 
 Two big questions remain . One is about Spain 's "" nationalities "" : how , essentially , Mr Aznar proposes to deal with the Catalans and the Basques . If he fails to win an outright majority of seats in the next parliament , as is entirely possible , he will have to decide whether he wishes to buy the support of those regions ' parties with a further devolution of power from Madrid . 
 The even bigger question concerns the economy . Although Aznar's has lately sounded so studiously moderate , Mr Aznar may decide that the economy 's structural problems - with its tax system , the labour market , welfare , pensions , the banksare so severe that only brave and radical action as soon as he gets into office will have a chance of solving them . The Thatcherites think he is more attracted to their ideas than he lets on , and that he might become more adventurous once in power . "" I am a liberal , not a Thatcherite , "" he has said . "" Wait and see , "" the Hispano - Thatcherites retort . 
 The more cautious people in Aznar's say that , if he is converted to radicalism , Mr Aznar will be taking a risk with Spain 's newborn democracy , still too frail to stand the shock of drastic economic reform . The irony is that , if Mr Aznar decides to ignore these nervous colleagues , it will be because of what he inherits from Mr Gonzalez . his 13 years , Mr Gonzalez has overseen Spain 's transformation into a firmly - rooted democracy that might , in fact , accept the painful measures which Spain needs at least as much as does the rest of Western Europe . 
 Post - Franco Spain has been , on the whole , a remarkable success . But it has not removed all the weaknesses of the Franco times , and Aznar's have been in power long enough to have produced new flaws of Aznar's own . Spain needs something livelier , post - Gonzalez , than just a dutiful preserver of things as they are .",PRE TERM,True

At last month's congress of his centre-right People's Party, 99.5% of those attending endorsed him as leader. Opinion polls give his PP a fairly comfortable six-to-ten percentage-point lead over the ruling Socialists. And on March 3rd, when Spain has a general election, he is fancied to break the Socialists' 13-year hold on power and become the first full-blooded conservative leader since Generalissimo Franco died in 1975.
But Mr Aznar should not count his chickens. He has been beaten twice by Felipe Gonzalez, who has been prime minister for 13 years and remains a formidable campaigner. And Mr Aznar still wants to show that he can do more than ride to power on a wave of Socialist unpopularity: he wants to win the arguments. If, as is possible, he fails to win an outright majority in parliament, his government will be hobbled by the need to bargain with regional parties from Catalonia and perhaps the Basque country. And even with a handsome majority, it is unclear how radical he would dare to be.
He has promised austerity, an end to corruption and the start of what he calls Spain's ""second transition"" (the first was the move to democracy in the first postFranco years). ""Spain has had enough charisma,"" he says, referring to Mr Gonzalez. So he must hope: a former tax inspector, Mr Aznar hides his charisma well. But young and middle-class voters seem to like him.
On social issues, he does not sound very different from the Socialists, though some Spaniards fear that the PP's traditionalists, spurred on by the Opus Dei religious group, might press for restrictions on abortion and more religious instruction in schools. One of Mr Aznar's achievements, so far, is to have welded together Christian Democrats, economic liberals and the remnants of Spain's autocratic right into a moderate, modern-European centre-right. But he has done so by imposing strict control within his party-at the cost of stifling debate. If Mr Aznar wins, differences within could burst into the open.
A future Aznar-led cabinet might, for instance, contain a foreign minister who favours European federalism and a finance minister sceptical of European monetary union. But the argument most likely to break out soonest is over how to tackle Spain's economy. The markets may punish Mr Aznar if, within three months or so of coming to power, he fails to cut spending, make labour markets more flexible and open up protected sectors such as energy, transport and telecoms.
Not so easy. Spain's economy grew last year by around 3%, but it meets none of the criteria laid down in the Maastricht treaty. So far Mr Aznar implausibly insists that Spain can still meet them on time, by reducing the budget deficit from its current 5.9% of GDP to 3% by 1999 without undermining Spain's welfare state. The PP's probable economic supremo, Rodrigo Rato, says that the top rate of income tax can eventually be cut from 56% to 40% by making sure that tax dodgers, especially rich ones, pay up. He would also bring down employers' taxes but says that a PP government would not touch pensions. Social-service spending would simply grow more slowly.
Mr Aznar is still clutching most of his cards tightly to his chest. He knows that Spain has become used to consensus and still shudders at the memory of civil war. So he has promised to consult Spain's labour unions and employers as soon as he is elected. The unions, which have organised four general strikes against Mr Gonzalez's tentative steps towards economic liberalisation, are becoming a bit more realistic.

Now, with the conservative People's Party, led by Jose Maria Aznar, looking set to win the general election on March 3rd, that may change. The PP's campaign slogan, ""the New Majority"", underlines its eagerness to govern alone. That would mean a weaker voice for Spain's regions.
 In any event, Xabier Arzallus, the brash and awkward leader of the Basque National Party, the region's biggest, says he could never work with the PP. Catalonia's boss, the much cannier Jordi Pujol, says many aspects of PP policy ""frighten"" him. Both men are wary of the Spanish right's traditional tendency to concentrate power at the Castilian centre. They also fear a more sceptical attitude to Europe: they, especially Mr Pujol, have cleverly solicited European help for their regions and have even hinted at switching allegiance one day from Madrid to Brussels.
Yet as opinion polls suggest that the PP is gathering pace, both Basques and Catalans have begun to sound more cautious, tacitly acknowledging that the PP is unlikely to snatch back concessions already granted, and that they could probably come to an understanding. Mr Gonzalez's assurance that he will not, if the PP wins most votes, deprive it of power by ganging up with regional parties has helped make them less extravagant in their claims.
A PP government would not, in any event, be all that hostile to the regions. For sure, it might call a halt to the devolution that began after Franco's death in 1975 as part of Spain's transition to democracy. But it would not try to roll it back. It would also try to set in motion an all-party agreement to make Spain's 17 regional governments more responsible for their own public services. It might be less easy-going about Basque and Catalan attempts to promote their languages. And it sounds a bit tougher on terrorism. But that's about it.
Basques are different from Catalans. They tend to be more emotional and romantic and fundamentalist in their nationalism, whereas Catalans are more cautious and money-minded and pragmatic. Mr Arzallus and Mr Pujol typify that contrast. A more striking difference, of course, is that a lot of Basques-about 15% in the last election-back a party that endorses ETA, the Basque terrorist movement, which showed its teeth again this week by shooting dead a former head of Spain's Constitutional Court in his Madrid office. Catalans demanding outright independence eschew violence and are proportionately fewer.
But even in the Basque country, regional fervour may be waning. Both there and in Catalonia the PP may make inroads. In both places some prominent businessmen, who have had enough of nationalist zealotry, are backing it.

FOR two decades Spain has been one of Europe's stirring success stories. The transition to democratic government, after the death in 1975 of dour Generalissimo Franco, went smoothly enough. Half a century after a bloody civil war and 15 years after an attempted military coup, Spain has a solid democracy and an economy that, with vigorous pruning, could be sturdy enough to meet the challenges ahead. For this, Felipe Gonzalez, reigning Socialist prime minister for 13 years but likely loser in the general election on March 3rd, deserves much credit. How could Spain manage without him?
Under Mr Gonzalez's guidance, the Socialists tossed away the past and reinvented themselves as free-market social democrats. Inward-looking, suspicious, austere Spain became outgoing, cosmopolitan and relaxed. It joined what is now the European Union and NATo. At home, the power of the old Castilian centre has sensibly been curbed. The outer regions, most importantly Catalonia and the Basque country, have been given enough autonomy to satisfy all but the most fanatical of separatists. Class-warring egalitarians on the left and corporatists on the right have been marginalised. Some of this had begun before Mr Gonzalez won power. But he deserves thanks for seeing it through.
That said, however, his government has long been dying on its feet. A string of scandals has brought to light massive corruption and worse. A former interior minister is accused of overseeing death squads that killed more than a score of suspected Basque terrorists-several of whom turned out to be innocent. Mr Gonzalez has lost the nation's trust, not because he is thought to be mired personally, but because he has seemed negligent towards the wrongdoing of his cronies.
Meanwhile, Mr Gonzalez's many achievements have been increasingly overshadowed by his failure to tackle the deeper structural problems of Spain's economy. Although some figures do not look too bad-after a fierce recession in the early i99os, growth is back to about 3% a year and inflation is down to 4%-Spain has the highest unemployment rate in Europe and a welfare and pensions system that consumes an ever growing proportion of its budget. If the next government is to tackle all that, and stay within shouting distance of the criteria for joining a future European economic and monetary union, then privatisation and deregulation need to be speeded up, stifling labour laws need to be axed and the mess which masquerades as Spain's tax system has to be sorted out.
But Mr Gonzalez and his government are clean out of ideas. If opinion polls are to be believed, their time is now up (see page 52). Certainly, Spain could use a less winded leader, a new government, and a fresh spirit of reform.
Spain's likely next prime minister,Jose Maria Aznar, who leads the People's Party, lacks anything like the Gonzalez charisma. A strikingly unflashy former tax inspector, his very ordinariness has helped convince Spaniards that his party has exorcised both its anti-democratic, Francoist past and the old Castilian authoritarianism. If Mr Gonzalez recreated the Socialists as a party of the centre-left, Mr Aznar's party now smells rosily of the moderate, pragmatic centre-right.
Will Aznar do better?
But there, for Mr Aznar and for Spain, is the rub. The right may be about to wrest power from Mr Gonzalez's weakened Socialists because it is no longer frightening. In the long run, however, that is not enough. In the past year or so, as the Socialists have destroyed themselves, Mr Aznar has cannily held his economic cards close to his chest. But if he is to succeed as Spain's prime minister over the next four years, he will need to find the steel to push through radical measures which, in the short run at least, will cause Spaniards even more economic pain than many of them already feel. And if he can do that, can Spain, its social fabric already stretched by unemployment and economic uncertainty, take it?

Not only do opinion polls suggest he will lose a general election on that day to the conservative People's Party (rr), led by Jose Maria Aznar, but his Socialists may even get shunted into second place in the regional parliament of his backyard, the once impregnable Socialist fief of Andalusia. After more than 13 years in power, Mr Gonzalez has lost his charisma and his political touch.
Felipe, as he is universally known in Andalusia, has tried to look after his own, investing more than 1,000 billion pesetas ($8 billion) in infrastructure there since he came to power in Madrid. Yet unemployment, at a full third of the workforce, is 10% higher than the official figure in Spain as a whole. Meanwhile the once-solid Socialist vote is splitting, as it is elsewhere in Spain: old people, unemployed and rural folk, nervous that a conservative government might cut welfare, remain stubbornly loyal. But the young and the goahead, especially in towns, are thirsting for change.
Throughout the general election campaign Mr Gonzalez has put in a defensive, lacklustre performance. His heart is not in it. He has been demoralised by the assassination of two close allies during the campaign. His panache on the hustings has always been the Socialists' trump card. Yet this time he has been heavily criticised for promoting a campaign video which crudely depicts the PP as fascist-style oppressors. The Socialists could be pulled further down by a good showing from the United Left, mainly former communists, who won 9.6% last time round, in 1993.
By contrast, the increasingly confident Mr Aznar, who has doggedly presented his party as middle-of-the-road, comes across as intense, clean and efficient. If opinion polls are to be believed, he might win an outright majority in parliament, thus relieving him of the need to bargain with Catalan and other regional parties.
The economy has been foremost in most voters' minds. Having watched the rough ride given in recent months to Alain Juppe, France's prime minister, in his attempt to introduce welfare reform, Mr Aznar has promised not to launch a similar wholesale attack on Spain's equally bloated system. He says he will not touch pensions. An array of other benefits will, he says, be safe. Instead, if elected, he will immediately ""consult"" trade unions and employers. ""Social cohesion is guaranteed,"" he told an audience of Catalan businessmen.
Still, if Spain is to meet the criteria for economic and monetary union set out in the Maastricht treaty, as prime minister Mr Aznar would have to try to halve the budget deficit, currently 5.9% of GDP, over the next three years and bring down inflation. He would also need to kill or sell off more of Spain's state industries, a left-over of Francoist corporatism and protectionism, and reform the country's labour laws. Meanwhile Mr Aznar promises tax cuts, arguing unconvincingly that he can find the revenue largely by making government ""more efficient"". And all this, while somehow reducing unemployment .
Privately, Mr Aznar knows that these hopeful assurances do not add up. If he wins the election, expect him to declare that the situation is even worse than he had realised. With a four-year mandate ahead of him, the period straight after the election would be the best moment to start dishing out the nastiest medicine. But he will need a lot of nerve.
Nor is it really clear where Mr Aznar stands on Europe. On the whole, the conservatives have sounded as keen as the Socialists to be ""good Europeans"". Mr Aznar pays lip-service to the current timetable for economic and monetary union by 1999. Once in office, he may well prove more sceptical. He has already accused Mr Gonzalez of being too keen on European integration, at a cost to national pride and interests. He would probably like the Maastricht timetable to be slowed down. And he is irritated bywhat he senses to be tacit support for Mr Gonzalez from Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor.
Terrorism has also become a campaign issue. The Basque terrorist group, ETA, currently holds two kidnap victims and has carried out two assassinations in the past fortnight. If the conservatives win, the terror could increase. Mr Aznar has made it plain he wants to govern without Catalan and Basque nationalist support. That has hurt regional sensibilities-and could even revive support for terror on the Basque nationalist fringe. With ETA under the command of new, young and relentlessly violent leaders, the chances of a conservative government being able to win a negotiated settlement are zero. Yet Mr Aznar might shrewdly hope to quell unease by tapping a respected Basque as his interior minister.
As for the non-violent Basque and Catalan parties, a victorious Mr Aznar might be urged to offer them a pact (though not a place in government) along the lines of the one he says he will offer to the trade unions and employers. He is unlikely to want to start off in government with both the centre-left and the nationalists lined up against him. But tactics is one thing, backbone another. If he is to govern Spain well, Mr Aznar will need both.",230,Spain,"Aznar may be hit by a double blow on March 3rd .

AN ERA may have ended. Spain's Socialists, for the time being, are out. But the heralded new dawn of conservatism, let alone radical conservatism, is not at hand. Worse for Spain, the country may now enter a period of weak and wishy-washy government, with parties and factions vying for advantage, terrorists and regionalists stirring the pot, and no person and no new set of ideas emerging as the dynamo for rejuvenating the country. Once again, a Spanish prime minister at the head of the largest party is likely to be yanked this way and that by a canny provincial boss concerned more with the fate of Catalonia than the fate of Spain. The likeliest outcome: fuzziness and drift. Spain, as a result of the election on March 3rd, has lost.
Numerically, there was indeed a winner. Jose Maria Aznar and his conservative People's Party won 38.9% of the votes and 156 seats against Felipe Gonzalez and his Socialists, who took 37.5% of the vote and 141 seats. That was victory, of a kind, for the right. It was, after all, the first time in Spanish history that straightforward conservatives (as opposed to the technocrats who ruled Spain in the immediate transition to democracy after General Franco's death in 1975) had ever been freely elected.
But it was a big disappointment for Mr Aznar, who, had the opinion polls been right, would have won an outright majority in the Cortes's 350-seat lower house. Instead, he fell 20 seats short. The margin of Mr Aznar's victory was so narrow that he has immediately been sucked into the messy business of deal-making with the cleverest horse-trader in Spanish politics: Jordi Pujol, who has run Catalonia for nearly two decades and whose 16 seats could, if he wanted, deprive Mr Aznar of the vote of confidence he will need to form a government.
Even those Catalan seats might not be enough to enable Mr Aznar to govern. He also needs a clutch of Canary Islanders to keep him going. If they do not co-operate, there are a handful of moderate Basques, a couple of Galicians and a lone Valencian to be kept in play.
In theory, Mr Gonzalez could still try to cobble together a coalition of his own (though he and the mainly ex-communist United Left, which won 10.6% of the vote and 21 seats, have sworn not to canoodle with each other), which could deny Mr Aznar his working majority and even present itself as a ruling alternative. In fact, Mr Gonzalez seems to have accepted the people's dismissal. Now his most likely aim is to watch Mr Aznar from the sidelines, chuckling as the new man ties himself in knots trying against the odds to run a coherent government.
The key, though, is once again Mr Pujol. After Mr Gonzalez won the 1993 election without securing an outright majority, the Catalan leader made a pact with him, whereby Mr Pujol propped up the minority government but refused to form a coalition. Then, as the corruption and other scandals plaguing the Socialists got out of hand, Mr Pujol felt obliged to withdraw his support altogether. Mr Aznar is now looking glumly at a similar deal. Mr Pujol will make him sweat. Mr Aznar could look bedraggled before he has even entered the prime minister's palace.
In economics, he and the businessminded Mr Pujol can probably come to terms, though he is less likely to back radical policies for which he would then have to share the inevitable unpopularity, at least in the short term. On constitutional matters, however, co-operation between Mr Aznar and Mr Pujol will be even trickier. The Catalan is bound to seek ever greater concessions for his fief, in such matters as revenue raising. Mr Aznar is already offering to bargain over tax. Yet his Castilian core constituency already thinks the regionalists have been getting so much autonomy that the fabric of the Spanish state is threatened.
The poker could go on for weeks. King Juan Carlos, who has a delicate job on his hands, will give Mr Aznar about a month to find enough votes to give him an absolute majority of the whole of the lower house of the Cortes needed to install a new government. Failing that, a second vote within a few days, with a majority merely of those voting, would be enough to endorse a new government. The Catalans might abstain, allowing Mr Aznar to form a government, but a limp one.
The puzzle of the election is why Mr Gonzalez, with unemployment officially stuck at 23% and his government mired in corruption, did as well as he did. The result, in the end, testifies to Mr Gonzalez's enduring appeal to those in the bottom half of the Spanish pile. Despite the shakiness of its economy, the Socialists even managed to win a regional election in Mr Gonzalez's backyard, Andalusia. With left-wing parties still corralling more than half the vote nationwide, the heart of Spain still, it seems, beats a shade to the left of centre.
And why did Mr Aznar not do better? Many Spaniards were evidently not reassured by his protestations that the new Spanish right has exorcised the ghosts of the authoritarian past. The rural poor and the elderly were worried that the right might cut welfare. Many people in the outlying regions, especially Basques and Catalans, still suspect that the right wants to shut them up. Despite the rise of a middleof-the-road urban middle class, perhaps Spain is still more a country of two nations than commentators in Madrid had cared to admit.
The upshot is threefold. Spain's new government is likely to be weak. Radical reform is likely to be postponed. And Spain will miss an early chance to shape up as a competitive country in 21st-century Europe. A new election, perhaps within the year, might be a way out, though it might produce the same result. Meanwhile, politicians in Madrid are already muttering darkly about the ""Italianisation of Spanish politics"".

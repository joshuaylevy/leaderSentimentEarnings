There was no obvious reason for the floods, which with little warning engulfed tens of thousands of homes, affecting nearly im people, destroying thousands of hectares of crops. But local people think they know why they happened. They say Indians across the border have opened up the flood-gates on the Farakka dam, which is 19 kilometres (12 miles) inside India. 
The dam was built in 1975 to divert water from the Ganges to India's West Bengal region. Bangladeshis claim that in the rainy season, when there is a danger of the Ganges flooding the Indian state of West Bengal, the flood-gates are opened, allowing water to rush towards Bangladesh. In the dry season, when the water levels are low, most of the water is diverted to West Bengal, leaving little to reach Bangladesh. 
Bangladeshis suspect that the Indians are willing to give them a properly regulated supply of water only in return for a transit route through Bangladesh to India's seven north-eastern states-Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, Meghalaya and Tripura. At present, goods worth about $1.5 billion a year go mostly by rail, using the Indian network that almost encircles Bangladesh. If India could send the goods by road through Bangladesh from Calcutta, the distance would be more than halved. And the southern port of Chittagong in Bangladesh could provide easy access by sea to some of the Indian states. 
The Indian proposal should not be hard to swallow, since it would clearly benefit Bangladesh economically. If Bangladesh levied a 5% tariff on the transit goods, the route and the use of the port could earn it nearly $7sm a year. With about 1,ooo lorries plying the road every day, there would be jobs and opportunities for Bangladeshis to build warehouses, hotels and restaurants, as well as service stations to cater for the drivers. 
Though the government does not seem to object to the proposal, the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party has vowed to prevent the transit route. ""It will happen only over our dead bodies,"" says a party official. The BNP leader, Khaleda Zia, who until March was prime minister and presided over five years of decidedly cool relations with India, has said that the transit route would undermine Bangladesh's sovereignty and its defence. But an Indian official said his country had no designs on Bangladesh. With 80% of its 120m people living in poverty, Bangladesh would be a liability rather than an asset for India. 
A visit to Bangladesh this weekend by the Indian foreign minister, I.K. Gujral, seems unlikely to solve the problem.

This week's visit to Delhi of the Bangladeshi foreign minister, Abdus Samad Aazad, has raised hopes that the two countries could sign an agreement before the lean JanuaryMay season begins. 
The mighty Ganges has an excess of water during the monsoon, but too little in the lean season. India has built a barrage at Farakka to divert some water down a tributary that feeds the port of Calcutta, which is getting silted. But this means less water for Bangladesh, which complains of a loss of irrigation and drinking water, and an intrusion of sea water that destroys forests and farms. The upshot has been massive illegal migration from Bangladesh's worstaffected district, Khulna, to India. Population growth in Khulna in 1981-91 was only 1.62%, compared with the average for the country as a whole of 2.03%. 
Calcutta port alone claims it needs 40,ooo cusecs of water (a cusec is a cubic foot-28 litres-of water per second). But the lean-season flow in the Ganges drops to 55,ooo cusecs in most years, and below 40,ooo cusecs in drought years. In 1977 the two countries signed a provisional agreement giving India 20,500 cusecs and Bangladesh 34,500 cusecs, pending ways to augment the water supply and provide enough for both sides. 
India favoured high dams on the Brahmaputra in the north-east, with a huge canal linking the Brahmaputra to the Ganges above Farakka. Bangladesh objected that the link canal would inundate its territory, and suggested instead storage reservoirs in Nepal. Neither side gave way, the water agreement lapsed, and since 1986 India has drawn all the water it wants. 
The governments in both countries changed this year, making a settlement possible. In India, the old Congress regime has been replaced by a United Front government, and the external-affairs minister, Inder Gujral, favours concessions to India's neighbours to improve relations. In Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina has come to power. She was given refuge in India for many years after the assassination of her father, a former Bangladeshi president. India feels that Sheikh Hasina is the most likely Bangladeshi leader to strike a deal. 
There remain ifs and buts. Sheikh Hasina is already being accused by her rival, Begum Khaleda, of neglecting her country's interests. An additional problem is the environmental suspicion of large dams, which could torpedo the proposals of both sides for augmenting water in the Ganges. 
Bangladesh does not allow goods and passengers to cross its territory between India's north-eastern states and West Bengal. So it will be hard to sell the Indian public a deal on Ganges waters without an agreement on transit. And another, more basic, problem remains: there is simply not enough water for both sides.

Last year Pakistan spent $3.8 billion on defence, over a quarter of the government's budget, while India spent $8.4 billion. Both countries possess-or at least could quickly assemble-nuclear weapons. Their 1,200-mile border remains one of the most heavily fortified in the world. So the senior officials from Pakistan and India who were due to meet on March 28th have plenty to talk about. If all goes well, Gohar Ayub Khan, Pakistan's foreign minister, and Inder Kumar Gujral, his Indian counterpart, will meet next month. 
Indian and Pakistani officials have held such talks before, without much success. Indira Gandhi and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto agreed to a framework for a permanent settlement as long ago as 1972, but it has never been put into practice. The most recent ministerial talks broke down in 1994 over the guerrilla insurgency in India's portion of the disputed province of Kashmir. Squabbles over both countries' refusal to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Test-Ban treaties further soured relations. 
But the recent change of regime in Pakistan has provided fresh impetus for negotiation. Nawaz Sharif, the new prime minister, emphasised his hopes for warmer relations with India in his inaugural speech to the National Assembly. His overwhelming parliamentary majority-177 out of 217 seats-may give him greater freedom than his predecessors to cut military spending. His chief supporters, tradesmen and business leaders, are keen to increase commercial ties with India. And Kashmir seems less of an obstacle, now that India has restored a semblance of calm and installed an elected state government. 
The present Indian government, too, is more disposed than its predecessors to normalise relations. Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first prime minister, had family roots in Kashmir, and his descendants and successors, Indira and Rajiv Gandhi, shared his strong feelings about the province. Deve Gowda, the current prime minister, is a politician from the southern state of Karnataka with no such emotional ties. Furthermore, India's recent military detente with China demonstrates its willingness to make peace with old enemies. 
Both countries have taken a conciliatory line in the run-up to the talks. The Pakistani authorities, in a gesture calculated to soften stony hearts, released 38 Indian children detained after their fishing boats had strayed into Pakistani waters. India in turn unilaterally eased restrictions on travel from Pakistan, reduced visa fees and also legalised the import of Pakistani books and periodicals, hitherto taboo. 
Chambers of commerce on both sides of the border are pushing hard for trade liberalisation. Official cross-border commerce between the two countries is tinydirect trade currently amounts to just 4 billion rupees ($111.4m) annually, although a further 1o billion rupees-worth may be diverted through other countries to avoid tariffs and restrictions. There is just a single border crossing. But if both countries relaxed controls, trade might take off. Tourism would also profit, since many citizens of both countries (including Mr Gujral) were born and raised in the other and still have relatives there. 
But politicians on both sides are reluctant to promote ties without a settlement on Kashmir. Pakistan's president, Farooq Leghari, delivered a pugnacious speech on March 23rd attacking India's ""repression and human-rights violations"" in the state. In the Indian parliament, the mere announcement of the visa concessions drew such a storm of protest that the session had to be adjourned. Any concession which could be portrayed as surrender would undermine Mr Gowda's fragile minority government. 
Even if the talks do not produce any breakthroughs, they may at least create momentum for change.

On April 11th, India's fragile coalition government was thrashed in a confidence vote in parliament by 338 votes to 90. Pretty decisive,you might think. Yet it looks like staying in power, under a new prime minister. 
The 13-party United Front survived in power for ten months as a minority government because it was being propped up by the Congress party. Congress, in turn, was willing to vote with the United Front, in order to keep the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) out of power. But at the end of March, Sitaram Kesri, Congress's president, decided to topple the government and bid for power himself His party has only 143 seats in a house of 544, but he hoped that once he pulled down the government, the United Front would shatter and regroup behind him. Mr Kesri believed that members of the United Front would come over to him, rather than risk losing their seats in a fresh election. 
But the front remained united, and suddenly Mr Kesri found his own MPS panicking at the prospect of a fresh election which is likely to benefit the BJP most. So he pulled back from the brink, even before the confidence vote, announcing that he did not seek the top job, and would settle for a new leader of the United Front to replace Deve Gowda, the prime minister. Mr Kesri claimed that Mr Gowda had been using the police to target members of Congress and ruin their reputations. Most United Front members will cheerfully sacrifice Mr Gowda to stay in power, and a new leader may be elected soon. There are no really strong contenders and an infinite number of weak ones. India's next prime minister could be any one of the following: 
G.K. Moopanar, the president of the Tamil Maanila Congress, a regional party of the south. He is a formidable politician, but was a member of the Congress party until recently and so is viewed with suspicion by the Communists, whose support he needs. 
Inder Gujral, the foreign minister. Well liked, but a political lightweight. 
Laloo Prasad Yadav, the chief minister of Bihar. Embroiled in a financial scandal. 
Ram Vilas Paswan, the railway minister. He is one of India's untouchables, by caste, and the United Front would boost its propoor credentials by electing him.

In the past, opposition parties would have screamed themselves hoarse if a government on the verge of falling had announced any important decision.

THE good news is that in place of the venal opportunists who have lately dominated Indian politics, a new prime minister has emerged who is almost universally regarded as clean, decent and intelligent The bad news is that he will probably not last very long. Inder Kumar Gujral has replaced Deve Gowda as head of the United Front government, which survives in office with the support of the Congress party. Mr Gowda lasted ten months. Sceptics doubt if Mr Gujral will last any longer. 
He rules over a fragile coalition, and faces an immediate problem because one of its constituents, the Tamil Maanila Congress (TMC), a regional party, has opted out of the government in a huff. The TMC president, Gt Moopanar, was the frontrunner in the race to succeed Mr Gowda, but was finally vetoed by the Communists, who regarded him as too close to Congress. The TMC says its pride has been hurt by this accusation of double-dealing, and its four ministers (including Palaniappan Chidambaram, the finance minister) have pulled out. Mr Gujral is trying hard to woo them back, and may succeed. But he will face many more such political challenges in the coming months. 
A lifelong socialist, Mr Gujral was the left's candidate in the contest for the prime ministership. This at first led to fears that he might try to reverse economic liberalisation, especially since Mr Chidambaram had left the government. A writer in the Asian Wall Street Journal even suggested that Mr Gujral's resemblance to Lenin was not entirely accidental. A few years ago, he headed a parliamentary committee that had wanted India to pull out of the GATT rather than accept its new rules on patents. When he visited Moscow recently as foreign minister, he talked fondly of India's old strategic relationship with the Soviet Union, and supported Mr Yeltsin's opposition to any expansion of NATO in Europe. 
However, by reinstating virtually every member of the outgoing cabinet, Mr Gujral has sent a clear message that he seeks continuity, not change. No matter what his own predilections are, he has to focus on survival, and this means he cannot risk policy changes that may antagonise any coalition member. To woo back the TMc, he has kept vacant the four portfolios earlier allotted to the party. He has pledged to continue with economic liberalisation, and to press on with Mr Chidambaram's tax-cutting budget. The left is disappointed, but investors are delighted. 
Neighbouring countries will welcome Mr Gujral's elevation, since as foreign minister he propounded what came to be called the Gujral doctrine-go out of your way to be friendly with smaller neighbours and offer them unilateral concessions, since you will create an improved atmosphere that will yield major gains later. The main success of the doctrine was an agreement on sharing the waters of the Ganges with Bangladesh, which later responded by offering India transit rights through its territory. Mr Gujral also unilaterally liberalised the granting of visas to Pakistanis wanting to visit India. He will press on with his doctrine as prime minister, and will retain the foreign-affairs portfolio. 
The Congress party brought down his predecessor, Mr Gowda, because it was angry that he had authorised police investigations of some of its members. Mr Gujral has promised he will allow no witch-hunts. But the truth is that many Congress members would be quite at home on a broomstick, and Mr Gujral is not going to drop cases already under way. To reduce the chances of a future misunderstanding between Congress and the United Front, a co-ordinating committee is being formed, with five members from each side. 
Optimists hope that this arrangement will ensure stability for at least some time. Yet it can hardly satisfy Congress. The party is far larger than any constituent of the United Front. It keeps the government alive, yet it enjoys none of the perks of office. Some members of the United Front (notably the Communists) say they will walk out if Congress joins the government. Others want Congress to come in for the sake of stability, but will not accede to the demand of Sitaram Kesri, the president of Congress, that his party should be the majority partner. The tussle for power will continue, and many observers believe the arrangement will break down by the end of the year. The main reason why the government might stagger on is the enormous reluctance of most MPS to face voters again in a fresh election. 
If an election nevertheless takes place, the betting is that the Hindunationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will fare best. Along with its allies, it holds 204 seats out of 544 in parliament today, and a recent opinion poll suggests that its tally could rise to 253 in a fresh election. Congress could lose a quarter of its existing 143 seats. 
So is Congress, the party that ruled for most of the past five decades, in irreversible decline? Some observers are already predicting that it will fade away into nothingness. That is an exaggeration. More likely, Congress will be obliged to give up any hope of ruling on its own, as it did for so many years. It may have to trim its ambitions and decide that its future lies in being part of a coalition. In a state election in Uttar Pradesh last year, it agreed to be junior partner to a regional party, and reaped the benefits when it improved its vote. 
The party has yet to debate its future at the national level, but many of its members think that coalition politics are here to stay, and that the party must reshape its ideas accordingly. One new strategy would be to join an anti-Bjp alliance. The main divide in Indian politics would then run between the secular parties and the BJP. 
If Congress and the United Front could fight the next election together, they would whip the BJP. The problem is that the United Front consists mainly of regional parties, which regard Congress as the main enemy in any state election. They are uneasy about allying themselves with the enemy in Delhi. How to get around this problem will be one of the central dilemmas of Indian politics in the future.

NOT often does a prime minister have to prosecute his party's president for corruption. But within a week of taking office, Inder Gujral has had to give his assent to the prosecution of Laloo Prasad Yadav in connection with a racket in the state of Bihar, where he is chief minister. Mr Yadav is president of Janata Dal, a party in India's ruling United Front coalition, which also happens to be the prime minister's party. Mr Yadav has said he is innocent and refuses to resign as chief minister. But four leftist constituents of the United Front have said he must go. 
If pushed, Mr Yadav could split the Janata Dal and form a regional party. He is the only charismatic Janata Dal leader in Bihar and says he will, if necessary, take the matter to the ""people's court"" (an election) He controls around 25 members of the Delhi parliament, not enough to topple Mr Gujral's government but enough to cause it problems. 
The racket in which, according to India's Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Mr Yadav was involved centres on Bihar's animalhusbandry department. The fiddle has allegedly been going on for some 20 years, though it was unearthed only two years ago. The unusually high death rate for animals and poultry purchased by the department was originally ascribed to incompetence. It now seems the animals were never bought and their ""deaths"" were invented to explain their absence. Vehicles supposedly used to transport cattle have also turned out on investigation to include mopeds and oil tankers. 
The 56 people charged in connection with the fraud include three ministers in Mr Yadav's state government. Not surprisingly, investigators have been under political pressure to go slow. The initial police charge-sheet last year did not list a single politician, and attempts were made to oust the main investigator. But the High Court intervened and threatened the director of the cBI, Joginder Singh, with contempt of court. That kept the investigation on track. 
The previous prime minister, Deve Gowda, was accused by his political foes of selectively targeting them with police investigations. Mr Gujral had to promise on coming to power that he would not go in for witch-hunts. This led to worries that he would go slow on crooks. It also led to the expectation that Mr Singh, a Gowda appointee, would be replaced. Now, by naming politicians, Mr Singh may have ensured that he keeps his job (the High Court will smell a rat if he is sacked) Politicians of all parties have been given notice that they cannot count on the police being as pliable as in the past. Voters are delighted. 
There is further good news. The Tamil Maanila Congress, a constituent of the United Front, had walked out after its leader lost the prime ministerial race to Mr Gujral. Now it has returned to the fold. This means that Palaniappan Chidambaram is back as finance minister, and will pilot his sensible budget through parliament. The stockmarkets have zoomed joyously. Mr Yadav in decline, Mr Chidambaram on the up: the formula delights investors. Mr Gujral is more ambivalent. ","DELHI

SONIA GANDHI has joined the Congress party, and so formally entered the political arena she had previously shunned. A humble primary member of the party is supposed to work for at least two years before qualifying as an active member, let alone aspiring to anything bigger. But such is the Gandhi family's hold on Congress that, if Sonia insists on becoming party president, few established members will dare object. 
By entering politics, the widow of Rajiv Gandhi, a former prime minister, risks death. Indira Gandhi, Sonia's mother-in-law and Rajiv's predecessor as prime minister, was assassinated by Sikh guards who were outraged when she ordered the army in 1984 to storm a temple taken over by gunmen. Rajiv Gandhi sent Indian troops to Sri Lanka to help the government cow its Tamil Tiger rebels, and was killed by Tamil extremists in 1991. Sonia and her children continue to get death threats from the two aggrieved groups. If she wants to enter active politics, however, she cannot remain in her barricaded house. After Indira Gandhi was killed, Sonia pleaded with Rajiv not to plunge into politics, presciently as it turned out. Now Cassandra herself has taken the plunge. 
In one sense, she has always been in politics. She gives audience to Congress activists, and listens to their complaints and implorings. In the feudal culture of the party, a mere smile or frown from her matters. But so far she has refused to intervene in party quarrels or take centre-stage. That may now change. She seems in no hurry to assert herself, yet many Congress loyalists swear undying devotion to her. 
The party is in bad shape, and desperately needs a popular figure to regain electoral ground. Whether Italian-born Mrs Gandhi can do the trick is unclear. In an opinion poll taken after her decision to go into politics, 27% said she would make the best prime minister, way below the 57% who preferred Atal Behari Vajpayee, leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party, the main opposition group, but far above the to% opting for the ruling-coalition incumbent, Inder Kumar Gujral. 
Why has she decided to sally forth now? Some say it is because the police are about to issue charges in connection with the Bofors gun scandal, which led to Rajiv Gandhi's electoral defeat in 1989. After a long delay, the Swiss authorities have handed over documents relating to the payments of 640m rupees ($40m in 1989) by the Swedish arms maker into various Swiss bank accounts. None of these accounts is in the name of the Gandhi family, but one relates to Ottavio Quattrochi, a friend of the Gandhis and former representative in India of an Italian chemicals company, Snamprogetti. Mr Quattrochi says these were private business payments, but he has not said what business, if any, he had with Bofors. 
However, it seems doubtful whether Sonia can influence the Bofors investigation at this stage. The ruling United Front depends for survival on the support of Congress, yet cannot afford to be seen sabotaging the investigation. After Rajiv's death, other political parties lost interest in the case. But if Sonia Gandhi looks like becoming Congress's chief, Bofors will once again be made into a big political issue by rival parties. ","DELHI 
SONIA GANDHI has joined the Congress party, and so formally entered the political arena she had previously shunned. A humble primary member of the party is supposed to work for at least two years before qualifying as an active member, let alone aspiring to anything bigger. But such is the Gandhi family's hold on Congress that, if Sonia insists on becoming party president, few established members will dare object. 
By entering politics, the widow of Rajiv Gandhi, a former prime minister, risks death. Indira Gandhi, Sonia's mother-in-law and Rajiv's predecessor as prime minister, was assassinated by Sikh guards who were outraged when she ordered the army in 1984 to storm a temple taken over by gunmen. Rajiv Gandhi sent Indian troops to Sri Lanka to help the government cow its Tamil Tiger rebels, and was killed by Tamil extremists in 1991. Sonia and her children continue to get death threats from the two aggrieved groups. If she wants to enter active politics, however, she cannot remain in her barricaded house. After Indira Gandhi was killed, Sonia pleaded with Rajiv not to plunge into politics, presciently as it turned out. Now Cassandra herself has taken the plunge. 
In one sense, she has always been in politics. She gives audience to Congress activists, and listens to their complaints and implorings. In the feudal culture of the party, a mere smile or frown from her matters. But so far she has refused to intervene in party quarrels or take centre-stage. That may now change. She seems in no hurry to assert herself, yet many Congress loyalists swear undying devotion to her.

Even internal ballots in political parties are watched with intense interest. At the moment, Indians of every kind--politicians, journalists and tea drinkers at roadside stalls--are fixated on increasingly bitter struggles within the country's oldest political organisation, the Congress party, and one of its newest, the Janata Dal. 
Congress's options might seem uninspiring to those who consider charisma, oratory or vision important attributes in a politician. The clear front-runner is the incumbent, Sitaram Kesri--a portly, smiling bachelor of 78, whose age and clownish appearance belie his guile and backroom skills. The dog-loving Congress leader (he keeps four impeccably groomed Pomeranians, and insists that press photographers include them in their pictures) recently brought down a prime minister, Deve Gowda, by withdrawing Congress's support from his coalition. But he then failed to achieve his stated aim of becoming prime minister in his own right. 
Mr Kesri's name keeps popping up in the strangest places. Police investigating the grisly murder and mutilation of one of his acquaintances may want to question him as a possible witness. There are also unproven allegations of involvement in some of the more infamous financial scandals of recent years--charges that are almost inevitable, given Mr Kesri's long-time position as the Congress party's treasurer. 
But despite all the allegations and the debacle of his failed attempt to become prime minister, Mr Kesri's victory in next week's vote is almost assured. This owes everything to his ability to manipulate the complex electoral college that chooses the party president, and to take advantage of Congress's obsessive desire to opt for the devil it knows, rather than take even moderate risks. Other senior Congress figures may also back him because he is too old to be a long-term obstacle to their own ambitions. The Congress front rank is made up of septuagenarians, balanced by the occasional octagenarian. Mr Kesri's two challengers, by contrast, are mere striplings. 
First is 56-year-old Sharad Pawar, a wily political boss from the industrial state of Maharashtra. Mr Pawar is said to have a deep understanding of the complex and often shady workings of India's main financial centre, Mumbai (Bombay). He began the electoral race with some influential supporters, but Mr Kesri's machinations have prised many of them away. Many think Mr Pawar is not really serious about being party president, or even prime minister--but wants his old job back, chief minister of Maharashtra. 
The most interesting candidate is Rajesh Pilot, a former minister who is a relative infant at just 52. He acquired his unusual surname during his 15 years as a squadron-leader in the air force. Despite his name change, he is proud of his origins as a Gujar--a caste of cattle herders. On the hustings, he drives his own vehicle from village to village, tying a colourful cattleman's turban around his head before addressing the crowds. Unlike the Congress party as a whole, Mr Pilot increased his share of the vote at the last election. But his very charisma and youth make him suspect in the eyes of party elders. 
If such a contest does not bode well for India's once invincible founding party, then the Janata Dal - the party of the prime minister, Inder Gujral - may be even feebler. A fratricidal contest is in prospect that could divide a grouping that already has relatively few seats in parliament, despite its leadership of the coalition government. 
The battle is between two colourful lowcaste politicians from the northern state of Bihar. Both are named Yadav, a reference to their caste. One is the state chief minister, Laloo Prasad Yadav, the current party president. He is the Janata Dal's most popular figure but federal police want to charge him in an embezzlement scandal worth hundreds of millions of dollars. His opponent, Sharad Yadav, is also tainted by scandal. His most recent contribution to federal politics was to lead a vocal rebellion against his own prime minister's attempts to introduce a bill to set aside a third of parliamentary seats for women. If Sharad Yadav wins, then his former friend, Laloo, will probably split an already tiny party, diluting its relevance further.

That balancing act is in danger of collapsing. 
The problem is the prices of petrol and petroleum products. These are heavily subsidised so the poor can afford to cook, buy fertiliser and travel by public transport. But, thanks to all the subsidies, the government's ""oil pool account"", which is supposedly filled from several interconnected sources, is now nearly $5 billion in the red. Its deficit grows each day by $8m, creating an ever-expanding hole in the middle of India's public finances-and in its hopes of staging an Asian economic miracle. 
The one sure way to close the gap in the oil account is to raise prices. Indian drivers get the cheapest diesel in the world. Kerosene for cooking costs a few pennies for a month's supply. And highly refined petroleum products, needed for making fertilisers are virtually given away to the mighty agri-chemical industries. They have grown fat and powerful on the back of subsidies meant to help the poor.

In the end, Mr Gujral has little choice. He has to raise prices. But he may be tempted to go for a fudge that seems to maintain the tricky balance between fiscal prudence and the interests ofthe poor. That would involve raising the prices of petrol and aviation fuel, and leaving diesel and kerosene alone. The trouble with this is that Indian petrol is already relatively expensive, and most drivers have already switched to diesel. The only real solution is to start to move all prices to their market levels. Critics of this idea say that an acrossthe-board price rise would add to inflation, and hit the poor hard.

Until recently, the chill between the two seemed too deep for even post-cold-war global warming to reach. These sibling states have fought three wars since their bloody division into two newly independent states in 1947. Lately, their soldiers have lobbed shells at each other across the remote Siachen glacier. Earlier this month, a row erupted over missiles that India had moved provocatively close to the Pakistani border. A year ago, the result would have been instant crisis. Yet last week a hotline was hooked up between India's prime minister, Inder Gujral, who was born in what is now Pakistan, and his Pakistani counterpart, Nawaz Sharif This week, officials from the two sides agreed to take a fresh look at their many disputes. Can the new warmth keep the old frost away? 
Talking does not always lead to solutions. But it is a start. Working-groups will now discuss a range of problems, from the Siachen glacier to the fight against terrorism and the promotion of trade. The senior officials who did this week's deal will meet again in September for direct talks on the two thorniest issues: the future of muchfought-over Kashmir and ways to enhance peace and security. 
Simply agreeing to include Kashmir in discussions is something of a breakthrough. In 1972, India and Pakistan agreed to settle their dispute over this mostly Muslim-dominated, but mostly Indian-controlled, region, without international arbitration. They have never really tried. India shows no sign of giving up its twothirds of Kashmir. Last year, after several years of insurgency by Muslim militants from Pakistan, countered by direct and sometimes brutal rule from Delhi, Kashmiris were able to vote in India's general election and in local elections. Life in Kashmir, claims India, is now returning to ""normal"". Pakistan is unconvinced. It wants Kashmiris on both sides of the disputed border to be given the right to decide their future, in the expectation that they would vote to join Muslim Pakistan. 
This festering dispute has poisoned all previous efforts to improve relations. It could do so again. Not only have tensions over Kashmir more than once led to war, they have also stoked an arms race. Talking about Kashmir is better than shouting or shooting over it. But military rivalries could still overwhelm the latest peace efforts. 
Take the missile issue. ""Deliberate misrepresentation,"" was how Mr Gujral described reports, leaked earlier this month to the Washington Post, that India had moved some of its short-range Prithvi missiles from the plant in southern India where they were built to a military base in Punjab, close to the border with Pakistan. He did not deny that some Prithvis are now in Punjab. ""But we have not deployed [them] in any part of India or on its borders,"" he said. The public denial is worth having, but the distinction is a fine one.The missiles would need to be fuelled and fitted with warheads to pose an immediate threat to Pakistan. Yet storing them near the border seems an unnecessary provocation,just as relations with Pakistan were warming. 
Why did India do it? The missiles were moved to their new home just before Mr Gujral became prime minister in April. But as foreign minister in the previous United Front government, he should have known about the move. If he did not, then quite possibly some in India's defence establishment were showing their unhappiness with his overtures to Pakistan. 
Unlike India's longer-range Agni missile, which was developed mainly as a deterrent against China but has not gone into full production, the Prithvi was designed with Pakistan in mind. The Indian army is said to want at least lOO of them to counter Pakistan's Chinese-supplied M-ii missiles, which successive Pakistani governments deny having but which are believed to be stored at an air base north-west of the city of Lahore. Meanwhile, both countries are thought to be working on nuclear warheads that could be fitted on these missiles. 
So far, Pakistan's public reaction to the Prithvi move has been muted. Mr Sharif, like Mr Gujral, would like to protect the new dialogue. Yet Mr Sharif, under pressure at home, says Pakistan ""cannot remain indifferent"" to India's action. He may step up Pakistan's already feverish effort to produce its own home-built version of the M-11, thought to rely heavily on Chinese design and technology. 
According to Michael Krepon, of the Stimson Centre in Washington, unless quick action is taken, worse may come. Pakistan claims to have frozen its production of fissile material for nuclear bombs, but there are doubts. Two years ago, China supplied ring magnets for centrifuges used to enrich uranium. Pakistan is also building a reactor at Khushab, south-west of Islamabad, that could provide plutonium to build more compact missile warheads. India never reciprocated Pakistan's ""freeze"", refuses talk about a global fissile-material ban and last year refused to sign the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty (so Pakistan did not either). The Prithvi issue could now be used as an excuse to abandon what restraints Pakistan still has on the production of fissile material. 
Meanwhile, further deployment of the Prithvis by India or of the Nt-ii look-alikes by Pakistan, both potentially able to carry nuclear warheads, would heighten tensions again and bring a new hair-trigger instability to any future crisis on the subcontinent. So how could that be prevented? 
After the last real war scare, in 199o, India and Pakistan, under pressure from the United States and others, agreed to a series of measures designed to bolster stability and avoid misunderstandings, including advance notice of military exercises, a hotline between military commanders and an agreement not to attack each other's nuclear facilities. But the confidence-building impetus was soon lost. Far more radical steps are now needed. 
In both countries, there are serious people with good ideas on home-grown-and, it must be hoped, more durable-confidence-building measures. These include: thinning out troops in Indian-controlled Kashmir; prior notification of missile tests and movements; and agreement not to move missiles to launch sites. Though neither country has signed the test-ban treaty, Pakistan contributes data to the seismic network that will monitor a ban. India could volunteer to do the same. Both have said they do not intend to test. They could reaffirm that, either jointly or in parallel. In a risk-prone region, there has never been a better chance to take some risks for peace.

His love of consensus seems to leave him incapable of taking difficult decisions, or of standing firm when the situation calls for strength. 
Take the matter of his old friend Bhavani Sen Gupta, a fellow intellectual and soulmate from decades of leftist politics. Soon after becoming prime minister in April, Mr Gujral asked Mr Gupta to become an adviser. But when newspapers complained that Mr Gupta had once written a letter to the New York Times calling for the Americans to put serious pressure on India over its supposed arsenal of nuclear weapons, Mr Gujral immediately dropped his old friend. 
Then there were Mr Gujral's tears during a recent television interview. India is nothing if it isn't macho. So the sight of the prime minister weeping, albeit over a poignant memory of the struggle for Indian independence, was seen as weakness. 
Even his admitted strengths, in diplomacy and foreign policy, are causing him problems. During a trip to Nepal in May, Mr Gujral shocked his diplomatic minders with an attack on his aviation minister. Though no one wanted to defend the minister, the airing of domestic political quarrels abroad was considered unacceptable 
On the other hand, Mr Gujral seems reluctant to take action against colleagues who are believed to be putting their noses in the trough. He came to power amid fine words about clean government, and no one doubts his personal integrity. But when Laloo Prasad Yadav, the chief minister of Bihar, and president of Mr Gujral's Janata Dal party, was accused of being involved in an embezzlement case, the prime minister appeared to vacillate. He ordered a federal cabinet colleague facing a similar charge to resign. Indians thought the smack of firm government had arrived. But Mr Gujral declined to call for Mr Yadav to stand down as chief minister. 
Watching Mr Gujral with care is another Bihari, the Congress party chief, Sitaram Kesri. He was responsible for Mr Gujral becoming prime minister, having unseated his predecessor, HD. Deve Gowda, in a parliamentary coup in March. Mr Kesri, a spry 78-year-old, is assumed to be getting ready to bid for power if Mr Gujral falls. Some conspiracy theorists are suggesting that the wily Mr Kesri chose Mr Gujral because of his lack of political strength, knowing he could not last long in the hurlyburly of Indian politics. ","IN THE view of many Indians , Inder Gujral is not tough enough to be a good prime minister . Inder Gujral's love of consensus seems to leave Inder Gujral incapable of taking difficult decisions , or of standing firm when the situation calls for strength . 
 Take the matter of Inder Gujral's old friend Bhavani Sen Gupta , a fellow intellectual and soulmate from decades of leftist politics . Soon after becoming prime minister in April , Inder Gujral asked Mr Gupta to become an adviser . But when newspapers complained that Mr Gupta had once written a letter to the New York Times calling for the Americans to put serious pressure on India over its supposed arsenal of nuclear weapons , Inder Gujral immediately dropped Inder Gujral's old friend . 
 Then there were Inder Gujral's tears during a recent television interview . India is nothing if it is n't macho . So the sight of Inder Gujral weeping , albeit over a poignant memory of the struggle for Indian independence , was seen as weakness . 
 Even Inder Gujral's admitted strengths , in diplomacy and foreign policy , are causing Inder Gujral problems . During a trip to Nepal in May , Inder Gujral shocked Inder Gujral's diplomatic minders with an attack on Inder Gujral's aviation minister . Though no one wanted to defend the minister , the airing of domestic political quarrels abroad was considered unacceptable

Indian politicians of today increasingly find themselves accused of using similar methods to win elections. Since the late 198os, politicians of all stripes have increasingly sought support from specific castes, communities and religions, rather than using broad ideological appeals as they did in the past. Caste, in particular, has been the most popular method used by politicians to build up ""vote banks"". A simple appeal is used-low caste politicians promise to look after their own, middle appeals to middle and the high-caste Brahmins, who have dominated Indian public life for decades, find themselves squeezed out by people whose servitude they once took for granted. 
Those who feared that the spread of caste politics could only lead to trouble will see recent riots in the commercial capital, Mumbai (Bombay), and other cities in the states of Maharashtra and Gujarat as a vindication of their fears. Eleven people were shot dead by police during the riots-all but one were members of the lowest of India's myriad castes, the untouchables, to the politically incorrect, or dalits as they now style themselves. 
The riots broke out when people in Mumbai's largest dalit slum reacted with fury to a garland of shoes placed around the neck of a statue of Dr B.R Ambedkar, a champion of the dalit cause, who controversially converted thousands of Hindus to Buddhism to help them escape their lowcaste status. Shoes are considered unclean in the subcontinent and there are few insults worse than a string of dirty sandals hung around the neck. 
Mumbai is the capital ofthe state of Maharashtra, which is ruled by a high-caste dominated coalition of the right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party, the BJP, and a Hindu extremist movement, Shiv Sena. To such parties, Dr Ambedkar is a bete noir and their activists are the natural suspects in the desecration of the statue. The city is still simmering, and the federal government in Delhi is under pressure to take stern measures against the governing coalition in Maharashtra. If the federal authorities take the sternest step of all, and dismiss the state government, there is a fear of a high-caste backlash. 
Maharashtra is not the only state threatened by inter-caste conflict. In the most populous Indian state, Uttar Pradesh, a dalit-run government has come to power, in coalition with the BJP. But this has merely cleared the way for the dalit chief minister, Mayawati, to go on an all-out rampage against her personal caste enemies, the middle-ranking yadavs. They are landowning animal herders who have done well economically in north India in recent years, in part thanks to positive discrimination. Mayawati's bitter enemy is the federal defence minister, Mulayam Singh Yadav, himself a former chief minister of the state. Since she came to power in April, she has been busily filling government posts with members ofher caste, sacking thousands of Mr Singh's backers in the process. There are already fears of outright caste war in the country's most important state; in neighbouring Bihar, which is ruled by a member of the yadav community, there are similar tensions. 
All this conflict is underlining the problems with the politics of divide and rulethe main problem being that it does not really work. Heightened awareness of division can make communities impossible to rule. Conscientious Indian politicians, including Inder Gujral, the prime minister, are now calling on their contemporaries to learn from the experience of the failure of British imperialism, and start stressing unity and playing down division.

Nor, it would appear, are chicken farmers. Four years ago, amid the euphoria of India's new open-skies policy, which allowed private companies to enter the hitherto state-monopolised airline business, a poultry-breeder called Parvez Damania leased a few aircraft and started selling tickets. Big losses forced him to sell his company in 1995 to another private carrier, NErc Airlines. 
Starting an airline in India is easy. A carrier can be launched with only five airworthy aircraft, which may be leased, and an equity investment of as little as 15om rupees ($4.2m), compared with the 1 billion rupees required to start a bank. But few entrepreneurs have measured up to the task. NEPC itself was grounded in May for not paying its fuel bills. Two other private airlines, East West and Modiluft, ran out of money last year and suspended their services. Of the seven private airlines launched since liberalisation, only three remain aloft.Jet Airways (owned by an expatriate Indian, Gulf Air and Kuwait Air) is the only real success, having captured a quarter of the market.

As the new firms fold, the state champion is regaining market share. Now its bumbling managers fear that, if the Tata-slA deal proceeds, this recovery may halt.The joint venturers intend to invest loads of cash: to buy, not lease, their own aircraft, to build their own hangar and to improve maintenance and training.

Our first article deals with India,which has paid heavily for a failed economic experiment, but is justly proud of its political achievements. Our second article argues that Pakistan has done better than India economically, but worse politically 
ON AUGUST 15th 1947, India became the first British colony to win independence. Its new leaders swore to make democracy work in a multi-religious, multi-lingual, multi-ethnic region that had never been under unified rule. In speeches to enthusiastic crowds around the country, they pledged to end poverty and help India regain its pre-colonial glory as a great economic power. 
Today, the euphoria is gone. The champagne bottles will pop on the 5oth anniversary of independence, but the bubbly will taste a trifle flat. At best, India has been a qualified political success and a barely qualified economic failure. 
Indian leaders believed in 1947 that colonial exploitation had kept the country poor, and that when the British went, so would poverty. In fact 320m Indians remain below the poverty line today, almost as many as India's entire population was in 1947. A mistaken socialist experiment has cost India dear. 
India's first prime minister,Jawaharlal Nehru, wanted to attack what he saw as the two main evils of the colonial era. The first was rural feudalism-under which princes and aristocrats creamed off one-fifth of national income while the poor starved, and were denied basic civil rights. The second evil, according to Nehru, was the de-industrialisation of India by the Raj. Before the British came, India and China were the world's biggest manufacturers. When the British left, India was relatively poor and backward. Nehru attributed this not to Britain's industrial revolution but to the net transfer of capital from India to its colonial master, which averaged 1.5% of GDP annually throughout the two centuries of the Raj. This transfer was financed because, throughout the colonial period, India had a persistent trade surplus with Britain, and thus exported capital. So Indian leaders regarded export-orientation as an instrument of colonial exploitation. And since colonial India's exports were overwhelmingly commodities, free trade was regarded as a hypocritical ploy to force British manufactures on India while stifling local industry. Thus the colonial experience led Indian leaders to turn to autarkic socialism. 
Nehru wanted an activist state to enact egalitarian laws, transfer land from the aristocracy to the peasants, and make India a great industrial power again. He succeeded, despite many shortcomings in land reforms, in gradually giving power to India's rural peasantry. The peasants reelected Nehru repeatedly with massive majorities, convincing him of the need for ever-more state activism. 
Besides, state activism was fashionable at the time. Capitalism was widely seen as having failed between the world wars, while the Marshall Plan, Keynesian demand management and the rise of the welfare state seemed to vindicate government intervention. Rapid Soviet industrialisation made five-year plans look such a good idea that they were adopted even by antiSoviet countries like South Korea and Taiwan, with the blessing of the World Bank. 
Unlike future East Asian tigers, however, Nehru's India neglected primary education. He viewed universal literacy as socially desirable but not as a key economic input, and instead emphasised higher and technical education. A far-reaching consequence after 50 years is that India's literacy rate is a pathetic 52%, lower even than in Kenya (78%) or Tanzania (68%). 
East Asian countries sometimes used state intervention to help support competitive private-sector giants. But Nehru, impressed by the Soviet model, wanted the public sector to capture the commanding heights of the economy. He saw industry, especially the heavy sort, as the key to prosperity, and thought the potential of agriculture and exports was limited. So he decided to protect industry heavily against trade, and left agriculture relatively unprotected. This implicit tax on agriculture skewed Indians' investment decisions. And the investment that flowed into industry was often wasteful because Nehru forsook exportorientation for import substitution, with no checks to ensure efficiency. 
Under Nehru, GDP growth averaged 3.5% per year. This was almost three times as fast as the 1.3% averaged during the first half of the century under the Raj, and faster than Britain's own growth rate during its industrial revolution. Many economists the world over hailed India as a success, convincing Indian leaders that they had nothing to learn from free-marketeers in the West. Only much later did East Asia demonstrate that, in the new post-war conditions, growth of 3.5% was slow rather than fast. But by then Indian planners had become knowledge-proof. 
Planning created a veritable jungle of controls on production, prices and employment. Companies could not sack workers or close down without permission, which was virtually never given. The planners regarded competition as wasteful because it allowed an excess number of competitors, and then forced some to close down. As they saw it, this caused unemployment and wasted capital. Instead, the planners proposed a licensing regime that would create exactly the planned capacity in each industry, and keep it going no matter how badly it was run. The result was a proliferation of uneconomic units and corruption, and a collapse in productivity. 
Nehru's daughter, Indira Gandhi, became prime minister in 1966, and in the next decade took the command economy to new heights. Using the slogan garibi hatao (abolish poverty), she nationalised banks and several industries, increased price and trade controls, and squeezed foreign investment. This socialist economic agenda masked a private political one. The main opposition party at the time, the Swatantra Party, was led by a coalition of princes and businessmen. Mrs Gandhi abolished the princes' principal source of income, ""privy purses"" (annual payments from the government as compensation for the loss of their fiefs) and imposed harsh income and wealth taxes on businessmen, whose cumulative effect at the margin exceeded 100%. Gari.bi hatao killed the Swatantra Party. Poverty, alas, survived. Mrs Gandhi reversed Nehru's neglect of her complete supremacy. 
Mrs Gandhi was a ruthless centraliser of power who eroded many of the independent institutions her father had created. She converted her Congress party from the proud party of the independence movement into something that sometimes seemed little more than a bunch of family retainers. In 1975, a court disqualified her from holding office for a minor technicality in election expenditure. She responded by imposing an ""emergency"", suspending civil rights and jailing political opponents. In many developing countries, such a person would have gone on to become dictator for life. But Mrs Gandhi did not institutionalise the emergency. Instead she held a fair election in 1977 in which she was routed. 
The rag-tag coalition of parties that ousted her soon fell apart. This enabled Mrs Gandhi to win the next election in 198o. Many of her supporters claimed this was a vote for a new emergency. But she found herself unable to shake off the Nehruvian tradition completely. So ingrained was her desire for public approbation that she stayed democratic. Indian democracy had proved its resilience. 
A strong current of violence, however, continued to mar politics. Mrs Gandhi was assassinated by Sikh militants in 1984. Her son, Rajiv, won a landslide election victory later that year, leading some to believe that the Gandhi dynasty was unshakeably established. But the Congress party was rotting beneath the Gandhis' feet. Over four decades it had become increasingly corrupt. Other parties had grown steadily, and now ruled several states. Rajiv lost the 1989 election and was then himself assassinated by Tamil militants from Sri Lanka. Although some Congress party activists still hanker after bringing Rajiv's widow, Sonia, into politics, his death seems to have marked the end of the Gandhi dynasty. 
With the passing of the Gandhis, India in the 199os shifted from single-party rule to coalition politics. Earlier prime ministers were charismatic members of a charismatic family. But the most recent threeNarasimha Rao, Deve Gowda and now Inder Gujral-have been political lightweights who got the top job mainly because they were too lacklustre to have many enemies. This does not make for strong leadership. But a system that propels nonentities to the front does not lend itself to dictatorship either. 
In the authoritarian parts of East Asia, India's democracy is sometimes blamed for its relative backwardness. But to democracy goes the credit for one of India's key achievements in the past 50 years-the conquest of mass starvation. This was a recurring problem in every drought, and thousands died in the twin droughts of 1965 and 1966, despite 21m tonnes of food aid. One much-discussed book of the time even argued that India was fundamentally unviable and should be left to starve, conserving scarce food aid for savable countries. 
Yet within a decade, India had conquered starvation. The credit for this is widely but mistakenly given to the green revolution. In fact food production between 1965 and 198o grew by just 2.8% annually, no faster than in the preceding 15 years. Several developing countries, including many in Africa, fared much better. 
India ended starvation by better distribution, not accelerated food production. A drought decimates agricultural activity and hence the earnings of farm labourers. Indians proved that if they are given purchasing power through employment schemes, they will survive even when food is scarce. In the Indian state of Maharashtra, in the early 1970s more food was available than in the Sahel. Yet there was famine in the Sahel but not in Maharashtra. 
Apart from employment schemes, an affected country needs grain reserves, rural roads, and the ability to spot distress and move grain quickly. By the 1970s India had created all these facilities, but most African countries had not. The pressures of a free press and opposition parties in India forced the government to act. Such pressures were rare in Africa. 
A similar tale can be told of China, where about 3om people starved during the ""Great Leap Forward"" of 1958-60. China had no free press to give warning of impending disaster, no opposition demanding action. Instead it had sycophants unwilling to tell Mao how bad things were. In China, as in the Sahel, the needy were killed as much by a lack of democracy as by a lack of food. 
The virtues of Indian democracy must not, however, be exaggerated. It may have helped prevent famine. But it has not prevented mass hunger, illiteracy, or policies guaranteed to keep people poor. Nor has democracy checked growing corruption and the emergence of a political class that is widely held in contempt by ordinary Indians. These days it is a common complaint in India that public services and government work only for those with money, muscle or influence. 
In 1947,joining politics meant sacrificing your career for public service. Today, joining politics increasingly means joining the race for money, power and influence. Every political party now has links with gangsters, many of whom have elbowed their way into the legislatures. In some states the distinction between lawmakers and lawbreakers has virtually disappeared. A former home secretary estimates that in recent municipal elections hundreds of suspected criminals stood for election in Mumbai (formerly Bombay) Similar calculations were made by newspapers at the time of the Delhi elections earlier this year. 
For all the flaws in India's democratic system, however, most middle-class Indians remain proud that their country can claim to be a rare democracy in the third world. If India can achieve economic success as well, the dreams of its founding generation may finally be fulfilled. ","Partition in 1947 created two nations .

MOVES to make peace between India and Pakistan, the subcontinent's most bitter rivals, are expected to get a boost when Nawaz Sharif, Pakistan's prime minister, attends a meeting of the United Nations General Assembly in New York later this month.

Mr Sharif would also be able to turn more of his attention to reforming the country's battered economy.

Recent exchanges of fire between Indian and Pakistani troops in Kashmir are a reminder of the continuing bloodshed in this disputed region, and of the potential for future flare-ups. If Mr Sharif gets close to a settlement with India, he is bound to face harsh criticism from the hawks in his own country. 
Matters are further complicated by America's reluctance to become a mediator in the dispute. Successive Pakistani regimes have urged Washington to step in, even suggesting an Oslo-style peace initiative similar to that for the Middle East. The IndiaPakistan dispute, despite being between neighbours with nuclear capability, nevertheless does not have the same public prominence in America as the Arab-Israeli dispute, which is the subject of much lobbying. Thus, American politicians feel far less compelled to do something. 
Mr Sharif also risks provoking an antiAmerican backlash over Aimal Kansi, a Pakistani accused in America of killing two CIA employees. In June, Mr Kansi was arrested in a remote area of Pakistan during a commando-style operation involving FBI agents, and was extradited to the United States. Pakistani nationalists condemned this as ""appeasement"" of America.

Its total debts to the World Bank and others amount to $39 billion. Instead of stabilising the country's economy and helping to introduce lasting structural reforms, loans have become the subject of popular scorn. 
Mr Sharif's own reforms, such as sharp cuts in tax rates, although generally welcomed, still fail to address bigger problems: not least increasing tax revenue in a country where less than 1% of the population pays any income tax at all.

Not only was it the first time India had used a locally built launcher to put a fully operational satellite (as opposed to experimental ones) into orbit, but it also brought nearer the time ""when the world will have to treat us as equal partners"", a delighted Inder Gujral, India's prime minister, declared. India is also launching a new foreign policy to transform itself from a regional to a global political force. 
For decades India has been so obsessed with subcontinental affairs that its critics have said, derisively, that it has no foreign policy, only a Pakistan policy. That is changing. India is trying more determinedly to modernise its economy. It wants a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council and, since it has the ability to launch not just satellites, but also missiles carrying nuclear warheads, it would like to be considered a world power. India's rocket programme, however, shows how difficult these lofty ambitions are. 
Indian technology currently limits the payload of its rockets to 1.2 tonnes. This needs to be more than doubled if India has any hope of becoming a serious competitor in the business of launching big telecoms satellites. To boost its launch capacity, India contracted some years ago to get more powerful rocket-engine technology from Russia. But in 1992 America pressed Russia to block the deal on the ground that India might also put the engines on missiles that could hit other countries, including its old antagonist, Pakistan. 
Many Indian officials believe this was merely an excuse to prevent their country from becoming a low-cost competitor for space launches. Anyway, India now aims to develop the necessary technology itself It remains annoyed with America, in particular finding it unfair that, while China has long been accepted as a nuclear power, America and others are determined to thwart India's nuclear ambitions. Hence India refuses to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and has ruled out signing a Comprehensive Test Ban, unless all other nuclear powers do. 
As part of the campaign to create an India that matters in global affairs, in late September Mr Gujral visited the UN in New York, and met Bill Clinton. While there, he also met Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister of Pakistan. Though the two attempted to push forward their peace dialogue, India's quest for a global role loomed over the talks. Pakistan would much prefer India to remain a regional rather than global power, so it does not support its neighbour's bid for a Security Council seat. 
Although the outcome of that bid is uncertain, Indian officials think they now hold a trump card. Much of South-East Asia has been hit by a currency crisis, just as India's economic reforms are at last making the world's second most populous country a promising place to invest Last year India attracted $5.6 billion in foreign direct and portfolio investment; the figure this year may be $7 billion. Though this is only a fraction of the $42 billion that foreigners pumped into China last year, the difference is less dramatic than it seems: the vast majority of foreign investment in China is by overseas Chinese, especially those in Hong Kong and Taiwan. 
India's economic liberalisation is also younger:just six years old. The World Bank estimates that, in terms of purchasing power, India could have the fourth largest economy in the world by 2020. There remain plenty of uncertainties about India's economic future, including whether its budget deficit will be reduced or whether infrastructure will be built fast enough to sustain the current 7% rate of GDP growth. Higher import taxes, recently introduced to pay for public-sector wage increases, are also causing concern. 
Nevertheless, if India can keep its reforms on track, its future is bright. How that will be translated into political clout remains unclear. When a senior diplomat in Mr Gujral's entourage in New York was asked what vision India had of its place in the world, the response was a long silence followed by a change of subject. 
One thing, however, is clear. India wants to be considered in the same league as China, not Pakistan. Whereas America and others view China as a power in its own right, India is nearly always seen as one part of a troubled subcontinent. There are, however, signs of change. On September 26th, Frank Pallone, an American congressman and head of an India caucus, moved a ""sense-of-the-house"" resolution which backs India's case for a permanent seat in the Security Council. Although this has yet to be voted on, such support would have been unthinkable a decade ago. 
At least America seems to be taking India more seriously. Later this month, Thomas Pickering, under-secretary of state for political affairs, will visit India. The secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, will follow in November, and President Clinton will visit early next year-the first visit by an American president since 1978. 
A recent report of the American Council on Foreign Relations argued for the adoption of a new strategy towards India. Instead of working to cap, reduce and finally eliminate nuclear arms in South Asia, it recommended a policy designed to produce a ""stable plateau"" in the nuclear competition between India and Pakistan. The council suggests that India should be wooed rather than disciplined; that its growing power should be acknowledged, curbs on technology transfer reduced, military co-operation increased, and assistance given to India's civilian nuclear power programme. The aim would be to encourage greater nuclear restraint by both countries. The rocket that streaked away from Sriharikota suggests the aim, though worth pursuing, may not be so easy to achieve. ","THE rocket that blasted off on September 29th from Sriharikota , an island off the coast near Madras , was highly symbolic . Not only was it the first time India had used a locally built launcher to put a fully operational satellite ( as opposed to experimental ones ) into orbit , but it also brought nearer the time "" when the world will have to treat us as equal partners "" , Inder Gujral's declared . India is also launching a new foreign policy to transform itself from a regional to a global political force . 
 For decades India has been so obsessed with subcontinental affairs that its critics have said , derisively , that it has no foreign policy , only a Pakistan policy . That is changing . India is trying more determinedly to modernise its economy . It wants a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council and , since it has the ability to launch not just satellites , but also missiles carrying nuclear warheads , it would like to be considered a world power . India 's rocket programme , however , shows how difficult these lofty ambitions are . 
 Indian technology currently limits the payload of its rockets to 1.2 tonnes . This needs to be more than doubled if India has any hope of becoming a serious competitor in the business of launching big telecoms satellites . To boost its launch capacity , India contracted some years ago to get more powerful rocket - engine technology from Russia . But in 1992 America pressed Russia to block the deal on the ground that India might also put the engines on missiles that could hit other countries , including its old antagonist , Pakistan . 
 Many Indian officials believe this was merely an excuse to prevent their country from becoming a low - cost competitor for space launches . Anyway , India now aims to develop the necessary technology itself It remains annoyed with America , in particular finding it unfair that , while China has long been accepted as a nuclear power , America and others are determined to thwart India 's nuclear ambitions . Hence India refuses to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and has ruled out signing a Comprehensive Test Ban , unless all other nuclear powers do . 
 As part of the campaign to create an India that matters in global affairs , in late September Inder Gujral visited the UN in New York , and met Bill Clinton . While there , Inder Gujral also met Nawaz Sharif , the prime minister of Pakistan . Though the two attempted to push forward their peace dialogue , India 's quest for a global role loomed over the talks . Pakistan would much prefer India to remain a regional rather than global power , so it does not support its neighbour 's bid for a Security Council seat . 
 Although the outcome of that bid is uncertain , Indian officials think they now hold a trump card . Much of South - East Asia has been hit by a currency crisis , just as India 's economic reforms are at last making the world 's second most populous country a promising place to invest Last year India attracted $ 5.6 billion in foreign direct and portfolio investment ; the figure this year may be $ 7 billion .

""WAR, on peace"" is how one Indian 
magazine describes it Earlier this year, both India and Pakistan got new prime ministers, both keen to try to normalise troubled relations. Yet progress in talks between officials has been stymied by heavy shelling of civilian areas across the line of control in the disputed state of Kashmir. Each side blames the other for starting the intermittent artillery barrage, which has killed perhaps 50 civilians in the past month. Meanwhile, hawks in both countries clamour for retaliation, and newspapers spout indignant jingoism. The prospects for peace are therefore among the chief victims of the artillery exchanges. 
For decades, firing across the line of control in Kashmir has been almost a daily ritual. But heavy shelling of civilian areas is unusual: India said that 17 civilians had been killed by Pakistan; Pakistan said 30 of its civilians had died. The two prime ministers talked twice on their newly installed hot line to cool tempers, and by last weekend the big guns had stopped. Rifle fire has continued, however, and on October 8th it claimed another victim on the Indian side. 
There are plenty of conspiracy theories to explain the continued shooting. One, favoured in India, is that Pakistan is trying to keep international attention on Kashmir at a time when the United Nations seems to be losing interest. Pakistan's prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, has a thumping majority in parliament and sees the sense in opening up to India. But the armed forces, which have always had a strong say in running the country, are keen he should understand the limits of his peace-making powers. 
Similarly, on the Indian side hardliners worry that the prime minister, Inder Gujral, is too much of a softie. Though he presides over a precarious coalition at home, Mr Gujral has been adventurous abroad. As foreign minister in the previous government, he put forward what became known as the ""Gujral doctrine"", by which India made some unilateral concessions to its neighbours to create a cordial atmosphere that would bring benefits to all. This improved relations with Bangladesh and Nepal, and has been welcomed by Mr Sharif. 
Mr Gujral is particularly keen to improve economic ties with Pakistan. He points out that India and China also have a border dispute, but have agreed to disagree, while strengthening commercial links. Mr Gujral favours a similar path with Pakistan, and is willing to offer extra trade concessions. In the past, Pakistan has refused to normalise trade unless progress is made on Kashmir. Yet businessmen on both sides are keen to see obstacles removed, a process that could quadruple two-way trade. Mr Sharif, himself a businessman, is similarly inclined. But the latest shelling, highlighting as it does the depth of distrust between the two countries, shows just how far the two prime ministers have to go. 
Mr Gujral and Mr Sharif recently met at the United Nations in New York and are due to meet again at the Commonwealth summit in Edinburgh later this month. But neither can afford to push ahead boldly in the face of strong opposition at home. The recent shelling is not expected to escalate into full-scale fighting, but real peace also looks as far off as ever. ","India and Pakistan

Queen Elizabeth's visit to India and Pakistan was envisaged as a grand historical reconciliation between the subcontinent and its former colonial master on the 5oth anniversary of independence. Instead, it led to Indian accusations of a new British imperialism, thanks to remarks about Kashmir by Britain's foreign secretary, Robin Cook So a royal visit planned as a veiled apology for colonialism turned into a veiled apology for grossly underestimating Indian sensitivities about the disputed region of Kashmir. 
At least one part of the visit went well. The queen went to Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar on October 14th to lay a wreath at the spot where, in 1919, British soldiers opened fire on a meeting, killing 379 people, and giving an impetus to India's independence movement. The wreath-laying was a gesture intended to acknowledge the excesses of a shared history, and to build on this reconciliation. Some Indians were concerned for the queen's safety. But the visit to Amritsar passed off with only minor demonstrations. Indeed, the ruling Sikh party in Punjab, the Akali Dal, was delighted to have the queen visit the holiest of Sikh shrines, the Golden Temple. 
The planners of the visit had evidently worried about Indian sensitivities over the colonial legacy, yet they had overlooked India's far greater prickliness over its dispute with Pakistan about Kashmir. Britain's ruling Labour Party is sympathetic to the idea of self-determination through a plebiscite in Kashmir, which amounts to a pro-Pakistan view. India, though, regards Kashmir as an internal problem exacerbated by Pakistan's support for militants in Kashmir. It wants to deal with Pakistan alone, and regards any offer of third-party mediation as support for Pakistan's attempt to internationalise the issue 
The queen and Mr Cook visited Pakistan first In private discussions, the Pakistani prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, asked Mr Cook to lend a hand in resolving Kashmir, which he agreed to do. Possibly, Mr Cook thought this was routine diplomatic politeness, unaware that it would evoke hysterical outrage in India. When the Indian prime minister, Inder Gujral, who was visiting Egypt at the time, heard of it, he reportedly attacked Britain as a ""third-rate power"" that had created the Kashmir problem in the first place by partitioning India in 1947, and now had the presumption to think it had an historical role in solving it. Newspapers joined in, and sneered that a country incapable of solving the difficulties in Northern Ireland had the audacity to offer solutions to Kashmir. 
Clearly, damage control was needed to save the royal visit. Mr Cook said on arrival in India this week that he had neither given any interview nor made any public state ment on Kashmir during his Pakistani visit. Mr Gujral in turn denied he had called Britain a third-rate power.Mr Cook carefully refrained from mentioning either Kashmir or Pakistan in his official talks with Mr Gujral. But the controversies continued. The Indian government forbade the queen to make a planned speech in Madras, saying such addresses, however short, were always made in the capital. 
Indians worry far more about Kashmir than the colonial past, and no grand reconciliation between Britain and India is needed anyway. Despite the passions generated by the independence struggle, the parting of ways in 1947 was amicable, and Jawaharlal Nehru, the prime minister, actually asked the last viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, to become independent India's first governor-general. During the independence movement, Indian leaders blamed Britain for the country's poverty. However, after 50 years of independence there is recognition in India that its continued poverty shows that colonialism cannot be blamed for all its ills. Self-flagellation became a national pastime in the run-up to the 5oth anniversary in August, and writers galore blamed incompetent, corrupt Indian leaders rather than the colonial legacy for India's relative decline even among developing countries. 
The anniversary celebrations have coincided with the handover of Hong Kong to China. In 1947, Indians pitied Hong Kong for remaining under the colonial yoke. Yet in the next 50 years Hong Kong's income per person rose to $23,000, while India achieved no more than $320. The Times of India observed, ""The country that gained independence stayed poor, the country that remained a colony became immensely rich. Indeed, Hong Kong became far richer than its colonial master... This paradox cries out for an explanation."" 
The new soul-searching means that most Indians worry less about the colonial past than some Britons. Plenty still links the two countries-the English language, legal and democratic institutions, cricket And in some areas the empire has struck back and no longer has any wounded sense of domination. India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka have won three of the past four world cups in cricket, leaving England far behind. And this week, India's dazzling new author, Arundhati Roy, won the Booker prize for English literature. That demonstrates more emphatically than the queen's wreath at Jallianwala Bagh that the days of the white man's burden are gone. ","EVEN one Cook can spoil the broth .

India's economy grew by an average of 7% a year for the past three years. This encouraged Palaniappan Chidambaram, the finance minister, to announce in February a budget in which tax cuts set India on the path to become a fully fledged Asian tiger by stimulating hoped-for growth of 8%. Instead, the economy's rate of growth has slowed, perhaps to less than 6% this year. Businessmen have reacted hysterically, crying recession and lobbying for devaluation, tariff protection and cheap credit. Although their alarm is overdone, the slowdown does raise a key question: is India incapable of sustaining high growth? 
The growth spurt was led by industry and exports. Both are now in the dumps. Exports grew at 20% annually for three years, but slowed to little more than 4% last year. Industrial production, growing at almost 12%, slumped to 5.1% in the first quarter. With both domestic and export demand drying up, despite his tax cuts and looser monetary policy, Mr Chidambaram's ""dream budget"" has been followed by restless nights for many industrialists. 
The optimists claim the problem is only temporary, and that liberalisation is merely sorting out the men from the boys. They argue that, as sales of consumer goods had been growing by record amounts, a slowdown was inevitable. High interest rates in 1995-96 also led to a drop in investment, but this is expected to pick up as interest rates have fallen sharply this year. 
Pessimists, however, argue that the high-growth years were a short-lived rebound from earlier imf-induced austerity, and that the economy may be unable to sustain growth above 6%. Adding to the problem is Asia's financial crisis. The devaluation of currencies allows other Asian countries to cut export prices, especially in plastics and synthetic fibres. This threatens to edge out Indian exporters, whose profit margins are already under pressure. Indian politicians, meanwhile, are proud that their currency, the rupee, has not crashed and see this as vindication of various capital controls that prevent foreigners from attacking the currency. Exporters, however, would rather devalue. 
While a late recovery might be staged, most businessmen remain gloomy. On November 18th, the prime minister, Inder Gujral, said he believed 7% growth was feasible. But this depends on whether recent structural changes in the economy are sufficient to ensure long-term growth. The scorecard is not unimpressive. 
Although India has had three prime ministers in 18 months, economic liberalisation continues because of a political consensus on reform. So, political instability does not seem to lead to policy reversal, only creeping liberalisation. 
This is just as well. Mr Gujral runs a fragile minority coalition government that depends for survival on the support of the Congress party, which has long ruled India. On November 20th, the Congress party said it would withdraw support in a row over the report of a commission inquiring into the 1991 assassination of a former prime minister, Rajiv Gandhi. The report has blasted the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), a regional party of Tamil Nadu and a member of the coalition, for aiding and abetting the Sri Lankan insurrectionists, the Tamil Tigers, who are blamed for the killing. Congress wants the DMK expelled from the coalition. Without some sort of compromise, Mr Gujral's government will fall. 
Investments should do better. The savings rate has risen steadily from 20% of GDP in the 1980s to a record 25.6% in 1995-96, and looks like moving towards 30% in the next decade. This should lead to more investment, on which Mr Gujral bases his hopes for faster growth. In addition, foreign investment, negligible until the 1990s, should reach $6.7 billion this year, which means an annual target of $10 billion is feasible. Exports have more than doubled, from 4.5% of GDP in the mid-1980s to 10%, which suggests India has become more productive. With the abolition of many controls, old uneconomic plants, especially small units, are being replaced by ones that are more competitive. The liberalisation of imports has also enabled companies to slash stocks, releasing funds for investment Agriculture's role in the economy, which was as high as 57% when India became independent, has declined to 25% and will keep shrinking. As agriculture is inherently more slow-growing (3% annually this decade) than industry or services, this will help boost India's overall growth rate. 
India's literacy rate is a poor 55%, and it is particularly low among women. In the long term this will do India no good. Meanwhile, however, the literacy rate among men of working age has risen to 70%, making the labour force much more productive than in the past. 
These are solid foundations for faster growth. Yet plenty of negative influences are at work, too. Political instability may not endanger liberalisation, but it makes it more likely that fragile governments will placate powerful lobbies, such as the government employees who recently extracted a huge pay rise. This means the cashstrapped central and state governments will lack money for essential services, such as primary education, health, rural development and infrastructure. Without these, India cannot hope to grow rapidly. 
The consensus on reform is also muddled. Few politicians dare touch rigid labour laws or giveaways, such as free electricity to farmers. Although minority stakes have been sold in state-run firms, the government is 10th to give up control. Subsidies amount to almost 15% of GDP. These factors will keep growth in check. But provided liberalisation keeps creeping along, for a while an economy that increases by anywhere near 7% may seem impressive compared with the poor South-East Asian tigers that India was so keen to emulate.

Indian journalists are having a field day with phrases to describe how Rajiv Gandhi, a former prime minister assassinated six years ago, now looks like precipitating a general election posthumously. 
The Congress party has threatened to withdraw support from Inder Gujral's minority United Front government, which it has propped up for 17 months. A judicial inquiry into Rajiv Gandhi's assassination has castigated the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), a regional party that is part of the ruling coalition, for aiding the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, who are accused of killing Rajiv. This is hardly news: the DMK ran the state government of Tamil Nadu in i99o-9i and was dismissed shortly before the assassination for aiding terrorists. Besides, Indira Gandhi, Rajiv's mother and predecessor as prime minister, was the one who armed and aided the Tigers, with the approval of all India's parties, which were outraged at the time by mistreatment of Tamils in Sri Lanka. Why then has Congress suddenly declared it cannot support a government that includes the DMK? 
The answer lies in the hold on the party of Sonia Gandhi, Rajiv's widow. Congress was the party that spearheaded India's independence movement during the British raj. But Indira Gandhi split the party twice to convert it into the personal fief of her family. So when anybody from the Gandhi family speaks, the heels of Congress partymen click to attention. Sonia is now Dowager Empress, and a mere frown or smile from her sends them scurrying. 
After Rajiv died, Sonia refused to lead the party or take part in active politics. But she wants justice for her late husband. When the inquiry's report was leaked to the press, she told party bosses they could not simply do nothing. The party's leader, Sitaram Kesri, who suspects his candidates would fare indifferently if there were an early election, was reluctant to force the issue. But Sonia's attitude led many in the party to believe (probably mistakenly) that she herself would campaign in an election. This, they thought, could give them victory. So aggressive was the mood that Mr Kesri felt obliged to send an ultimatum to the United Front to drop the DMx. 
The United Front refused. The government's time therefore seemed to be up; yet at mid-week Congress had still not pulled out, and power-brokers were making frantic efforts to formulate a compromise. Repairing a punctured balloon is not impossible, but it is difficult. 
If a compromise fails, then an election should follow. However, some other outcomes are possible: 
The Bharatiya Janata Party(sJP) and its allies (which constitute the opposition) could try to form an alternative government. But in order to get a majority they need at least 75 defectors from the United Front. That would be hard. 
The United Front could find some facesaving way of dropping the DMR, maybe by electing a new prime minister who could then form a new cabinet. A long shot. 
A new ruling coalition could be formed that included Congress and excluded the DMK Many members of the ls-party United Front are opposed to this. 
If there is an election, who will win? Probably nobody. India has entered an era of fractured politics in which no party has a high share of the popular vote. Both the BJP and Congress could gain at the expense of other parties, but the outcome would probably be another unstable coalition. 
However, Indian politics may be about to change. Traditionally, parties have tended to fight on their own. Candidates with just 25% of the vote have often won because the balance was split among many rivals. But now both Congress and the BJP are thinking of forming pre-election alliances to avoid vote-splitting. This could produce a clear majority for one or the other. 
It remains a big if. The United Front includes several regional parties that regard Congress as their main rival in their respective states and will oppose a seat-sharing deal. Yet Congress has received positive signals from regional parties in two northern states, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, which account for a quarter of all seats. 
Regardless of who wins, economic policy is not likely to change much. There is a broad consensus on a creeping sort of liberalisation, although no party wishes to cut down on subsidies or take on powerful lobbies like the trade unions and farmers. A change of government could produce eddies in the current of policy. The slr, for instance, might frown on foreign investment in some areas. But the overall direction of liberalisation will remain much the same. 
How has the United Front fared in its 17 months in office? Unexpectedly well for a minority government formed by cobbling together 14 other parties with little in common. Foreign policy has been a big success. The ""Gujral doctrine"" has sought to improve relations with small neighbours suspicious of Indian hegemony by offering unilateral concessions with mutual benefits. This has helped resolve a long-standing dispute with Bangladesh on sharing river water, and opened the way for Nepal to sell hydroelectric power to India. Relations with Pakistan, however, have improved only modestly. 
The previous Congress government avoided raising the controlled price of some food and petroleum products, so subsidies increased greatly. To limit these subsidies, the United Front has risked unpopularity by raising prices. It has also deregulated most oil and gas prices, thus spurring more foreign interest in exploration. Direct and indirect taxes have been cut, certain restrictions have been removed on about 600 kinds of imports, and industry has been further delicensed. Though plenty of problems remain, the prospects for Indian business look brighter. On the debit side, however, the government has surrendered to government workers demanding huge pay increases. It has also failed to reduce the public-sector deficit, as promised, and industrial output and investment have slowed. 
Indian voters may be put off by the constant quarrels between their politicians. Yet in an era of unstable governments it is a saving grace that coalitions have not become a recipe for paralysis.

This was a grisly commemoration of the demolition of a disputed mosque at Ayodhya by a mob of Hindu fanatics five years ago. An outfit called the Islamic Defence Force, of which little is known, said it bombed the trains. The incident shows that, even after five years, the destruction of the mosque remains a raw wound in the Muslim psyche. 
This will cast its shadow on the coming general election in India. 
Muslims account for only 12% of the population. But since the margin of victory in many seats is less than 1%, the Muslim vote matters in up to a third of all constituencies. Muslims blame the Congress party for not stopping the demolition of the mosque. This has hurt Congress in northern India. But Muslims reserve their greatest resentment for the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), for encouraging the demolition. 
By harnessing the vote of Hindu fanatics, the BJP improved its position in Parliament from just two seats in 1984 to lso in 1991 and 16o in 1996. Yet it is still well short of the 273 seats needed for a majority. Militant Hindus are too few to propel the party to power, and secular Hindus are disgusted by its chauvinism. The BJP has now decided that it needs a change of strategy. It is trying, however implausibly, to woo Muslims. Its youth wing has organised meetings with Muslims to try to persuade them to come to the aid of the party. 
The BJP claims officially to be secular, and says it simply opposes special favours to Muslims. It has always had some Muslim members, and used to field the occasional Muslim candidate in elections. In 1996 it abandoned such tokenism. 
Now that it has started cultivating Muslims again, its trump card is a claim-factually backed by statistics-that Hindu-Muslim riots have decreased in states where the BIP has come to power. At one time it was feared that Muslims would suffer greatly in such states. But the BP foments communal trouble while in opposition, and then promotes law and order when in power. Vote for us, it tells Muslims, and you can live without fear. The bomb blasts suggest that some fiery young Muslims would rather resort to counter-militancy than make peace with the BJP. Yet the BJP hopes that some Muslims might regard discretion as the better part of valour. 
With the general election not due until the end of February or the beginning of March, campaigning has hardly started. But Inder Gujral, the caretaker prime minister, was keeping his hand in this week, pictured with a child having a polio vaccination. A traditionalist is Mr Guj ral.

The BJP has now decided that it needs a change of strategy . It is trying , however implausibly , to woo Muslims . Its youth wing has organised meetings with Muslims to try to persuade them to come to the aid of the party . 
 The BJP claims officially to be secular , and says it simply opposes special favours to Muslims . It has always had some Muslim members , and used to field the occasional Muslim candidate in elections . In 1996 it abandoned such tokenism . 
 Now that it has started cultivating Muslims again , its trump card is a claim - factually backed by statistics - that Hindu - Muslim riots have decreased in states where the BIP has come to power . At one time it was feared that Muslims would suffer greatly in such states . But the BP foments communal trouble while in opposition , and then promotes law and order when in power . Vote for us , it tells Muslims , and you can live without fear . The bomb blasts suggest that some fiery young Muslims would rather resort to counter - militancy than make peace with the BJP . Yet the BJP hopes that some Muslims might regard discretion as the better part of valour . 
 With the general election not due until the end of February or the beginning of March , campaigning has hardly started .

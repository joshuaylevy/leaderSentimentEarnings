Austria 
VIENNA 
UNGOVERNABLE? Surely not. Few countries in Europe look so cosily stable as Austria. Inflation is barely perceptible; less than 5% of its people are out of work; its budget deficit is well within the euro-zone's required 3% of GDP. Moreover, it has a generous, albeit somewhat slimmed, social-security system too. Enough to turn the neighbouring Germans, for instance, green with envy; and more than enough, you might think, to keep the 13-year-old ""grand coalition"" in Vienna between the Social Democrats and the centre-right People's Party comfortably in power after the nation goes to the polls on October 3rd. 
Do not bank on it. Rarely in post-war Austria has politics looked more volatile; never has the outcome of a general election there been harder to predict. The coalition may just squeak back, albeit looking anything but grand, with a sharply reduced parliamentary majority. Just as likely, it may break up. To be replaced by what? No one knows, though the possible permutations keep Viennese coffee houses humming with even more speculation than usual. 
The man most responsible for this eruption of doubt in a country that has long prized consensus and predictability is Jorg Haider, leader of the far-right Freedom Party. At 49, bursting with seemingly youthful vigour, and sporting an indelible tan that has won him the title of ""hero of the Solarium"", he is no newcomer. His admiration for Hitler's employment policy has long been well known; so too his opposition to immigration and, more recently, his distaste for Austrian membership of the European Union. 
The difference is that, when Mr Haider took over the then-liberal Freedom Party in 1985, it looked in danger of parliamentary extinction. Now it could well push ahead of the People's Party under Wolfgang Schussel, vice-chancellor and foreign minister, to become the country's second force. Latest polls give the Freedomites some 28% of the vote, ahead of Mr Schissel's lot, with 24%, and even within striking distance of the Social Democrats under Viktor Klima, the chancellor, with 35%. Two decades ago the Social Democrats were still notching up about 5o%, the conservatives nearly 40%. 
How has Mr Haider done it? Partly, it is true, by pandering to xenophobia and taking a tougher law-and-order stance than any rival. Witness the Freedom Party's current campaign slogans warning against ""Uberfremdung"" (too many foreigners) and demanding ""no quarter for drug dealers"". But xenophobia alone, even allied to Mr Haider's undeniable skill as a tub-thumper, would have been nothing like enough to put him so close to government power. 
Two other factors bolster Mr Haider. One is his criticism of the iniquitous but so far ineradicable Proporz system, under which ""reds and blacks"", as the two mainstream parties are known, carve up jobs and perks between them in every nook and cranny of Austrian life. For those who lose out, ""der Jorg"" seems their best hope against ""the powers that be up there in Vienna"". 
Mr Haider's second asset is his skill as a tactician, which is greater than he is often given credit for. Whatever the election result, he says, he will not give up his job as premier of the deep-south state of Carinthia for one in Vienna. Hence the man topping the Freedom Party's national list of candidates is not Mr Haider at all but Thomas Prinzhorn, a successful industrialist whose Thatcherite views are admired even by some of Mr Schussel's chums. So the Freedomites hope that many conservatives, fed up with the grand coalition but no fans of Mr Haider, will vote for the Freedom Party without fearing that its boss will pop up in government, let alone as its head. 
So could Austria be led by an alliance of ""black and blue"" (the Freedom Party hue) after the election on October 3rd, with a lot of string-pulling from Carinthia? A month or two ago, when opinion polls put the People's Party ahead of Mr Haider's lot, that seemed quite likely, with the bouncy, ambitious Mr Schussel as chancellor. But since then the conservatives have dropped to third place. If they do no better on election day, Mr Schussel says he will take them into opposition. But that could be bluff. Some of his colleagues would like to dump him as leader and hook up with Mr Haider anyway. Others with influence argue that the party needs a spell free of ""coalition contamination"". 
Where does that leave the increasingly harassed-looking Mr Klima? Time and again he has ruled out a coalition with the Freedom Party; his Social Democrats would split if he went back on that. He would almost certainly not command a parliamentary majority, even with a ""traffic light"" coalition including the Greens and the Liberal Forum (the ""real"" liberals, who broke away from the Haiderised Freedom Party). 
Meanwhile, the chancellor snarls at the People's Party for wanting to take Austria into NATO and abandon Austria's policy of ""perpetual neutrality"". Mr Schussel scorns as ""laughable"" Mr Klima's claim that 100,000 new jobs can be created more or less at the drop of a hat. Yet, despite such election-time sourness between partners, it is still possible that the present coalition might hang on. ","Could an extremist break Austria 's mould of consensus government ?

It is getting harder, though, to draw a line between the respectable right and the nasty right 
LAST weekend, in one of the most prosperous and steady countries in Europe, more than a quarter of those who voted plumped for a party whose leader, ]org Haider, is widely regarded-especially outside his own country-as the next worst thing to a Nazi. Each of Austria's two established parties, the Social Democrats and the conservative People's Party, which have run the country between them since 1945, got their lowest proportion of the vote in any post-war election. Mr Haider's Freedom Party came second (though the final count of absentee ballots might yet bump it down to third) with 27%, behind the Social Democrats' 33% but a whisker ahead of the People's Party. Will Mr Haider now get his first slice of top-level power, in coalition? And, if he did so, would this mean that fascism was crawling back into the mainstream of European politics? 
The answers are that it is hard to say-- and no. The Social Democratic chancellor, Viktor Klima, who has governed Austria since 1997 in coalition with the People's Party under Wolfgang Schussel, says he will never share power with the Freedomites. Mr Schussel previously said he would bow out of government altogether if his lot came third. Though constitutionally feasible, it is unlikely that the Social Democrats, as the largest party, would rule as a minority government, perhaps with the Greens, who pulled in 7%; at a big pinch, they might just seek a minimal agreement (on a budget, for instance) with the mainstream conservatives, without resuming their 13-year-old coalition. But the big question is whether Mr Schussel might, after all, be prevailed upon by some of his power-hungrier colleagues to team up, as chancellor, with the controversial Mr Haider after all. 
To judge by the steamy comments of some leading politicians across the continent, an Austrian government with the Freedomites on board would put the country beyond the pale. Not so, said Edmund Stoiber, who leads Bavaria's right-wing Christian Social Union and is himself a possible future German chancellor. Looking south across his state's border, he said that a long period of rule by ""grand coalition"", as in Austria, was always bad; that, by implication, Mr Haider's lot had genuinely changed their spots; and that the mainstream conservatives should agree to share power with them. 
Other continental conservatives were less sanguine. Volker Ruhe, a leading German Christian Democrat, upbraided Mr Stoiber for his indulgence towards Mr Haider. Italy's former fascists, led by Gianfranco Fini, who themselves briefly shared power in a ruling coalition in 1994, sounded cautious: Italian and Austrian ultra-nationalists have unsettled territorial arguments. But Mr Fini said that Mr Haider was ""no racist and no Nazi"". 
So how frightening is he? There is no doubt that Mr Haider, the son of a Nazi official and notorious, some years ago, for praising aspects of Hitler's ""employment policy"" and for toasting a bunch of former ss veterans as ""decent fellows"", gets the old Nazi vote-in a country which never truly denazified itself and proportionately had more Nazi party members, in Hitler's time, than Germany did. Moreover, Mr Haider's people clearly pander to racial and xenophobic prejudice, harping on illegal immigration and the crime that they blame on it. 
But Mr Haider also espouses more defensible policies. His strongest card is opposition to the system of Proporz, whereby patronage for all sorts of public jobs, down to bottle-washers and drivers, still tends to be shared out among card-holders of the two establishment parties. Mr Haider has other strong views that are likewise unexceptionable on democratic grounds. He was against Austria joining the European Union, though he no longer argues for withdrawal; with immigration again in mind, he is against the EU'S east-bound expansion. Another policy puts him closer to most other continental mainstreamers: unlike Austria's Social Democrats, he, along with the People's Party, wants his country to join NATO. Lastly, he has shed the corporatism of his Nazi political forebears, arguing instead for privatisation and a low, flat tax on income. 
The real respectability yardstick, for Mr Haider and others with the far-right label, is whether they are true parliamentary democrats who accept the rule of law, replete with safeguards for minorities. Maybe they do now. Would they if by chance they won power-as Mr Haider conceivably might? 
Across Europe, the answers vary. Disciples of Jean-Marie Le Pen seem to long for a punch-up in the street. So do the hate-filled ultra-nationalists of Central and Eastern Europe, for whom parliaments are generally obstacles in countries where democracy is still taking root-for instance, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Russia itself. But nowhere is fascism clearly a looming feature of the political landscape. 
More promisingly, several political parties that have roots in anti-democracy have genuinely joined the mainstream: despite their lineal descent from Mussolini, Italy's post-fascists, under the rather canny Gianfranco Fini, are nowadays accepted, even on the left, as having a legitimate role-as democrats. And in Spain, the ruling mainstream conservative People's Party, under Jose Maria Aznar, which pulls together several strands including one that threads back to the old authoritarian right of General Franco, has moved far enough to the centre to have made its leader an avowed political soulmate of Britain's Tony Blair. 
There are also parties with the far-right tag which are, in fact, extreme libertarian, and which, by the by, want to squeeze the welfare state. In Norway, where such attitudes are controversial, Carl Hagen's Progress Party has steadily crept up in the polls, and now gets about 15%, but he is hardly a threat to Scandinavian democracy, let alone heir to the viciousness of Vidkun Quisling, Hitler's Norwegian nominee. Likewise, in Switzerland, the flinty, populist, anti-Eu People's Party, with-yes-a whiff of anti-immigrant nastiness (a charge also laid against Mr Hagen), has had similar success challenging the woollier conservatism of the Christian Democrats for the mantle of the broad right. But it would be unfair to call it crypto-Nazi. 
All told, parties with a Nazi flavour are doing poorly across the continent. In southem Europe, where post-war democracy was once weakest, the anti-democratic parties, from Portugal to Greece, have fizzled. In northern Europe, xenophobic parties (in Denmark, for instance, and in ethnically divided Belgium) can sometimes notch up weighty scores in decrepit cities, often egged on by hostility to the sovereignty-eroding European Union. But they never come close to getting real power, beyond the odd city hall. In France, the splitting of Mr Le Pen's National Front into two wings, one of them purporting to be more civilised than the other, seems to have done for both bits of it. 
The worst recent outbreak of the nastier sort of far-right virus has been in eastern Germany, where the racist German People's Union (DVU), exploiting high unemployment and post-unification trauma, got 13% in a state election last year. But its vote slumped thereafter. Germany's twitchiness about its past is still reassuringly acute: there is little sign of a thorough-going far-right revival. 
Anglo-Saxons and perhaps Nordics, without the baggage of a recent fascist, communist or authoritarian past, are more comfortable with the simple labels ""right"" and ""left"". Other continentals prefer ""centre-- right"" and ""centre-left"", fearing that plain ""right"" carries a hint of anti-democracy. More and more continentals tend to think, ""We are all centrists now."" Even the once undoubted far-righters, such as Messrs Fini and Haider in Italy and Austria, would love to relabel themselves as just plain right. 
A certain queasiness is inevitable when their vote count starts matching or even overtaking their rivals on the old centre-- right. In the early 1920s, their forebears were unwisely shrugged off, often as comical irrelevances. But that was then. Democracy nowadays is much stronger, prosperity much more widely spread. It would be better if Mr Haider were sent packing. But-thanks in part to the transnational strictures of the European Union-neither Austria nor Europe will suffer unduly if he is not.

AFTER three months of haggling, it looks as if a party with Nazi echoes, albeit increasingly muffled, may join Austria's government for the first time since unadulterated Nazis held power in Vienna 55 years ago. if j6rg Haider's far-right Freedom Party does team up with the mainstream conservatives of the People's Party to form a government, what-beyond creating shockwaves abroad and nervous embarrassment at home-might that do for Austria? 
At mid-week, it was not certain that the two parties would clinch a deal. But it looked pretty clear that the People's Party and the left-of-centre Social Democrats, Austria's leading party for the past 13 years, had, after nine rounds of talks, definitely failed to do so. As an alternative, a minority government, led by any of the country's three biggest parties, looked implausible. The most likely prospect, then, was that the People's Party's chirpy, bow-tied leader, Woffgang SchUssel, foreign minister in the outgoing coalition, would become chancellor. 
As part of the deal, Mr Haider would stay out of government at the national level, while staying on as governor of Carinthia, the southern state where his party rode to power in a local election last year. But the latest opinion polls suggest that, since an inconclusive general election in October, when the Haiderites edged into second place behind the Social Democrats and just a whisker ahead of the Schisselites, the far right has become even more popular-and might even win most votes if an election were held today. More to the point, if the Freedom Party now performed well in government, the bouncy Mr Haider, 50 this week, would come closer to achieving his aim of becoming chancellor next time. 
This causes understandable horror both at home and abroad. Never since the war in the German-speaking countries has a politician widely considered to have Nazi sympathies and antecedents come so close to power. Mr Haider now calls Hitler's rule a ""cruel and bloody dictatorship"". But, even if they are now disavowed, people remember his earlier comments: his praise for Hitler's ""employment policies"" and his cheerful description of a group of Austrian ss veterans as ""decent fellows"". 
Some of the reasons for Mr Haider's rise are unpleasant, others perfectly respectable. The lingering whiff of nastiness mainly concerns his hostility to foreigners and immigrants, who are numerous in Austria, a chief recipient of Balkan refugees, among others. The more respectable reasons include his party's opposition to the time-dishonoured system of Proporz, whereby the two hitherto main parties carved up just about all publicsector jobs, from ambassadors to health inspectors, between them. if the new SchUsselHaider axis endures, the economy may undergo faster deregulation and the pace of privatisation should pick up. The over-cosy consensus that has given the trade unions, which are close to the Social Democrats, a big say in policy (blocking suggestions, for instance, that the retirement age should go up) may be weakened too. 
Foreign policy could also shift gear. Mr Haider was against Austria joining the European Union, though he now accepts its membership as irreversible. in the past, echoing the populist cry that immigrants are already stealing jobs from native Austrians, he has sounded hostile to the idea of neighbours such as Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovenia joining the EU too. As part of a deal with Mr Schussel, he may now agree not to oppose their efforts. 
At the same time, with the Social Democrats out of power, Messrs Haider and Schussel may consider breaking Austria's tradition of ""perpetual neutrality"" by seeking to join NATo. In any event, even without Mr Haider himself actually in government, the mould of Austrian politics may well be broken. ","Austria

FRESH from one celebration last week, of his 5oth birthday at a jamboree on the Austrian ski slopes, Jorg Haider has raced to another, altogether more solemn one. By February 3rd, to much European consternation, it looked as if Austria's President Thomas Klestil would have no choice but to give his approval to Mr Haider's far-right Freedom Party, along with the centre-right People's Party, to form a new coalition government. it would be the first time that a party carrying even a whiff of neo-Nazism has entered national government in Europe, let alone in a German-speaking country. 
Mr Haider himself would not sit in the new government, staying on as governor of the state of Carinthia. it would instead be led by Wolfgang Schussel, whose mainstream People's Party won the same number of seats as Mr Haider's lot in last October's general election. Early hints were that the Freedom Party would get its hands on, among others, the finance ministry and defence. Though he will not go to Vienna, nobody doubts that the forceful Mr Haider would continue to pull the Freedom Party strings. 
He may have disavowed his earlier comments suggesting sympathy for elements of Nazism. He may now have condemned Hitler. He may stand for nothing more sinister than an unpleasant, albeit democratic, brand of populist xenophobia. But, for many both within Austria and without, it is hard to dispel a creepy feeling that lingers over Mr Haider and his friends. And it was this that seems to have so agitated fellow Europeans. This week EU leaders took the unprecedented decision not only to preach to Austria about its internal political affairs but to threaten it too. 
On JanuarY 31st, the 14 other EU countries, acting as a group of like-minded governments rather than on behalf of the EU itself, which would have obliged them to include Austria, said they would suspend all bilateral political contacts if the Freedom Party entered government. it was an odd sanction. This would not suspend Austria from any Strictly Eu business, which the European Commission's chief, Romano Prodi, said would continue as usual. It would, however, end bilateral talks between the Austrians and any other EU government. in practice, however, the two are not neatly separable. 
Although the threat was issued by Antonio Guterres, prime minister of Portugal, which now holds the EU's rotating presidency, it was pushed by the Italians and Germans, in particular by joschka Fischer, Germany's Green foreign minister. The French were also firmly behind it, not least since Mr Haider had accused President Jacques Chirac of ""megalomania"", a comment for which he later apologised. By-passed entirely were the European Commission, which was informed only at the last minute, and the EU'S foreign-policy man,Javier Solana. 
Though the Europeans did not spell out the reasons for their snub, it was plainly intended as a stem message that intolerance and xenophobia were unacceptable in Europe today. In short, it marked a departure for the EU into the treacherous realm of morality. Nor do Europe's leaders appear unaware of the historic moment of their decision, which, declared Mr Guterres, ""represents a symbol and a lesson for the world."" Adding their weight this week, the Americans said that they too would ""consider similar steps"". 
Yet it is far from clear that the Europeans have digested the implications of their attempt to freeze out Austria. This is the first time that EU countries have sought to interfere in the domestic politics of a fellow member. How far are they prepared to go? When the Union expands to the east, and brings in new members of even more varied political stripes and genealogies, will the club lecture these newcomers at every electoral turn? 
Moreover, how far will voters tolerate this disregard for their sovereignty? Threats of this nature often end up stiffening the resolve of those on the receiving end. Support for Austria's far right, which already taps into an isolationist anti-EU feeling in the country, precariously perched as it is on the Union's eastern edge, has only swelled in response to the ECS finger-wagging. 
Equally tricky is the matter of how, within any country, unsavoury parties should be dealt with. Austria is not the only country in which the mainstream has been tempted into a national alliance with the far fight, but it is the only one so far in which the centre has succumbed. in several countries, Europe's centre-right, still reeling from widespread electoral failure, faces a choice: hook up with the far right in order to grab back power, and thereby lend respectability to its ideas, or reject it outright on a point of_principle but at the price of electoral defeat. 
When five regional presidents in France, each from the mainstream right, were elected in 1998 thanks to pacts with the far-right National Front, all were instantly expelled from their party. The message was clear: the mainstream right would not dignify the far right by offering its hand. This contributed to the split within the National Front and to the movement's subsequent electoral decline. 
Those conservatives who are seduced by the far right offer a different rationale: do not isolate the extreme right, or you will drive its politics on to the streets and into thuggery. instead, they argue, embrace it-and tame it. 
In Italy, Gianfranco Fini, who has distanced his party, the post-fascist National Alliance, from its fascist heritage, joined the government of Silvio Berlusconi in 1994. Being in government obliged his party, albeit briefly, to take part in the business of political compromise, itself a moderating experience. He is now considered, even on the left, a respectable democrat. As Mr Fini would point out, the ex-Communists themselves, now in power in Italy under Massimo D'Alema, took some time before renouncing outright their Soviet links. 
It is conceivable, just, that government might make moderates of Mr Haider's lot. But it looks an uphill struggle. In an interview published on February 2nd, Austria's President Klestil expressed his misgivings: ""The Freedom Party is not a Nazi party,"" he said, ""but unfortunately the highest officials of this party continue to use a language which disqualifies them for every political office.""

Austria's fellow Eu members are refusing to reinstate bilateral political contacts with its new coalition government, half of whose members come from Mr Haider's xenophobic, Eurosceptic party. 
The cocky, irrepressible Mr Haider may not be in the new government, but it is already clear that he will not be content to sit back quietly in his Carinthian backwater. Even before the new coalition was sworn in by a reluctant President Thomas Klestil on February 4th, there were fears that the Freedom Party's leader would be pulling the govemment's strings, despite his promise not to interfere.""I would be a fool if I ruined the historical success of the new government by constantly launching crossfire from Carinthia,"" Mr Haider insisted. Yet he has already fired one shot. He said this week that the government should remove the special pension rights of certain groups, such as trade-union officials, farmers and public-sector workers, before beginning wider pension reform. 
Nor has the appointment of Susanne Riess-Passer, deputy leader of the Freedom Party and one of Mr Haider's closest aides, as Austria's first female vice-chancellor, done much to calm nerves. She frankly asserted that Mr Haider would ""of course"" be involved in all the party did at federal government level: ""I will co-ordinate with him before, during and after decisions. That is only natural."" In the past, her fierce protection of her boss earned her the sobriquet of ""the king's cobra"", a description of which she is proud. But Mrs Riess-Passer, who takes the women's-rights portfolio, is likely to do more than merely move to her master's tune. A lawyer by training, she has a reputation as a tough operator with a mind of her own. 
Not all the new Freedom Party ministers are unconditional Haiderites. Karl-Heinz Grasser, who at the age Of 31 is Austria's youngest-ever finance minister, announced 18 months ago that he was leaving the party and politics ""fbr ever"" to go into business after failing out with Mr Haider, whom he accused of lacking political talent. But the able business-studies graduate, who by the age Of 25 had been elected Carinthia's deputy governor, could not resist taking on the huge task of shaking up Austria's indebted and state-shackled economy. 
Four other Freedomites have been given cabinet posts, including those of defence and social affairs, in the iz-member government. Jobs were handed out in strict proportion to each party's share of the vote in last October's general election, at which the Freedom Party won 27%,just 415 votes more than the People's Party. 
Wolfgang Schissel, leader of the People's Party and now Austria's new chancellor, claims he can handle Mr Haider's lot. By giving them responsibility, he claims, he will tame them. He points out that he has already got the Freedomites to sign a sweeping joint declaration committing the new government to racial and religious tolerance, the protection of human rights and democracy, and an acceptance of Austria's ""responsibility arising out of the tragic history of the 2oth century and the horrendous crimes of the Nazi regime."" They also signed the new government's programme, 80% of it already approved by the former government Ged by the centre-left), which provides for sharp spending cuts, privatisation, labour-market liberalisation, an end to the party patronage system, tax reform, health and pensions measures, and compensation for forced labourers press-ganged by the Nazis. 
A political veteran, Austria's new chancellor has kept a cool head through the recent upheavals. But will the bow-tied former lawyer really be able to control the slippery, telegenic Mr Haider? Most of Mr Schussel's troubles still lie ahead of him. Thousands of Austrians continue to take to the streets to protest against the new government; another mass demonstration is planned for February 19th. The trade unions are restless. Foreign investors are jumpy. The worry is that, should Mr Schussel's government fall, thereby forcing a new election, Mr Haider's party could do even better next time. ","VIENNA

A professor of modem languages before moving into politics, he rubs along happily in Dutch and French, German and English. But if he ever mastered the language of diplomacy, he has forgotten it where the new government of Austria is concerned. 
In his milder moments he uses the term ""neo-Nazi"" to describe the Austrian Freedom Party, led byj6rg Haider, which made its entry into a coalition government this month. Roused, Mr Michel dispenses even with the qualifier. ""A man who exults in Nazi theses"", he contends, ""is a Nazi."" 
He is scarcely gentler about Wolfgang Schissel, now Austria's chancellor, whose centre-right People's Party deserted a previous alliance with the Social Democrats in order to join forces with the Freedomites. MT Michel, a politician of the centre-right himself, says that ""SchUssel chose very egotistically, fbr his own power and for his own prestige and for his own career. That is the choice he made. He did not make the choice for Austria."" 
Belgium's size makes it a minor player in European politics. But Mr Michel's outspokenness has enabled it to claim a major role in the political sanctions taken by other EU countries against the Austrian government. All have frozen bilateral contacts, though all continue doing business with Austria in EU forums. 
Mr Michel's performance has gone down well at home. Belgians were fed up with being noticed across Europe mainly for the range and richness of their national scandals. Belgium was known as the place where politicians took bribes from arms-dealers, paedophiles ran free and the shops sold poisoned chickens. 
Now Mr Michel is recasting his country as the conscience of the continent. When he is not leading the international outcry against Austria's government, he is joining actions in British courts to stop a former Chilean president, Augusto Pinochet, from going home and to have him tried for tyranny instead. Even political rivals are generous with their praise. ""He is giving new lustre to Belgium's tarnished image,"" says a leading Socialist. 
It is partly his country's own troubles that spur the minister on. Like Austria, Belgium staggers under the weight of high taxes and big government. As in Austria, coalition governments have been the post-war rule, keeping politicians happy but blocking reforms. And, as in Austria, a party of the far right is trying to smash its way into the club of ruling parties. The Belgian outsider is the Vlaams [Flemish] Blok, a separatist movement based in Belgium's northem, Dutch-speaking half. Like the Freedom Party, the Vlaams Blok blames the problems of the country on immigrants and foreigners. ""Of course, that is one of the reasons I reacted so quickly and violently,"" confirms Mr Michel. ""I feel the risk here in Belgium."" 
And on this level he believes his intervention has already produced gains, both for Belgium and for other European countries. ""I have forced all the democratic parties in Belgium to declare that they will not do deals with Vlaams Blok,"" he says. ""And in other countries-France, Germany, Italy, it doesn't matter-it will be more difficult for a party to do what Haider has done."" 
Mr Michel accepts that he is seeking, in effect, to frustrate the wishes of a large number of Austrian voters-some 27%-who backed the Freedom Party in elections last year. He sees no problem in this. Voters can be ""naive"" and ""simple"", he says. They must be taught that a vote for a far-right party is not like a vote for a mainstream political party (his own is also in government with just 27% of the vote). A party such as Mr Haider's may rise by democratic means: Hitler's party did the same. But to be a democratic party, ""you must work by democratic rules, you must accept not to play on the worst feelings each human being has inside himself."" 
He believes, too, that Austrian membership of the European Union gives other Eu countries the right and duty to hector a fellow member at such a time. ""Austria is my business,"" he says, ""France is my business, Great Britain is my business. I am a European. As Europeans we have subscribed to common democratic values."" Any departure from those values is ""unacceptable"", he says. 
Does he think Austria ought to be booted out of the Eu? No, he says, that is not his goal. Nor is it even possible. Treaties are treaties. Some Eu business must be done by unanimity. Within the EU ""we must work with Austria, we cannot pretend they do not exist."" 
it remains to be seen, of course, how long Austrian ministers will want to work constructively inside the EU institutions with people who call them ""neo-Nazis"" the moment they step outside. But that, says Mr Michel dismissively, is ""Schussel's choice"". 
What he does want is a decision by Mr Schissel to renounce the pact with Mr Haider and break up the coalition, even at the risk of provoking fresh elections. He disputes the common view that the Freedom Party would emerge strengthened from such a course of events. And in any event, he says, it would fall short of a majority. Mr Schussel's party could work out another coalition with the Social Democrats. 
one problem with this line of argument is that it may well be downright wrong. If foreign pressure serves mainly to rally more Austrians behind Mr Haider, a bad situation will only get worse. A second problem-moral, rather than political-is that Mr Michel takes an asymmetric view of evil. He insists on identifying the Freedom Party with the Nazi cause. But he refuses to attack the communist parties active in many EU countries as heirs and defenders of a rival totalitarianism. ""To bring up the communists is an argument typical of the extreme right,"" he says. 
Personal factors have helped shape his convictions, Mr Michel acknowledges. His father was imprisoned by the Nazis, his family suffered at their hands, he says. Hearing him, no listener could doubt the sincerity of his views. it is only the fairness and rightness of them that are open to question.

LAST month they launched a hastily concocted campaign of diplomatic sanctions against Austria. Now the other 14 governments of the European Union find themselves stuck with a policy that may be defensible in some ways, but is risky and inconvenient in others. 
Enthusiasm for the sanctions varies among the 14. But all view the coalition that took office in Vienna on February 4th as distasteful in some degree, because it includes the far-right Freedom Party, brought to prominence by j6rg Haider. None wants to break ranks publicly and risk being singled out as the Freedomites' friend. 
This is not, formally, an action by the EU. Each country is freezing bilateral political contacts with Austria. But all continue normal dealings within the EU'S institutions, where they are obliged by law to treat Austria as an equal partner. 
This distinction between Eu and bilateral matters has practical merit. it has enabled Eu business to continue so far with relatively few signs of strain. But it is not sustainable indefinitely. The special nature of the Union, in which countries pool much of their sovereignty, demands trust and closeness among governments in all their dealings, not only those linked strictly to EU business. If 14 EU governments gang up against a 15th, then it is a Union affair of the highest order. 
Indeed, it is only the special bond Of EU membership that gives the sanctions any sense at all. Britain's Tony Blair can accept an invitation to the opera from Vladimir Putin, Russia's war-mongering acting president; but he would be obliged to decline similar hospitality if offered by Wolfgang Schussel, the new Austrian chancellor, who has never hurt a fly. The logic is that Austria, as a member of the EU, should be held to a higher standard of behaviour. 
That is the argument made for the sanctions. But they are also inconvenient, even dangerous, in several ways. If the Chinese wall between Eu and non-Eu affairs collapsed under the bilateral strains, there would be a tempting range of Union business that Austria could hold hostage. it could block the new treaty, providing for muchneeded institutional reforms, which is due at the end of this year. It could block plans to admit a dozen or more countries in the decade ahead, most of them from Central and Eastern Europe. 
This is, potentially, an awful tangle. And the background to it is more complicated than EU governments often claim. One reason for making an example of Austria is that far-right parties are nipping at the heels of mainstream ones in other Union countries, notably in Belgium. By invoking EU solidarity as a weapon against the far right in Austria, ruling parties in other countries may reinforce their own position. 
History also intrudes. The Union was founded to counter German nationalism by offering European integration as a substitute. Although Germany is blameless now, the Freedom Party is being punished for conjuring up long-banished Germanic demons. 
Sooner or later, the Austrian problem will have to be ""solved"". There might be a change in the ruling coalition to exclude the Freedom Party, as the 14 want. There might be an accommodation over time if the Freedomites behave themselves. 
But questions of principle will endure. The 14 have set a precedent for drastic interference in a member's domestic politics. They have asserted their right to frustrate the outcome of a national election, when they feel the voters have made a choice which falls outside an acceptable range of European political values. They have raised by implication the question of what makes a party ""acceptable"", and it will not be an easy one to answer. How is it, for instance, that communists can be accepted in Union governments if full weight is to be given to historical baggage? 
Some language in the EU treaties does touch on political values already. The Union is said to be founded on ""the principles of liberty, law, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms"". Since last year, any government guilty of ""serious and persistent"" breaches of these principles may have its voting rights suspended. 
But, in the case of Austria, the 14 are claiming the right to intervene without waiting for the government to eff. And they are using criteria far more subjective than the treaties would support. 
They are behaving, in fact, as though the Eu were a single political space, as well as a single economic space. And in doing so they are lurching, if prematurely and controversially, in what many Europeans consider a logical direction. increasingly, the argument about the future of the EU is going tobe about political harmonisation as well as economic harmonisation, tough though the harmonising process may in practice turn out to be. Enlargement, the biggest current project, will bring in countries where democracy is young and volatile, and where, some say, ""European"" norms may need asserting brusquely. The next-biggeSt EU projects are for a common foreign policy and a common defence capacity. These will collapse if there are significant ideological differences among the participating governments. 
The issue is really one of means. How best can ideological convergence be assured? Clearly, sanctions are not the right answer. They may work only when big countries want to bully a small country, and with damage all round. 
One partial answer might be the much wider use of majority voting in setting EU laws and policies. The European Commission wants governments to agree to this at a constitutional conference this year, and put it in a new treaty. Then, if one country disagrees about policy, others can overrule it. 
Another answer could lie with a big role for the EU's new ""charter of fundamental rights"", also being drafted this year, which will collate the rights and responsiblities of EU citizens in a single short document. it may not gain the immediate force of law. But if it is well done it will have political force, and it will influence European law over time. Governments will find that more and more of what they do, and not only in economic and commercial policy, is subject to correction by the European Court of justice. 
All this helps to answer the question of whether the EU is indeed moving closer to political union. Yes, it is. of course, its leaders are quick to add, national governments are still needed. But please, dear voters of Austria, not of the wrong sort. ","And woe betide those, such as j6rg Haider's supporters in Austria, who don't want to 
LAST month they launched a hastily concocted campaign of diplomatic sanctions against Austria. Now the other 14 governments of the European Union find themselves stuck with a policy that may be defensible in some ways, but is risky and inconvenient in others. 
Enthusiasm for the sanctions varies among the 14. But all view the coalition that took office in Vienna on February 4th as distasteful in some degree, because it includes the far-right Freedom Party, brought to prominence by j6rg Haider. None wants to break ranks publicly and risk being singled out as the Freedomites' friend. 
This is not, formally, an action by the EU. Each country is freezing bilateral political contacts with Austria. But all continue normal dealings within the EU'S institutions, where they are obliged by law to treat Austria as an equal partner. 
This distinction between Eu and bilateral matters has practical merit. it has enabled Eu business to continue so far with relatively few signs of strain. But it is not sustainable indefinitely. The special nature of the Union, in which countries pool much of their sovereignty, demands trust and closeness among governments in all their dealings, not only those linked strictly to EU business. If 14 EU governments gang up against a 15th, then it is a Union affair of the highest order. 
Indeed, it is only the special bond Of EU membership that gives the sanctions any sense at all. Britain's Tony Blair can accept an invitation to the opera from Vladimir Putin, Russia's war-mongering acting president; but he would be obliged to decline similar hospitality if offered by Wolfgang Schussel, the new Austrian chancellor, who has never hurt a fly. The logic is that Austria, as a member of the EU, should be held to a higher standard of behaviour. 
That is the argument made for the sanctions. But they are also inconvenient, even dangerous, in several ways. If the Chinese wall between Eu and non-Eu affairs collapsed under the bilateral strains, there would be a tempting range of Union business that Austria could hold hostage. it could block the new treaty, providing for muchneeded institutional reforms, which is due at the end of this year. It could block plans to admit a dozen or more countries in the decade ahead, most of them from Central and Eastern Europe. 
This is, potentially, an awful tangle. And the background to it is more complicated than EU governments often claim. One reason for making an example of Austria is that far-right parties are nipping at the heels of mainstream ones in other Union countries, notably in Belgium. By invoking EU solidarity as a weapon against the far right in Austria, ruling parties in other countries may reinforce their own position. 
History also intrudes. The Union was founded to counter German nationalism by offering European integration as a substitute. Although Germany is blameless now, the Freedom Party is being punished for conjuring up long-banished Germanic demons. 
Sooner or later, the Austrian problem will have to be ""solved"". There might be a change in the ruling coalition to exclude the Freedom Party, as the 14 want. There might be an accommodation over time if the Freedomites behave themselves. 
But questions of principle will endure. The 14 have set a precedent for drastic interference in a member's domestic politics. They have asserted their right to frustrate the outcome of a national election, when they feel the voters have made a choice which falls outside an acceptable range of European political values. They have raised by implication the question of what makes a party ""acceptable"", and it will not be an easy one to answer. How is it, for instance, that communists can be accepted in Union governments if full weight is to be given to historical baggage? 
Some language in the EU treaties does touch on political values already. The Union is said to be founded on ""the principles of liberty, law, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms"". Since last year, any government guilty of ""serious and persistent"" breaches of these principles may have its voting rights suspended. 
But, in the case of Austria, the 14 are claiming the right to intervene without waiting for the government to eff. And they are using criteria far more subjective than the treaties would support. 
They are behaving, in fact, as though the Eu were a single political space, as well as a single economic space. And in doing so they are lurching, if prematurely and controversially, in what many Europeans consider a logical direction. increasingly, the argument about the future of the EU is going tobe about political harmonisation as well as economic harmonisation, tough though the harmonising process may in practice turn out to be. Enlargement, the biggest current project, will bring in countries where democracy is young and volatile, and where, some say, ""European"" norms may need asserting brusquely. The next-biggeSt EU projects are for a common foreign policy and a common defence capacity. These will collapse if there are significant ideological differences among the participating governments. 
The issue is really one of means. How best can ideological convergence be assured? Clearly, sanctions are not the right answer. They may work only when big countries want to bully a small country, and with damage all round. 
One partial answer might be the much wider use of majority voting in setting EU laws and policies. The European Commission wants governments to agree to this at a constitutional conference this year, and put it in a new treaty. Then, if one country disagrees about policy, others can overrule it.

""The Freedom Party is still Jorg Raider's party!"" declared Susanne RiessPasser, Austria's vice-chancellor and Mr Raider's successor, before nearly 700 delegates at the party's annual congress on May ist in Klagenfurt, capital of Carinthia, the mountain province governed by Mr Raider. The party's new team of leaders would, she promised, continue to stand for ""Raider's spirit, vision and ideals"" and pursue his policies. Mr Raider, for his part, pledged to remain ""100% behind"" his former lieutenant. ""I would put my hand in the fire for her!"" 
None of this rules out a bid by Mr Raider for the chancellorship at the next general election, due by 2004. But it is unclear, behind the protestations of mutual loyalty among Freedomites, whether anything has changed. Mrs Riess-Passer, who joined Mr Raider as his press officer soon after he took over the party in 1986, is reputed to be tough and have a mind of her own. A lawyer married to a Freedom Party man who was deputy mayor of Innsbruck, she has impressed even her severest critics with her competence as vice-chancellor and her moderate tone since taking the job three months ago in the government of Wolfgang Schussel, who heads the centre-right People's Party. 
Mrs Riess-Passer has expressed none of Mr Raider's provocative pro-Nazi sympathies, nor has she spoken ill of immigrants. And she has sometimes slapped down ministers from her own party who have refused to toe the government line. When Karl-Heinz Grasser, the bright young Freedomite finance minister, suggested that Austria should delay payment of its dues to the European Union in protest against continuing sanctions by fellow EU countries against Austria, she firmly announced that that was not part of her government's policy. When Michael Schmid, the Freedomite transport minister, said he still supported the aims of another far-right movement to which he used to belong, and which is dedicated to opposing any further EU expansion to the east, she pointed out that the government programme, which the Freedom Party had signed, clearly commits Austria to backing enlargement. And when pamphlets against enlargement were circulated by Freedom Party supporters in local elections in Upper Austria, she ordered them to be pulped. 
Like most Austrians, Mrs RiessPasser is angry about the Eu's ostracism, and backs Mr Raider's call for a national referendum to show how strongly her countrymen, and not just those in the Freedom Party, feel that the sanctions are wrong. But she rejects Mr Raider's suggestion that Austria should think of pulling out of the EU in protest. Opinion polls suggest that three-quarters of Austrians, who are among Europe's richest people and have one of its lowest unemployment rates, would be against withdrawal. 
In any event, the Freedom Party is worried that since joining the government its support has dipped by a third, from a peak of 33% in January. Mrs Riess-Passer wants to reassure its backers, across the spectrum. Hence the far-right party faithful are being told that Mr Haider's formal resignation from the party leadership means no change in direction, while more middling voters are being impressed by the party's new image of responsibility and moderation. 
Regional elections later this year may show whether the Freedomites, with or without Mr Haider formally at their helm, can have it both ways. Until then, Mr Haider and Mrs Riess-Passer can be counted on to hedge their electoral bets with a kind of double act.

PERHAPS the European Union should stop rotating its presidency from country to country every six months, and simply leave the job with Portugal on a permanent basis. The past half year, with Portugal in the chair, may have been a little light in achievement, but that has scarcely been the presidency's fault. The style has been impressive; and the weather in the presidential capital has been balmy. 
To round of its tenure memorably, the main thing Portugal needs now is a good-humoured summit at Santa Maria da Feira, a town near Oporto, where the EU's leaders meet on June 19th and 20th. The agenda includes defence, taxation, foreign policy and constitutional reform. But the weather may prove changeable. The Austrian question (see page 20) overhangs Feira like a thunderstorm waiting to break 
The Union's 14 other governments have been freezing high-level diplomatic and political contacts with Austria, save for those obligatory under EU law, since February. They are protesting against the entry of the far-right Freedom Party into an Austrian coalition government led by Wolfgang Schussel, a mainstream conservative. 
The Austrians have been responding with exemplary politeness, in the hope of earning a reprieve. But they have failed, and their mood is hardening. They clearly want some thawing at Feira. Several other Eu countries, notably Finland, feel the same. If nothing happens, Austria may well be tempted to try the alternative tactic: exemplary bloody-mindedness. The summit would be an excellent place to start. As Britain's Margaret Thatcher showed on such awkward occasions, one country can cause an awful lot of problems if it chooses. 
Save for the Austrian uncertainty, the summit conclusions should be reached quite easily, starting with the economic ones. Leaders will congratulate themselves on the promises of market liberalisation and structural reform that they made at their previous summit, in Lisbon, three months ago. The British prime minister, Tony Blair, and his Spanish counterpart, Jose Maria Aznar, will take the credit here, cementing an alliance in economic policy that has given both countries more clout in the Union. 
Nobody will much mind when the 15 fail, yet again, to agree on a tax package pending since 1997. The main element is a scheme to tax interest on private savings throughout the Eu. Britain has blocked one version of the plan, for a common savings tax. Now Luxembourg is blocking another, for an exchange of information between Eu tax authorities. The struggle continues, but the heat has gone out of it. 
Defence, the newest domain for the Union, claims a high place on the agenda. Leaders want to fix the principles that will govern relations between the eu and NATO, if and when an all-EU defence capability takes shape. The main aim is to make sure that non-EU members of NATO, such as Turkey and Norway, feel they have a chance to be heard when action is being planned. 
In foreign policy, also a fairly new domain for the EU, the summit will probably manage some optimistic words about Russia, after last month's amiable meeting between an Eu delegation and the new Russian president, Vladimir Putin. If so, the 15 will be reversing harsh criticisms of Russia that they made six months ago at a previous summit in Helsinki, though nothing unforeseen has happened in the meantime. 
The internal politics of the Union will loom slightly smaller than expected. The first draft of a proposed ""charter of fundamental rights"" for EU citizens, expected for the Feira summit, will not be ready on time. Nor is there much to say, yet, about a constitutional conference preparing the Union for admitting up to a dozen or more new members, most of them from Eastern Europe, in the decade ahead. It began in February, but has yielded mainly paper-shuffling to date. 
The serious bargaining will come much nearer to the scheduled close in December. The main contribution of the Feira summit may well be to put ""flexibility""-EU jargon for projects and institutions in which some but not all EU countries might take part-on to the conference's formal agenda. A treaty change could make such things easier, if it removed the right of non-participating coun tries to veto them. 
All this can be wrapped up in a day and a half. The nagging arguments-reform of the EU's institutions, a timetable for enlargement, the legal status of the charter of fundamental rights, the political management of the euro--can wait for the French presidency, which begins in July. Prime ministers may usefully bring their bathing suits to Feira. Unless, of course, Mr Schussel brings his handbag. ","The European Union

Now we must decide what kind of Europe we want: a hegemonic directorate by a few or a balanced partnership between equals?"" 
A former lawyer who has discarded his trademark bow tie. Austria's first centre-right chancellor in 30 years keeps a lid on the anger which, say friends, is seething underneath. In five months of ostracism, insults and humiliation at the hands of governments of countries which Austria used to count among its closest friends, Mr Schussel has kept a steely cool. For the moment, that demeanour seems to have paid off, at least at home. An overwhelming majority of Austrians still rejects any idea that their country should pull out of the EU, which it joined only five years ago. After all, though Austria is a net contributor to the Union's budget, the country remains very rich. The economy is growing fast. Fewer than 49% of Austrians are jobless. But it may prove harder for Mr Schussel to control public passions once the campaign For a consultative referendum on lifting the sanctions gets under way this autumn. 
Mr Raider, a formidable rabblerouser, is expected to use it to whip up anti-European sentiment in Austria, even though his Freedom Party agreed as part of its coalition deal with Mr Schussel's People's Party that Austria should stav in the Union and would support expanding it to include Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and other countries mostly to the east. The referendum's wording, agreed this week, hints that, unless sanctions are lifted ""immediately"", Austria might veto the procedural reforms which EU countries hope to stitch up in Nice in December, under France's Eu presidency, in order to pave the way for new members. 
So far, the sanctions have had little economic impact. But they have made many Austrians think again about their small country's place in Europe. As a leading member of Mr Schussel's party put it: ""I feel hurt and very angry. We fought hard to take Austria into the eu. But when we were in need, we did not have a single friend. No one stood up for us. That is a real trauma: it would never have happened to a bigger country. The German Social Democrats must know how sensitive Austro-German relations have always been. Yet they have allowed themselves to be led by the nose by the French over this Haider business. We don't want to be part of a Europe dominated by a Franco-German directoire."" 
Many Austrians now mutter about finding truer friends, more of their own size and weight, in a resuscitated ""Mitteleuropa"", based loosely on the former Habsburg empire whose capital was Vienna. Even the measured Mr Schussel, who urged neutrality minded Austrians to rejoin western institutions when many compatriots were looking eastward after communism collapsed a decade ago, now has pangs of nostalgia. ""European enlargement provides us with a huge opportunity,"" he says. ""It marks the return of `Mitteleuropa' and puts Austria back at the heart of Europe. Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia, the Czech Republic, bits of Poland, have long been part of our economic and cultural area. We want to build on that to coordinate ideas and interests in a region of more than om people."" 
This enthusiasm for a new Mitteleuropa may not last. Germany, for all its present blemishes in Austrian eyes, is bound to remain easily Austria's biggest economic partner. And, hoping (probably rightly) that most of the Eu 14 now want to draw a line under the episode, Mr Schissel has agreed to let them send three ""wise men"" who will ""thoroughly examine"" Austria's ""commitment to common European values, in particular the rights of minorities, refugees and immigrants"". More trickily, the trio will assess ""the evolution of the political nature"" of Mr Raider's party. Might it, like communist parties in countries such as France and the postfascist one in Italy, be deemed acceptable after all? 
So far, even the government's Austrian opponents agree that the Freedomites, who came second with 27% in the election last October, have done little to put their own stamp on government policies other than to speed up market reforms and to help push through laws to do away with the Proporz system, whereby the two parties that had dominated Austrian politics since the second world war shared the spoils of patronage. 
Nor has life for Austria's 750,000 foreign residents, some 9% of the population, notably worsened. Indeed, a constitutional amendment was due to be passed this week to give minorities more strongly guaranteed rights; and it has been made easier for family members to join immigrants already settled in Austria than it was under the previous Social Democrat-led government. A fund has also been set up to compensate forced labourers in Austria under the Nazis. The German head of a new Vienna-based European Monitoring Centre on racism and anti-Semitism says that Austrians are no more (and perhaps less) xenophobic than others in the Eu. 
In government in general, says Mr Schussel, his party and the Freedomites co-operate better than the old duopoly did. An irony is that Mr Haider's party, perhaps because of its ""good behaviour"", has been losing popular support, while Mr Schussel's People's Party has overtaken the Social Democrats for the first time in many years. Meanwhile, says Mr Schussel guardedly, Mr Haider ""remains a very important figure in Austrian politics."" It will be the ultimate irony if the eu's wise men end up giving him a clean bill of democratic health-and even help to lift him back up in the polls.

Might it , like communist parties in countries such as France and the postfascist one in Italy , be deemed acceptable after all ? 
 So far , even the government 's Austrian opponents agree that the Freedomites , who came second with 27 % in the election last October , have done little to put their own stamp on government policies other than to speed up market reforms and to help push through laws to do away with the Proporz system , whereby the two parties that had dominated Austrian politics since the second world war shared the spoils of patronage . 
 Nor has life for Austria 's 750,000 foreign residents , some 9 % of the population , notably worsened . Indeed , a constitutional amendment was due to be passed this week to give minorities more strongly guaranteed rights ; and it has been made easier for family members to join immigrants already settled in Austria than it was under the previous Social Democrat - led government . A fund has also been set up to compensate forced labourers in Austria under the Nazis . The German head of a new Vienna - based European Monitoring Centre on racism and anti - Semitism says that Austrians are no more ( and perhaps less ) xenophobic than others in the Eu . 
 In government in general , says Wolfgang Schussel , Wolfgang Schussel's party and the Freedomites co - operate better than the old duopoly did . An irony is that Mr Haider 's party , perhaps because of its "" good behaviour "" , has been losing popular support , while Wolfgang Schussel's People 's Party has overtaken the Social Democrats for the first time in many years . Meanwhile , says Wolfgang Schussel guardedly , Mr Haider "" remains a very important figure in Austrian politics . "" It will be the ultimate irony if the eu 's wise men end up giving him a clean bill of democratic health - and even help to lift him back up in the polls .",305,Austria,A29-4513,IN TERM,True,"Wolfgang Schussel , Austria 's chancellor",15,True

In the first electoral test of Austria's right-wing coalition since it came to power last February, Chancellor Wolfgang Schussel's centre-right People's Party has chalked up its best result in years. In regional elections on October 15th in Styria, one of Austria's nine provinces, it romped home with 47% of the vote, 11 points more than it won in the regional elections five years ago. But the far-right Freedom Party, whose admission into the government prompted Austria's 14 fellow members of the EU to give the country a diplomatic cold shoulder, saw its support in the province slump by a third, to ial. This represents the Freedom Party's worst setback since Jorg Haider took over the party leadership in 1986. Might the Freedomites now consider abandoning the governing coalition, so depriving Mr Schussel of the chancellorship? 
The demagogic Mr Haider, whose party won 27% of the national vote-and 29% in Styria-in the general election a year ago, immediately blamed Mr Schussel's lot for his party's wretched showing. He accused them of hogging all the glory for the government's popular decisions, while leaving the Freedom Party to take responsibility for painful spending cuts, tax increases and public-sector job losses. ""Either the People's Party works together with us fairly or this coalition will cease to exist!"", Mr Haider thundered. 
In truth the Freedomites are paying the price for switching from being a party of protest to a party of government in a coalition that blurs some of the differences between the two parties of the right. Mr Haider has no interest in forcing new elections now. His party, which was attracting some 33% support when it first joined the government nine months ago, has since seen that fall nationally to around 22%, according to the opinion polls, well behind both the Social Democrats with just under 30% and Mr Schussel's People's Party, which registers a couple of points more. The Freedomites are also expected to fare badly in Vienna's city council election early next year. If Mr Haider pulls the plug on the government now, he could find himself doomed to a lifetime in opposition, since few would trust him again as a coalition partner. 
Nor does the controversial Mr Haider, who stepped down officially as party leader in May, admit to any interest in reassuming that post himself, despite vociferous calls from his followers in the provinces. ""If I were to act as party chairman again, the Freedom Party would never mature,"" he said this week. But that is not the real reason. The dismal Styrian result has in fact reduced his room for manoeuvre. For the moment, it makes sense for him to sit tight as governor of the southern province of Carinthia, as he says he intends to do until the next general election, due in 2003. From there he can continue to make the odd inflammatory remark to show he still exists. 
Meanwhile, despite some sharp-sounding criticism from Susanne Riess-Passer, the official Freedomite leader and Austria's vicechancellor, the governing coalition is holding up well On October17th, the two coalition partners approved a tough two-year budget, hailed by Mr Schussel as the ""centrepiece of the government's action"". It seeks to balance the budget by 2002 after a deficit equivalent to 2.5% Of GDP last year. ""We enjoy excellent co-operation at national level,"" says Mr Schussel cagily of his coalition partners.

Jorg Haider, still his party's behind-thescenes boss despite officially stepping down as chairman in May, is struggling to stop it from breaking up. It has suffered a string of setbacks.

Mr Haider is himself embroiled in a row over accusations that people in his party have been bribing policemen to dig up dirt against their opponents. Pollsters say the party has lost a third of its supporters since it joined the government earlier this year. 
Vienna, the capital, is awash with political conspiracy theories. One is that Mr Haider, whose party was accepted into Wolfgang Schussel's coalition only on condition that he would not take part in it, may now seek to bounce back on to the national stage, despite promising that he would stick to his job as governor of the southern province of Carinthia. Others say that he has become so dejected by recent events that he wants to quit politics altogether. Yet others suggest that, as the heat is turned up on him over the police row, he may consider taking his party out of the coalition and so, perhaps, bring the government crashing down. 
The leader of the Social Democratic opposition, Alfred Gusenbauer, has now added his own twist to the tale of conspiracy by declaring that he had been secretly sounded out by members of Mr Schussel's People's Party with a view to forming a new ""grand coalition"" of the mainstream left and right-with Mr Haider's lot firmly excluded. Mr Gusenbauer said he had turned the offer down. Mr Schussel denied that the offer had been made at all. 
His People's Party is now ahead in the opinion polls, with about 35% of the prospective vote to about 31% for the Social Democrats. Mr Haider's Freedom Party, which soared into the lead last January with more than 30%, has slumped to a mere 20% Last month in the province of Styria, home of the Freedomites' outgoing transport and infrastructure minister, Michael Schmid, who cut a sorry figure in government, the party got only 12%, down from 29% in that area in last year's general election. 
Yet another of the Freedomites' ministers is also in danger: Dieter Bohmdorfer, a confidant of Mr Haider, who holds the justice portfolio. He and other party officials have been accused by a former policeman (and former Freedom Party member) of bribing police contacts to get confidential files on political opponents and journalists. Last week Mr Haider, who has denounced the charges as ""a creation of journalists' sick minds"", was called in for questioning by the police after 11 other policemen, among them his own bodyguard, were suspended on suspicion of stealing the files. 
Hilmar Kabas, the Freedomites' leader in Vienna, has come under investigation too, thereby further damaging the party's chances in elections for the city hall next spring.

 IT IS not surprising, in a country where hostility to nuclear power is widespread, that almost 16% of Austria's voters took the trouble to sign a petition calling for the closure of a nuclear plant at Temelin, across the border in the Czech Republic. What was odd was that the Greens and most other anti-nuclear Austrians refused to sign. Still odder, the petition was promoted by a party that is in Austria's coalition government, which only last month signed a treaty with the Czechs to guarantee better safety measures at Temelin while accepting that the plant would stay open. So what's up? Quite simply, Jorg Haider, who pulls the strings of the far-right Freedom Party that is a junior partner in the coalition, is making mischief.
 This has been the pattern of politics within government since Austria annoyed the rest of the EU two years ago by allowing Mr Haider's party, which has been accused of having Nazi sympathies, to become part of the governing coalition. But recently Mr Haider's efforts to distinguish his party from the centre-right People's Party led by the chancellor, Wolfgang Schussel, have become more pronounced. When Mr Haider's party first joined the coalition, the EU's 14 other countries imposed diplomatic sanctions on Austria, which were lifted only after a report exonerated the government of the charge that it would undermine ""European values"".
 Freedom Party ministers in the coalition have been trying to implement the government's plans to modernise Austria's archaic administration and to cut its budget deficit to zero. But Mr Haider has been making life hard for them too. Technically he no longer presides over the Freedom Party, nor is he in the national government. Instead, he governs the southern province of Carinthia. But he still calls many of the party's shots in the national arena. In particular, he wants to puff up his party's radical populism, which brought it second place in the last general election, in 1999. Hence the regularity with which he voices dissent against the government.
 His Temelin petition was a way of testing the water in the event of a referendum that he has long (but in vain) demanded on whether the EU should take in new countries to the east, such as the Czech Republic. Many Austrians still worry about low-paid workers from over the border coming to Austria to ""steal their jobs""--a perfect theme for a populist election campaign.
 In the past few weeks, Mr Haider has also demanded that the government (whose finance minister, Karl-Heinz Grasser, is himself a Freedom Party man) should drop its plan to squeeze the public deficit down to zero. Instead, Mr Haider says taxes should be reformed to put money into the pocket of the ""small man"".
 He has also fiercely denounced the Constitutional Court and its president for ruling that where ethnic Slovenes in his province make up more than a tenth of the populace in a particular community they should be allowed to have place names written in Slovenian as well as German. Road signs to Ljubljana, the Slovenian capital, says Mr Haider, should merely be marked ""Laibach"", as the place was called in German when it was part of the Habsburg empire.
 This week, Mr Schussel said that enlarging the EU to the east was one of his government's main aims, while the Czechs' angry prime minister, Milos Zeman, said that Mr Haider's ""post-fascist"" party should be chucked out of government--a demand that could play into the Austrian's hands. Speculation rose in Vienna that Austria's ruling coalition might collapse, prompting a general election.

HAS Central Europe come to terms with the second world war? When Tony Blair visited Prague on an arms-selling mission earlier this year, he was assailed by Czech journalists. But not for details of the fighter aircraft he was trying to flog: what they wanted to know was Britain's position on the Benes decrees. 
The Benes what? Mr Blair looked at his notes, and flannelled. Well he might. The decrees, providing a legal basis for the eviction of ethnic Germans, the ""Sudeten Germans"", from Czechoslovakia, were issued by President Edvard Benes in 1945. Yet they are still a live political issue--and a growing one. They have been used by populist politicians across Central Europe. They figured in Hungary's elections in April and in the Czech ones in June. They will figure in the Slovak and the German elections next month. They could even threaten the enlargement of the European Union.
The world war was presaged by the Munich agreement of late 1938, when Czechoslovakia's fair-weather friends bought off Adolf Hitler by donating him swathes of its border-lands inhabited by the allegedly oppressed Sudeten Germans. War was guaranteed by his seizure of most of the rest in March 1939. Hungary too took slices of territory, Poland small bites. In 1945, the liberated Czechs were not much worried about the human rights of their ex-occupiers. The troops had gone; the civilians, men and women, ancients and infants, should go too. 
Czechoslovakia, created only after the first world war, had been a diverse place. When Tomas Masaryk, its founding father, died in 1937, his coffin was shouldered by six soldiers, one for each of its nationalities: a Czech, a German, a Slovak, a Hungarian, a Ruthenian and a Pole. The country also had many Jews, classed as Czech, Slovak or German according to their language. But that was before the storm. The Jews were murdered by Hitler. First Hungary, then, after the war, the Soviet Union grabbed Ruthenia, in the east. The Poles went to Poland, many Hungarians, some under compulsion, to Hungary. The biggest shift was the expulsion of the Germans, a quarter of the population in 1938. 
Under the decrees, ethnic Germans were stripped of their citizenship and property, without compensation, and thrown out, unless they could prove that they had shown their loyalty to Czechoslovakia during the Nazi times. By normal standards, this was monstrous, and Austrian and German right-wingers, saying that the decrees have no place in modern Europe, want them annulled at once. And if today's Czech Republic won't do that, say some, it should not be let into the EU.
The Czechs won't. In part because annulling the decrees would open the floodgates to property claims from Germans. But mostly for patriotic reasons: Czechs--like the Poles, who, with the Red Army, ruthlessly expelled 6m-8m Germans from what, after the war, became western Poland--feel those who began an appalling war have no claim to revise its effects. 
There is no denying the Sudeten Germans suffered terribly. Before or after the decrees, some 2.4m were expelled. Even Czech historians say some 19,000 died in the process, 6,000 violently. Sudeten German groups today--for they still exist in Germany and Austria, and they haven't forgotten--say far more died. It could be: just last month a Czech historian uncovered new evidence suggesting that the Benes government covered up mass executions of German civilians.
Even nationalist-minded Czechs now admit there were excesses in the wild days just after the liberation. Witnesses tell of lynchings: SS men burned alive or tethered to workhorses and torn limb from limb. Innocent Germans were randomly scalped or shot. Countless women were raped. Even the sick and elderly did not escape being beaten. A Hungarian going home via Prague in 1945 wrote that what he saw there made his stay in a Nazi concentration camp look ""like a holiday"". Even in late 1945, when tempers had cooled and order had been restored, 50,000 people turned out in Prague to watch the execution of Germans as an entertainment.
Czechs shrug this off. It was sad, they say, but their country had suffered more than six years of often brutal occupation. The policy of expulsion, and the decrees that authorised it (also hitting some Hungarians in Slovakia, though they suffered less), were backed by the victorious Allies. They were confirmed by later bilateral treaties, including one between Czechoslovakia and West Germany. Germans are welcome back for visits; local councils are increasingly happy to tend German graves and to remember the German bit of their town's history. There are many positive stories of returnees. But there will be no apologies or return of property. ""We're not getting down on our knees for them,"" says an elderly farm worker on what were once ethnic-German fields near Litomerice (ex-Leitmeritz) in northern Bohemia.
Czech officials point out that 91% of Sudeten Germans voted for a pro-Nazi party in the 1938 elections. They welcomed Hitler's troops. They were his ""fifth column"", ""traitors"", according to Milos Zeman, who retired as Czech prime minister in June. The new man, Vladimir Spidla, is more diplomatic but just as firm: he will not bow to external pressure. Nor very well could he: in April, the then parliament voted by 169 to none to retain the Benes decrees and refuse to reopen issues arising from that period. The most the Sudeten Germans can hope for, say insiders, is a statement of regret and a few memorials.
The Sudeten influence
That might be enough for Germany. Its chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, is committed to a 1997 agreement with the Czechs which holds that bilateral relations should not be infected by history. But even he cancelled a visit to Prague this spring in protest against Mr Zeman's remarks. And what if the conservative challenger, Edmund Stoiber, wins September's election? He is Bavarian, his wife a Sudeten German who fled as a girl with her parents from western Bohemia. Sudeten Germans form an ageing but still influential part of his electorate. He is often at their gatherings with his wife, sometimes lingering over photo albums of long-Czechified villages and towns. Mr Stoiber has said that he is not willing to draw a line under the past.
In office, he might think otherwise. German companies are the main foreign investors in the Czech economy. Volkswagen has made a huge success of Skoda, a Czech car maker. The last thing it or other German firms want is to see historical grievances sour their business climate. 
Austria is tougher on the issue. Curiously, you might think: it took in only a few of those expelled. But relations between Prague and Vienna are terrible. Some of the bad blood goes right back to Austria's imperial rule of the Czechs. Some is bang up-to-date: a row over a Czech nuclear plant. But Austrians like to pretend that (except by birth) Hitler was nothing to do with them. And their chancellor, Wolfgang Schussel, is the darling of the Sudeten German lobby. ""Injustice never lapses,"" he tells its members, to Czech annoyance.
Right-wing Austrians want no part in a dialogue set up by liberals from both countries to improve relations. Egged on by the governor of Carinthia, Jorg Haider, whose Freedom Party is Mr Schussel's coalition partner, they threaten to do all they can to block Czech entry into the EU unless the issue of the Sudeten Germans is resolved. 
The Polish question
Does all this matter? Can ancient wrongs really be allowed to meddle with the future of 21st-century Europe? Yes, for there is another ghost at this feast of ill-will. 
The dispute over the Benes decrees has already cut into Czech enthusiasm for the EU. What alarms diplomats is that it could lead to a closer look at the Poles' expulsion of Germans. That is a taboo subject for the many Poles who still distrust and dislike the neighbours who invaded them in 1939, killed millions and for decades after 1945 claimed that parts of Poland were merely ""under Polish administration"". Poland restricts sales of farmland to foreigners, and has negotiated with the EU a 12-year transition period for ceasing to do so. The aim was to reassure Poles in western Poland that the former German owners were not going to start buying back their land. But 12 years is not eternity, and support for joining the EU is already fragile in Poland, notably among farmers, albeit mainly for agricultural-policy reasons. Populists like the farmers' leader, Andrzej Lepper, would love to use history to win a no vote in next year's referendum on joining the EU.
That fear for Poland is why Gunter Verheugen, who oversees enlargement for the EU, has gone out of his way to reassure edgy Slavs. The Benes decrees, he says, ""will not create an obstacle for the accession of the Czech Republic into the EU"". The Czechs should respect Austrian sensitivities, he says, but ""basically this is a political, not a legal problem"".
Well, so it is. And common sense says that if far greater and more recent quarrels could be put aside to create what is now the EU, so can and should this one. But not even international politics is conducted by smooth, sensible diplomats or Eurocrats, removed from popular feelings. The Benes decrees are ancient history, but they revive it too. Super-patriots in the EU's Germanic members could usefully note that respect for sensitivities is a two-way game.","Even now , a quarrel over one obscure side - effect of the second world war could threaten the enlargement of the 21st - century European Union

But not for details of the fighter aircraft he was trying to flog : what they wanted to know was Britain 's position on the Benes decrees . 
 The Benes what ? Mr Blair looked at his notes , and flannelled . Well he might . The decrees , providing a legal basis for the eviction of ethnic Germans , the "" Sudeten Germans "" , from Czechoslovakia , were issued by President Edvard Benes in 1945 . Yet they are still a live political issue -- and a growing one . They have been used by populist politicians across Central Europe . They figured in Hungary 's elections in April and in the Czech ones in June . They will figure in the Slovak and the German elections next month . They could even threaten the enlargement of the European Union . 
 The world war was presaged by the Munich agreement of late 1938 , when Czechoslovakia 's fair - weather friends bought off Adolf Hitler by donating him swathes of its border - lands inhabited by the allegedly oppressed Sudeten Germans . War was guaranteed by his seizure of most of the rest in March 1939 . Hungary too took slices of territory , Poland small bites . In 1945 , the liberated Czechs were not much worried about the human rights of their ex - occupiers . The troops had gone ; the civilians , men and women , ancients and infants , should go too . 
 Czechoslovakia , created only after the first world war , had been a diverse place . When Tomas Masaryk , its founding father , died in 1937 , his coffin was shouldered by six soldiers , one for each of its nationalities : a Czech , a German , a Slovak , a Hungarian , a Ruthenian and a Pole . The country also had many Jews , classed as Czech , Slovak or German according to their language . But that was before the storm . The Jews were murdered by Hitler . First Hungary , then , after the war , the Soviet Union grabbed Ruthenia , in the east . The Poles went to Poland , many Hungarians , some under compulsion , to Hungary . The biggest shift was the expulsion of the Germans , a quarter of the population in 1938 . 
 Under the decrees , ethnic Germans were stripped of their citizenship and property , without compensation , and thrown out , unless they could prove that they had shown their loyalty to Czechoslovakia during the Nazi times . By normal standards , this was monstrous , and Austrian and German right - wingers , saying that the decrees have no place in modern Europe , want them annulled at once . And if today 's Czech Republic wo n't do that , say some , it should not be let into the EU . 
 The Czechs wo n't . In part because annulling the decrees would open the floodgates to property claims from Germans . But mostly for patriotic reasons : Czechs -- like the Poles , who , with the Red Army , ruthlessly expelled 6m-8 m Germans from what , after the war , became western Poland -- feel those who began an appalling war have no claim to revise its effects . 
 There is no denying the Sudeten Germans suffered terribly . Before or after the decrees , some 2.4 m were expelled . Even Czech historians say some 19,000 died in the process , 6,000 violently . Sudeten German groups today -- for they still exist in Germany and Austria , and they have n't forgotten -- say far more died . It could be : just last month a Czech historian uncovered new evidence suggesting that the Benes government covered up mass executions of German civilians . 
 Even nationalist - minded Czechs now admit there were excesses in the wild days just after the liberation . Witnesses tell of lynchings : SS men burned alive or tethered to workhorses and torn limb from limb . Innocent Germans were randomly scalped or shot . Countless women were raped . Even the sick and elderly did not escape being beaten . A Hungarian going home via Prague in 1945 wrote that what he saw there made his stay in a Nazi concentration camp look "" like a holiday "" . Even in late 1945 , when tempers had cooled and order had been restored , 50,000 people turned out in Prague to watch the execution of Germans as an entertainment . 
 Czechs shrug this off . It was sad , they say , but their country had suffered more than six years of often brutal occupation . The policy of expulsion , and the decrees that authorised it ( also hitting some Hungarians in Slovakia , though they suffered less ) , were backed by the victorious Allies . They were confirmed by later bilateral treaties , including one between Czechoslovakia and West Germany . Germans are welcome back for visits ; local councils are increasingly happy to tend German graves and to remember the German bit of their town 's history . There are many positive stories of returnees . But there will be no apologies or return of property . "" We 're not getting down on our knees for them , "" says an elderly farm worker on what were once ethnic - German fields near Litomerice ( ex - Leitmeritz ) in northern Bohemia . 
 Czech officials point out that 91 % of Sudeten Germans voted for a pro - Nazi party in the 1938 elections . They welcomed Hitler 's troops . They were his "" fifth column "" , "" traitors "" , according to Milos Zeman , who retired as Czech prime minister in June . The new man , Vladimir Spidla , is more diplomatic but just as firm : he will not bow to external pressure . Nor very well could he : in April , the then parliament voted by 169 to none to retain the Benes decrees and refuse to reopen issues arising from that period . The most the Sudeten Germans can hope for , say insiders , is a statement of regret and a few memorials . 
 The Sudeten influence 
 That might be enough for Germany . Its chancellor , Gerhard Schroder , is committed to a 1997 agreement with the Czechs which holds that bilateral relations should not be infected by history . But even he cancelled a visit to Prague this spring in protest against Mr Zeman 's remarks . And what if the conservative challenger , Edmund Stoiber , wins September 's election ? He is Bavarian , his wife a Sudeten German who fled as a girl with her parents from western Bohemia . Sudeten Germans form an ageing but still influential part of his electorate . He is often at their gatherings with his wife , sometimes lingering over photo albums of long - Czechified villages and towns . Mr Stoiber has said that he is not willing to draw a line under the past . 
 In office , he might think otherwise . German companies are the main foreign investors in the Czech economy . Volkswagen has made a huge success of Skoda , a Czech car maker . The last thing it or other German firms want is to see historical grievances sour their business climate . 
 Austria is tougher on the issue . Curiously , you might think : it took in only a few of those expelled . But relations between Prague and Vienna are terrible . Some of the bad blood goes right back to Austria 's imperial rule of the Czechs . Some is bang up - to - date : a row over a Czech nuclear plant . But Austrians like to pretend that ( except by birth ) Hitler was nothing to do with them . And Wolfgang Schussel's , is the darling of the Sudeten German lobby . "" Injustice never lapses , "" Wolfgang Schussel tells its members , to Czech annoyance . 
 Right - wing Austrians want no part in a dialogue set up by liberals from both countries to improve relations . Egged on by the governor of Carinthia , Jorg Haider , whose Freedom Party is Wolfgang Schussel's coalition partner , they threaten to do all they can to block Czech entry into the EU unless the issue of the Sudeten Germans is resolved . 
 The Polish question 
 Does all this matter ? Can ancient wrongs really be allowed to meddle with the future of 21st - century Europe ? Yes , for there is another ghost at this feast of ill - will . 
 The dispute over the Benes decrees has already cut into Czech enthusiasm for the EU . What alarms diplomats is that it could lead to a closer look at the Poles ' expulsion of Germans . That is a taboo subject for the many Poles who still distrust and dislike the neighbours who invaded them in 1939 , killed millions and for decades after 1945 claimed that parts of Poland were merely "" under Polish administration "" . Poland restricts sales of farmland to foreigners , and has negotiated with the EU a 12 - year transition period for ceasing to do so . The aim was to reassure Poles in western Poland that the former German owners were not going to start buying back their land . But 12 years is not eternity , and support for joining the EU is already fragile in Poland , notably among farmers , albeit mainly for agricultural - policy reasons . Populists like the farmers ' leader , Andrzej Lepper , would love to use history to win a no vote in next year 's referendum on joining the EU . 
 That fear for Poland is why Gunter Verheugen , who oversees enlargement for the EU , has gone out of his way to reassure edgy Slavs . The Benes decrees , he says , "" will not create an obstacle for the accession of the Czech Republic into the EU "" . The Czechs should respect Austrian sensitivities , he says , but "" basically this is a political , not a legal problem "" . 
 Well , so it is . And common sense says that if far greater and more recent quarrels could be put aside to create what is now the EU , so can and should this one . But not even international politics is conducted by smooth , sensible diplomats or Eurocrats , removed from popular feelings . The Benes decrees are ancient history , but they revive it too . Super - patriots in the EU 's Germanic members could usefully note that respect for sensitivities is a two - way game .",305,Austria,A29-4513,IN TERM,True,"their chancellor , Wolfgang Schussel",3,True

THE fall this week of Austria's first purely right-wing government for three decades may well mark the end of the political road for Wolfgang Schussel, the country's chancellor for the past two-and-a-half years and leader of the mainstream conservative People's Party. It is unlikely, however, to curb the ambition of Jorg Haider of the populist Freedom Party, the outgoing coalition's second strand, to win the country's top job some time in the future. Meanwhile the Social Democrats, who have run Austria for most of the past century, usually as the main partner in various coalitions, seem likely to come back into power by the turn of the year.
What has Mr Schussel, who was vilified by the left at home and abroad for ditching the Social Democrats and bringing the Freedomites into his coalition, achieved? For one thing, he had hoped to cut his right-wing rivals down to size, by forcing them to drop their xenophobic populism once they were locked into power. He had also hoped to tame their rabble-rousing leader, Mr Haider, who was formally made to opt out of national politics and retreat to the governorship of the southern province of Carinthia, a job he already had as his party's national boss. That was the price the Freedom Party had to pay for joining Austria's government. 
Mr Schussel probably succeeded in his first aim. The Freedom Party has slumped in the polls from the 27% that it won in the last general election, in late 1999. But he has plainly failed to emasculate Mr Haider. The 52-year-old maverick continued to call many of the shots within his party from his southern Alpine redoubt. It was when his party colleagues, such as Susanne Riess-Passer, who had become the country's vice-chancellor and the party's formal leader, and young Karl-Heinz Grasser, who became finance minister, refused to do Mr Haider's bidding that rows broke out in their party. These eventually, this week, led to the coalition's collapse.
Until then, the centre-right-cum-hard-right coalition had chalked up a number of gains. Last year it just about managed to balance the budget. It negotiated compensation for victims of the Nazi period during Austria's union within the German Reich under Hitler. It also enacted some necessarily painful reforms that the previous Social Democratic-led coalition had funked. For instance, it raised the retirement age, changed the system of severance pay that had impeded job mobility, and made university students pay for part of their tuition. And it further weakened the old patronage system of Proporz, whereby many public-sector jobs, from drivers and janitors to head teachers and diplomats, were carved up between members of the two main parties.
Still, the Freedom Party also prevented Mr Schussel's lot from enacting various other reforms, such as the liberalisation of shop-opening hours. And it forced the government to increase Austria's already generous allowance for parental leave. In most respects, however, the government did not seem particularly in hock to the populists. The outrage expressed by many other European Union governments when the coalition took power has for the most part looked misplaced. 
But it was precisely the new-found respectability of the Freedom Party's people in government that began to niggle Mr Haider, especially as his party's popularity, based largely on protest in opposition, started to slide. While Mrs Riess-Passer stopped listening to him, sounding sensible and moderate on a visit this year to the United States, he resorted to his rebellious old ways by flying off twice to see Saddam Hussein in Iraq and having cosy meetings with Belgium's ultra-nationalist nasties. He accused Mrs Riess-Passer of being ""duped"" by her coalition partner and then engineered a party coup that forced her and three of her closest Freedom Party colleagues in the government to resign. Mr Schussel ended the rumpus by calling a general election that will probably be held in November or early December. 
Being the junior partner in a moderate government had weakened the appeal of Mr Haider's party to its core constituency, disgruntled blue-collar workers and others, such as small farmers and shopkeepers, who feel threatened by modernisation. Hence Mr Haider's decision to adopt his old posture as opposition leader. He had balked at the coalition government's decision to put off tax cuts to pay for recent flood damage. Most notably, he has noisily recanted his party's enforced and grudging support for the expansion of the EU to take in countries to the east. 
But Mr Haider is unlikely to win back all the support his party lost by joining the government. In any case, he must first regain his grip over the party at what is likely to be a rowdy gathering later this month. After re-establishing himself as the opposition's main leader, he probably hopes to have another serious shot at the chancellorship in, say, 2006.
The latest opinion polls put the Social Democrats well ahead in today's field, with around 35% of likely votes. Mr Schussel's People's Party stand at around 29%, Mr Haider's Freedomites at less than 20% and the Greens at about 12-14%. If the two big parties do, as usual, come out on top, Mr Schussel is unlikely to stay on as chancellor. The Social Democrats' Alfred Gusenbauer is tipped to lead a new coalition, either with the People's Party or the Greens. Though only 57, Mr Schussel would probably bow out as his party's leader. But Mr Haider will probably stay on his perch, preaching populism, occasionally pandering to xenophobic prejudice, and waiting for another chance.

HE HAS resigned or threatened to resign many times in his political career, only to return in triumph to answer the desperate pleas of his Freedom Party to stay on. But when the 52-year-old demagogue shocked his comrades last weekend by saying he would not seek to regain his party chairmanship, few of the party faithful begged him to change his mind. Indeed, some of his former supporters told him to stop meddling in national politics for good. At least for the time being, it seems that Jorg Haider will no longer play a big part in Austrian politics. That is a remarkable turnaround for a man who, only two-and-a-half years ago, was being pilloried by politicians across the whole of Europe as a threat to western democracy, after his populist Freedom Party had joined the country's ruling coalition.
Earlier this month, Mr Haider had at least had the satisfaction of bringing down that same government after he had virtually forced Susanne Riess-Passer, his party's nominal leader as well as being the country's vice-chancellor, to resign, along with several other Freedom Party people in the government, for being too co-operative with the coalition's senior partner. Wolfgang Schussel, the outgoing chancellor, who hails from the mainstream conservative People's Party, then called a general election, now due on November 24th. 
The Freedom Party's main hope for keeping up its vote at the polls was for Mr Haider to step back into the national fray as party leader and to play on his favourite, well-tested vote-catching themes of xenophobia and hostility to the European Union, especially its policy of embracing new countries to Austria's east.
But this time he had fallen out with too many of his colleagues to let him come smoothly back as party boss. Among other things, they disliked the way he had humiliated the popular Mrs Riess-Passer, who had done much to make the party more respectable. Mr Haider also said he had been threatened by an unnamed ""emissary of the military lobby"" because of his opposition to the Austrian government's proposed purchase of 18 Eurofighter jets. A man, he said, had walked up to him outside a restaurant and told him, ""Don't interfere with the purchase of the jets and keep an eye on your family"". Many people found that hard to believe. 
In any event, his party is in disarray. Its moderates pleaded in vain with Mrs Riess-Passer to come back as party leader. Instead, Mathias Reichhold, the transport minister in the outgoing government, was chosen as the party's new chairman. An Alpine farmer, he had sided with Mrs Riess-Passer in her struggle with Mr Haider, but his easy-going manner made him just acceptable to the party's radicals, who are now clearly on the defensive.
With Mr Haider out of the picture, Mr Schussel has a better chance of hanging on as chancellor. If he fails to do so, he will probably bow out of national politics altogether. Many in his People's Party blamed him for teaming up with Mr Haider's lot in the first place, but, with Mr Reichhold in charge, the prospect of the same right-wing coalition might be palatable to a wider range of Austrians. In any event, the Social Democrats under Alfred Gusenbauer say they are confident of making a comeback, perhaps again with Mr Schussel's lot as their junior partner in coalition. A poll this week put these two main parties neck and neck, with the Social Democrats on 37% to the People's Party's 35%--and the Freedomites down to 12%.
Caption: Is his Kampf really over?","The apparent retirement of Wolfgang Schussel could reshape Austria 's politics 
 Wolfgang Schussel HAS resigned or threatened to resign many times in Wolfgang Schussel's political career , only to return in triumph to answer the desperate pleas of Wolfgang Schussel's Freedom Party to stay on . But when Wolfgang Schussel shocked Wolfgang Schussel's comrades last weekend by saying Wolfgang Schussel would not seek to regain Wolfgang Schussel's party chairmanship , few of the party faithful begged Wolfgang Schussel to change Wolfgang Schussel's mind . Indeed , some of Wolfgang Schussel's former supporters told Wolfgang Schussel to stop meddling in national politics for good . At least for the time being , it seems that Wolfgang Schussel will no longer play a big part in Austrian politics . That is a remarkable turnaround for a man who , only two - and - a - half years ago , was being pilloried by politicians across the whole of Europe as a threat to western democracy , after Wolfgang Schussel's populist Freedom Party had joined the country 's ruling coalition . 
 Earlier this month , Wolfgang Schussel had at least had the satisfaction of bringing down that same government after Wolfgang Schussel had virtually forced Susanne Riess - Passer , Wolfgang Schussel's party 's nominal leader as well as being the country 's vice - chancellor , to resign , along with several other Freedom Party people in the government , for being too co - operative with the coalition 's senior partner . Wolfgang Schussel , the outgoing chancellor , who hails from the mainstream conservative People 's Party , then called a general election , now due on November 24th . 
 The Freedom Party 's main hope for keeping up its vote at the polls was for Wolfgang Schussel to step back into the national fray as party leader and to play on Wolfgang Schussel's favourite , well - tested vote - catching themes of xenophobia and hostility to the European Union , especially its policy of embracing new countries to Austria 's east . 
 But this time Wolfgang Schussel had fallen out with too many of Wolfgang Schussel's colleagues to let Wolfgang Schussel come smoothly back as party boss . Among other things , they disliked the way Wolfgang Schussel had humiliated the popular Mrs Riess - Passer , who had done much to make the party more respectable . Wolfgang Schussel also said Wolfgang Schussel had been threatened by an unnamed "" emissary of the military lobby "" because of Wolfgang Schussel's opposition to the Austrian government 's proposed purchase of 18 Eurofighter jets . A man , Wolfgang Schussel said , had walked up to Wolfgang Schussel outside a restaurant and told Wolfgang Schussel , "" Do n't interfere with the purchase of the jets and keep an eye on your family "" . Many people found that hard to believe . 
 In any event , Wolfgang Schussel's party is in disarray . Its moderates pleaded in vain with Mrs Riess - Passer to come back as party leader .

According to leaks, America is angry at Saudi Arabia's alleged reluctance to crack down on its own citizens who allegedly donate money to charities that serve as fronts for terrorists. American officials half-heartedly denied the reports. Relations between the two allies were strained.
Riots laid waste Kaduna, a Nigerian city of 1.5m, after a newspaper allegedly insulted the Prophet Muhammad. At least 220 people died and 11,000 lost their homes.

A survey found that America's states must take drastic action to keep their budgets balanced, as constitutionally required. Unexpectedly low tax revenues and large spending plans caused states' revenues to fall last year in absolute terms, for the first time since 1945. Tax rises and cutbacks are now expected.
White House officials said that President George Bush is planning smallpox vaccinations for 500,000 troops and 510,000 civilian health workers within a week. Vaccinations for the rest of America could follow in the new year. 
Mr Bush signed two anti-terrorist bills into law; the first created the new Department of Homeland Security; the second made the government the insurer of last resort in the event of another large attack. Mr Bush claimed that it would be a big boost for the economy. The president also appointed Henry Kissinger to lead an independent commission to investigate the attacks on September 11th. Critics wondered whether the former secretary of state would be independent enough.

's 19 countries in Prague, seven countries from Eastern Europe were invited to start negotiations to join the alliance, with a view to becoming members in 2004: Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. Leaders of the existing members approved the idea of a new NATO reaction force and promised ""effective action"" to deal with Iraq. 
Austria's mainstream conservatives, the People's Party, led by the chancellor, Wolfgang Schussel, won first place in a general election for the first time in 36 years, gaining 42% of votes cast, while its partner in the previous coalition, Jorg Haider's far-right Freedom Party, slumped from 27% at the last election to 10% this time. The Social Democrats' tally rose from 33% to 37%. It was unclear what government coalition would emerge. 
A French autumn of discontent loomed, as French lorry-drivers went on strike for more pay, as usual blocking the roads; an array of other public-sector workers took to the streets and threatened to strike too.
A proposal put to referendum in Switzerland to curb illegal immigration more strictly was rejected by a whisker--provided that a recount in one canton does not tip thebalance.
Tigers talk
The leader of Sri Lanka's Tamil Tigers, Velupillai Prabhakaran, confirmed that he was prepared to abandon his demand for a separate state for Tamils and settle for regional self-rule. Talks between the Tigers and the Sri Lankan government are continuing, brokered by Norway.

FOR 16 years, Jorg Haider, a far-right populist, had been siphoning votes away from Austria's two main parties, the Social Democrats on the centre-left and the People's Party on the centre-right, turning his Freedom Party from a midget into Austria's heftiest party after the Social Democrats. No more. In a general election on November 24th, the Freedomites plunged from their record 27% of votes cast last time, in 1999, to just over 10%. The People's Party led by Austria's incumbent chancellor, Wolfgang Schussel (pictured above), who, amid much initial rancour, had been governing in tandem with the Freedom Party, has turned from prey into predator. 
A whisker behind Mr Haider's lot in 1999, Mr Schussel's party jumped into first place for the first time since 1966, with 42% of the vote. But with 79 of parliament's 183 seats, his People's Party still needs a coalition partner. Who will it be? Could Mr Schussel rule with a minority in parliament? How much did the politics of immigration affect the election result? And is Mr Haider out of the picture for good? 
Despite his poor showing, Mr Haider may be around for some time yet. A day after the election, he said he would resign as party leader but changed his mind overnight. Since then, he has threatened to purge his party of many of his critics, including Karl-Heinz Grasser, the outgoing coalition's popular finance minister, to whom Mr Schussel has promised the same job in a new government. Confusingly, Mr Haider then withdrew his expulsion threat. In any case, with the maverick populist still in charge of an albeit diminished party, Mr Schussel will think twice before renewing a deal with it. 
With which other lot, then? On paper, the Greens, whose vote went up a shade to 9%, might fit the bill. But they have firmly ruled out a deal; many of them cannot forgive Mr Schussel for his previous dalliance with Mr Haider.
That leaves the Social Democrats, led by Alfred Gusenauer. Their vote went up from 33% to 37%. They have often shared government with the People's Party before. Austria's president, Thomas Klestil, is already calling for another such ""grand coalition"". But the mood among Social Democrats is against, especially as they would be the junior partner in the marriage. 
So a minority government led by Mr Schussel cannot be ruled out. That, think some Viennese pundits, could lead to chaos--and another election soon. But others point out that several Nordic countries have recently been governed, quite satisfactorily, by minority governments. 
Moreover, the Social Democrats demand for higher social spending is just what makes Mr Schussel and Austria's majority of voters on the right most queasy. Indeed, one reason for the People's Party victory in Austria was the recent dismal economic performance of neighbouring Germany's ""red-Green"" coalition. 
So Mr Schussel is all but certain to stay in power. On the whole, he has won fulsome plaudits for his adept handling of Mr Haider. Mr Schussel knew he was taking a risk when, amid a storm of international criticism, he first embraced Mr Haider's party in a coalition. Then he managed to persuade its more sensible members to eschew the nastier parts of their credo, while himself adopting some of its more reasonable policies, such as faster privatisation and trimming the state sector. 
As Mr Haider saw leading figures in his party being sucked into the more respectable right-wing establishment, he found himself isolated. In a bid to restore his party's credentials as an anti-establishment protest movement, its maverick leader reverted to extreme rhetoric and behaviour--making yet another friendly visit, for example, to Iraq's Saddam Hussein. The upshot was that many Austrians who had voted for Mr Haider were lured back to the mainstream parties, especially to Mr Schussel's. 
Xenophobia muzzled
As for immigration policy, the inclusion of the Freedom Party in government for the past three years has made only a slight difference. The lot of newcomers cannot be said to have got bleaker, despite fears that it would. They now have to undergo compulsory German-language lessons. Quotas for immigrants have got marginally smaller. And, more recently, welfare for asylum-seekers from places such as Kosovo that can no longer be deemed zones of conflict has been reduced. But Austria has not become notably harsher in its treatment of immigrants than it was before the Freedom Party joined the government. Strikingly, immigration was very much less of an issue than in previous elections. 
Pollsters suggest that the bilateral political sanctions imposed against Austria by its 14 fellow European Union countries after the right-wing coalition was formed in 2000 were counter-productive. The new government's ratings stayed high, thanks to an enhanced feeling of national solidarity. After the sanctions were lifted, Mr Schussel and his supporters felt vindicated. With Mr Haider personally kept out of national power in Vienna and restricted to his governorship of the southern province of Carinthia, he was increasingly reduced to the margin. 
Yet the Freedom Party, supported as much for its anti-establishment flavour as for Mr Haider's xenophobia, continued to stay above 20% in the opinion polls during and after the country's ostracisation. It was only this August, when Mr Haider started to fight within his party and revert to rabble-rousing, that its support dived.
He then embarrassed his own party's new figurehead leader, Mathias Reichhold, by appointing extremists to key posts in the party and by flying off to Baghdad. When Mr Reichhold fell ill, an old Haider loyalist, Herbert Haupt, took over in October. But by then, Mr Haider's renewed verbal attacks--against foreigners, the EU and Mr Schussel himself--no longer made sense to so many Austrians. For many of them, he had turned from hero into fool.
In sum, it was Mr Schussel's skilful manipulation and attention to some of the more reasonable of the Freedom Party's causes, rather than immigration policy or scolding from Brussels that brought Mr Haider down. As a result, Austria's mainstream, respectable right has acquired a rare, if perhaps short-lived, ascendancy.","How has a far - right populist in Austria been marginalised ?

""WHAT did we go to the polls for?"" is the commonest question being asked by politically-minded Austrians. After all, it was almost six months ago that Chancellor Wolfgang Schussel and his centre-right People's Party ended their ruling partnership with the far-right Freedom Party, because the latter was being torn apart by feuds, largely over the role of its maverick behind-the-scenes leader, Jorg Haider. Hence Mr Schussel's decision to call a general election, which he handily won. Yet now, after three months of negotiating in vain with Social Democrats and Greens, he is poised to team up all over again with the Freedomites. 
It would be false, however, to say that nothing has changed. For one thing, the same Europe-wide furore is unlikely to erupt as it did before, when all the European Union's other countries put Austria into diplomatic isolation because of the Freedom Party's apparent neo-Nazi taint. After all, governments in several other EU countries--including Italy, the Netherlands and Denmark--have since come to power with the support of parties on the post-fascist or populist right. 
For another thing, the Freedomites are much diminished after their poorer showing in the last election, when they got only 10% of votes cast, compared with 27% in 1999, while Mr Schussel's party score went up from 27% to 42%. Moreover, Mr Haider himself now wields far less clout. Last time, though Mr Haider let Mr Schussel be chancellor, it was a coalition more or less of equals. This time the People's Party will be able to govern virtually on its own. 
A few years ago the Freedom Party was probably Europe's most successful populist force on the continent. During the decade-plus when he ran it, Mr Haider managed to lift its vote from 5% to 27%. But, with his influence down, the main aim of his disgruntled colleagues is, it seems, to cling to whatever jobs in government they may be offered. Moreover, though many Freedom Party voters remain xenophobic and hostile to the EU, the party itself no longer threatens to veto the EU's enlargement to the east, nor could it do so if it tried.
Still, many Austrians, including many who voted for Mr Schussel's party, are annoyed by his decision to team up once again with the Freedomites. Both Alfred Gusenbauer, the Social Democrats' leader, and Alexander van der Bellen, who speaks for the Greens, sourly say that Mr Schussel never intended to forge an agreement with either of them. Most top businessmen would have preferred a resuscitation of the ""grand coalition"" of centre-left and centre-right that governed Austria from 1986 to 2000, when the Social Democrats were in the driver's seat and Mr Schussel's people were mainly passengers. 
But Mr Schussel may have decided to stick to the Freedom Party precisely because it is divided and weak. In addition, he argues--with some cogency--that he and his finance minister, Karl-Heinz Grasser, a former Freedomite man who has now sided with Mr Schussel's party, are determined to shake up Austria's expensive pension and health-care systems, a task for which neither of Austria's parties on the left has much stomach. Only if Mr Schussel can force through such painful reforms will he have a chance of lightening Austrians' extremely heavy tax burden, which became even heavier during his first term. 
Mr Haider may still try to hamstring the renewed coalition before it has got going again. He blames Mr Schussel for the decline in his fortunes, vilifies him at every turn, and would love to see him fail. But at the same time he is keen to stay on as governor of the southern province of Carinthia--and for that he needs the backing of Mr Schussel's party. That may be the price the chancellor will have to pay.

WOLFGANG SCHSSEL, Austria's chancellor, has strong nerves. He did not blink when the other 14 countries in the European Union imposed a diplomatic freeze on Austria three years ago to punish him for his temerity in forming a coalition with Jorg Haider's far-right Freedom Party. Nor did Mr Schussel seem unduly bothered when Mr Haider brought down the same government last year. Nor did he flinch from the brickbats earlier this year when he decided to team up, once again, with the Freedomites--though Mr Haider, tucked away as governor of the southern province of Carinthia, is now less in the national limelight. So it is no surprise that Mr Schussel is determined to ride out the latest storm, caused by his government's plan to revamp Austria's expensive pension system. This time, though, it is less certain that he will manage to keep his cool.
Just about everybody, including all the main parties, agrees that pension reform is overdue. Some 15% of GDP is gobbled up by public pensions. Worldwide, only Italy is as profligate. Few Austrians work full-time beyond 60. But as they live longer, the pay-as-you-go system is becoming unaffordable. If nothing is done, in 20 years almost half of gross wages will be needed to keep the system afloat, says Bernd Marin of the European Centre for Social Welfare Policy and Research in Vienna.
The last two attempts to reform the system were too timid. In 1997, a Social Democratic-led government, with Mr Schussel's conservative People's Party as a junior partner, ended up boosting pensions rather than cutting them. Three years ago Mr Schussel, in coalition with Mr Haider's Freedom Party, raised the retirement age by 18 months, to 61.5 years for men and 56.5 years for women--and was vilified by opposition parties and trade unions for his supposed callousness.
This time, Mr Schussel has decided to take a much more daring plunge. A few weeks after reviving his fragile coalition with the Freedomites, he presented a proposal to cut the benefits of new pensioners by 13.5% next year and to impose heavy penalties on people retiring early. Those now in their 30s could lose as much as 50% by the time they retire in the 2030s. 
An angry reaction by Social Democrats and trade unions was expected but Mr Schussel is facing revolt within his coalition too. The social-affairs minister, Herbert Haupt, who formally leads the Freedom Party, is one of the authors of the reform. But when Mr Haider blasted the government from his Carinthian redoubt and called for a referendum on pensions, Mr Haupt followed suit and disavowed his own work. Voices of dissent, even in Mr Schussel's own party, are getting louder.
The proposals were plainly written in a hurry. For example, the government decided to extend the earnings period used as the basis for calculating pensions from 15 to 40 years. Fine, but they forgot to adjust earnings from decades ago for inflation. So some people may actually get far less out of the system than they paid into it. The main losers will be women who worked only part-time during their child-raising years.
One reason for the plan's sloppy design is the government's desire to reduce its own subsidies to the pensions system, which stand this year at euro7 billion ($7.5 billion). It needs to make savings as early as next year if it is to carry out its promised tax cuts of euro3 billion without breaking the deficit limit decreed by the euro zone's stability and growth pact. 
Moreover, the government has been politically insensitive by deciding to touch only pensions for those in the private sector but not the even more generous public-employee ones, which are drawn by some of the People's Party's most loyal voters. The plan also spares all those who are already retired and, worst of all, MPs and government members who in earlier years earned the right to retire at full pay with multiple pensions.
The uproar over these privileges may damage the government's plans more than the sniping from the opposition parties, which have so far failed to present any plausible alternative. If Mr Schussel really wants to stay on course, he may have to sacrifice some of his own pension.

THE annual average number of days lost per Austrian worker as a result of strikes used to be measured, not actually in days, but in seconds. That was thanks to the country's vaunted ""social partnership"", a corporatist arrangement set up after the second world war whereby trade union officials, business leaders and government ministers cut back-room deals on wages, work conditions and most social and economic legislation. For half a century, it worked. This week, on May 6th, the country was brought to a halt by a rare country-wide strike. Is the old system falling apart?
The strike, organised by the main trade-union group, the GB, stymied public transport and closed schools and dozens of the country's biggest companies, in protest against the government's plans to overhaul Austria's pension system. The unions say they will continue various strikes until the coalition of Chancellor Wolfgang Schussel's People's Party and the far-right Freedom Party withdraws its controversial proposals.
Mr Schussel is unlikely to budge--and the union leaders probably know it. Most Austrians feel edgy about the government's pension proposals, which would reduce pensions under the current pay-as-you-go system for future retirees by a good 10% (and by 30% in some cases). Most of them support the strikes. But they would probably change their minds if the unions' activities were to start disrupting ordinary people's lives on a wider scale and if the economy began to suffer badly as a result. Austrians certainly don't tolerate strikes in the way many Italians and French people do. So Mr Schussel will sit tight. Unless the Freedom Party's former leader, Jorg Haider, a maverick populist, launches another revolt within his party, parliament will probably pass the pension bill next month.
The union leaders see strikes as the only way to reassure their angry members that the unions still care--and matter. But they could risk playing into Mr Schussel's hands. For he is determined to end Austria's system of consensus politics, which he thinks is preventing the country from meeting the challenges of globalisation and from succeeding in an ever-more-competitive world market.
His first blow against the old culture of compromise came three-and-a-half years ago when he took his party out of the ""grand coalition"" led by the Social Democrats and struck a controversial bargain with Mr Haider's Freedomites. A new coalition of the unadulterated right pushed Austria's traditional social partners--the trade-union association, the left-wing chamber of labour and the conservative business chamber--to the sidelines, while letting them draft some bills, including one that obliged companies to set up private pension schemes.
But in this latest spat, over state pensions, Mr Schussel has decided to snub not only the trade unions but also the business chamber and its president, who leads a powerful faction in Mr Schussel's own party. The chancellor, it seems, looks to Margaret Thatcher for his inspiration. If he can cut the unions down to size, he intends to liberalise further, among other things by loosening Austria's restrictive shopping hours and by weakening labour-market protection.
If that means a prolonged punch-up with the still powerful unions, some businessmen fear that investors may be scared off. Until now, social partnership and the pragmatism of unions and bosses have helped make Austria rich. Much depends on whether Mr Schussel's more abrasive approach continues to be backed in his own party, most of whose members probably still prefer the old system of Gemutlichkeit (cosy joviality) to the bone-cracking of a Thatcherite revolution.

ON JUNE 3rd, France was virtually closed by yet another nationwide strike. The government's plan to reform the country's pension system is being opposed by massed ranks of workers on the streets. Their colourful banners and shouted slogans have dominated the local media for over a month, rising to a crescendo this week in advance of the parliamentary debate on the plan, scheduled to begin on June 10th. The last time organised labour took on the government over this issue (in 1995) the government backed down. This time it appears to have more resolve. The prime minister, Jean-Pierre Raffarin, has said that he does not intend to yield on the issue: it is, he has said, ""about the survival of the republic"".
It is not just in France, though, that trade unions have been flexing their muscles of late. Demonstrations of organised labour on the move have been widespread. 
* In Germany, the unions have been battling against their government's efforts to raise pensioners' contributions to their health-care schemes. Thousands marched in a series of rallies on May 24th to protest. This week, workers in eastern Germany were on the march again, this time to protest at the length of their working week.
* Even normally placid Austria was gripped by widespread strikes on June 3rd, following equally crippling stoppages on May 6th. This week's were said to be the largest industrial protest in the country since the second world war. Co-ordinated by the national federation of Austrian unions, they drew more than a million people on to the streets to protest (as in France) against planned pension reforms. Wolfgang Schussel, Austria's chancellor, attacked the unions for launching a ""disproportionate"" strike and said that parliament would not be swayed. 
* On May 21st, India suffered a general strike as workers protested against plans to privatise state-owned assets and reform labour laws. A huge march brought Calcutta to a standstill.
* In Britain, firemen have been on partial strike for months, demanding a huge pay increase while bitterly resisting changes to their working conditions. Tony Blair's Labour government has watched with some alarm as a series of elections has put militant leaders into the top jobs at some of the biggest unions. In April, Kevin Curran, a former welder, succeeded the more moderate John Edmonds as leader of the GMB, Britain's fourth-largest union, and in May, Tony Woodley, a left-winger, defeated a candidate favoured by the Labour Party for the leadership of the powerful T&G union.
* In America, powerful unions have been holding back efforts to restructure ailing industries. In April, American Airlines narrowly avoided bankruptcy after it reached last-minute deals with unions representing pilots, flight attendants and ground staff. However, the USWA, the traditionally obstructive steelworkers' union, changed its attitude last September when it agreed to more flexible, less generous employment contracts and put its weight behind consolidation of the industry. On May 19th, it duly signalled its approval of a takeover by US Steel of rival National Steel, securing pension rights for its members in the process.
Strikingly deceptive
Europe at least appears to have entered a new period of labour militancy. But appearances can be deceptive. In Prague last week, members of the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) met for their four-yearly assembly to discuss their agenda for the future. (The ETUC brings together 78 national trade-union confederations with roughly 60m members.) The occasion was much more muted than recent events might have suggested. Cross-border wage-bargaining initiatives and minimum working standards featured more prominently than did industrial protest.
For the reality is that the past few years have been tough for the labour movement. In Britain, Germany and the Netherlands, the unions lost one-third of their members before they began offering carrots such as discount holidays and cheap insurance in order to regain them. In America, membership levels are considerably lower than in Europe: the proportion of workers who are union members is around 14%, compared with 21% in Japan and an average of 43% in Europe (see chart). The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), America's labour confederation, has struggled in recent years to replace its ageing membership. 
But events in France show that small or declining membership is not necessarily the same thing as declining influence. Private-sector union membership in France is even smaller than the 13% figure for the country overall. But this belies the extent of union power, which is cemented not by mass membership but rather by the unions' formal role in the welfare system--via the mutuelles, organisations for delivering health and unemployment insurance.
Moreover, militancy itself is not easy to interpret--militant unions are not necessarily strong ones. A measure of protest, such as days lost to strikes, can be misleading. Rising industrial action may signal the failure of an existing social consensus--and corresponding union weakness--rather than a resurgence of union strength. By contrast, America's remarkably low strike activity (in 2001, the days lost to strikes were at a record low) is undoubtedly a sign of its unions' weakness across a widening band of the industrial spectrum. 
Rent by economics
""With a few exceptions, trade unionism has been on the back foot,"" says John Monks, a former head of Britain's Trades Union Congress (TUC) who last week was elected head of the ETUC. Some go further. Jeremy Waddington, an academic at UMIST in Manchester, England, argues that unionism is in crisis following the decline of a (largely European) model for its activity and organisation that emerged after 1945 and remained relatively stable until the late 1970s.
Several factors destabilised the model. In particular, the Thatcher government in Britain succeeded in reining in the power of unions that had previously held the country to ransom. New labour laws introduced strike ballots by secret vote rather than by a show of hands and made it much easier for companies to sack striking workers. In America, Ronald Reagan took on the country's 13,000 stroppy air-traffic controllers in 1981, sacking all those who refused to return to work and later decertifying their union.
Persistently high unemployment in Europe in the early 1990s was also important, as jobless workers gave up memberships they could no longer afford. The changing nature of work--with many more part-timers and the end of lifelong employment as a norm--also played an important role in challenging the traditional rationale for unions. Mr Monks points to the success of America's economy in the late 1990s as another big influence on declining union membership. With employers bending over backwards to find good workers, who needed union support? The unions, it would seem, were damned in good times and damned in bad. 
As the American economy boomed, so other countries sought to emulate its success. There was a wave of deregulation and privatisation, and the cult of shareholder value--a trend in which unions were kept very much in the background. The rise of market-led economics combined with low inflation to limit their room for manoeuvre. Mr Monks also cites the anti-union influence of business schools, calling them ""bible colleges for the American way"". 
The changing nature of the economy in big industrial nations has also played a more subtle role in undermining unions. Waves of cost-cutting and efficiency exercises have made private-sector companies leaner. Manufacturing jobs have been lost to developing countries with lower labour costs, leading to the end of the era of big factories in the West. ""When there were 5,000 workers on one site, it was relatively cheap per member for a union to service them,"" says Stephen Pursey, an analyst with the International Labour Organization (ILO) in Geneva. Plants with only 500 workers are much more expensive to serve. Some companies--such as Merloni, an Italian white-goods manufacturer--kept their plants small for this very reason.
The public sector has attempted, less successfully, to become leaner, and unions have responded in order to protect their members there. The recent wave of strikes across Europe has been largely related to pension reform and the protection of social benefits for public-sector workers. Less obvious, but no less potent, have been the struggles behind the scenes as governments have tried to improve public-sector performance. Union negotiators have fought a largely losing battle to preserve these workers' entrenched rights, while often recognising in private that something has to give. 
Political persuasions
Their relations with government have also inevitably had a big effect on the unions. In America, trade unions have always been seen as affiliated to the Democratic Party, a useful alignment during the Clinton presidency, but one which has been disastrous since. John Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO, publicly backed Al Gore against George Bush in the 2000 election. Not surprisingly, Mr Bush feels little compulsion to return his calls today. 
Nevertheless, the unions retain considerable power in Congress, and a few have been courted by the Bush administration. But these have been in politically sensitive sectors--such as steel and oil--where there are jobs (and votes) to protect.
In some parts of the world, unions continue to play an important political role. In Brazil, for example, Lula da Silva, a former metalworker and shop steward, became president in January. His rise to power was the culmination of an indigenous union movement that for decades had campaigned for economic reforms.
In other countries, notably Italy, the unions have defied predictions that they would be marginalised. In 1991, CGIL, the biggest of three big union groups, adroitly abandoned its traditional goal of class struggle, adopting instead bargaining demands that were thought to be reasonable within the constraints of a capitalist economy, and seeking ""co-determination"" rather than confrontation. That set the tone for a decade or so of constructive engagement with the nation's politicians, a time when CGIL became a model of open communication with its members.
Flexible friends
The debate about what services a union should provide to its members in the 21st century is an ongoing one. Some have experimented and offered financial services, such as cheap mortgages and credit cards. Others believe the future lies in providing legal services, with union dues becoming more like insurance premiums for protection against problems at work.
Many unions have become far more pragmatic than they have dared to admit in public. In Germany, for example, big companies face daunting labour regulations that make it difficult to compete against more flexible foreign competitors. It is against the law to operate 24-hour shifts, or for Saturday to be treated as a normal working day. In public, IG Metall, Germany's biggest industrial union, is usually recalcitrant on these issues, refusing to discuss ways round the problem with company managers. Companies have, however, found their own solutions by negotiating directly with their works councils, essentially committees of worker representatives. Although they are union members, the representatives operate at the local level and can do things that it would be impossible for a national union to do without losing face. 
Siemens, a giant engineering group, has negotiated more than 100 different deals on working hours in its German factories, deals that technically have broken the law but have been responsible for keeping thousands of jobs inside the country. A few years ago, the group's big medical-equipment division was in danger of having to abandon its historic centre in Erlangen, a loss that would have devastated the local economy. But a deal on flexible working time was agreed with the works council, and Erlangen now boasts modern high-tech Siemens factories that make medical scanners and good profits.
There are other examples of union pragmatism that defy the general conception of their inflexibility. John Evans, the general secretary of the Trade Union Advisory Committee (TUAC), a consultative body to the OECD, points to a group of countries where three-way deals between unions, government and employers have had a big impact, not just on economic performance but also on union participation. These countries include the Netherlands and the Nordic region, where a willingness by unions to take part in public dialogue about restructuring social safety nets has led to a resurgence of interest in union membership. 
Also in this group of countries is Ireland. In the late 1980s, Ireland introduced a wide-ranging social pact, which included acceptance by the unions of wage restraint. Lucio Baccaro and Marco Simoni, the authors of a recent study commissioned by the ILO, found that Ireland's rolling three-year social agreements ""altered the process of wage formation"" and had an important side-effect in allowing big foreign companies to create highly competitive (but non-unionised) operations in the country.
Mr Pursey of the ILO suggests that social partnership can be an effective tool of economic management, particularly for smaller countries operating in the euro area. Facing budgetary constraints and unable to devalue their currencies, such countries can use co-ordinated national-level wage bargaining to keep claims in a narrow band and minimise differences between the public and private sectors. 
Global brothers
Mr Monks says that there are plenty of other opportunities for organised labour to exploit. For example, it is slowly becoming aware that it has a largely untapped source of influence. Of the $17 trillion in worldwide pension and mutual funds, around $12 trillion either has direct union participation or employee involvement at the trustee level, says Mr Evans. Through the activism of funds such as TIAA-CREF, an American teacher's fund, unions have begun to realise that they can have a bigger voice in the broadening debate about corporate governance. The AFL-CIO, for example, has been very active in this year's shareholder revolt against executive pay.
There is also scope for more imaginative recruitment. The AFL-CIO has had some success in reaching America's growing Latino population. But women and minorities remain generally under-represented everywhere; few unions have made them central to their cause. The gender pay gap, for instance, has barely narrowed in recent years and remains high--20%, on average--across Europe.
Perhaps the biggest opportunity, though, is for the unions to find a new international model to replace the plethora of misogynistic national organisations that continue to run the show today. ""Many big companies are global and have a mindset to match,"" says Mr Monks. ""Unions have to understand this and adapt their approach accordingly."" 
There are signs of the beginning of an international approach to union organisation. ETUC has scored some successes in Europe, including framework agreements defining minimum rights for workers and, more notably, the introduction of a directive on European works councils. There has been less progress towards a Europe-wide, collective-bargaining regime, mainly because there are internal tensions between national confederations and industry or sector federations. 
Ironically, help is coming from a number of big companies. Mr Evans says that a few of the world's biggest firms are actively trying to polish their haloes by showing they meet or exceed guidelines on working practices--a sort of labour equivalent of environmental standards. Last year, for example, Volkswagen signed a global agreement with the International Metalworkers' Federation that set out the ground rules for how it operates worldwide. These include the recognition of workers' rights to join a union, and a commitment to proper pay and conditions. TUAC has had enquiries from dozens of big companies about such agreements.
In the end, the future of trade unions rests largely in their own hands. A few pioneers, notably in the Netherlands, have shown that a willingness to address their own organisational weaknesses (and an acceptance that some social reforms are inevitable) can translate into a much greater degree of influence. The noisy, colourful demonstrations of recent weeks attract media attention and raise the unions' profile. But they are not symptomatic of what influential unions do today, nor of what they want to do tomorrow.

These countries include the Netherlands and the Nordic region, where a willingness by unions to take part in public dialogue about restructuring social safety nets has led to a resurgence of interest in union membership. 
Also in this group of countries is Ireland. In the late 1980s, Ireland introduced a wide-ranging social pact, which included acceptance by the unions of wage restraint. Lucio Baccaro and Marco Simoni, the authors of a recent study commissioned by the ILO, found that Ireland's rolling three-year social agreements ""altered the process of wage formation"" and had an important side-effect in allowing big foreign companies to create highly competitive (but non-unionised) operations in the country.
Mr Pursey of the ILO suggests that social partnership can be an effective tool of economic management, particularly for smaller countries operating in the euro area. Facing budgetary constraints and unable to devalue their currencies, such countries can use co-ordinated national-level wage bargaining to keep claims in a narrow band and minimise differences between the public and private sectors. 
Global brothers
Mr Monks says that there are plenty of other opportunities for organised labour to exploit. For example, it is slowly becoming aware that it has a largely untapped source of influence. Of the $17 trillion in worldwide pension and mutual funds, around $12 trillion either has direct union participation or employee involvement at the trustee level, says Mr Evans. Through the activism of funds such as TIAA-CREF, an American teacher's fund, unions have begun to realise that they can have a bigger voice in the broadening debate about corporate governance. The AFL-CIO, for example, has been very active in this year's shareholder revolt against executive pay.
There is also scope for more imaginative recruitment. The AFL-CIO has had some success in reaching America's growing Latino population. But women and minorities remain generally under-represented everywhere; few unions have made them central to their cause. The gender pay gap, for instance, has barely narrowed in recent years and remains high--20%, on average--across Europe.
Perhaps the biggest opportunity, though, is for the unions to find a new international model to replace the plethora of misogynistic national organisations that continue to run the show today. ""Many big companies are global and have a mindset to match,"" says Mr Monks. ""Unions have to understand this and adapt their approach accordingly."" 
There are signs of the beginning of an international approach to union organisation. ETUC has scored some successes in Europe, including framework agreements defining minimum rights for workers and, more notably, the introduction of a directive on European works councils. There has been less progress towards a Europe-wide, collective-bargaining regime, mainly because there are internal tensions between national confederations and industry or sector federations. 
Ironically, help is coming from a number of big companies. Mr Evans says that a few of the world's biggest firms are actively trying to polish their haloes by showing they meet or exceed guidelines on working practices--a sort of labour equivalent of environmental standards. Last year, for example, Volkswagen signed a global agreement with the International Metalworkers' Federation that set out the ground rules for how it operates worldwide. These include the recognition of workers' rights to join a union, and a commitment to proper pay and conditions. TUAC has had enquiries from dozens of big companies about such agreements.
In the end, the future of trade unions rests largely in their own hands. A few pioneers, notably in the Netherlands, have shown that a willingness to address their own organisational weaknesses (and an acceptance that some social reforms are inevitable) can translate into a much greater degree of influence. The noisy, colourful demonstrations of recent weeks attract media attention and raise the unions' profile. But they are not symptomatic of what influential unions do today, nor of what they want to do tomorrow.

The Middle Eastern road map crashed into huge road blocks. A suicide bomber blew up a bus full of people in Jerusalem, killing 16. In a series of strikes, Israel killed at least 14 people in Gaza, including five Hamas men. The day before, Israel had tried to assassinate Abdel-Aziz Rantisi, Hamas's top political leader. He escaped, but Hamas vowed revenge. Earlier, militants had killed five Israeli soldiers. 
After intense fighting between rebel forces and Charles Taylor's regime in the suburbs of Monrovia, Liberia's capital, the two sides agreed to a ceasefire, paving the way for peace talks in neighbouring Ghana to resume. Foreign nationals were evacuated from Monrovia by French military helicopters. 
An attempted coup against Mauritania's president, Maaouya Sid Ahmed Ould Taya, was put down after heavy fighting in the centre of Nouakchott, the capital. The president recently cracked down on suspected Islamists; the rebels are said to be dissident members of the army.
French soldiers started to arrive in Bunia, the capital of a region in north-eastern Congo that has been torn by savage tribal fighting. The French will provide most of the troops for a 1,400-strong peacemaking force with a weak mandate.

In Peru, over 70 workers employed at the Camisea natural-gas project were kidnapped, apparently by the Shining Path, a formerly powerful Maoist terrorist group. They were later released. It was not clear whether a ransom was paid.
In an extraordinary session of Venezuela's National Assembly held in a park, legislators loyal to President Hugo Chvez approved rule changes to prevent the opposition blocking bills. But they were unable to ratify the changes at a full session.

North Korea continued its nuclear ""diplomacy"", saying it needed nuclear weapons to counter America's ""hostile policy"", but also to cut its armed forces and put more cash into its economy. Colin Powell, America's secretary of state, repeated that a peaceful solution was being sought to the North's nuclear problem. Australia said it was working with Japan and America to stop the North exporting drugs and missile parts.

IN ONE of the troughs into which his career has periodically fallen, Austria's far-right populist, Jorg Haider, once crisply announced his definitive retirement from politics with the words: ""I'm gone already"". As usual Mr Haider was back in the limelight within weeks. Now, once again, after stirring things up in Austria on and off for two decades, he seems poised for a comeback. 
For a start, he looks keen to get back his old job as formal leader of the Freedom Party, which he relinquished in February 2000 thanks to the international outcry over his party's inclusion in a ruling coalition. This would make life very tricky for the chancellor, Wolfgang Schussel. It could even destroy the present coalition government, as the chancellor's conservative Austrian People's Party relies on the Freedomites as its junior partner.
In fact, Mr Haider never left politics for good. He stayed on as governor of the southern province of Carinthia, from where he went on meddling in national and party politics. Last summer, he managed to topple his pragmatic successor, Susanne Riess-Passer, who, as vice-chancellor, had co-operated well with Mr Schussel. But the resulting turmoil in the Freedom Party hurt it badly in last autumn's general election, when it plummeted to 10% in the poll from 27% in 1999. Mr Haider withdrew again to his alpine retreat. 
What's his latest gambit?
This time, the party leader Mr Haider wants to replace is his old friend Herbert Haupt, a veterinarian who used to do his bidding. Mr Haider thinks Mr Haupt gave way too easily to Mr Schussel in recent wrangling over the reform of Austria's expensive pay-as-you-go pension system which was finally shoved through parliament on June 11th. Each time Mr Haupt, who is social-affairs minister as well as vice-chancellor, accepted the latest draft, the populist Mr Haider, speaking on behalf of the ""little man"", demanded further changes that threatened to bring the government down.
As a result, Mr Haider and his allies in the Freedom Party's group in parliament had the reform watered down. Future retirees have been spared losses of up to 40% of what their pensions would previously have been worth, as the first drafts had proposed; the maximum loss was capped at 10%, at least for those now aged over 35. The government also had to promise to abolish the separate, more generous, pension system for public employees, many of whom habitually vote for Mr Schussel's party but are now particularly cross. 
Mr Schussel's party is not at all keen on Mr Haider's return as the Freedom Party's leader--and is dead against having him in the government itself. Mr Schussel says he can work with Mr Haupt and his awkward colleagues but not with the troublesome Mr Haider. If he does return to power of a kind at the national level, the European Union's 14 other governments are unlikely to isolate Austria diplomatically, as they did--to little avail--before, but many Austrians fear it would cost their country a lot of prestige and influence. 
Most people at the top of the Freedom Party still want Mr Haupt to stay in charge. They fear that if the impetuous Mr Haider comes back the coalition will collapse and they will lose their jobs and perks. Even Mr Haider's sister, Ursula Haubner, who is doing quite well as a junior minister for social affairs, wants him to stay away. At 53, Mr Haider may have stopped dreaming of becoming chancellor; he is no longer the party's undisputed vote-catcher. But he is still unbeatable at making mischief.","Can Jorg Haider return to national politics without the government 's fall ?

THESE days, in most of the world's rich countries, if the government tried to sell its stake in a flourishing steel group through a public share offer, few people would bat an eyelid. Not in Austria. The proposed flotation of one-third of Voestalpine later this month for an estimated euro450m-plus ($494m) has sparked a furore. Accusations are flying. It is an unpatriotic sell-out to foreigners, cry many. The market, say others, is being manipulated. Wolfgang Schussel's right-wing coalition government has been rattled.
Voestalpine is not an ordinary company. Founded by the Nazis after the ANSCHLUSS (Union) with Germany in 1938 as the Hermann-Goring-Werke in Linz, the steel mill became the flagship of Austria's state-owned industry and was long a fief of trade unions and the Socialist Party. After a brush with bankruptcy, a partial privatisation in the mid-1990s and diversification into car parts and rail systems, it became one of Europe's most profitable steel groups and the pride of Linz and the surrounding province of Upper Austria. 
So the political leaders of Upper Austria were not amused when they found out that the finance minister, Karl-Heinz Grasser, had been having secret talks with Magna International, a Canadian car-parts group, about a possible takeover and break-up of Voestalpine. Mr Grasser once worked for Magna, whose flamboyant Austrian-born chairman, Frank Stronach, has made big inroads in recent years into Austrian industry, politics and even football. After a public outcry, Mr Grasser, who used to belong to the coalition's junior partner, the ultra-nationalist Freedom Party once led by Jorg Haider, had to promise that Voestalpine would not be taken over by foreigners and would definitely not be split up. He suggested a private sale to selected investors--but the European Commission in Brussels said no. 
So Mr Grasser and his boss, Mr Schussel, instead proposed a public share offer--with a corporatist flavour. Instead of organising road shows to solicit the highest bids from international fund managers, the state holding group IAG gave a few weeks' notice and began to assemble a bunch of friendly investors who already own around 30% of Voestalpine. Its leader is Ludwig Scharinger, a big banker close to Mr Schussel's People's Party. Assured of his support, Mr Schussel declared that Voestalpine would stay in the control not only of Austrians but of Upper Austrians. 
Other bankers then cried foul. A meeting at the stock exchange with the main people involved was cancelled. Political support for the deal began to crumble. Freedom Party people still inveigh against foreign threats and demand that further privatisation be stopped. 
Mr Grasser refused. But the rumpus may have scared foreign investors away. Mr Schussel, who talks fondly of open borders and free markets, now sounds happy to accept a much lower price for Voestalpine to keep it in familiar hands. That, it seems, is what Austrian voters want.","Austrians are still reluctant free - marketeers

FOR over a year, commentators have predicted the electoral demise of Jorg Haider. On March 7th, the far-right Austrian proved them wrong with a spectacular win in his stronghold of Carinthia, where he has been governor since 1999. Mr Haider's Freedom Party won 42.5% of the vote, more than five years ago, and well ahead of the Social Democrats. The Social Democrats made gains mostly from the People's Party, whose vote fell by almost half to 11.6%.
The People's Party had promised not to vote for Mr Haider as governor. But it may change its tune, to keep him busy in Carinthia rather than risk his return to Vienna. There, he would make life harder for Chancellor Wolfgang Schussel's coalition, in which the Freedom Party is a junior partner.
The vote in Carinthia was a reversal from the general election in November 2002, when the People's Party won largely by winning over Freedom Party voters upset by Mr Haider's ouster of the party leadership, which undid the coalition. The Freedom Party's vote tumbled from 27% to 10%, and Mr Haider pledged to withdraw from national politics. But he continued to meddle from his Carinthian base. Will he now seek further revenge on Mr Schussel?
The chancellor certainly looks vulnerable. Besides Carinthia, the People's Party lost the governorship of Salzburg, which it had held since 1945, to the Social Democrats. Mr Schussel's finance minister, Karl-Heinz Grasser, who bolted from the Freedom Party in 2002, is under pressure over a dodgy donation for his website. As voters feel cuts in social spending, Mr Schussel may lose more support. Yet Mr Haider's options are limited. If he rattles the coalition too much, he will hurt his own party, which has few other talents and little voter appeal outside Carinthia. It lost heavily in Salzburg, and it faces a struggle in the European parliamentary elections in June. If he were now to bring down the government again, his party might be wiped out at the national level.
Yet the Social Democrats fear a head-on confrontation between Mr Schussel, a formidable campaigner, and their clever but colourless leader, Alfred Gusenbauer. Their hope is that Mr Schussel might take over from Romano Prodi as president of the European Commission later this year. But Mr Schussel may prefer to stay on, fending off Mr Haider's eruptions and calculating that, by 2006, an economic upswing may arrive in time to re-elect his coalition.","The maverick Austrian bounces back

IT IS a horse-race in which the declared runners carry such heavy handicaps that it is hard to see any of them winning. The conditions are perfect for an outsider to come up on the inside rail. With only a month to go before European Union leaders are due to pick a new president of the European Commission, to serve for the next five years, the field is almost disconcertingly wide open.
The job is critical in European politics. The commission has the sole right to propose EU laws, which now account for half of all new legislation in the 25-member block. It is the guardian of existing EU rules. It initiates actions against members for such offences as illegal state aid, running excessive budget deficits or having filthy beaches. And it is meant to identify the ""general European interest"". The commission president can thus combine the roles of a visionary, a deal-maker and a disciplinarian.
The difficulty in finding a candidate to take over from Italy's Romano Prodi stems from some onerous and arbitrary requirements. In theory EU leaders can choose anybody they like. In practice a new president must meet a series of conditions. It is widely held that the president should come from the ranks of prime ministers or former prime ministers. That the most successful recent president, Jacques Delors, failed this test, and that such former prime ministers as Jacques Santer of Luxembourg and Mr Prodi have been notably unsuccessful, have not dented leaders' prejudice in favour of one of their own.
The demands of the European Parliament complicate matters. It insists that any selection must reflect the results of the European elections in mid-June. Formally, the parliament cannot veto the choice, but a parliamentary rejection would be awkward. The centre-right seems likely, but not certain, to emerge as the biggest single parliamentary block, which points towards selecting a centre-right candidate. Because Mr Prodi comes from a big, southern country, the new president would best hail from a smaller, northern European country. And to assuage France's sensitivity about the growing dominance of English, a commission president who speaks little or no French is probably out.
Finding a candidate who ticks all these boxes is hard (see our table below). One possibility is Jean-Claude Juncker, a centre-right prime minister from Luxembourg, indubitably a small country. But there is a feeling that it would be faintly ridiculous to appoint a third commission president from Luxembourg, when Germany, Britain and France have held the post only once each. The British also suspect that Mr Juncker would be in the pocket of the Franco-German alliance. His appearance at last year's ""chocolate"" summit, when France, Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg proposed deeper EU defence co-operation heightens such suspicions. But other centre-right candidates--Wolfgang Schussel from Austria and Jean-Luc Dehaene of Belgium, for example--have been floated without gaining much support.
Faced with such an uninspiring field, European leaders might have to abandon some of their criteria. Could the parliament be persuaded to accept a strong candidate from outside the dominant political group? Or perhaps leaders should go for somebody who has never been a prime minister--such as a member of the current commission?
Guy Verhofstadt, the Belgian prime minister, has emerged as a new favourite in the past week or two. He is a member of Europe's liberal group, which could pose a problem with the parliament, but he is liked by the French and Germans. Unfortunately, he also organised the chocolate summit and is seen as a dyed-in-the-wool federalist--making him even more suspect to Britain than is Mr Juncker.
This points to a wider problem. Any candidate pushed by France is automatically suspect in Britain, and vice-versa. To match British wariness of Mr Juncker and Mr Verhofstadt, the French are hostile to candidates floated by Britain, including two current commissioners, Antonio Vitorino and Chris Patten (the latter pushed also by Valery Giscard d'Estaing, a former French president), and the European Parliament's Pat Cox. There is a good German candidate who might be acceptable in both Paris and London: Gunter Verheugen, who has been a highly successful enlargement commissioner. But he has no backing from the Germans, who have their eyes on the job of vice-president of the commission in charge of economic reform. 
Some reckon that, as Ireland holds the rotating EU presidency, an Irish candidate could yet emerge. The Irish have an advantage in that they are native English-speakers without being British. Some suggest that Bertie Ahern, the Irish prime minister, who is leading the search, is secretly angling for the job himself. This week Mr Ahern issued a fairly convincing denial. That leaves Mr Cox, who speaks good French and has impeccable EU credentials. He is a liberal, though the parliament might accept one of its own. But one French official sniffs that he is ""too lightweight"".
Sooner or later somebody will have to emerge as front-runner. This time round, no single country can veto a candidate (as Britain did in 1994), because under the Nice treaty the choice is one for a majority vote. The British are increasingly fretful that, in the absence of plausible alternatives, they may end up with Mr Verhofstadt. ""You can't beat somebody with nobody,"" muses one British high-up.
The broader question is whether the paucity of the field says something about the job. Two weak presidents in a row have seriously diminished the credibility of the commission and its boss. The next president will have a tough job managing a commission that has now swelled to 25 members and also has a growing credibility problem with big countries like France and Germany. Yet it would be a mistake to write off the commission. Its position is well-entrenched. For better or worse, its next president will still wield great power in the EU.","Our form-guide for the race to be next European Commission president

""IT'S quite a good job, so they tell me, I'm sure we can find somebody to take it,"" joked Bertie Ahern, the Irish prime minister, after last week's European Union summit had failed to agree on a new president of the European Commission. Mr Ahern and the other 24 EU leaders were perhaps lucky that they had managed to strike a deal on the new constitution. For that allowed them to gloss over a huge, acrimonious and inconclusive row about who should have the Union's most senior job. The argument over the commission presidency was not only unseemly. It also showed that, despite the hard-won consensus over the constitution, bitter rivalries still plague the EU.
The main quarrel took place over dinner in Brussels on June 17th, with the presidential ambitions of Guy Verhofstadt, the Belgian prime minister, colliding with those of Chris Patten, a British European commissioner. It quickly degenerated into a power struggle between a Franco-German camp and a rival group led by Britain and Italy. Mr Verhofstadt's claims were pushed fiercely by Jacques Chirac, the French president, and Gerhard Schroder, the German chancellor. Mr Chirac has been increasingly dismayed by the inability of the Franco-German duo to continue getting its way in an enlarged EU of 25 countries. Instead of reconsidering his tactics, his reaction has been to push even harder. As it became clear that Mr Verhofstadt did not have the votes, the French president became more and more indignant, accusing smaller countries who were sitting on the fence of moral cowardice, and threatening the Italians with a serious deterioration in bilateral relations. Mr Schroder was also cross, reminding other leaders that Germany remains the biggest contributor to the EU budget. This flexing of Franco-German muscle only stiffened the others' resistance. 
The spectre of Iraq also had a seat at the dining table. France, Germany and Belgium were all in the anti-war camp; Britain, Italy, Poland and Portugal, all of whom opposed Mr Verhofstadt, supported the war. But although the Belgian prime minister could not garner enough votes, neither could Mr Patten, despite the endorsement of the dominant centre-right political group in the European Parliament. Mr Chirac made it clear that he could not accept a British candidate. His ostensible reason is that Britain is a member of neither Europe's single currency nor the Schengen border-free zone, both of which are run by the commission. But his deep resentment of the British role in rallying opposition to Franco-German dominance was also crucial.
Sorting out this mess will test the much-praised diplomatic powers of Mr Ahern. The Irish say that they would like an agreement before the end of the month, when the Dutch take over the EU presidency. If agreement is in sight, a special summit will be called. Yet finding a name remains fiendishly hard. Anyone acceptable to France is instantly suspect in Britain, and vice versa. A further complication is added by the insistence of the new European Parliament, which convenes on July 20th, that it must approve the new president. This probably rules out otherwise plausible Socialists, such as Antonio Vitorino, the Portuguese commissioner, or Javier Solana, the EU's foreign-policy chief. 
The names still in the hat do not inspire. There is Jean-Claude Juncker, prime minister of Luxembourg, whom many shrewd observers have long assumed would ultimately emerge as an inoffensive compromise. He is on the centre-right and is respected by his colleagues. The British are wary of his closeness to France and Germany, but see him as more of a conciliator than Mr Verhofstadt. However, Mr Juncker has just been re-elected as prime minister of the Grand Duchy, and has promised his voters that he would not move swiftly on to Brussels. Against all expectations, he seems likely to keep his word.
Other centre-right names being floated include those of the prime ministers of Portugal, Denmark and Austria, and the French foreign minister. Jose Duro Barroso of Portugal has an interesting political biography: once a Maoist student leader, he is now a staunch economic liberal and Atlanticist. But his support for the Iraq war may have been too fervent for the French to stomach. Anders Fogh Rasmussen of Denmark falls foul of the Franco-German reluctance to accept a president from a country that has not adopted the euro; Wolfgang Schussel, the Austrian chancellor, is mistrusted for having once formed a coalition with the far-right. Michel Barnier, the French foreign minister, has a courteous and amiable style that makes a pleasant contrast with Mr Chirac's. But he is derided even by senior French officials as an intellectual lightweight (one particularly haughty one labels Mr Barnier le cretin des Alpes, a reference to the fact that he made his reputation organising the winter Olympics in 1992). He might also fall victim to the poisonous state of Franco-British relations.
The luck of the Irish
That leaves a plethora of Irish candidates. Pat Cox, outgoing president of the European Parliament, has not won support. A new name in the ring is Peter Sutherland, a perennial previous candidate who was once EU competition commissioner and first boss of the World Trade Organisation. But he has been out of Brussels for a long time, and his chairmanship of two archetypal Anglo-Saxon capitalist groups, BP and Goldman Sachs (albeit only in Europe), could make him a hard sell in France and Germany.
If Mr Ahern looks in the mirror, the answer stares him in the face. The Irish prime minister comes from the centre-right and has burnished his reputation during the Irish presidency. The French might hesitate about a candidate who does not speak their language and is close to Mr Blair, but they recognise that at least Mr Ahern has dealt fairly with them. Bertie, as he is always known, seems genuinely reluctant to swap Dublin for Brussels. But he might find it hard to resist a concerted effort to draft him. Chairing the meeting that ends in his being dragged to the EU's top job might be a fitting end to an eventful presidency.","An increasingly desperate search for a European Commission boss

But he has been out of Brussels for a long time, and his chairmanship of two archetypal Anglo-Saxon capitalist groups, BP and Goldman Sachs (albeit only in Europe), could make him a hard sell in France and Germany.
If Mr Ahern looks in the mirror, the answer stares him in the face. The Irish prime minister comes from the centre-right and has burnished his reputation during the Irish presidency. The French might hesitate about a candidate who does not speak their language and is close to Mr Blair, but they recognise that at least Mr Ahern has dealt fairly with them. Bertie, as he is always known, seems genuinely reluctant to swap Dublin for Brussels. But he might find it hard to resist a concerted effort to draft him.

KARL-HEINZ GRASSER, Austria's finance minister, is an admirer of Friedrich Hayek, the Austrian-born free-market economist who inspired Margaret Thatcher. But he has recently found himself defending state-controlled national champions--and thus sitting rather closer to his French counterpart, Nicolas Sarkozy, than to the iron lady. 
In an echo of Mr Sarkozy's action earlier this year, when he saw off a bid by Germany's engineering giant, Siemens, for parts of France's Alstom group, Mr Grasser this week rebuffed Siemens for taking an interest in VA Technologie, a smaller Austrian firm. He even authorised the state holding group, IAG, to take up its share of a planned VA Tech capital increase, to maintain its stake at 15%. Siemens had not even made a formal bid. But its announcement of interest in parts of VA Tech last week caused a furore in Austria, where any sale of industrial assets to foreigners tends to be a hot political issue.
Last month, Wolfgang Schussel, the chancellor, forced Mr Grasser to walk away from a deal to sell the state's 42% stake in Telekom Austria to Switzerland's Swisscom, for about euro3.2 billion ($3.9 billion). The finance ministry also shelved plans to sell a quarter of the state-owned postal service to Germany's Deutsche Post. Mr Schussel does not want to take any chances after last year's storm over the sale of Voestalpine, a steelmaker, almost led his coalition partner, the far-right Freedom Party, to leave the government. Soon afterwards, Mr Schussel's centre-right People's Party did badly in regional elections. 
Sensing the prevailing public mood, Jorg Haider, the driving force in the Freedom Party, has joined trade unions, opposition Social Democrats and most of the country's opinion-makers to defend the remaining ""national champions"" against foreigners. Conveniently his tactics are embarrassing Mr Grasser, a former Haider protege who defected to Mr Schussel's side two years ago. 
All this leaves privatisation, nominally a government priority, in tatters. There is not enough domestic capital to produce ""hard-core"" shareholders for all companies. Selling shares only on the tiny Vienna bourse would mean low prices, which would be bad for the budget and still leave privatised companies vulnerable to unwanted takeover bids. The state may be stuck with its shareholdings for years to come--and with Brussels competition authorities watching for hints of illegal state aids.","Defending Wolfgang Schussel's Austrian - born free - market economist who inspired Margaret Thatcher .

YOU might be forgiven for assuming that, when European Union leaders meet in Brussels next week, they will have little to say on the main item on their agenda: Turkey's bid to join the EU. The European Commission has recommended the opening of membership talks next year, and most EU leaders are in favour. Yet discussion could still be acrimonious.
The first issue will be when to start the talks. The Turks want a date early in 2005. What they will probably get is a promise of a start some time in the second half of 2005. The reason is that the French referendum on the EU constitution could be in May, and the government is desperate to avoid Turkey clouding the debate. A second argument will be whether to accede to those who want to state explicitly that talks may not end in membership, but instead in a ""privileged partnership"". The betting is that no such reference will appear in the summit's conclusions.
Turko-sceptics may be thrown other bones, including a ""trigger mechanism"" providing that negotiations can be suspended if Turkish human-rights reforms go into reverse. There will be debate too about whether to suggest that membership might include permanent exceptions from normal EU laws, especially on free movement of people. Yet the subject of permanent derogations is also unlikely to feature in the conclusions.
Lurking behind these questions is the fear that Cyprus, a new EU member, could sabotage the whole deal. The official position of the (Greek-Cypriot) government is that unless Turkey recognises it, it might veto the opening of talks. But the Cypriot government, already in bad odour because it encouraged the Greek-Cypriot rejection of the UN's unification plan in April, will come under huge pressure not to cast its veto now.
Other new members are largely favourable to Turkey. Poland has misgivings, but is now keener as a way of promoting the admissibility of Ukraine. Poles also remember that throughout the 19th century the Ottoman empire refused to recognise their country's elimination. At diplomatic functions, the sultan would repeatedly query, ""Where is the Polish ambassador?"" 
Of the rest, Britain, Scandinavia, Italy and the Iberian duo are essentially on Turkey's side. The main nervousness is to be found in France, Germany, Austria and the Netherlands. In France, President Jacques Chirac's enthusiasm for Turkish entry is out of tune with his people and his party. He has long argued that Turkey has ""a European vocation"", and yet polls show some 75% of the French against Turkish entry. France's ruling UMP party is against, as is Nicolas Sarkozy, its freshly elected boss. 
The main French objection is that Turkey is big, poor and, above all, Muslim. The French fear not only Turkish workers, but also a louder voice for Islam. France already has Europe's biggest Muslim population, and it is finding it hard to reconcile its model of integration, which relies on a strict separation of religion and state, with demands by French Muslims for religious expression within public institutions. If France has trouble accommodating a big Muslim population, some ask, how can Europe manage a whole country?
The other French objection concerns the changing nature of Europe. The creation of ever-closer union was once a clear Franco-German project. But the EU is becoming a looser entity, with limited political ambition, where English prevails over French. Some see Turkey's admission as a final confirmation of this trend. Mr Chirac has given some ground, promising a referendum on Turkish entry in 10-15 years' time. In his recent visit to Germany, he also hinted at a ""third way"": although affirming that ""Germany and France share the same objective: to bring Turkey into the European Union"", he also spoke of creating ""a sufficiently strong link"" with Turkey, short of full membership, if the talks failed. 
In Germany, Turkish entry into the EU is even more sensitive than elsewhere. Yet apart from the occasional populist outburst, the debate has so far been surprisingly rational--and almost as many Germans are for full Turkish membership as are against it. One might have expected Chancellor Gerhard Schroder and, even more so, his foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, to be hesitant. But the threat of international terrorism has changed their tune. ""If we succeed in integrating an Islamic country, this would tremendously increase our security,"" says Mr Schroder, adding that it would be inconceivable for the EU to shut the door after having made promises to Turkey for more than 40 years.
Yet the opposition Christian Democrats (CDU) argue that, even if Turkey is ready for full membership, the EU is not, either culturally or politically. ""A Europe with Turkey won't be a Europe of deep integration,"" Angela Merkel, the CDU leader, told her party's annual congress this week. Ms Merkel is the strongest exponent of the notion of a ""privileged partnership"", and she is still hoping to get a reference to it inserted into the summit's conclusions, by pushing a fellow-conservative, Wolfgang Schussel, Austria's chancellor, to back it. His government supports the opening of negotiations with Turkey, but much of domestic opinion in Austria is hostile. 
It is not lost on Germany's politicians that Germans with Turkish roots are a growing constituency, and one in which the governing Social Democrats are said to have a two-thirds majority. Even Ms Merkel is not insensitive: were she to become chancellor in 2006, she would not jump off the train after the negotiations have begun. But she cannot always resist populist temptations: for a few days in October, she toyed with the idea of organising a petition against full EU membership for Turkey. And the debate in Germany on Turkey's eventual membership could still turn ugly in future. Indeed, it is likely to flare up every time a decision on Turkey has to be taken in Brussels, particularly if it coincides with one of the endless number of electoral campaigns in Germany.
Presiding over next week's summit will be the Dutch prime minister, Jan Peter Balkenende. His task will be the more delicate as opinion in his country, never too keen on Turkish entry, has turned strongly against, largely as a result of the turmoil over Islam that followed the murder of Theo Van Gogh last month. Mr Balkenende's party, the Christian Democrats, is divided; so is its Liberal (VVD) coalition partner. The outgoing Dutch European commissioner and former VVD leader, Frits Bolkestein, once said that Turkish accession might mean that the repulsion of Ottoman forces from the gates of Vienna in 1683 had been in vain. Yet the Dutch EU presidency is still likely to end by sponsoring the opening of membership talks with Turkey, for all that.","Despite doubts and grumbles around Europe , next week 's EU summit will say yes to the opening of membership talks with Turkey

JRG HAIDER exploded on to the European political scene five years ago when his far-right Freedom Party joined the Austrian government. The coalition led by Wolfgang Schussel, a moderate conservative, suffered the embarrassment of a diplomatic freeze by Austria's European Union partners, as well as upheavals caused by Mr Haider's erratic style. Now the government faces what may be an even more trying time. For the erratic Mr Haider has decided to dump his nationalist creed, desert his party and start another that steers clear of any recognisable ideology.
The Alliance for Austria's Future, as the new party is called, has adopted the colour orange from Ukraine's revolution. At its launch this week, Mr Haider managed to combine pro-European and anti-globalisation rhetoric. The man who once praised Hitler's employment policies now defines his credo merely as being ""young, handsome and cool"".
Mr Haider had long been facing growing unrest from the Freedom Party's nationalist wing, as supporters blamed him for a string of electoral defeats and urged a return to his old populism. Being part of a moderate government has cost the party support: its backing peaked at 27% in 1999 but was down to no more than 9% by the start of this year. Mr Haider, now governor of Carinthia, seems more interested in the perks of power than in his old xenophobic message. He has toned down his anti-immigration rhetoric and even supports Turkey's entry into the EU.
By taking all Freedom Party ministers and most of his 18 parliamentary deputies with him into the new Alliance, Mr Haider can also keep Mr Schussel in power. But most grass-roots activists are sticking with the old party. And the new one has not, so far, played well with the public. If elections were held now, the Social Democrats and Greens would probably win a majority; both the new Alliance and the old Freedom Party might fall short of the 4% threshold for parliamentary representation.
Mr Schussel's hope is that he can hold his coalition together until the first half of 2006, when Austria holds the EU presidency, and use his formidable campaigning skills in the general election due later that year to keep his People's Party just ahead of the Social Democrats.

IN ONE ancient fable, a frog falls into a pail of milk. Unable to scramble out, the creature thrashes around, seemingly drowning. Eventually, however, his frantic struggles churn the milk into butter--and he hops away. Some European Union leaders seem to see themselves as this frog. They suffered a huge defeat over the EU constitution, but they think that, if at first they did not succeed, they should just try, try again.
That, at any rate, may explain attempts to resurrect a constitution that only six months ago seemed to have been killed by French and Dutch voters. Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that ""this constitution has so many positive elements that we must not abandon it."" Both her spokesman and the leader of her party in the European Parliament say that reviving the constitution will be Germany's top priority when it takes the EU's rotating presidency in the first half of 2007. If it fails, says Portugal's president, Jose Socrates, Portugal will take up the task in the second half.
Perhaps integrationists will get their wish even sooner. Wolfgang Schussel, Austria's chancellor, is in charge of the EU just now, and he insists that the constitution is not dead. In theory, the EU is in the midst of a year-long ""pause for reflection"", which its leaders decreed after the French and Dutch referendums. But why wait? The Austrians are talking of working out by the middle of 2006 how to take the constitution forward. Yet this drift towards reviving a dead text has as much plausibility as the Danube suddenly turning blue. All 25 EU members must ratify the constitution before it can come into force--and that seems an impossibly remote prospect.
It might have been possible to wiggle out of the unanimity requirement, or to insist on a second referendum, if the refusenik were a single small country, or an awkward cuss, such as Britain. But France and the Netherlands, both founder members, cannot be either sidelined or wished away. Their present leaders could not possibly risk the voters' wrath by trying to pass in parliament a charter that had been rejected by the people. No serious politician in either country has been foolhardy enough to call for a new referendum.
Besides, the French and Dutch are not isolated. Britain would be likely to reject the constitution if it were put to the vote. So might Sweden or Denmark, and perhaps one or more of the central Europeans. Thus, quite apart from the little question of respecting the will of the people when they have spoken, demands to resurrect the constitution run up against the practical problem that half a dozen countries cannot now ratify it.
Why are people falling over themselves to promote something that cannot succeed? Perhaps the politicians think they can change voters' minds. They did so after 1992, when Denmark rejected the Maastricht treaty, and again after 2001, when Ireland rejected the Nice one. The politicians may even be right this time, too: the voters may change their minds--one day. But at present support for the EU is falling, suggesting that the constitution may be even less popular than it was.
Perhaps some of the politicians calling for a revival of the constitution are simply trying to burnish their European credentials. Ms Merkel might be calculating that a bit of windy Euro-talk is an easy way to establish herself as the true and only heir to the Europhile Helmut Kohl. Or perhaps, to be more generous, European leaders genuinely believe that the EU is unworkable without the institutional reforms in the constitution, such as the new voting rules, a separate foreign minister and the abolition of the musical-chairs presidency. In this, too, they may be right. But even if they are, the politicians are going a funny way about getting matters changed, since sticking with the whole constitution and nothing but the constitution will make it even harder to rescue any of its useful bits. It would surely be easier to try to carve up the corpse for the organs, rather than to try to jolt the whole thing lumberingly back to life.
The fact is that this is one of those moments when the EU's integrationist impulse is overriding both democracy and natural caution. The budget crisis is over and there is no other displacement activity (except perhaps energy security). The pretence of a pause for reflection has been largely abandoned. The text of the constitution also encourages ratification to continue despite the French and Dutch rejections. Fourteen countries have now ratified it, setting up the possibility, envisaged in a declaration annexed to the treaty, of a showdown with the few that have not.
The perpetual-motion machine
Indeed, Europe's integrationist drive is so strong that it keeps popping out. Guy Verhofstadt, prime minister of Belgium, has written a book, ""The United States of Europe"", that argues for closer co-operation (including political co-operation) among the 12 euro-zone countries. Such demands for integration are so strong that something is likely to come of them, though whether it is co-operation within the euro zone, sovereignty-sharing arrangements under the existing treaties, or cherry-picked bits of the constitution is hard to say.
But to go back to the constitution as if nothing had happened--or to argue that what happened was so long ago that nobody should worry about it--seems a dangerous strategy. It risks precipitating a huge split between the countries that want the constitution and those that do not, as well as alienating long-suffering voters everywhere.
Before they go down this road, Europe's leaders might ponder another fable, this one by Aesop. The frogs are living happily in a pond, until they decide they need a proper king (and constitution). They ask Jove for one. First he sends a log, but they get bored by such a passive ruler. Then he sends an eel, but it proves too easygoing. So the frogs demand another ruler, and an infuriated Jove sends them a heron--who eats them all.","What part of "" no "" do European integrationists not understand ? Every part , apparently

 The fact is that this is one of those moments when the EU 's integrationist impulse is overriding both democracy and natural caution . The budget crisis is over and there is no other displacement activity ( except perhaps energy security ) . The pretence of a pause for reflection has been largely abandoned . The text of the constitution also encourages ratification to continue despite the French and Dutch rejections . Fourteen countries have now ratified it , setting up the possibility , envisaged in a declaration annexed to the treaty , of a showdown with the few that have not . 
 The perpetual - motion machine 
 Indeed , Europe 's integrationist drive is so strong that it keeps popping out . Guy Verhofstadt , prime minister of Belgium , has written a book , "" The United States of Europe "" , that argues for closer co - operation ( including political co - operation ) among the 12 euro - zone countries . Such demands for integration are so strong that something is likely to come of them , though whether it is co - operation within the euro zone , sovereignty - sharing arrangements under the existing treaties , or cherry - picked bits of the constitution is hard to say . 
 But to go back to the constitution as if nothing had happened -- or to argue that what happened was so long ago that nobody should worry about it -- seems a dangerous strategy . It risks precipitating a huge split between the countries that want the constitution and those that do not , as well as alienating long - suffering voters everywhere . 
 Before they go down this road , Europe 's leaders might ponder another fable , this one by Aesop . The frogs are living happily in a pond , until they decide they need a proper king ( and constitution ) . They ask Jove for one . First he sends a log , but they get bored by such a passive ruler . Then he sends an eel , but it proves too easygoing . So the frogs demand another ruler , and an infuriated Jove sends them a heron -- who eats them all .",305,Austria,A29-4513,IN TERM,True,"Wolfgang Schussel , Austria 's chancellor ,",2,True

BANK runs are rare in rich countries, but they still happen. This week Austrian financial institutions and the government stepped in with a euro1.35 billion ($1.7 billion) package to stem a run on deposits at BAWAG, the country's fourth-biggest bank, which is owned by the GB, the trade-union federation.
BAWAG was caught last October when it gave a euro350m top-up loan to Refco, an American futures broker, hours before it went bust. When BAWAG tried to get its money back, other angry creditors filed a counterclaim for $1.3 billion, alleging that bank officials had been complicit in the fraud surrounding Refco's downfall. On April 25th an American judge initially froze BAWAG's American assets but then decided that the bank could post a $1.1 billion surety. The bank then agreed to pay $675m in a settlement with Refco's creditors.
Then came the run on BAWAG's deposits. The government put up a guarantee of euro900m and the banks and two insurers injected euro450m of capital into the wounded bank.
The episode provides more evidence that trade-union federations and big business are a dangerous cocktail. The GB had already had trouble in the 1990s with Konsum, a retail chain. In Germany the BGAG, the unions' investment vehicle, has also had its share of woe. Late last year, it rid itself of a troubled mortgage bank, AHBR.
The GB has pledged to sell BAWAG as soon as possible. Refco is not the only recent blot on its copybook. In the late 1980s BAWAG's then chief executive, Walter Flottl, began to invest the bank's money in an American derivatives business run by his son, Wolfgang. After Mr Flottl senior retired, his successor, Helmut Elsner, revived the business but ran up undeclared losses of around euro1 billion. A cover-up via Caribbean subsidiaries, successful until only a few weeks ago, was provided by the GB, which used its strike funds to plug the gap. Mr Elsner and Mr Flottl junior are under investigation.
The Austrian government will hope that its guarantee will not have to be called on, and that its mere involvement will be enough to repair confidence in BAWAG. Ministers are doing their bit, personally: Wolfgang Schussel, the chancellor, and other members of the cabinet conspicuously opened accounts in the troubled bank on May 2nd.

IN THE absence of a new European Union constitution, justice and law enforcement have emerged as the areas in which the impetus towards more integration is strongest. This might seem odd given that, by and large, the criminal law falls largely outside the union's competence. Yet only a week ago, EU members approved a ""European evidence warrant"", requiring police in one country to execute search warrants issued in another. And at next week's EU summit, the president of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, will ask for more powers to fight cross-border crime, such as drug-trafficking, fraud and terrorism.
He may not get them. But by pushing matters of crime and justice up the priority list, Mr Barroso is venturing into some of the thorniest territory in the union, on which feelings about national sovereignty, legal and police traditions and popular opinion all conflict and intertwine. Is he justified in seeking more powers? And even if he is, is it wise to do so?
The argument for what Mr Barroso calls ""more Europe"" begins by noting that crime increasingly crosses borders. The EU set up Eurojust in 2002 to help prosecutors co-operate in dealing with the worst cross-border crimes; its workload has since tripled. The public seems to want action: almost two-thirds of respondents to polls say that the union should do more to fight crime. Even more want greater EU efforts to deal with international terrorism and illegal migration. What might be called the deterministic approach to European affairs also holds that justice and security should be the EU's next frontier. The union has created a single market and (partially) swept away internal border controls in most member states. But there are some 27 different legal systems, some based on the Napoleonic civil code and others on Anglo-Saxon common law. This makes catching and trying crooks, who can move freely around Europe, harder.
Nobody is about to swap their national legal system for a brand new EU one. All are willing to recognise each other's legal proceedings in serious cases. But in between a host of practical problems arise in deciding which rules and standards are mutually acceptable. Hence the question: how do you resolve disputes when countries have different degrees of trust in judges, prosecutors and policemen?
At the moment, the answer is, by unanimous agreement. Everyone must agree which rules and standards to accept. And national governments then enforce (or ignore) those agreements.
Those who want ""more Europe"" argue that such co-operation is unnecessarily arduous and inefficient. The evidence warrant, for example, took four years to negotiate and is even now riddled with exceptions (Germany does not have to obey it in certain areas). By contrast, on the rare occasions when countries manage to negotiate something quickly, it works. The European arrest warrant was agreed in a rush, in the aftermath of September 11th 2001. It has cut the average extradition time from one EU country to another from nine months to 43 days.
This, the argument goes on, shows why it is worth changing the voting rules to make co-operation in criminal matters easier. Let it be done, suggests Mr Barroso, by ""qualified-majority"" vote, as with single-market matters. And let the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament set minimum judicial standards. If the politicians do not agree to this, the European Court of Justice may even force it on them. Last year, the court ruled that governments must implement EU criminal-justice agreements even when they contradict national law. It also ruled that the EU could set minimum penalties for breaches of national environmental laws.
Yet it is not for nothing that criminal justice remains primarily national. Law is essential to national sovereignty and even identity. Arguments about logic and efficiency are beside the point. Legal systems are not supposed to be efficient. They are designed to ensure that innocent people are not found guilty. If that requires inefficiencies, so be it. Anyway, legal co-operation in Europe is not that inefficient: the arrest and evidence warrants were both approved, albeit in diluted form. 
When nationalism strikes back
Nor is it clear that legal decisions by majority vote would necessarily stick. As it is, the highest courts of several countries, including Germany's and Poland's, have struck down the European arrest warrant as unconstitutional (some constitutions require countries to try their own citizens, rather than extradite them under an EU law). Ways are being found around the courts' objections, but this suggests that EU involvement in criminal justice may have gone almost as far as it can.
As for the argument that the European Court of Justice may ""federalise"" national legal systems, that is possible but not certain. Last week, the court leant the other way, striking down an EU deal on sharing airline-passenger data, on the ground that law enforcement cannot be decided using single-market rules. 
In any event, the claim that public opinion will support ""more Europe"" in this area is untested. Asked if they want the EU to do more in almost any area of public concern, people will tend to say yes. Asked if they want, say, their homes searched at the behest of a foreign judge, they will say no. Opinion polls are of little use when the precise phrasing of a question is this sensitive. But it is striking that European politicians who are, in other respects, far from Eurosceptic, such as Austria's Wolfgang Schussel, have been worrying aloud that the court may be usurping the powers of democratically elected politicians. 
Critics of the ""top-down"" constitution often say that ""ever closer union"" should happen only organically, in response to genuine Europe-wide concerns. Legal co-operation seems to be a possible example. But making national legal practice subject to majority vote still seems unnecessary, and it could provoke yet another backlash against the whole project.","Should there be ""more Europe"" in the provision of law and order?

THE European Union: tougher and less absorbent than ever! It sounds like communist-era toilet paper. But that is roughly the slogan that the EU is now adopting. Its latest intellectual fad is the notion of ""absorption capacity"": a label for its supposed (in)ability to take in new members. The European Commission gave the idea its imprimatur last November. At their recent summit, Europe's heads of governments instructed the commission to draw up a report on how much absorption capacity there is. After all, the club cannot go on taking in new candidates without any regard to public opinion or their impact on current members. Yet this sudden burst of interest in such a vague idea is worrying. Not only has nobody sought to define the concept, but it could prove misleading, dishonest and damaging.
The term first cropped up in 1993, at a time when former communist countries from central Europe were clamouring at the doors. A summit in Copenhagen laid down the terms of entry for these and other would-be members: the so-called Copenhagen criteria. Among other things, these decreed that ""membership requires that the candidate country has achieved stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights"". But along with the criteria was a further declaration: that ""the union's capacity to absorb new members...is also an important consideration in the general interest of both the union and the candidate countries."" 
The distinction between a formal ""criterion"" and a mere ""consideration"" sounds abstruse and semantic, but in practice it has been vital to the EU's recent expansion. If applicant countries meet the Copenhagen criteria, they are admitted. It is their readiness that matters; the union's capacity to absorb them is secondary, as befits a mere consideration. 
Ostensibly, this has not changed. The summit's president, Austria's Wolfgang Schussel, confirmed that absorption capacity had not been upgraded. The president of the commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, spelled this out further. ""This is not a new criterion--I repeat, not a new criterion.""
Maybe, yet absorption capacity now seems far more important than it did. The big EU expansion of May 2004 and the start of membership talks with Turkey last October have provoked a backlash against enlargement. France and Austria have both said that they will put Turkey's entry to a referendum. In commissioning a report on absorption capacity, the summit gave the game away: it instructed the commission to ""cover the issue of present and future perception of enlargement by citizens."" In other words, the question is no longer only, are new members ready; it is also are old ones prepared? Absorption capacity is an attempt to measure the old members' readiness.
In a narrow, technical sense, this may simply mean thinking through the consequences of enlargement, which seems sensible enough. For example, every member now has a commissioner, but the current treaty says that, once the EU has more than 25 members, there must be fewer than one commissioner per country. Bulgaria and Romania will become the 26th and 27th members in 2007 or 2008. Further enlargement will also have a budgetary impact. Most of the EU's money goes to farmers or to poor areas--and Turkey (for one) has plenty of both. 
Manifestly, popular concerns over enlargement must be mollified if enlargement is to be a success. Surprisingly, some of those who have been doing this most are German and Austrian Christian Democrats, who have long worried about further expansion, especially to Turkey. But what is disturbing about absorption capacity is the way in which the idea is now being applied. Consider the context. Three months before the summit, EU foreign ministers meeting in Salzburg backpedalled from a 2003 promise that Balkan countries would become members when they were ready, just as other countries from central and eastern Europe had done. Only days before the summit, negotiations with Turkey were on the brink of collapse after a spat between Turkey and Cyprus. In these circumstances, absorption capacity has become a buzz phrase for those who really want to stop the whole process of expansion dead.
Misleading economics
Yet the term is fundamentally misleading when applied to an organisation such as the EU. It originates in development economics, and it refers to a country's ability to use external assistance effectively. Countries genuinely do absorb foreign aid. Their ability to do so can be measured and, to some extent, predicted. That gives the term a gloss of scientific objectivity that, in the context of the EU, is completely bogus. For, as Carl Bildt, a former Swedish prime minister, points out, the EU does not ""absorb"" members. It simply adds them. The EU has not absorbed Britain or France (perish the thought). The capacity to absorb other countries should not be a new requirement for it. 
Moreover, argues Frank Vibert of the European Policy Forum in London, absorption capacity is intellectually dishonest. It implies that there are principles at stake in enlargement that can be described and measured impartially. In reality, there are individual applicants--Turkey, say, or Croatia--that pose particular problems of their own, most of them political in nature. And there are institutional questions, such as how commissioners should be chosen or how to weight members' votes. But these do not need a grand intellectual framework for debate.
Indeed, talk of absorption capacity misunderstands the nature of the EU. It is not a club with a fixed lump of benefits that get used up when it adds new members. It is more like a network in which the benefits of membership increase as more members join. To debate and define absorption capacity is, strictly, to beg the question: ie, to assume the answer that you are pretending to look for. It could easily become a way of stopping enlargement--perhaps the EU's greatest single achievement--altogether.","Europe's latest big idea is stupid and dangerous

Surprising the pundits, voters punished the chancellor, Wolfgang Schussel, for ruling from the right for six years. His People's Party shed eight points, to only 34%, less than the Social Democratic Party, which held broadly steady at 36%. The Social Democratic leader, Alfred Gusenbauer, had attacked Mr Schussel's ""cold-hearted"" policies and promised more warmth and social spending.
Yet Mr Schussel's real undoing was the revival of the far right. In 2000 he triggered world protests by deserting the coalition with the Social Democrats and joining forces with Jorg Haider's xenophobic Freedom Party, which had raised its vote to a spectacular 27%. At first Mr Schussel's gamble paid off. The Freedom Party was racked by strife, saw its popular support collapse and split when Mr Haider formed a new group that remained part of Mr Schussel's government. But last week Mr Haider's Alliance for Austria's Future got barely over 4%, whereas the Freedom Party, running on an anti-Islamic and anti-immigration platform, got 11%. Together, they robbed the People's Party of the votes it needed to stay in first place.
The far right's success limits the options for a future government. A coalition with the Freedom Party is unacceptable to Mr Schussel. One between the Social Democrats and the Greens would fall just short of a majority. That leaves only a grand coalition between the Social Democrats and the People's Party, with Mr Gusenbauer as chancellor and Mr Schussel retiring.
Mr Gusenbauer might slow privatisation and boost education spending. He wants to scrap the purchase of Eurofighter jets. But he will not interfere with Austria's flexible labour market or its recent corporate-tax cut. The Social Democrats favour tough immigration controls and are as wary of Turkey's European aspirations as the People's Party. 
Unlike their German counterparts, the big parties in Austria have often worked together on reforms. They may shake up the federal structure, in which nine small provinces all have governments and parliaments. Yet the big beneficiary of a grand coalition could be the far right, which can appeal to unease over immigration and globalisation, plus the whiff of corruption that often swirls round broad-based governments. Austrians may like political cosiness, but it can be too much of a good thing.

The Freedom Party was racked by strife , saw its popular support collapse and split when Mr Haider formed a new group that remained part of Wolfgang Schussel's government . But last week Mr Haider 's Alliance for Austria 's Future got barely over 4 % , whereas the Freedom Party , running on an anti - Islamic and anti - immigration platform , got 11 % . Together , they robbed the People 's Party of the votes it needed to stay in first place . 
 The far right 's success limits the options for a future government . A coalition with the Freedom Party is unacceptable to Wolfgang Schussel . One between the Social Democrats and the Greens would fall just short of a majority . That leaves only a grand coalition between the Social Democrats and the People 's Party , with Mr Gusenbauer as chancellor and Wolfgang Schussel retiring . 
 Mr Gusenbauer might slow privatisation and boost education spending . He wants to scrap the purchase of Eurofighter jets . But he will not interfere with Austria 's flexible labour market or its recent corporate - tax cut . The Social Democrats favour tough immigration controls and are as wary of Turkey 's European aspirations as the People 's Party . 
 Unlike their German counterparts , the big parties in Austria have often worked together on reforms . They may shake up the federal structure , in which nine small provinces all have governments and parliaments . Yet the big beneficiary of a grand coalition could be the far right , which can appeal to unease over immigration and globalisation , plus the whiff of corruption that often swirls round broad - based governments . Austrians may like political cosiness , but it can be too much of a good thing .

ANOTHER 300 American aircraft; another $4 billion of the taxpayers' money; an imminent summons to perhaps thousands of air-force and army reservists. ""We must stay the course,"" says President Clinton, ""and persist until we prevail."" Fine words, but many Americans, recalling George Washington's strictures against foreign entanglements, are wondering what they may actually mean. So, too, the American Congress. Does the bombing of Serbian targets, now in its fourth week, go on until there are no more missiles left to fire; or will American ground troops, despite Mr Clinton's disavowals, eventually be placed ""in harm's way"" in the Balkans? 
If those are questions the president prefers to leave unanswered, he nonetheless recognises the danger of keeping the politicians on Capitol Hill in ignorance. Serbia may not be Vietnam, but the administration, acutely sensitive to allegations of ""mission creep"", knows that the last thing it needs as the 2ooo elections approach is a nation divided by a foreign war. Last week, therefore, a bipartisan delegation from both Senate and House accompanied the defence secretary, William Cohen, across the Atlantic to talk to NATO commanders, chat with American troops and assess the Balkans' humanitarian needs. This week, when Congress returned from its spring break, the president first conferred with senior members of both parties and then, on April 13th, gave a two-and-a-half-hour brief ing to some 58 members of Congress. 
So far, so reasonably good. Even those most critical of the president's handling of the Kosovo issue will rally round the flag and support the air campaign for some time yet. But what if the bombing goes on for ""weeks and months"", as Senator Joe Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat, believes it may? As Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Texas Republican, put it after Tuesday's briefing: ""All of us will support the money we need to do this job but] I think there are still many questions about where we go from here."" 
The biggest question is clearly the issue of ground troops. Pat Buchanan, a Republican presidential candidate who is both more articulate and more isolationist than most, relentlessly argues that America has no business interfering in a far-off country, especially when-as he sees it-there is no vital American interest at stake. 
At the other end of the spectrum one of his rivals for the Republican nomination, Senator John McCain of Arizona, said this week that NATO has to start ""fighting this war as if it were a war with huge stakes involved, instead of some strange interlude between peace initiatives . . . We should commence today to mobilise infantry and armoured divisions for a ground war in Kosovo."" For her part, Mrs Hutchison sits on a quasi-patriotic fence by saying that what is needed is not a campaign on behalf of Kosovo's Albanians but a plan for the Balkans as a whole. Kentucky's Senator Mitch McConnell proposes a somewhat different fudge to delay the sending of ground troops: the shipment of American arms to the Kosovo Liberation Army. 
Meanwhile, the idea grows that the president's refusal to countenance ground troops is not as absolute as it first appeared. Witness Mr Lieberman's analysis, after meeting the president, that Mr Clinton ""does not favour the use of ground forces but he did say that that option should not be taken off the table-and it is very important for Mr Milosevic to know that we will exclude no action that is necessary to help us achieve victory."" 
But the sending of soldiers involves other issues, too. One is money. In the past week, General Wesley Clark, NATo's American supreme commander, has asked for 382 more American aircraft to join the 500 or so he already has. No wonder that this week the administration, which apparently reckons the air campaign is costing anything between $7om and $100m a day, told Congress it would need perhaps $4 billion to wage the war through to September. 
How to find the money? Senator John Warner, the Virginia Republican who sits on the Armed Services Committee, is adamant that the money should not be at the expense of the increased defence budget sent to Congress by the president on February ist. Most in Congress will doubtless agree: given that America's armed forces are supposed to be able to fight two major wars simultaneously, it hardly makes sense to stretch their resources still further. 
Still, this fiscal year's budget surplus is estimated to be at least $iii billion. The probably inevitable solution is to use the surplus and avoid budgetary constraints by treating the money as emergency spending. But that will not stop some Republican conservatives, who dogmatically insist that the money should be raised from offsetting cuts, arguing that the Pentagon is raiding a surplus which could both ""save"" Social Security and provide a tax cut. 
So much for one difficulty. But the greater problem will be the relationship between the president and Congress. For the moment, Congress's leadership is prepared to give the president both the benefit of the doubt over the war in Serbia and the money with which to fight it. In practice, that means delaying any big debate. 
But can it be delayed if the president decides to send ground troops? Most in Congress think not. Tom Campbell, a Republican congressman from California, is doing his best to have a debate sooner rather than later. His argument is that under Article t of the constitution only Congress has the right to declare war. Equally to the point, the War Powers Act of 1973 (a by-product of the Vietnam era) both requires a president to consult Congress about possible troop deployment and also limits the use of troops to 6o days without specific authorisation by Congress. As Mr Campbell said on Tuesday, ""If Congress does not stand up for its constitutional right to declare war in this instance, there is nothing left to the constitutional requirement"" that Congress and only Congress can declare war. 
Possibly so-and Mr Campbell may well be able to shove his colleagues to a vote by early May. But the facts of history are that no president, from Nixon onwards, has accepted the War Powers Act; that the act's constitutionality has not been ruled on by the Supreme Court; and that Congress has declared war on only five occasions, the last being in 1941. Yet American presidents, each designated as commander-in-chief by Article 2 of the constitution, have put troops into battle on more than 150 occasions, including both the Korean war in the 195os and the Vietnam war in the 1960s. 
In other words, Mr Clinton is running true to presidential tradition. He also has the comfort of a House resolution from before the Kosovo intervention approving of the use of American peacekeepers and of a Senate vote approving air strikes. 
Good enough? So long as ground troops are not involved, certainly so. But the lesson of history is that America wages war best when Americans are solidly behind it. George Bush side-stepped the War Powers Act when he sent troops to the Gulf in 199091, but he made his case both to the nation and to Congress, and Congress responded with a joint resolution approving the use of force against Iraq. President Clinton, the persuader-in-chief, still has work to do.

AFTER three weeks of war between Serbia and the combined forces of the western alliance, both sides are girding themselves for a long and perhaps worsening conflict, while exploring the possibilities for a skin-saving compromise. But there is one important difference between them. Yugoslavia's President Slobodan Milosevic has largely succeeded in his main aim-that of slashing the size of Kosovo's ethnic-Albanian majority. NATO, by contrast, has not yet been able to achieve any of its stated aims, and is therefore calling in heavy reinforcements to swell its air armmada to some 1,100 aircraft. 
In Belgrade, Mr Milosevic's government shows every sign of digging in for a war which might mean facing western ground troops. The mobilisation of reservists is gathering pace. Middle-aged lawyers and taxi drivers are being drafted; whether out of fear or patriotic zeal, few refuse the summons. While links between Serbia and Iraq were initially played up by western governments, to stress Serbia's status as pariah, it is officials in Belgrade who now boast about the tips Iraq has given them, such as burning tyres to confuse laserguided missiles. Although the number of civilians killed by NATO-which may have exceeded 150-is small compared with the ocean of Kosovar blood that Serbian forces have shed, NATO'S mistakes (including an attack on a train which killed lo Serb civilians and on a convoy that may have included Kosovar refugees as well as Serb soldiers) have been grist to Mr Milosevic's propaganda mill. 
Plans are being drawn up in Belgrade to issue ration cards for food. Oil supplies have been cut by NATO attacks on depots and refineries, but the Serbs of Bosnia are busy smuggling fuel to their motherland. Despite more than 6,000 NATO sorties, Serb forces remain in control of Kosovo. 
Mr Milosevic has proved his ability to wrong-foot western governments and tie down their troops, by switching on and off like a tap the flow of refugees to neighbouring countries. By April 13th, some 460,000 Kosovars had been forced out of the province since the bombing began, while at least 260,000 had been displaced within the province. The separatist fighters of the Kosovo Liberation Army say more than 1,000 civilians have been killed this week by Serb forces in the mountains near Srbica, in central Kosovo. 
On April 13th, General Wesley Clark, NATO'S supreme commander in Europe,explained why 500 or so aircraft had not been enough either to deter Mr Milosevic from persecuting ethnic Albanians or to destroy his ability to do so. Only seven out of the campaign's 21 days had good enough weather for accurate bombing; on ten days, more than half the strikes were cancelled because of clouds. Serbia's air defences, the initial target of NATO raids, was ""damaged but still operational""-and would quickly recover if NATO bombs stopped. In any case, the air defences were still too strong to allow for an airlift of Kosovo's beleaguered civilians. A few of Serbia's 1,300 tanks have been destroyed from the air, but going after Serbian armour from so prudently high an altitude was a ""difficult and slow"" business that pilots disliked. 
Perhaps the general's most revealing remarks were that ""you cannot stop paramilitary murder on the ground with aeroplanes"" and that NATO'S military aims were not an end in themselves but designed to serve a political purpose. That is, to persuade Mr Milosevic to sue for peace on terms acceptable to the West: a withdrawal of troops from Kosovo, an internationally policed return of refugees, and self-rule for the province. 
There is not, as yet, much sign that this will happen, although some blurring of differences was perceptible in this week's flurry of diplomatic activity. NATO'S opening position is that it must lead and dominate a post-war occupation force in Kosovo, while Serbia (and its Russian friends) insist, for a start, that those who ran the air war would be the least suitable keepers of Kosovo's peace. Madeleine Albright, the American secretary of state, has specified that NATO must form the ""core"" of any international military presence. Vuk Draskovic, the most liberal figure in the Belgrade regime, has suggested that NATO countries (like Greece) which did not take part in bombing would be welcome to oversee reconstruction. While all western governments are vague about Kosovo's political future, Mrs Albright mooted the idea of ""an international protective status"". 
Germany, which currently holds the European Union presidency and is often a favoured interlocutor for Russia, came up with a plan for a peace force led by NATO but mandated by the UN. Floated at a summit meeting of European leaders in Brussels on April 14th, this drew a cool response from America for suggesting a pause in bombing once the Serbs had started withdrawing. Russia, meanwhile, had some ""major problems"" with German ideas about a peace force but liked other bits of the plan. Whatever NATO wants, it still seems a long way from anything that Mr Milosevic or his Russian mentors are prepared to accept. Kofi Annan, the UN secretary-general, has offered to mediate, but seems in no hurry to go to Belgrade. 
An earlier meeting of NATO countries' ministers seemed divorced from reality. They discussed Kosovo as though the war was a minor detail. The real question, they implied, was how precisely to reconstruct the Balkans-once the small matter of beating Milosevic, was out of the way. 
But do western governments really believe they can ""beat Milosevic"" or are they resigned to the strong probability of another awkward compromise? In Belgrade, it has not gone unnoticed that the president's name is missing from the list of generals, policemen and warlords that the West wants to prosecute for war crimes. Suspicious minds wonder why Mr Milosevic's home town of Pozarevac has been left off the list of targets. 
While the popular mood in Belgrade remains defiant, unease beneath the bravado is growing, along with tension between people who genuinely support Mr Milosevic and those who mistrust him but have rallied round in Serbia's hour of need. 
Already, NATO's offensive has provided an opportunity for extremists to settle old scores. Slavko Curuvija, a newspaper editor who was once close to the regime but later distanced himself, was shot dead by two men outside his home on April uth. While he may have been a special case-because of ties to figures in the security apparatus who have recently been purged-the killing has prompted shudders among the handful of people who have refused to rally to Mr Milosevic or to his government. 
Meanwhile, Yugoslavia's president and his brother Borislav, who is its ambassador to Moscow, are counting on more support from allies in the Russian armed forces and the Communist Party. They expect this support to harden, should President Boris Yeltsin die or leave office. Viewed from Belgrade, the Russian leader and his protegessuch as Igor Ivanov, the foreign minister, and an ex-prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, newly named as a Russian point man on the crisis-look disappointingly lukewarm in their support for Serbia. After all, the most Mr Yeltsin has been prepared to do is warn the West of the dangers of a third world war.

1999-04-24,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224067233/fulltext/91DDB12D513D4CB2PQ/46?accountid=14657,"IN FACETIOUS mood a week ago, this column wondered whether Tony Blair had thought through to the bitter end every last detail of NATO'S strategy against Serbia. This week, Bagehot doffs his cap. Whether the strategy was thought through or not, Mr Blair is sticking to it. More: having been one of a dozen NATO leaders implicated in the war's grand design, the prime minister has not just resisted but actively cast aside what must be a powerful temptation to take cover behind collective responsibility. At NATO headquarters in Brussels, on visits to British air crews, and now in Washington, he has shown an almost Thatcherite determination to emphasise the justness of the cause and screw the alliance's courage to the sticking place. Baroness Thatcher is said to have stopped George Bush from going ""wobbly"" in the Gulf; Mr Blair may hope to perform a similar service for Bill Clinton. It may help that the old lady is spurring the prime minister on. This week she knocked away the legs from under William Hague (this is becoming a habit) by arguing for the ground war which the Tory leader had been stoutly telling Mr Blair to resist. 
It is brave of Mr Blair to intensify his advocacy of a war which so many of its other architects are beginning to lose faith in. He is genuinely revolted by the Serbian atrocities in Kosovo. Who could not be? But for a war to be just, it must also be judged capable of achieving its aims. If a war has no hope of succeeding, continuing to prosecute it at calamitous cost not to your own servicemen but to its supposed beneficiaries in Kosovo begins to look less like courage than wanton obstinacy. So the prime minister has a difficulty. He is carrying popular opinion with him. But the more successful he is in persuading Britons of the war's high purpose, the less plausible it becomes to rule out a fight on the ground just because such an enterprise would be hazardous and costly. A British leader who invokes the spirit of 1940 is not expected to flinch from the necessary price in blood, toil, tears and sweat. 
The trouble is that Britain may not be able to pay such a price, even if its people wanted it to. Perhaps (history does not yet record) Baroness Thatcher really did persuade Mr Bush to go to war to rescue Kuwait from Saddam Hussein. But if so, that was the high point of British influence on that conflict. Its actual military contribution to the final battle was small-a single armoured division, plus pinprick raids by commandos (several of whom were captured) and Tornado bombers (a disproportionate number of which were shot down). The same imbalance applies now in the Balkans, notwithstanding last year's strategic defence review, which argued for retaining an ability to project British power overseas. Of 1,000 or so aircraft committed in Kosovo, about 800 are American. Even after reinforcement, there will be only about 8,000 British troops in Macedonia, far too few to play more than a token part in a war against the Yugoslav army. True, Britain is the only American ally to possess cruise missiles. It is reported that one fired by Splendid, its sole cruise-equipped submarine, failed to explode. Its carrier, Invincible, is armed with unwanted anti-shipping helicopters and the wrong sort of Harriers, designed for air superiority rather than ground attack. 
These weaknesses are recited here not in order to argue against intervention in Kosovo, and still less in order to disparage the professionalism of Britain's servicemen, which may well be exemplary. It is all too easy for governments at war to accuse their critics of appeasement, or a want of patriotism. One minister, Clare Short, was at that old game this week when she called 13 Labour backbenchers who had dared to vote against the government line in the House of Commons ""a disgrace to the Labour Party"", who would not have stood up to Hitler. This accusation is itself disgraceful. Naturally, some parliamentary critics of the Kosovo campaign have their recognised eccentricities. A former Tory defence minister, Alan Clark, thinks it an outrage to bomb ""a brave and Christian people who have never injured or even threatened a British citizen."" The judgment of Tony Benn, a former Labour minister, seems fogged by a hatred of America. But most mps who own up to an unease about the war do so for the obvious reasons: that the bombing has failed, and NATO appears to have no other way short of a ground invasion to stop the Serbs from evicting the remaining Kosovars. 
Gradually, the government is abandoning its belief that NATO will not have to fight its way in. But it does not favour a full invasion. Is there a third way? In the House of Commons this week the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, conceded that he could imagine circumstances in which Slobodan Milosevic had not yet admitted defeat but in which his forces were in retreat and unable to put up much of a fight. You can see at once the special appeal to Mr Blair of such an eventuality. If only an unopposed invasion by relatively light forces could do the business. Then Britain could be seen to pull its weight, despite having relatively little military weight to pull. 
This new idea for a lightweight invasion, if that is what it amounts to, smacks dangerously of wishful thinking. Each of the NATO allies has salutary lessons to learn from events in Kosovo so far. Bill Clinton should have learnt that high-tech weapons fired from a safe distance do not scare every adversary into immediate submission. If the attitude of General Norman Schwarzkopf before the Gulf war is any guide, his generals are probably telling him now that a half-hearted invasion of Kosovo with light forces would be a disaster. It may suit Mr Blair, who leads a middle-- sized country with leadership ambitions beyond its military muscle, to argue otherwise. Perhaps he will tell Mr Clinton that European forces can do the ground job alone. Heaven forbid. In war, as the old saw goes, moderation is imbecility. ","IN FACETIOUS mood a week ago, this column wondered whether Tony Blair had thought through to the bitter end every last detail of NATO'S strategy against Serbia. This week, Bagehot doffs his cap. Whether the strategy was thought through or not, Mr Blair is sticking to it. More: having been one of a dozen NATO leaders implicated in the war's grand design, the prime minister has not just resisted but actively cast aside what must be a powerful temptation to take cover behind collective responsibility. At NATO headquarters in Brussels, on visits to British air crews, and now in Washington, he has shown an almost Thatcherite determination to emphasise the justness of the cause and screw the alliance's courage to the sticking place. Baroness Thatcher is said to have stopped George Bush from going ""wobbly"" in the Gulf; Mr Blair may hope to perform a similar service for Bill Clinton. It may help that the old lady is spurring the prime minister on. This week she knocked away the legs from under William Hague (this is becoming a habit) by arguing for the ground war which the Tory leader had been stoutly telling Mr Blair to resist. 
It is brave of Mr Blair to intensify his advocacy of a war which so many of its other architects are beginning to lose faith in. He is genuinely revolted by the Serbian atrocities in Kosovo. Who could not be? But for a war to be just, it must also be judged capable of achieving its aims. If a war has no hope of succeeding, continuing to prosecute it at calamitous cost not to your own servicemen but to its supposed beneficiaries in Kosovo begins to look less like courage than wanton obstinacy. So the prime minister has a difficulty. He is carrying popular opinion with him. But the more successful he is in persuading Britons of the war's high purpose, the less plausible it becomes to rule out a fight on the ground just because such an enterprise would be hazardous and costly. A British leader who invokes the spirit of 1940 is not expected to flinch from the necessary price in blood, toil, tears and sweat. 
The trouble is that Britain may not be able to pay such a price, even if its people wanted it to. Perhaps (history does not yet record) Baroness Thatcher really did persuade Mr Bush to go to war to rescue Kuwait from Saddam Hussein. But if so, that was the high point of British influence on that conflict. Its actual military contribution to the final battle was small-a single armoured division, plus pinprick raids by commandos (several of whom were captured) and Tornado bombers (a disproportionate number of which were shot down). The same imbalance applies now in the Balkans, notwithstanding last year's strategic defence review, which argued for retaining an ability to project British power overseas. Of 1,000 or so aircraft committed in Kosovo, about 800 are American. Even after reinforcement, there will be only about 8,000 British troops in Macedonia, far too few to play more than a token part in a war against the Yugoslav army. True, Britain is the only American ally to possess cruise missiles. It is reported that one fired by Splendid, its sole cruise-equipped submarine, failed to explode. Its carrier, Invincible, is armed with unwanted anti-shipping helicopters and the wrong sort of Harriers, designed for air superiority rather than ground attack. 
These weaknesses are recited here not in order to argue against intervention in Kosovo, and still less in order to disparage the professionalism of Britain's servicemen, which may well be exemplary. It is all too easy for governments at war to accuse their critics of appeasement, or a want of patriotism. One minister, Clare Short, was at that old game this week when she called 13 Labour backbenchers who had dared to vote against the government line in the House of Commons ""a disgrace to the Labour Party"", who would not have stood up to Hitler. This accusation is itself disgraceful. Naturally, some parliamentary critics of the Kosovo campaign have their recognised eccentricities. A former Tory defence minister, Alan Clark, thinks it an outrage to bomb ""a brave and Christian people who have never injured or even threatened a British citizen."" The judgment of Tony Benn, a former Labour minister, seems fogged by a hatred of America. But most mps who own up to an unease about the war do so for the obvious reasons: that the bombing has failed, and NATO appears to have no other way short of a ground invasion to stop the Serbs from evicting the remaining Kosovars. 
Gradually, the government is abandoning its belief that NATO will not have to fight its way in. But it does not favour a full invasion. Is there a third way? In the House of Commons this week the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, conceded that he could imagine circumstances in which Slobodan Milosevic had not yet admitted defeat but in which his forces were in retreat and unable to put up much of a fight. You can see at once the special appeal to Mr Blair of such an eventuality. If only an unopposed invasion by relatively light forces could do the business. Then Britain could be seen to pull its weight, despite having relatively little military weight to pull. 
This new idea for a lightweight invasion, if that is what it amounts to, smacks dangerously of wishful thinking. Each of the NATO allies has salutary lessons to learn from events in Kosovo so far. Bill Clinton should have learnt that high-tech weapons fired from a safe distance do not scare every adversary into immediate submission. If the attitude of General Norman Schwarzkopf before the Gulf war is any guide, his generals are probably telling him now that a half-hearted invasion of Kosovo with light forces would be a disaster. It may suit Mr Blair, who leads a middle-- sized country with leadership ambitions beyond its military muscle, to argue otherwise. Perhaps he will tell Mr Clinton that European forces can do the ground job alone. Heaven forbid. In war, as the old saw goes, moderation is imbecility. ",920,New Zealand,A29-9067,,False,,0,True

Supreme political authority, as every pocket guidebook to the alliance explains, rests in the North Atlantic Council, which consists of the elected, civilian leaders of member states-whether they are represented by the American president or a junior diplomat from Iceland, the only ally which has no armed forces at all. Only the NAC can tell NATO'S commanders what to do. 
In practice, this distinction between political NATO and military NATO is not cut-and-dried. The very existence of an integrated military structure, a well-tuned instrument for orchestrating the use of force, is an important political fact, defining the choices available to member governments. When NATO'S defence chiefs are unhappy about the political guidance they are receiving, they often make their views known. Last summer, for example, they expressed their frustration at being asked to prepare for a bewildering range of military operations in and around Kosovo. Military planning is itself a highly politicised process. When NATO'S civilian leaders want to send a warning signal, they can order military plans which they may or may not act on. 
But the distinction between political NATO and military NATO remains important. France has always been part of political NAro, but it formally abandoned military NATO in 1966. American officials regard Germany as a crucial player in political NATO, but they are privately disappointed by the quality of Germany's contribution to NATO'S military side. 
Apart from issuing guidance to commanders, NATO'S political masters make statements on world affairs which may have no direct military implications. In theory at least, political NATO should coordinate the allies' position in international diplomacy-for example, when disarmament issues are being discussed at the United Nations. (In practice, the allies by no means always vote the same way.) 
Military NATo demonstrates its unity in more practical ways, by training together, flying together, if necessary fighting together. It is not so much a standing army as a set of instruments, procedures and practices that can be used to assemble the forces of many nations and enable them to work together efficiently. Whether NATO is policing a no-fly zone or conducting a bombing campaign, military aircraft from a dozen nations can come together as seamlessly as squadrons from a single air force. 
Political NATO and military NATO meet in the person of the Supreme Commander in Europe, General Wesley Clark. He is an intensely political figure, helping to make as well as carry out the alliance's policy in the Balkans. He has demanded, and won, considerable freedom of action in the campaign against Serbia. It is not clear, for example, which political body authorised his early pledge to ""destroy"" Serbia's military if necessary. But military men say he is still hamstrung by NATO governments' insistence on scrutinising target lists. 
Both military NATO and political NATO have seen signs of strain, but for different reasons. In a sense, military NATO is in difficulty because of European weakness, whereas political NATO may get into difficulty because of Europe's keenness to make a show of strength. 
Semi-detached Europe 
At a NATO summit in Brussels in January 1994, President Bill Clinton told his allies that America no longer opposed the idea of separable European defence structures, capable of conducting military operations without direct American participation. But these structures should be tucked inside NATO, and detached only when needed; in other words, they should be ""separable but not (permanently) separate"" from the existing alliance forces. This marked a big change from the assumptions of the cold war, when America (and Britain) waged a constant diplomatic battle to steer Europeans away from doing their own thing in military matters. 
Since then, NATO has been lumbering towards a new political structure, with the alliance putting more weight on its European leg. But the process has been tortuous, as one by one the allies made adjustments to their defence and security doctrine. France became a bit more Atlanticist, Germany started to position itself as a ""normal"" military power, Britain became a little more European. France, which had eschewed the alliance's military wing for 30 years, faced up to the reality that NATO was the only forum in which its dream of robust European defences could ever be realised. Hence its dramatic promise in 1995 to ""take up its position"" in at least some parts of NATO'S military structure. 
It was not an easy decision. General Charles de Gaulle, the great rebuilder of national pride, had quit NATO'S military arm because its domination by America was incompatible with his lofty ideal of French sovereignty. Since the end of the cold war, though, things had changed. First, the United States had greatly scaled down its military presence in Europe, so that even viewed from Paris there seemed to be a greater risk that America might quit Europe altogether than that it might crush the continent's independence. Second, France found that in practice it was fighting side by side with other western armies in places such as Iraq and Kosovo, where its forces' lack of NATO experience was something of a disadvantage. 
Four years on, France has still not rejoined the military structure. It made the mistake of setting an unrealistic condition for its re-entry: an American undertaking that in future NATO'S commander in southern Europe, based in Naples, would be a European. The demand was dismissed in Washington because the command in Naples involved real, not symbolic power. France has not yet found a dignified way to climb down. But its interest in ""Europeanising"" NATO remains as strong as ever. 
Germany, meanwhile, took large strides towards rehabilitating itself as a military power, and therefore a potential player in new European defence structures, under the government of Helmut Kohl. Thanks to meticulous work by Volker Ruhe, the defence minister at the time, Germany gradually raised its profile in Balkan peacekeeping. At first the German forces' role was confined to running a military hospital in the relative safety of Croatia, but when NATO began its Bosnia operation in 1996, German troops were dispatched to the heart of the former war zone. The government patiently built up political and public support for such deployments, and after a challenge the constitutional court ruled that they were indeed legal. 
The new Red-Green coalition that came to power last autumn has been less sure what sort of defence policy it wants; it has announced a defence review which may take two years to complete. But Germany's participation, with the approval of a Green foreign minister, in air raids on Serbia is an extraordinary landmark in its history. A third piece in the European jigsaw is Britain. 
In an abrupt departure from British conventional wisdom, Tony Blair has decided that involving the European Union in defence matters is no longer taboo. The prime minister has acknowledged the oddity of having two hugely important international organisations-the Eu and NATo-located a few miles from each other in Brussels but never speaking to each other. If the EU itself is going to get involved in defence, the new British reasoning goes, there will no longer be a need for the Western European Union, a little-known defence club which groups ten of the EU'S 15 members. These changes in British thinking were received with delight by the continental Europeans. They led to a landmark Franco-British declaration at St Malo last December which stated that the ""(European) Union must have the capacity for autonomous action, backed up by credible military forces, the means to decide to use them, and a readiness to do so, in response to international crises."" 
Impressive as it sounded, the St Malo declaration was actually a delicate compromise between France's wish to boost the profile of the Eu and Britain's insistence that any upgrading of European defences should be kept firmly under NATO's aegis. At NATO headquarters, the declaration was not seen as an unmixed blessing. After all, the alliance's hapless officials had spent nearly three years trying to work out a relationship between NATO and the WEU to allow some European-only military missions that would benefit from NATO planning and perhaps the loan of some NATO equipment. 
Now those alliance boffins may have to start all over again, this time to work out a relationship between NATO and the EU. This prospect is particularly unwelcome for the six European members of NATO which do not belong to the Eu: the Polish, Czech and Hungarian newcomers, plus Iceland, Norway and, above all, Turkey. 
Not surprisingly, America has taken up the cudgel in defence of these six states, which risk being left out in the cold if the Eu becomes an important force in international security. Turkey's strategic significance to America can hardly be overstated. It is regarded as a pivotal state, not just within NATO but in the Middle East, in the Caucasus and even in Central Asia. Whatever happens to American relations with Western Europe, American relations with Turkey will remain robust. 
In some ways, NAo is not an axis but a triangle. The two sides formed by American-Western European relations and American-Turkish relations are sound and strong. The third side of the triangle, however-relations between Turkey and Western Europe-is in a poor state. Turkey accuses the Eu of discriminating unfairly against its long-standing application to join that club, and America sympathises with Turkey to a degree that infuriates some Europeans. 
Because of its icy political and economic relations with the EU, Turkey is horrified by the idea of a greater role in defence for that institution. With some difficulty, Turkey had negotiated for itself a relationship with the Western European Union that fell only fractionally short of full membership. Now, the Turks feel, they too may have to start from the beginning and find a way of devising a security relationship with the Eu, one of their least favourite international clubs. Trying to maintain warm cooperation with the EU in defence matters while political relations remain chilly would be like mixing ""hot coffee and cold ice cream"", says Turkey's envoy to NATO, Onur Oymen. 
The Washington summit may shed some light on whether ""stronger European defences"" means what America would like it to mean-more spending on things like the ""survivability and sustainability"" of European forces in distant war zones; or whether it means what America fears it might-the emergence of the Eu as a serious counterweight to NATO in managing the continent's security.

OTTAWA 
IN A general election in 1997, Canada's two main right-wing parties, Reform and the Progressive Conservatives, shared 38% of the vote between them, a similar proportion to that obtained by the governing Liberal Party. But whereas the Liberals won 155 of the 301 seats in the House of Commons, giving a second term to the prime minister, Jean Chretien, Reform managed only 60 and the Conservatives just Zo. Fears that the next election might have a similar outcome led Preston Manning, Reform's leader, to launch a crusade aimed at creating a single right-of-centre party at the federal level, to be called the United Alternative. Yet powerful as the electoral logic of unity might be, so is the hesitation about Mr Manning's proposal. 
In a referendum of Reform members held earlier this month, 60.5% of those voting backed the United Alternative. Mr Manning has taken this as a green light to proceed. But is it? Despite much prodding from party officials, under half of Reform's 64,580 members voted-and only 1,119 of them in the five provinces east of Ontario. Meanwhile, Conservative victories in provincial elections in Ontario and New Brunswick this month do not necessarily help Mr Manning's campaign to ""unite the right"". Joe Clark, the federal Conservative leader, is a steadfast opponent of the United Alternative. 
Reform's strength is in Canada's west. Mr Manning, who founded the party as a populist movement in 1987, is the son of a former premier of Alberta (and an evangelical preacher). But even in Alberta and British Columbia, over a third of those voting rejected Mr Manning's project, apparently fearing that it would dilute the party's principles, especially family values, greater accountability of MPS to their electors, and reform of the federal Senate. This last plank appeals to the country's westerners, who want an elected and more powerful chamber in which each of the ten provinces would have equal representation, instead of the present appointed body, which they see as dominated by prime-ministerial nominees from Quebec and Ontario. 
The Reform Party swept western Canada for the first time in the 1993 election, when the Liberals routed the Conservative govemment. In 1997, though Reform added to its seats and became the official opposition, its share of the popular vote stalled at 19%. In Ontario, Canada's most populous province, the right's division meant that the Liberals took all but two of the 103 seats. 
If Ontario is the key to the fortunes of Canada's right, the province's newly reelected Conservative premier, Mike Harris, is happy to be clutching it. The Reform Party does not compete in provincial elections (except in British Columbia), so Mr Harris faced a clear run on the right in Ontario's poll on June 3rd. But the 45% share of the vote won by the Conservatives went well beyond the core support of both right-wing parties, and owed much to Mr Harris's personality. That might give him a strong claim to lead the United Alternative, if it ever succeeds in becoming a formal party. Mr Harris, however, lacks rapport with French-speaking Quebec, and may prefer to remain on his home turf as a kingmaker. 
The initiative may lie with Mr Clark. He has argued that Reform has reached its ceiling-and its geographical frontier. After the referendum, he invited Reform members (he meant the dissatisfied ones) to help his federal Conservatives draft policy at their convention in September. He has also accepted in principle a scheme for joint candidates in some Ontario constituencies at the next federal election. For Mr Manning this is Plan B, a retreat from-or only a small step towardsforming a new party. But he has a harder hand to play than Mr Clark. In developing policies for the putative United Alternative, Mr Manning must reassure Reform fundamentalists while attracting more centrists. Some doubters have rallied to him since the vote, but time is running out. The Liberals, with or without Mr Chretien at their head, are likely to call an election in 200. ","Canada 's right

JOE CLARK is a happy man. Eighteen months ago, he might not have expected to be. After 21 years as an industrial engineer at a division of Harvard Industries in Tennessee, he found himself, when the plant shut down, out of ajob at the age of 62. 
""I tried retirement,"" he recalls. ""But I was just piddling about the house. So I went to a job fair and left my resume with several temporary-employment agencies."" Within six weeks he was on the payroll of Manpower Technical. Now Manpower is employing him to look at ways to cut packaging costs for a car-parts firm. ""I really look forward to coming to work."" 
Mr Clark's new life is one that many older workers might covet. He is applying skills he has acquired over 40 years of working, but without the stress and responsibility of line management. He can take a day off whenever he needs one: that was part of the deal. He is earning about as much as he did in full-time work, but without the need to pay money into a pension scheme. And, when his wife retires in two years' time, he will be able to cut down to working six months a year, so they can spend more time together. 
He is also a curiosity: he is in his early 60s and still at work. In the United States, only half the men aged between 60 and 64 are still in the labour force. That is more than Germany, where just over one-third still workor France and the Netherlands, where the figure is less than one-fifth. Retirement. a concept that barely existed a century ago, now begins so early that men spend only half their lives in work (see chart i on next page). 
Put early retirement together with the fall in fertility and the rise in life expectancy among the old, and a momentous change is occurring. Ahead lies a continued rise in the ranks of the retired-the ""Florida effect"", in the phrase of Peter Peterson, author of a recent book* on the impact of ageing-and a decline in the population of working age (see chart 2 on next page). In the 15 countries of the European Union, the population will not change between now and 2020-but the number aged between 25 and 50 will fall by an eighth, from 139m to 122m. In Britain, the fall will be 8%; in Germany, 11%; in Italy, 19%. In America, with its high immigration, that age group will continue to grow, but only by perhaps 3% over the whole period. 
A contracting labour market is something none of today's employers has ever seen. Disturbing for the United States, it is even more worrying for Europe and Japan, where the fall in fertility has been sharper and immigration has been lower. ""Populations in Europe are poised to plunge on a scale not seen since the Black Death in 1348,"" says Paul Wallace, author of another book^ on global ageing. ""Poised"" and ""plunge"" may put it a little strongly-even in Japan, population decline is unlikely before 2010-but the implications for countries and companies are certainly large. 
Up to now, policymakers have tended to assume that the main effect of ageing will be on the affordability of pensions. In fact, the more dramatic effects will be on growth and living standards, as the world's most productive countries become its oldest. Last year, the OECD heroically tried to guess the consequences in the first half of the next century. Such forecasts, while bound to be wrong, at least suggest the scale and direction of changes. Moreover, demographic trends change slowly: the old of the next half-century have all been born already. 
By 2040, guesses the OECD in a working paper published last year, the rise in the ratio of dependent old to working young may be reducing Japan's growth in living standards by three-quarters of a percentage point and Europe's and America's by half a point. The cumulative effect by mid-century could be to cut Japan's living standards by 23%, Europe's by 18% and America's by 10% below the level they might have reached otherwise. 
The biggest driver of these cuts is demographic change. But most companies are also ill-prepared for a workforce of ageing babyboomers. ""Employers still have a mindset of getting people out the door at the earliest age,"" says Scott Morris of the Committee for Economic Development, an American think-tank which is about to publish a ""wake-up call for employers, workers and government"". 
Employers who are likely to wake up first are those with the oldest workforces. In youthful America, some industrial firms have middle-aged workforces who will begin to retire in droves in the coming decade. The car companies are prime examples. At Ford, the average age of the 100,000 hourly workers is 44; at General Motors, it is 48. 
The car companies say that age diversity is wonderful and that they can recruit youngsters to take the places of retiring greyheads. But they also fret about this coming tidal wave of retirement: ""We are concerned with losing skilled, seasoned people,"" says Megan Giles, at DaimlerChrysler. ""We look at the next five years and know it's going to be a year-in-year-out problem."" 
The change in the balance of young and old is not easily reversible. What about early retirement? On the face of it, the rush to retire early is surprising. For one thing, the old seem healthier than ever before. A report by the OECD, ""Maintaining Prosperity in an Ageing Society"", suggests that disability is not generally a barrier to activity until people reach their mid-70s. Until people grow very old, differences in health within age groups are more important than differences among them. One implication: there is no biological basis for a retirement age in the 6os. 
Not only are the old healthier than ever; they are growing healthier still. Research at Duke University in the United States has found that disability among the over 65s has been falling at an accelerating pace-the result, perhaps, of better education, nutrition, medicine, public health and pay. The babyboomers may do better yet: today's middleaged have given up smoking, worry about their diet and go jogging at the weekend. Tedious, perhaps-but they will doubtless enjoy an even fitter third age than today's younger pensioners are doing. 
They will, moreover, have less strenuous jobs: sitting at a desk rather than lugging bricks. Eugene Steuerle of the Urban Institute, an American think-tank, calculates that the share of American workers in physically demanding jobs has dropped from 20.3% in 1950 to 7.5% in 1996, with the fastest declines in the older age groups. 
So why don't old folk stay in these cushier jobs? Part of the answer seems to be: because it makes little economic sense to do so. For a number of reasons, the benefits of retirement have risen, relative to the costs. 
Many governments, especially in Europe, spent lavishly in the late 1970s and early 1980s to bribe older workers out of the job market, reasoning that retirement was less humiliating for the old than unemployment for the young. Early retirement is back in fashion again: in Germany, the govemments Alliance for Jobs, a roundtable of ministers, employers and trade unions that aims to bring down unemployment, has discussed letting older workers draw their pensions early and switch to part-time work. The labour minister, Walter Riester, has floated plans to bring the retirement age down from 65 to 60. In France, the government is considering extending an early-retirement scheme it has agreed with the car industry. 
Such schemes not only store up problems for the future. They also send a clear message to companies: unload the old. In countries with company pension schemes, that message is often reinforced by a surplus that allows them to buy out their older employees and so reduce their staff costs. The result, says Alan Walker of Sheffield University, who wrote a report on ""Combating Age Barriers in Employment"" for the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, has been to create ""a culture of early retirement, where companies often think their older workers don't want to stay on."" 
Even in countries which have stopped deliberately promoting early retirement, governments-and companies-often unintentionally encourage early retirement, by imposing a heavy implicit tax on working for too many years. 
Thus in some countries, it is illegal to work while drawing a pension. In others, workers can draw a pension only if they first leave their current job. Given the difficulty older workers have in finding work, that in effect condemns them to unemployment. 
Many countries withdraw some pension entitlement from working pensioners. In the United States, pensioners aged under 65 lose $1 for every $2 they earn over $9,600. Add in payroll taxes and income tax, and that is the equivalent of a marginal tax rate of up to 80%. As for workers who stay on thejob, they rarely gain much in extra entitlements. That further boosts the implicit tax on work. 
Company pension schemes have similar effects. One study of pension plans and employment records at several Fortune 500 companies found that the ages of retirement in those firms correlated almost exactly with the financial incentives in their pension plans, which generally encouraged retirement before 65. Indeed, the impact of changes in such pension plans, for the workers covered by them, seemed even stronger than the impact of reforming Social Security. 
While work has become less rewarding, leisure has become more so. These days. the old have fun-and the money to enjoy it. Dora Costa, an economist at MIT who last year published an important study of retirement**, argues that ""retirement has become much more attractive. Retired people are no longer usually living with their children, and can move to low-cost places such as Florida."" Television provides endless free entertainment; travel costs less than ever before. In her book, she quotes one man who retired at 60 and clearly loved every minute of it: 
My wife and I have completely changed our lifestyle since retirement. We live in a 31-foot Airstream trailer-spend seven months in winter in Melbourne, Florida, where we have every kind of activity. We dance and square-dance and party all winter. Then in summer we travel about-stop and spend some days with children and grandchildren and the rest of the time sightseeing from Canada through 48 states and Mexico. My goal in trying to retire early was to be able to do just this kind of thing before either my wife, who is older,or I become unable physically to do as we have been doing for six years now. 
Not only are such delights less expensive than in the past; the old are wealthier. Once, many were paupers. Now, in some countries, they are better off than the workingaged population. Having lived through half a century of growing prosperity to enjoy generous pensions, they have the public and private means to enjoy life. 
Come back, we need you 
What would it take to persuade older workers to stay in the job market? The answer seems likely to emerge first in the United States. There, the flight of older men from the job market seems to have stopped since the mid-1980s. Indeed, a higher proportion of men aged 62 or over are in the job market now than in 1985. Nobody yet knows, however, whether the halt is permanent or merety a pause. 
The case for the pause is put by Ms Costa. Early retirement, she points out, is not just a recent trend, driven by taxes and benefits. The employment rates of older men have been falling since 1880, when fewer than 3% of Americans were over 64 but at least threequarters of those were still toiling (see chart 3 on previous page). In the early years of this century, a small rise in pension entitlement relative to pay produced a large rise in retirement. As the century went by, the lure of a bigger pension dwindled. ""If incomes continue to rise as economic growth progresses and if leisure-time activities continue to be relatively inexpensive and enticing, then the rise of retirement is unlikely to reverse."" 
Her view is challenged by Joseph Quinn, an economist at Boston College. He argues that a series of policy changes have removed some of the barriers that discouraged older men from working. Companies are prohibited by law from setting mandatory retirement ages. Congress has steadily increased the share of every dollar earned that a retired person can keep without losing Social Security entitlement; and is raising the extra benefit entitlement that a worker can accumulate by delaying retirement. And in the private sector, the share of pensioned workers covered by defined-contribution pension plans, which are usually age-neutral, rose from 13% in 1975 to 4z% in 1997. 
But those, of course, are not the only changes that matter. In addition, the economy is booming. At Manpower, a giant temporary-employment agency, Sharon Canter, director of strategic information, says that 25-30% of the people placed are at least so years old. In America, some are over 80. ""Labour is so short that our client companies are pleased to get qualified workers."" Manpower scours churches and community groups for older people who might not have thought of returning to work, and boasts that more than a quarter of the 500,0oo,ooo people it has trained in computer skills are ""gold-collar"" workers aged over so. 
Until the American boom stops fizzing, it may be impossible to be sure whether the change is permanent-or how far it will go. What is clear, however, is that the old are more likely to stay in the workforce if the kind of jobs on offer meet their needs-and those of prospective employers. 
Ajob for life 
Given the speed at which their workers are growing greyer, employers know surprisingly little about how productive they are. The general assumption is that the old are paid more in spite of, rather than because of, their extra productivity. That might partly explain why, when employers are under pressure to cut costs, they persuade the 55-year-olds to take early retirement. Earlier this year, Sun Life of Canada, an insurance company, announced that it was offering redundancy to all its British employees aged so or over ""to bring in new blood"". 
In Japan, says Mariko Fujiwara, an industrial anthropologist who runs a thinktank for Hakuhodo, Japan's second-largest advertising agency, most companies are bringing down the retirement age from the traditional 57 to so or thereabouts-and in some cases, such as Nissan, to 45. More than perhaps anywhere else, pay in Japan is linked to seniority. Given that the percentage of workers who have spent more than 32 years with the same employer rose from 11% in 1980 to 42% by 1994, it is hardly surprising that seniority-based wage costs have become the most intractable item on corporate profit-and-loss accounts. 
In Germany, Patrick Pohl, spokesman for Hoechst, expresses a widely held view: ""The company is trying to lower the average age of the workforce. Perhaps the main reason for replacing older workers is that it makes it easier to 'defrost' the corporate culture. Older workers are less willing to try a new way of thinking. Younger workers are cheaper and more flexible."" Some German firms are hampered from getting rid of older workers as quickly as they would like. At SGL Carbon, a graphite producer, the average age of workers has been going up not down. The reason, says the company's Ivo Lingnau, is not that sGL values older workers more. It is collective bargaining: the union agreement puts strict limits on the proportion of workers that may retire early. 
Clearly, when older people do heavy physical work, their age may affect their productivity. But other skills may increase with age, including many that are crucial for good management, such as an ability to handle people diplomatically, to run a meeting or to spot a problem before it blows up. Peter Hicks, who co-ordinates OECD work on the policy implications of ageing, says that plenty of research suggests older people are paid more because they are worth more. 
And the virtues of the young may be exaggerated. ""The few companies that have kept on older workers find they have good judgment and their productivity is good,"" says Mr Peterson. ""Besides, their education standards are much better than those of today's young high-school graduates."" Companies may say that older workers are not worth training, because they are reaching the end of their working lives: in fact, young people tend to switch jobs so frequently that they offer the worst returns on training. ""The median age for employer-driven training is the late 40s and early 50s,"" says Mr Hicks. ""It goes mainly to managers."" 
Take away those seniority-based pay scales, and older workers may become a much more attractive employment proposition. But most companies (and many workers) are uncomfortable with the idea of reducing someone's pay in later life-although workers on piece-rates often earn less over time. So retaining the services of older workers may mean employing them in new ways. 
One innovation, described in Mr Walker's report on combating age barriers, was devised by IBM Belgium. Faced with the need to cut staff costs, and having decided to concentrate cuts on 55-60-year-olds, IBM set up a separate company called SkillTeam, which re-employed any of the early retired who wanted to go on working up to the age of 60. An employee who joined SkillTeam at the age of 55 on a five-year contract would work for 58% of his time, over the full period, for 88% of his last IBM salary. The company offered services to IBM, thus allowing it to retain access to some of the intellectual capital it would otherwise have lost. 
The best way to tempt the old to go on working may be to build on such ""bridge"" jobs: part-time or temporary employment that creates a more gradual transition from full-time work to retirement. Mr Quinn, who has studied the phenomenon, finds that, in the United States, nearly half of all men and women who had been in full-time jobs in middle age moved into such ""bridge""jobs at the end of their working lives. In general, it is the best-paid and worst-paid who carry on working: ""There are"", he says, ""two very different types of bridge job-holders-those who continue working because they have to and those who continue working because they want to, even though they could afford to retire."" 
If the job market grows more flexible, the old may find more jobs that suit them. Often, they will be self-employed. Sometimes, they may start their own businesses: a study by David Storey of Warwick University found that, in Britain, 70% of businesses started by people over 55 survived, compared with an average of only 19%. To coax the old back into the job market, work will not only have to pay. It will need to be more fun than touring the country in an Airstream trailer, or seeing the grandchildren, or playing golf. Only then will there be many more Joe Clarks.

Eugene Steuerle of the Urban Institute , an American think - tank , calculates that the share of American workers in physically demanding jobs has dropped from 20.3 % in 1950 to 7.5 % in 1996 , with the fastest declines in the older age groups . 
 So why do n't old folk stay in these cushier jobs ? Part of the answer seems to be : because it makes little economic sense to do so . For a number of reasons , the benefits of retirement have risen , relative to the costs . 
 Many governments , especially in Europe , spent lavishly in the late 1970s and early 1980s to bribe older workers out of the job market , reasoning that retirement was less humiliating for the old than unemployment for the young . Early retirement is back in fashion again : in Germany , the govemments Alliance for Jobs , a roundtable of ministers , employers and trade unions that aims to bring down unemployment , has discussed letting older workers draw their pensions early and switch to part - time work . The labour minister , Walter Riester , has floated plans to bring the retirement age down from 65 to 60 . In France , the government is considering extending an early - retirement scheme it has agreed with the car industry . 
 Such schemes not only store up problems for the future . They also send a clear message to companies : unload the old . In countries with company pension schemes , that message is often reinforced by a surplus that allows them to buy out their older employees and so reduce their staff costs . The result , says Alan Walker of Sheffield University , who wrote a report on "" Combating Age Barriers in Employment "" for the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions , has been to create "" a culture of early retirement , where companies often think their older workers do n't want to stay on . "" 
 Even in countries which have stopped deliberately promoting early retirement , governments - and companies - often unintentionally encourage early retirement , by imposing a heavy implicit tax on working for too many years . 
 Thus in some countries , it is illegal to work while drawing a pension . In others , workers can draw a pension only if they first leave their current job . Given the difficulty older workers have in finding work , that in effect condemns them to unemployment . 
 Many countries withdraw some pension entitlement from working pensioners . In the United States , pensioners aged under 65 lose $ 1 for every $ 2 they earn over $ 9,600 . Add in payroll taxes and income tax , and that is the equivalent of a marginal tax rate of up to 80 % . As for workers who stay on thejob , they rarely gain much in extra entitlements . That further boosts the implicit tax on work . 
 Company pension schemes have similar effects . One study of pension plans and employment records at several Fortune 500 companies found that the ages of retirement in those firms correlated almost exactly with the financial incentives in their pension plans , which generally encouraged retirement before 65 . Indeed , the impact of changes in such pension plans , for the workers covered by them , seemed even stronger than the impact of reforming Social Security . 
 While work has become less rewarding , leisure has become more so . These days . the old have fun - and the money to enjoy it . Dora Costa , an economist at MIT who last year published an important study of retirement * * , argues that "" retirement has become much more attractive . Retired people are no longer usually living with their children , and can move to low - cost places such as Florida . "" Television provides endless free entertainment ; travel costs less than ever before . In her book , she quotes one man who retired at 60 and clearly loved every minute of it : 
 My wife and I have completely changed our lifestyle since retirement . We live in a 31 - foot Airstream trailer - spend seven months in winter in Melbourne , Florida , where we have every kind of activity . We dance and square - dance and party all winter . Then in summer we travel about - stop and spend some days with children and grandchildren and the rest of the time sightseeing from Canada through 48 states and Mexico . My goal in trying to retire early was to be able to do just this kind of thing before either my wife , who is older , or I become unable physically to do as we have been doing for six years now . 
 Not only are such delights less expensive than in the past ; the old are wealthier . Once , many were paupers . Now , in some countries , they are better off than the workingaged population . Having lived through half a century of growing prosperity to enjoy generous pensions , they have the public and private means to enjoy life . 
 Come back , we need you 
 What would it take to persuade older workers to stay in the job market ? The answer seems likely to emerge first in the United States . There , the flight of older men from the job market seems to have stopped since the mid-1980s . Indeed , a higher proportion of men aged 62 or over are in the job market now than in 1985 . Nobody yet knows , however , whether the halt is permanent or merety a pause . 
 The case for the pause is put by Ms Costa . Early retirement , she points out , is not just a recent trend , driven by taxes and benefits . The employment rates of older men have been falling since 1880 , when fewer than 3 % of Americans were over 64 but at least threequarters of those were still toiling ( see chart 3 on previous page ) . In the early years of this century , a small rise in pension entitlement relative to pay produced a large rise in retirement . As the century went by , the lure of a bigger pension dwindled . "" If incomes continue to rise as economic growth progresses and if leisure - time activities continue to be relatively inexpensive and enticing , then the rise of retirement is unlikely to reverse . "" 
 Her view is challenged by Joseph Quinn , an economist at Boston College . He argues that a series of policy changes have removed some of the barriers that discouraged older men from working . Companies are prohibited by law from setting mandatory retirement ages . Congress has steadily increased the share of every dollar earned that a retired person can keep without losing Social Security entitlement ; and is raising the extra benefit entitlement that a worker can accumulate by delaying retirement . And in the private sector , the share of pensioned workers covered by defined - contribution pension plans , which are usually age - neutral , rose from 13 % in 1975 to 4z% in 1997 . 
 But those , of course , are not the only changes that matter . In addition , the economy is booming . At Manpower , a giant temporary - employment agency , Sharon Canter , director of strategic information , says that 25 - 30 % of the people placed are at least so years old . In America , some are over 80 . "" Labour is so short that our client companies are pleased to get qualified workers . "" Manpower scours churches and community groups for older people who might not have thought of returning to work , and boasts that more than a quarter of the 500,0oo , ooo people it has trained in computer skills are "" gold - collar "" workers aged over so . 
 Until the American boom stops fizzing , it may be impossible to be sure whether the change is permanent - or how far it will go . What is clear , however , is that the old are more likely to stay in the workforce if the kind of jobs on offer meet their needs - and those of prospective employers . 
 Ajob for life 
 Given the speed at which their workers are growing greyer , employers know surprisingly little about how productive they are . The general assumption is that the old are paid more in spite of , rather than because of , their extra productivity . That might partly explain why , when employers are under pressure to cut costs , they persuade the 55 - year - olds to take early retirement . Earlier this year , Sun Life of Canada , an insurance company , announced that it was offering redundancy to all its British employees aged so or over "" to bring in new blood "" . 
 In Japan , says Mariko Fujiwara , an industrial anthropologist who runs a thinktank for Hakuhodo , Japan 's second - largest advertising agency , most companies are bringing down the retirement age from the traditional 57 to so or thereabouts - and in some cases , such as Nissan , to 45 . More than perhaps anywhere else , pay in Japan is linked to seniority . Given that the percentage of workers who have spent more than 32 years with the same employer rose from 11 % in 1980 to 42 % by 1994 , it is hardly surprising that seniority - based wage costs have become the most intractable item on corporate profit - and - loss accounts . 
 In Germany , Patrick Pohl , spokesman for Hoechst , expresses a widely held view : "" The company is trying to lower the average age of the workforce . Perhaps the main reason for replacing older workers is that it makes it easier to ' defrost ' the corporate culture . Older workers are less willing to try a new way of thinking . Younger workers are cheaper and more flexible . "" Some German firms are hampered from getting rid of older workers as quickly as they would like . At SGL Carbon , a graphite producer , the average age of workers has been going up not down . The reason , says the company 's Ivo Lingnau , is not that sGL values older workers more . It is collective bargaining : the union agreement puts strict limits on the proportion of workers that may retire early . 
 Clearly , when older people do heavy physical work , their age may affect their productivity . But other skills may increase with age , including many that are crucial for good management , such as an ability to handle people diplomatically , to run a meeting or to spot a problem before it blows up . Peter Hicks , who co - ordinates OECD work on the policy implications of ageing , says that plenty of research suggests older people are paid more because they are worth more . 
 And the virtues of the young may be exaggerated . "" The few companies that have kept on older workers find they have good judgment and their productivity is good , "" says Mr Peterson . "" Besides , their education standards are much better than those of today 's young high - school graduates . "" Companies may say that older workers are not worth training , because they are reaching the end of their working lives : in fact , young people tend to switch jobs so frequently that they offer the worst returns on training . "" The median age for employer - driven training is the late 40s and early 50s , "" says Mr Hicks . "" It goes mainly to managers . "" 
 Take away those seniority - based pay scales , and older workers may become a much more attractive employment proposition . But most companies ( and many workers ) are uncomfortable with the idea of reducing someone 's pay in later life - although workers on piece - rates often earn less over time . So retaining the services of older workers may mean employing them in new ways . 
 One innovation , described in Mr Walker 's report on combating age barriers , was devised by IBM Belgium . Faced with the need to cut staff costs , and having decided to concentrate cuts on 55 - 60 - year - olds , IBM set up a separate company called SkillTeam , which re - employed any of the early retired who wanted to go on working up to the age of 60 . An employee who joined SkillTeam at the age of 55 on a five - year contract would work for 58 % of his time , over the full period , for 88 % of his last IBM salary . The company offered services to IBM , thus allowing it to retain access to some of the intellectual capital it would otherwise have lost . 
 The best way to tempt the old to go on working may be to build on such "" bridge "" jobs : part - time or temporary employment that creates a more gradual transition from full - time work to retirement . Mr Quinn , who has studied the phenomenon , finds that , in the United States , nearly half of all men and women who had been in full - time jobs in middle age moved into such "" bridge""jobs at the end of their working lives . In general , it is the best - paid and worst - paid who carry on working : "" There are "" , he says , "" two very different types of bridge job - holders - those who continue working because they have to and those who continue working because they want to , even though they could afford to retire . "" 
 If the job market grows more flexible , the old may find more jobs that suit them . Often , they will be self - employed . Sometimes , they may start their own businesses : a study by David Storey of Warwick University found that , in Britain , 70 % of businesses started by people over 55 survived , compared with an average of only 19 % . To coax the old back into the job market , work will not only have to pay . It will need to be more fun than touring the country in an Airstream trailer , or seeing the grandchildren , or playing golf . Only then will there be many more Joe Clarks .

Mr Clark's selfless decision allowed pages of newsprint that would otherwise have been devoted to tedious Blairite sermons against teenage pregnancy to carry redder meat-namely, admiring tales of the bad life and happy times of a Tory rogue who took a mistress on honeymoon with his i6-year-old wife, seduced the spouse and both daughters of a South African judge, and published a diary that will delight students of British manners and politics long after the details of Mr Blair's various moral initiatives have been forgotten in some Whitehall vault. As it happened, soon after the news came through, your columnist bumped into one of those grave young men who toils day and night helping Mr Blair's government to modernise Britain. The grave young man was perplexed by the fuss. After all, he mused, Alan Clark never achieved anything in politics-did he? 
Of course not. British politics has its bizarre moments but seldom loses touch with reality altogether. As a romantic nationalist, former soldier and serious military historian, Alan Clark wanted to be defence secretary just as desperately as a little boy craves a train set. But not even Margaret Thatcher, whose ""very pretty ankles"" turned him on, and who liked him back, would risk putting the nuclear button near the finger of an habitual inebriate who said that Hitler was a military genius, who named one of his beloved dogs after Eva Braun, and who recommended sorting out Ireland's ""troubles"" by sending British commandos one night to kill a couple of hundred IRA terrorists. 
Mr Clark's mad ideas and compulsive political incorrectness (he called Africa ""bongo-bongo land"") kept him out of high office. He was not much good at low office. Life as a junior employment minister bored him silly. Asked to present a dreary speech, written by civil servants, to the House of Commons, he prepared himself not by reading over the text buthe admitted in his diaries-with a bottle of i96i Palmer, then a 1975, back again to the 1961, and finally a ""delicious"" Pichon Longueville. So slurred and robotic was his subsequent performance that Labour's Clare Short, nowadays in charge of the Department for International Development, butted in to complain that the minister was ""not sober"". Later, as a junior defence minister, he approved the sale of military gear to Iraq even though the government claimed at the time to have an embargo in place. He did at least have the decency to intervene in a trial that might otherwise have sent an innocent businessman to prison for these sales. Mr Clark did not apologise-""only servants apologise""-but he did admit languidly to having been ""economical with the actualite"". 
Here, though, is a mystery. How did a philanderer with odious views and a gift for offending people survive in politics at all? First, by being more than just a politician. He was funny, erudite and wrote divinely. Being rich was no impediment. The British frown upon displays of wealth, considering it vulgar. But they suffer it in their aristocrats because it reminds them of a vanished order. His father, Lord (Kenneth) Clark, seems to have left him emotionally mixed up, but also left him Saltwood Castle-a real one, moat and all-and a priceless collection of art. The younger Clark added Rolls-Royces, Jaguars, Porsches and women. He loved to outrage. He said that no bottle of claret costing less than o was worth drinking, and that the secret of managing a fortune was not to live on the interest from it but on the interest on the interest. He may have been a somewhat bogus aristocrat-his grandfather made it big in the Glasgow rag trade-but both he and his wife flaunted class for all they were worth. She threw the occasional axe, but stayed on. All she said of his treble against the South African judge was that, if you bed below-stairs sorts of people, they will run to the newspapers. 
It is hard to imagine anyone so politically incorrect surviving in the American Congress. But Britain is fond of upper-class rogues, and Mr Clark played the part to perfection. His other great asset was the British sport of mock self-deprecation, of which he was a master. 
It is striking that the source of most of the disparaging anecdotage about this not very successful politician is the not very successful politician himself. Alan Clark's diaries are not just the best bit of flesh-andblood political gossip since the diaries of Chips Channon. They also tell one story after another about his own unfitness for grown-up politics. He admits to losing track of detail, to getting nervous, to fluffing his lines. His diary's first entry on his first day as a minister dwells not on his plans to modemise Britain but on the large eyes and ""tightly controlled sexuality"" of the female civil servant who is assigned to him. He is lazy; he is ambitious; he is cast into unreasonable despondency when he cannot catch Mrs (now Lady) Thatcher's eye. The drunken parliamentary performance that enraged Ms Short is recorded in excruciating, rueful detail. But although it is a story against himself, it is also a piece of selfcongratulation. The diarist wants you to know that he would rather make a clown of himself than become a robot who reads from a text and never dares to stray from the party line. 
That is why he never achieved anything in politics. It also explains the perplexity of the grave young man from a party that has imposed an iron discipline on its new nz Ps. Most have to bend the knee. It is hard to be as independent as Alan Clark if you happen not to have written the many books, or inherited the great castle. He did not need a seat in Parliament (though he returned quickly enough after trying to live without one).

Panama's performance 
SIR-Your article on Panama's new president, Mireya Moscoso, (""Awaiting the lady"", August 28th) contains factual errors that give rise to a biased view of the readiness of the new administration and the condition of our economy and politics. 
You say that Panama is ""an economy already in recession"". This is not so: the economy grew by 3.1% in the first quarter of 1999 and 3.4% in the second, after growing 3.9% in 1998. The real story here is that Panama's dollarised economy has remained strong. This is despite repeated shockwaves from Asia and Russia that have forced virtually every other country in Latin America into recession. 
Second, you say that exports from the Colon Free Zone have fallen sharply because of troubles in Colombia and Venezuela. While this is correct, the brunt of this impact occurred in the first half of this year and has now largely run its course. 
Also, you report that the Arnulfista Party is in a minority in the National Assembly. The big story during the week after your article appeared was the formation of a coalition between the Arnulfista and six other parties that has given the president's party a working majority in the legislature. This should allow the president to remedy the highly irregular spate of controversial last-- minute legislation pushed through by the outgoing president, Perez Balladares, aimed at ""hobbling his successor"".

Minority opinion 
SIR-You paint a rather flattering picture of Max van der Stoel (Charlemagne, September nth) and his performance as the high commissioner for national minorities for the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). But the OSCE suffers from three biases, common in the West, concerning ""national minorities"". 
First, the OSCE is unwilling to tackle the injustices done to national minorities in three western countries-Greece, France and America-which do not even recognise the concept of national minorities in law. Why, for example, does the organisation not promote an autonomous status for Corsica, Brittany or the Slavic-- Macedonian region of northern Greece? Second, the OSCE tells states such as Estonia and Latvia to adopt minority and citizenship policies which are uncommon in the West, where naturalisation often requires language and history tests. Until recently, in Germany one had to prove German ancestry to have a reasonable chance. 
Finally, the OSCE is unwilling to tackle Russia over its minority policies: its second-largest minority-Ukrainians-still have no collective rights. And the organisation ignores Russian support for the ethnic cleansing of 250,000 Georgians from Abkhazia, and support for separatism in Moldova and Azerbaijan.

Video down the line 
SIR-Your article on video-ondemand (""Ultimate telly"", September nth) was a good example of how ideas can return to fashion, and how determining which applications will appeal to customers is the paramount skill in developing and deploying new technologies. It is amusing to note that while VOD was the original motivation behind asymmetric digital subscriber-lines (ADSL), by it came to be known as the ""killer application"" because of its fatal effect on the careers of those associated with it. 
You omitted two key aspects of VideoNet's service. First, its rediscovered viability is primarily because it does not stand alone. Sharing infrastructure with the user base who want only Internet access spreads the capital cost and the economics obviously improve. Although VideoNet is not doing it yet, providing users with both services makes an attractive package if only a small extra charge is levied for VOD to customers already paying for Intemet access. 
Second, video is a harbinger of another real-time service: voice. If a provider can reliably deliver this sort of video, then a voice channel, or many dozen voice channels, can sail down a single line with ease, with the payment of a single fee to British Telecom. 
It will be interesting to see whether British Telecom is as enthusiastic about revenues from real time services as are its competitors. These competitors are using the unbundled ADSL service to implement cheaply multiple telephone calls, thus capturing prime telephony revenues.

 You say that Panama is "" an economy already in recession "" . This is not so : the economy grew by 3.1 % in the first quarter of 1999 and 3.4 % in the second , after growing 3.9 % in 1998 . The real story here is that Panama 's dollarised economy has remained strong . This is despite repeated shockwaves from Asia and Russia that have forced virtually every other country in Latin America into recession . 
 Second , you say that exports from the Colon Free Zone have fallen sharply because of troubles in Colombia and Venezuela . While this is correct , the brunt of this impact occurred in the first half of this year and has now largely run its course . 
 Also , you report that the Arnulfista Party is in a minority in the National Assembly . The big story during the week after your article appeared was the formation of a coalition between the Arnulfista and six other parties that has given the president 's party a working majority in the legislature . This should allow the president to remedy the highly irregular spate of controversial last-- minute legislation pushed through by the outgoing president , Perez Balladares , aimed at "" hobbling his successor "" .

 Minority opinion 
 SIR - You paint a rather flattering picture of Max van der Stoel ( Charlemagne , September nth ) and his performance as the high commissioner for national minorities for the Organisation for Security and Co - operation in Europe ( OSCE ) . But the OSCE suffers from three biases , common in the West , concerning "" national minorities "" . 
 First , the OSCE is unwilling to tackle the injustices done to national minorities in three western countries - Greece , France and America - which do not even recognise the concept of national minorities in law . Why , for example , does the organisation not promote an autonomous status for Corsica , Brittany or the Slavic-- Macedonian region of northern Greece ? Second , the OSCE tells states such as Estonia and Latvia to adopt minority and citizenship policies which are uncommon in the West , where naturalisation often requires language and history tests . Until recently , in Germany one had to prove German ancestry to have a reasonable chance . 
 Finally , the OSCE is unwilling to tackle Russia over its minority policies : its second - largest minority - Ukrainians - still have no collective rights . And the organisation ignores Russian support for the ethnic cleansing of 250,000 Georgians from Abkhazia , and support for separatism in Moldova and Azerbaijan .

 Video down the line 
 SIR - Your article on video - ondemand ( "" Ultimate telly "" , September nth ) was a good example of how ideas can return to fashion , and how determining which applications will appeal to customers is the paramount skill in developing and deploying new technologies . It is amusing to note that while VOD was the original motivation behind asymmetric digital subscriber - lines ( ADSL ) , by it came to be known as the "" killer application "" because of its fatal effect on the careers of those associated with it . 
 You omitted two key aspects of VideoNet 's service . First , its rediscovered viability is primarily because it does not stand alone . Sharing infrastructure with the user base who want only Internet access spreads the capital cost and the economics obviously improve . Although VideoNet is not doing it yet , providing users with both services makes an attractive package if only a small extra charge is levied for VOD to customers already paying for Intemet access . 
 Second , video is a harbinger of another real - time service : voice . If a provider can reliably deliver this sort of video , then a voice channel , or many dozen voice channels , can sail down a single line with ease , with the payment of a single fee to British Telecom . 
 It will be interesting to see whether British Telecom is as enthusiastic about revenues from real time services as are its competitors . These competitors are using the unbundled ADSL service to implement cheaply multiple telephone calls , thus capturing prime telephony revenues .

AFTER New Zealand's general election of 1996, nine weeks passed before a coalition government could be put together between the conservative National Party and the Populist NZ First party. That wobbled along until 1998 when the coalition split, and the National Party carried on as a minority government. The election on November 27th was rather more decisive. The Labour Party won 52 seats, which with the ii seats of the Alliance party, its leftleaning partner, will give it a workable majority in the 120-member Parliament. The National Party has 41 seats. New Zealanders seem to have mastered some of the intricacies of their German-style system of proportional representation, which had been blamed for producing the previous unstable government. Countries considering changing their first-past-the post system had been alan-ned by the results of the New Zealand experiment. They may now be reassured. Possibly. 
New Zealand was ready for change. For 15 years, first Labour, then National, had guided the country away from its egalitarian past. But the gap between rich and poor had widened too far for many New Zealanders. In recent years particularly, they had become increasingly disenchanted with the flinty policies of National's leader, jenny Shipley, who sought to make New Zealand intemationally competitive whatever the domestic cost. The new coalition, led by Labour's 49year-old Helen Clark, plans to increase the top rates of personal income tax, and assist poor families. many of the poorest are Maoris, who make up about 15% of New Zealand's population Of 3.6m. 
In her early years in Parliament, Ms Clark, fresh from teaching politics at Auckland University, was regarded as a left-winger. These days she is thought of as centrist. Labour for her is not the radical market-driven ways practised by the party in the 198os, but the policies of its kinder, socially caring founders. She insists there is more to life than the pursuit of wealth. She likes listening to opera, cross-country skiing and climbing mountains. 
Ms Clark comes to office as New Zealand moves out of a mild recession brought on by the Asian slump and two severe droughts. Her major challenge may be to curb the demands of the Alliance, which is eager to impose wealth taxes, rebuild the tariff walls lowered over the past decade, and expand welfare benefits. For the moment, the Alliance's Jim Anderton, delighted after waiting for 18 years to get his hands on power, is exuding co-operation, but financial markets are wary that he will want to tamper with the independence of the Reserve Bank in running monetary policy. Mr Anderton has made no secret that he wants to be minister of economic development, besides being deputy prime minister, and return to the interventionism that was anathema to the governments of the past 15 years. The tussle for economic power between Mr Anderton and Labour's Michael Cullen, expected to become finance minister, promises to be one of the more fascinating chapters in the life of the government.

IN A scruffy office in midtown Manhattan, a team Of 30 artificial-intelligence programmers is trying to simulate the brains of an eminent sexologist, a well-known dietician, a celebrity fitness trainer and several other experts. Umagic Systems is a young firm, setting up websites that will allow clients to consult the virtual versions of these personalities. Subscribers will feed in details about themselves and their goals; Umagic's software will come up with the advice that the star expert would give. 
Although few people have lost money betting on the neuroses of the American consumer, Umagic's prospects are hard to gauge (in ten years' time, consulting a computer about your sex life might seem natural, or it might seem absurd). But the company and others like it are beginning to spook large American firms, because they see such halfbarmy ""innovative"" ideas as the key to their own future success. 
Innovation has become the buzz-word of American management. Firms have found that most of the things that can be outsourced or re-engineered have been (worryingly, by their competitors as well). The stars of American business tend today to be innovators such as Dell, Amazon and Wal-Mart, which have produced ideas or products that have changed their industries, 
A new book by two consultants from Arthur D. Little records that, over the past 15 years, the top 20% Of firms in an annual innovation poll by Fortune magazine have achieved double the shareholder returns of their peers.* Much of today's merger boom is driven by a desperate search for new ideas. So is the fortune now spent on licensing and buying others' intellectual property. According to the Pasadena-based Patent & Licence Exchange, trading in intangible assets in the United States has risen from $15 billion in 1990 to $100 billion in 1998, with an increasing proportion of the rewards going to small firms and individuals. 
And therein lies the terror for big companies: that innovation seems to work best outside them. Several big established ""ideas factories"", including 3,m, Procter & Gamble and Rubbermaid, have had dry spells recently. Gillette spent ten years and $1 billion developing its new Mach 3 razor; it took a British supermarket only a year or so to produce a reasonable imitation. 
""In the management of creativity, size is your enemy,"" argues Peter Chemin, who runs the FOX Tv and film empire for News Corporation. One person managing 20 MOVies is never going to be as involved as one doing five movies. He has thus tried to break down the studio into smaller units--even at the risk of incurring higher costs. 
It is easier for ideas to thrive outside big firms these days. in the past, if a clever scientist had an idea he wanted to commercialise, he would take it first to a big company. Now, with plenty of cheap venture capital, he is more likely to set up on his own. Umagic has already raised $5m and is about to raise $25M more. Even in capital-intensive businesses such as pharmaceuticals, entrepreneurs can conduct early-stage research, selling out to the big firms when they reach expensive, risky clinical trials. Around a third of drug firms' total revenue now comes from licensed-in technology. 
Some giants, including General Electric and Cisco, have been remarkably successful at snapping up and integrating scores of small companies. But many others worry about the prices they have to pay and the difficulty in hanging on to the talent that dreamt up the idea. Everybody would like to develop more ideas in-house. Procter & Gamble is now shifting its entire business focus from countries to products; one aim is to get innovations accepted across the company. Elsewhere, the search for innovation has led to a craze for ""intrapreneurship""-devolving power and setting up internal ideasfactories and tracking stocks (so that talented staff will not leave). 
Some people think that such restructuring is not enough. in a new book^ Clayton Christensen argues that many things which established firms do well, such as looking after their current customers, can hinder the sort of innovative behaviour needed to deal with disruptive technologies. Hence the fashion for cannibalisation-setting up businesses that will actually fight your existing ones. Bank One, for instance, has established Wingspan, an Internet bank that competes with its real branches (see page 21). Jack Welch's Internet initiative at General Electric is called ""Destroyyourbusiness.com"". 
Nobody could doubt that innovation matters. But need large firms be quite so pessimistic? A recent survey of the top 50 innovations in America, by industry Week,ajournal, suggested that ideas are as likely to come from big firms as from small ones. Another sceptical note is sounded by Amar Bhide, a colleague of Mr Christensen's at the Harvard Business School and the author of another book on entrepreneurship^^. Rather than having to reinvent themselves, big companies, he believes, should concentrate on projects with high costs and low uncertainty, leaving those with low costs and high uncertainty to small entrepreneurs. As ideas mature and the risks and rewards become more quantifiable, big companies can adopt them. 
Mr Bhide points out that such firms as Intel and Merck have tended to concentrate their research on existing core businesses, rather than chasing every shadow on the horizon. And he also thinks that it is possible to catch up, even if there are costs to being late: witness Microsoft's astonishing conversion to the Internet. many of the world's most successful service companies, including Goldman Sachs and his own former employer, McKinsey, are hardly innovators. 
Indeed, the current panic in many large firms may be driven less by any real crisis of innovation than by the inflated valuations of small Internet firms. Those valuations siphon away talented staff from big companies; they also allow companies without profits to remain independent-rather than becoming the prey of a big real-world company. And, of course, there is the psychic drumbeat of jealousy. Amazon is taking business from real-world booksellers, but would a profitable established retailer such as Barnes & Noble really be going quite so bananas if it was worth more than a profitless virtual rival such as Amazon? 
Adding to big companies' feelings of inadequacy is the way the concept of innovation is being stretched beyond product pipelines and R&D budgets. Ronald Jonash of Arthur D. Little points to how Chrysler built partnerships with suppliers. Wayne Sanders, the boss of Kimberly-Clark, thinks that innovation must include how the firm deals with retail customers and how it integrates mergers. Even in Kimberly-Clark's somewhat earthy industry, marketing ideas-for instance, selling toilet paper because it cleans well rather than because it is even softer-can be just as innovative as technological ones. No wonder firms feel that innovation is threatening them from every side. 
Second thoughts 
And yet, even though the insecurity about innovation is getting out of hand, the basic truths are hardly comforting. Unlike cutting jobs, or making an acquisition, innovation does not happen just because the chief executive wills it. indeed, it is confoundedly difficult to come up with new ideas year in, year out-especially brilliant ones. Underneath all the gurus' diagrams, lists and charts, most of the available answers seem to focus on two strengths that are difficult to create by diktat: a culture that looks for new ideas, and leaders who know which ones to back. 
At Kimberly-Clark, Mr Sanders had to discredit the view that jobs working on new products were for ""those who couldn't hack it in the real business.""He has tried to change the culture not just by preaching fuzzy concepts but also by introducing hard incentives, such as increasing the rewards for those who come up with successful new ideas and, particularly, not punishing those whose experiments fail. The genesis ofone of the firm's current hits, Depend, a more dignified incontinence garment, lay in a previous miss, Kotex Personals, a form of disposable underwear for menstruating women. 
Will all this creative destruction, cannibalisation and culture tweaking make big firms more creative? David Post, the f6under of Umagic, is sceptical: ""The only successful intrapreneurs are ones who leave and become entrepreneurs."" He also recalls with glee the looks of total incomprehension when he tried to hawk his ""virtual experts"" idea three years ago to the idea labs of firms such as IBM-though, as he cheerfully adds, ""of course, they could have been right."" innovation-unlike, apparently, sex, parenting and fitness-is one area where a computer cannot tell you what to do.

Yet, if the bill has immediately given rise to a cloud of invective, that was predictable: when it was tabled on December 13th, it was the first time in the 30 years since Quebec's separatist movement emerged as a mainstream force that the federal government had taken the initiative over the secession question. 
The cue for this was a ruling by Canada's Supreme Court in August 1998 that the federal government would be obliged to negotiate secession for Quebec if a referendum with a ""clear question"" produced a ""clear majority"". That seemingly diaphanous judgment in fact left its own murky question: what exactly does ""clear"" mean? The court said that it was not its business to give an answer. Neither does the Clarity Bill do so directly. instead, it sets out the procedure to be followed-and it is one that outrages the separatists. 
The bill says, first, that although Quebec-or, indeed, any other province-is free to hold a referendum on secession, the question put to the people must first be vetted by the federal parliament. To get its approval, the question would have to be direct and concise, and could make no mention of future economic or political partnerships with Canada. independent statehood, or stay in Canada: none of the studied fuzziness of the questions put to Quebeckers in 198o and again in 1995. 
Second, if the question is asked and the answer from the people is yes, the federal government will once again step in, to decide if the majority is adequate. Factors the bill says should be taken into account include the size of the majority, the turnout and ""any other matters or circumstances"" considered relevant. So what might be considered a ""clear"" majority? That's not, er, clear from the bill. But what the answer would not be is the traditional 50%plus-one, according to Stephane Dion, the federal minister for inter-governmental affairs, and the bill's godfather. Only after the House of Commons determined that there was ""a clear expression of the will of the population"" would the federal government negotiate a secession agreement. 
""We are forcing them to be honest,"" said Mr Chr6tien, who overrode the misgivings of three senior Quebec ministers in tabling the bill. ""Who can object?"" Not many, perhaps, in the rest of Canada, still shaken as it is by the near-death experience of the 1995 referendum, which came within a percentage point of approving secession. But many Quebeckers do object. Admittedly, approval of the bill would mean that Canada would join Austria in being the only countries whose legislation allows for their own eventual break-up. Separatists argue, however, that, though the bill makes secession possible in theory, it would become nearly impossible in practice. ""It's a veto given to jean Chretien on the future of Quebec,"" bemoans Daniel Turp, a separatist federal MP. 
Whatever its long-term impact, the bill is likely to shake the separatist movement out of a recent decline that has seen support for its cause in Quebec fall towards 30%. certainly, that is the hope of Lucien Bouchard, Quebec's premier. Within hours of the bill's publication, he promised legislation of his own reaffirming Quebec's exclusive right to determine its future. Mr Bouchard, whose resignation was rumoured just weeks ago, is also talking about holding hearings around the province to build up what he called""a sacred union"" on the issue. 
other separatist groups, knowing that nothing drives up support for secession like a real or perceived insult or injury to Quebec from the rest of Canada, have also gone to work, one group has sent a complaint to the UN Human Rights Commission, another has taken out full-page newspaper advertisements. Meanwhile, the province's labour and student federations have put aside their own protracted battles with the Bouchard government over spending cuts, and are promising demonstrations and protests. 
It is not only separatists who oppose the bill, however. Its potential to provoke the opposite of its intended effect had Joe Clark, the Conservative leader, calling it ""a road map to secession"". Alexa McDonough, who leads the New Democratic Party, initially said it was ""madness"" (though her party disagrees). Unhappiest of all is probably jean Charest, the Liberal leader in Quebec. His job requires walking an often impossibly fine line, defending federalism without seeming too compliant, and standing up for Quebec without alienating the rest of Canada. So far, Mr Charest has merely said that the federal government has no place interfering in the referendum process. But, as the debate over the Clarity Bill heats up, Mr Charest may have to retreat to the federalist side. 
The Liberals have a clear majority in the federal parliament. Since the Reform Party, the official opposition, has said it will support the bill, though seeking to amend it, its passage, if not necessarily swift, seems assured. As for Mr Chretien, who has been prime minister since 1993, some Liberals are whispering that the bid to fix the rules for secession may be his last big battle before bowing out. It looks like an effort to enter history as the man who nailed Canada together, even if with a heavy hand.

To get its approval, the question would have to be direct and concise, and could make no mention of future economic or political partnerships with Canada. independent statehood, or stay in Canada: none of the studied fuzziness of the questions put to Quebeckers in 198o and again in 1995. 
Second, if the question is asked and the answer from the people is yes, the federal government will once again step in, to decide if the majority is adequate. Factors the bill says should be taken into account include the size of the majority, the turnout and ""any other matters or circumstances"" considered relevant. So what might be considered a ""clear"" majority? That's not, er, clear from the bill. But what the answer would not be is the traditional 50%plus-one, according to Stephane Dion, the federal minister for inter-governmental affairs, and the bill's godfather. Only after the House of Commons determined that there was ""a clear expression of the will of the population"" would the federal government negotiate a secession agreement. 
""We are forcing them to be honest,"" said Mr Chr6tien, who overrode the misgivings of three senior Quebec ministers in tabling the bill. ""Who can object?"" Not many, perhaps, in the rest of Canada, still shaken as it is by the near-death experience of the 1995 referendum, which came within a percentage point of approving secession. But many Quebeckers do object. Admittedly, approval of the bill would mean that Canada would join Austria in being the only countries whose legislation allows for their own eventual break-up. Separatists argue, however, that, though the bill makes secession possible in theory, it would become nearly impossible in practice. ""It's a veto given to jean Chretien on the future of Quebec,"" bemoans Daniel Turp, a separatist federal MP. 
Whatever its long-term impact, the bill is likely to shake the separatist movement out of a recent decline that has seen support for its cause in Quebec fall towards 30%. certainly, that is the hope of Lucien Bouchard, Quebec's premier. Within hours of the bill's publication, he promised legislation of his own reaffirming Quebec's exclusive right to determine its future. Mr Bouchard, whose resignation was rumoured just weeks ago, is also talking about holding hearings around the province to build up what he called""a sacred union"" on the issue. 
other separatist groups, knowing that nothing drives up support for secession like a real or perceived insult or injury to Quebec from the rest of Canada, have also gone to work, one group has sent a complaint to the UN Human Rights Commission, another has taken out full-page newspaper advertisements. Meanwhile, the province's labour and student federations have put aside their own protracted battles with the Bouchard government over spending cuts, and are promising demonstrations and protests. 
It is not only separatists who oppose the bill, however. Its potential to provoke the opposite of its intended effect had Joe Clark, the Conservative leader, calling it ""a road map to secession"". Alexa McDonough, who leads the New Democratic Party, initially said it was ""madness"" (though her party disagrees). Unhappiest of all is probably jean Charest, the Liberal leader in Quebec. His job requires walking an often impossibly fine line, defending federalism without seeming too compliant, and standing up for Quebec without alienating the rest of Canada. So far, Mr Charest has merely said that the federal government has no place interfering in the referendum process. But, as the debate over the Clarity Bill heats up, Mr Charest may have to retreat to the federalist side. 
The Liberals have a clear majority in the federal parliament. Since the Reform Party, the official opposition, has said it will support the bill, though seeking to amend it, its passage, if not necessarily swift, seems assured. As for Mr Chretien, who has been prime minister since 1993, some Liberals are whispering that the bid to fix the rules for secession may be his last big battle before bowing out. It looks like an effort to enter history as the man who nailed Canada together, even if with a heavy hand. ",920,New Zealand,A29-9067,,False,,0,True

But it is still a region where men are macho, women are long-suffering, Catholicism dominates, and the family reigns supreme. Our reporter embarked on a personal odyssey to discover what this complex cultural mix means for Latin American gays 
To SOMEONE arriving in Mexico in May 1998, the first impression of what Latin Americans thought of homosexuality came out of loudspeakers. Every radio station and nightclub in the country was playing a song by Molotov, a rock band determined to shock with lyrics full of swearwords and an album cover showing a girl with her knickers pulled down. Society was shocked all right, and Molotov was roundly condemned for its brazenness; but nobody seemed to object to the words of ""Puto"", a thumping disco anthem that climaxed with: ""Puto, puto, matarile at mar/con-roughly translatable as ""Faggot, faggot, let's play kill the queer"". The sight of dozens of young men jabbing their arms in the air and yelling ""puto! puto!"" is not a calming one, especially if you happen to be a puto 
Take no notice, Mexican friends said soothingly; they don't mean it. Eventually, people got bored of ""Puto"". Molotov went back to making songs about drugs. But the question remained: how do Latin American societies really treat people whom they know are homosexual? 
An interview with a man running for governor of Zacatecas, a state in north-central Mexico, confirmed that gay rights are not high on the agenda.jose Narro represents the Workers'Party, a small left-wing group, and he talked in earnest and heart-warming terms about his belief in equality. So did he believe in allowing gays to marry? He fell silent, pondering. ""We believe in equality,"" he said at long last, ""but I've never really thought about that sort of equality..."" All equalities are equal, but some, it seems, are a little too equal to bear thinking about. ""You know, it's very simple,"" he concluded. ""We would have to put it to a vote, and let the people of Mexico decide."" He claimed not to be able to guess what the people of Mexico would say. 
Put homosexuality in front of them, and the people of Mexico don't say anything much. At this year's gay pride parade, thousands of homosexuals, bisexuals, drag queens, and transvestites marched down Mexico city's principal avenue, and on to its central square just as they might march in San Francisco or Berlin. Drivers chugging past wore the same looks of bemusement, amusement and occasional disgust as would drivers along London's Oxford Street. Two old men watched the spectacle shaking their heads in disbelief. But when asked their opinions, they replied: ""Each to his own."" 
This, though, is an attitude for special places and special occasions. in the metropolis, with an income that provides some independence from family, you may be able to live nearly as gay and proud as in New York or Paris. Elsewhere, homosexuals face the same attitudes as those in the North did four or five decades ago. But the number of ways Latin American gays have devised to live within those constraints is astonishing. 
Pablo (this article uses pseudonyms for those who appear only by first names) is a lawyer in his mid-20S who spent most of the pride march flouncing back and forth shouting ""Z-a-a-a-a-a-a-s!""-a sort of camp version of ""my goodness!""-at anything that displeased him. Pablo and his friends go to gay bars, gay restaurants and on gay holidays. His family knows he is gay. But he has to keep his loca (""crazy girl"") side under a tight rein at work, and does so with consummate skill: watching him switch from a hilarious one-man cabaret to a buttoned-up professional in a fraction of a second is an unnerving experience. Nevertheless, he is young and middle class, and relatively free to be what he chooses. 
Take the metro and then the bus north from the city's central square, and you eventually reach Azcapotzalco. This unprosperous part of the city is the last place you would expect to find Father Jorge, Father Rodolfo and their flock holding mass in one of the few gay churches in Latin America, an ecumenical chapel converted from the garage of the house where the two priests, partners for over 20 years, live. 
The 120-odd worshippers at their three Sunday services range from teenagers as carefree as Pablo to older men and women who have been shackled by traditional values for most of their lives. Arturo and Miguel, partners for just over five years, are both about 50 years old. Neither is especially wellto-do. And each still lives with his family, so that mass at the church is one of their few chances to see each other. Before he accepted his own homosexuality, at the tender age of 43, Arturo was not even an acting heterosexual; he lived to middle age without ever having a relationship. Now, he and Miguel are planning to ask Father Jorge to bless their union, ""But not yet,"" says Arturo cheerfully, ""because I'm a traditionalist. in my family courtships always last at least five years."" 
Latin America, like most places, has a long, disputed history of ambivalence and hypocrisy when it comes to homosexuality. ""The Maya of the Yucatan peninsula,"" writes Clark Taylor*, an anthropologist,""held large private sexual parties, which included homosexuality. However.. they were aghast at the public sexual rites of their Toltec conquerors."" Some anthropologists hold that the Aztecs, who vanquished the Toltecs in their turn, held such rituals too, although the experts at Mexico's national anthropology museum hotly deny this. 
The Spanish invaders claimed to find shocking behaviour among the natives. But, once again, the conquerors were no purer than the conquered. A 1658 court report on the trial and execution Of 14 members of a homosexual ring in Mexico city noted that the facilitator of the group was an elderly but irrepressible Spaniard known to his friends as ""Senora la Grande"" (a reference, presumably, to both his age and the size of his member), who ""had sex on all occasions, and at all times and places."" Even in hospital, where he was sent after suffering 200 lashes for false testimony, he managed to have it away with other patients, and quickly lost any chance of mercy that his age might have won him. 
Today ambivalence continues. Despite the culture of machismo, the ideal of total masculinity, Latin America is legendary for its male bisexuality. When Annick Prieur, a Norwegian anthropologist, asked her gay Mexican contact, Mema, how many men he knew who had had sex with another man, 
Mema started counting. First, he counted the 12 households closest to his own house. Then.. he counted the z7 households in the street where his mother lived. In this way he arrived at 13o men in 39 households...Out of these he affirmed that at least 82 ... had at least one homosexual experience. And this he knew because either he had seduced them himself or he knew someone else who had.t 
How could so many supposedly straight and macho men allow themselves to go to bed with a fellow who, according to Ms Prieur's description, wears bottom-hugging trousers, bleaches his hair, and does not walk, but sashays? Machismo is, in fact, the key to this puzzle. The stereotype of homosexual men as effeminate and passive is so powerful that a man who takes the ""active"" or ""masculine"" role, even with another man, is not necessarily seen as homosexual. Quite the reverse, sometimes. ""Soy tan macho que me cojo otro hombre""-I'm so macho that I fuck another man-is a Colombian saying. Ms Prieur writes: ""Contempt for the effeminate homosexual is exactly what makes bisexuality acceptance [sic] for masculine men, and this is why homophobia, machismo and widespread mate bisexuality make a perfectfit."" [author's italics] 
Even the Aztecs shared this contempt, judging by how they sometimes punished men caught in flagrante. The ""active"" partner, according to a Victorian anthropologist quoted by Mr Taylor, was merely tied to a stake, covered in ashes and left to die. However, ""the entrails of the passive agent were drawn out through his anus, he was then covered with ashes, and wood being added, the pile was ignited."" 
In this mindset, your sexual orientation isn't determined by whom you do it with, but what you do with them. It is an old distinction, going all the way back to the ancient Greeks. And it is long-lasting, for even in North America until earlier this century, before the notion of ""gay"" took hold, manly men could have sex with ""fairies"" and still think of themselves as heterosexual. in today's Latin America the ""modem"" view-in which homosexuals are no different from heterosexuals except for the trifling detail of who their partners are-jostles for space with a different and quite baffling lexicon of sexual identities (see box). 
of course, many homosexual men marry and have children while continuing secret affairs with other men. As a result, when AIDS started to take hold, faithful married women caught HIv at an alarming rate: one study of mv-positive housewives in Bogota in the early 199os estimated that 80% of them got the virus because of their husbands' bisexual affairs. What's more, because the affairs were secret, wives were catching Hiv even faster than female prostitutes, who were aware of the risks and used condoms. AIDS prevention has depended on destroying its image as a ""gay"" disease-because ""heterosexual"" men who had sex with other men thought they could not catch it. 
Machismo also means that gay women, who are less visible than gay men the world over, practically vanish in Latin America. They can be prominent in gay activism; the region's only openly gay politician at a national level is Patria Jimenez, a Mexican congresswoman. But women have less freedom than men, find it harder to get jobs, and so are even more likely to have no choice but to live with their families until a husband comes to carry them off. 
Two women living together, though, arouse less suspicion. ""Women's sexuality is denied,"" explains Sergio Abboud, an anthropologist at Rio de Janeiro's Federal Fluminense university. ""People think that a 40year-old man who hasn't married is either too sex-mad to settle on one woman, or gay. But if it's a woman, she must be frigid, or asexual, or nobody wants her-it can't be that she's lesbian."" There is a female counterpart to the male ideal of machismo: it is called marianismo, which means being like the Virgin Mary, about as explicit a denial of female sexuality as can be imagined. 
Despite prejudice, some gays don't bother to hide. Take Mema, and his coterie of gay men and transvestites in one of Mexico city's poorest suburbs. They sometimes suffer violence, especially the transvestites who sell sex on dangerous night-time streets. But their colourful, noisy progress through the toughest parts of town is usually met with nothing worse than amusement. Even in tiny backwater towns in the countryside, obvious transvestites often work in shops or restaurants, apparently unmolested. Many of Ms Prieur's Mexican contacts even consider themselves happier than gays in her native Norway, who enjoy many more legal rights but live in a buttoned-up society that has little truck with [email protected] camping about. 
Paradoxically,- obvious homosexuals seem more common in the working class. The explanation is simple pragmatism. ""Coming out"", that solemn rite of passage for gays in rich countries, isn't even an option when you share a small house with ten siblings and everyone can see that you are a bit more girly or manly than you should be. Moreover, at least one of your siblings will turn out to be something worse-a criminal, for instance. And a transvestite who works selling sex or as a successful hairdresser (the two commonest professions) may support her entire family. Because children usually live with their families until they marry, the family must get used to them, or else kick them out.""In my 25 years of research in Mexico,"" writes Joseph Carrier, an American anthropologist, I have found this to be much more an implied threat than a reality.""t 
However, not all families are quite so accommodating. in Honduras, surely one of the worst places to be gay in the entire world, Nina Cobos, the president of the country's only gay-activist group, says she knows just 20 gay couples who live together. And even that can require contortions. The invitation to dinner came from Luis and Enrique, two young men who live together in a middleclass part of Tegucigalpa, the capital. With them live Enrique's parents, his brother and sister-in-law, and their three kids. The two men have for four years shared the same room and the same bed. Before arriving, Rodrigo, a Guatemalan friend of theirs, issued instructions: ""Enrique's family doesn't know they're a couple, so don't say anything."" 
It seems preposterous. Yet as they sit with their guests in the living room, surrounded by family photos, Luis and Enrique keep up the pretence. After a few minutes it becomes second nature to flip the conversation from whether a particular movie star is gay to who will win the football whenever someone else walks through the room. Most likely, says Rodrigo, everyone tacitly agrees to feign ignorance as a way to accept the unacceptable; he himself has lived with his American boyfriend for seven years and has no doubt that his family knows, but he would still never tell them outright. 
Delve in, and there are many peculiar stories to be told. Like that of Rodrigo's cousin Carlos, who is also gay. Carlos's sister married a man who didn't like putos, and made sure everyone knew it. one day she came home to discover him in bed with her brother. They survived her wrath, and so did the marriage; but as with Rodrigo, the family still never mentions the fact that Carlos is gay. 
Or of Fidel, a young gay waiter in Nicaragua, who just shrugs when he hears about Luis and Enrique. ""I had a boyfriend who came to live with me, in my room. I told my mother he had to leave home and didn't have a place to stay. He stayed for six months before she figured it out."" 
or of Leo, a male prostitute in Rio de Janeiro. He is 19 and has been selling sex in a seedy downtown sauna (in between appearing in gay porn films) for a year. Does he consider himself gay? No, nor do any of his colleagues. ""I'd say I'm bisexual. I have a girlfriend."" Ah. And does she know what he does for a living? ""Oh, yes. She does the same thing. She earns a lot more than me, too."" 
But perhaps the most unusual gay scene of all is in Cuba. There is no gay politics, since there is no legal political activism of any sort; and there are few gay households, since it is difficult for anyone but married couples to get a state housing allocation. But every night outside the Lara cinema, in full view of Havana's tourist district, an odd crowd gathers. 
Handsome young men-some not yet even men-meet, kiss and exclaim over each other's shiny new clothes. Magazine-model women six feet high teeter back and forth on pin-sharp heels or sway glamorously in the breeze. on closer inspection they still look like women-which is impressive, since they are men too. Sometimes the crowd heads for one of the semi-legal gay bars. Tonight the whole flock decamps to an illicit party held in someone's house, where rum, salsa music, physical beauty and the tropical heat together create an atmosphere that any nightclub on the planet, if it could reproduce it, would charge a fortune for. 
At about 3am, after a fight between two transvestites breaks up the party, the crowd shifts once more, to a caf& by the Malecon, Havana's seaside ring road. More than 200 brilliant creatures hang around blocking what little traffic there is, and nobody comes to move them on or bash them up. it seems like paradise. And then Laura, one of the few real women present, punctures it. ""Almost all these guys are jineteros,"" she explains-- men who sell their bodies or just their company, for money, drinks or shiny new clothes. For anyone else, the few dollars needed to go out can be a month's wages. 
Back in Mexico city the pride march has ended. Pablo and his friends are walking off, past the police who have failed to set up a roadblock in the right place and are now half-heartedly waving traffic away from the mass of gay men and women. Time to act straight again. A cab stops; they climb in soberly. The driver glances in the rearview mirror and smiles. ""is the march over, then?"" he asks. Pablo pretends to look outraged. ""I'm not a faggot,"" he insists. ""What makes you think that? Z-a-a-a-a-a-s...""

It seems preposterous. Yet as they sit with their guests in the living room, surrounded by family photos, Luis and Enrique keep up the pretence. After a few minutes it becomes second nature to flip the conversation from whether a particular movie star is gay to who will win the football whenever someone else walks through the room. Most likely, says Rodrigo, everyone tacitly agrees to feign ignorance as a way to accept the unacceptable; he himself has lived with his American boyfriend for seven years and has no doubt that his family knows, but he would still never tell them outright. 
Delve in, and there are many peculiar stories to be told. Like that of Rodrigo's cousin Carlos, who is also gay. Carlos's sister married a man who didn't like putos, and made sure everyone knew it. one day she came home to discover him in bed with her brother. They survived her wrath, and so did the marriage; but as with Rodrigo, the family still never mentions the fact that Carlos is gay. 
Or of Fidel, a young gay waiter in Nicaragua, who just shrugs when he hears about Luis and Enrique. ""I had a boyfriend who came to live with me, in my room. I told my mother he had to leave home and didn't have a place to stay. He stayed for six months before she figured it out."" 
or of Leo, a male prostitute in Rio de Janeiro. He is 19 and has been selling sex in a seedy downtown sauna (in between appearing in gay porn films) for a year. Does he consider himself gay? No, nor do any of his colleagues. ""I'd say I'm bisexual. I have a girlfriend."" Ah. And does she know what he does for a living? ""Oh, yes. She does the same thing. She earns a lot more than me, too."" 
But perhaps the most unusual gay scene of all is in Cuba. There is no gay politics, since there is no legal political activism of any sort; and there are few gay households, since it is difficult for anyone but married couples to get a state housing allocation. But every night outside the Lara cinema, in full view of Havana's tourist district, an odd crowd gathers. 
Handsome young men-some not yet even men-meet, kiss and exclaim over each other's shiny new clothes. Magazine-model women six feet high teeter back and forth on pin-sharp heels or sway glamorously in the breeze. on closer inspection they still look like women-which is impressive, since they are men too. Sometimes the crowd heads for one of the semi-legal gay bars. Tonight the whole flock decamps to an illicit party held in someone's house, where rum, salsa music, physical beauty and the tropical heat together create an atmosphere that any nightclub on the planet, if it could reproduce it, would charge a fortune for. 
At about 3am, after a fight between two transvestites breaks up the party, the crowd shifts once more, to a caf& by the Malecon, Havana's seaside ring road. More than 200 brilliant creatures hang around blocking what little traffic there is, and nobody comes to move them on or bash them up. it seems like paradise. And then Laura, one of the few real women present, punctures it. ""Almost all these guys are jineteros,"" she explains-- men who sell their bodies or just their company, for money, drinks or shiny new clothes. For anyone else, the few dollars needed to go out can be a month's wages. 
Back in Mexico city the pride march has ended. Pablo and his friends are walking off, past the police who have failed to set up a roadblock in the right place and are now half-heartedly waving traffic away from the mass of gay men and women. Time to act straight again. A cab stops; they climb in soberly. The driver glances in the rearview mirror and smiles. ""is the march over, then?"" he asks. Pablo pretends to look outraged. ""I'm not a faggot,"" he insists. ""What makes you think that? Z-a-a-a-a-a-s...""

Rights and votes 
SIR-YOU say that belief in individual rights is a quite recent invention. Not so. Around 20OAD, Ulpian was expounding Roman law as a system based on the Stoic idea that we are all born free and equal, that slavery is against nature, and that all people, including slaves, possess a dignity that can be vindicated in legal proceedings. Do not underestimate the deep mots of human rights in European culture, even if the phrase itself is fairly recent.

SIR-Your table states that Australian aboriginals were enfranchised in 1967. Although this view is widely held, it is not correct.

Colorado, Utah, and Idaho followed Wyoming's lead about the same time that New Zealand did.

Computer memory 
SIR-You repeat the standard claim that Babbage's ill-fated attempt to build a computer cost a fortune and was eventually abandoned. You should have added: ""by Babbage"". In Stockholm, Georg and Edvard Scheutz, father and son, inspired by Babbage's writings (sometimes intentionally misleading, to avoid copycats), built not one but several calculating engines. (One is on display in Stockholm, another at the Smithsonian in Washington, DC.) While Babbage repeatedly asked for vast sums of money from Parliament, the Scheutzes succeeded on a small budget. 
You are right that Babbage should be forgotten; had he succeeded, he would have met the same fate as the two Swedes. just as Babbage had proposed, the machine was employed to calculate astronomical and mathematical tables. when you have one table there is no need for a repeat calculation, and the market turned out to be meagre indeed. So much for the suggestion that the information age would have been jump-started had Babbage succeeded in seducing Parliament yet again.

James I and Catholics 
SIR-Writing on the union between England and Scotland you say that ""James I ... was fiercely anti-Catholic, and recruited Protestants from Scotland, far more so than from England, to settle on land in Northern Ireland from which Catholic families had been removed."" You are mistaken. 
James was one of the greatest advocates of ecumenism in 17thcentury Europe. He acted as an arbiter in two major confessional crises in Europe. His wife had converted to Catholicism around 1600. Even after a group of English Catholics tried to blow up Parliament in 1605, he sought to marry his son, Henry, to a Catholic princess; after Henry's death he worked towards a Spanish Catholic marriage for the future king, Charles I. 
He was keen to settle just as many English Protestants as Scottish ones in Ireland. in most cases, Catholic families stayed on the land; only the owners had changed. Two of the leading Scottish planters, the Earl of Abercorn and his brother, Sir George Hamilton, were Catholics themselves and settled their lands in Strabane almost entirely with Scottish Catholic families.

The Kaiser's war 
SIR-In casting the blame for the first world war you are too kind to Kaiser Wilhelm. We now know that he and his military cabinet were ready to begin war early in 1913, aware that neither France nor Russia was ready. The only hold-up was the insistence of Admiral Tirpitz that it would be better to wait for the Baltic-North Sea canal to be widened and deepened (due in July 1914) and a submarine harbour on Heligoland to be completed. This was reluctantly conceded. But instructions were given for a press campaign to prepare Germans for the rigours of a just war. Preparations were made for the supply of armies in the field, and the Reichsbank started buying and hoarding gold without regard to cost. 
German diplomacy was focused on what was deceivingly called a policy of ""localisation"": representing the murder of Archduke Ferdinand as a purely Austro-Serbian matter, with possible input from Russia but no subject for intervention by other powers. Even so, the peace initiative of Sir Edward Grey, Britain's foreign secretary, came close to success; but the Kaiser wanted war. 
The British Foreign Office had changed its tone since the 1890s from suspicion of France and Russia to suspicion of Germany. But Grey had worked tirelessly to improve relations, not only in the naval field but to give Germany the ""place in the sun"" that it so ardently desired. Unfortunately, Germany did not understand that Britain did not have a lien on the whole world, and that (British interests apart) the views of other powers had to be taken into account, so that the desired territorial concessions could not be slipped into Germany's pocket without demur. This was taken in Germany as a deliberate snub, increasing anti-British feeling. 
The allies rejected efforts for peace. But the German leadership, until the desperate days of late 1918, had made it perfectly plain that the only peace it would accept would be on its own terms: what it had won by force it would keep. The leadership at once disowned the (powerless) Reichstag's peace resolution of April 1917. 
In sum, the Kaiser's Germany, following a course at least partly set by Bismarck's earlier brutal wars of conquest, destroyed Europe's chance of ioo years of peaceful development. Your title should have been not ""Attempted suicide"" but ""Attempted murder"".

SIR-I have no doubt that you published God's obituary to challenge your readers. Equally, I have no doubt that you did so in the conceit of thinking that to be published was not to be damned. The undoubted strengths of The Economist are its greatest undoing: its intellectual rigour; its distillation of dizzying amounts of information into concise prose; and its rationality. This makes The Economist required reading, but also explains why you often miss the point in the subjective world of the emotions which the bulk of mankind inhabits and in which you fear to tread. 
When you do address matters of faith or other subjects about which people feel passionately yet subjectively, you do so with the arrogance of the quick yet solely rational mind. Essentially the obituary talked entirely of religion-man's effort to bind himself to God-and not of the revelation whereby God has made Himself known to man, and continues to do so.

Home-grown temptresses had been tried with only varying success. An American houri is a contradiction. in the 192.os Theda Bara (an anagram of Arab Death) had done her vampish best to sully the minds of clean-living Americans, and had been much attacked from the pulpits of the mid-west, but her seductive powers had diminished when it emerged that her real name was Goodman and she had been born in Cincinnati. Miss Lamarr, though, was from deepest Europe, from Vienna. Not only was she disturbingly beautiful, but in a European film, ""Ecstasy"", she had appeared in the nude. She was the real thing. 
Sadly, none of her American films turned out to be memorable. She was starred with many of the biggest names in the Hollywood repertory company, Clark Gable, Spencer Tracey, Victor Mature, John Garfield, and so on. All her films made money, some a lot. Women were sufficiently envious of her to copy her hairstyle, with its central parting. But male pulses remained normal. Men left the cinema no more discontented with their women than they previously were. Hollywood was careless of her talent. once she was put in a comedy, as a foil to Bob Hope, another time in a western. Yet, although her last forgettable film was made back in the 195os, Hedy Lamarr's name has retained a lingering association with the timeless idea of the femme fatale, a reason for writing about her. 
Sexual attraction was not just a matter of looks, Miss Lamarr said. ""Any girl can be glamorous-all you have to do is stand still and look stupid."" You should have a brain as well as a body, she said. She was an admirer of Mata Hari, a spy in the first world war, who was both a seductress and a military expert. Louis B. Mayer, a Hollywood boss, was charmed by Miss Lamarr's talk as well as her looks when he first met her in London. He got her to change her name from Hedy Kiesler, and gave her a seven-year contract to work for MGM. But on the way to Hollywood some of her allure was seemingly mislaid. 
A new habitat 
Moving from her native environment was probably what went wrong for Miss Lamarr, as it can do for any animal. Even Marlene Dietrich, for all of her success in America, never repeated the sensuality she brought to ""The Blue Angel"", made in Germany in 1930. Greta Garbo retained the persona she had brought from Sweden, but it was her air of mystery that made her so watchable, rather than her sexuality. Sex was Hollywood's main product, but the movie bosses decreed, confusingly, that it should be wholesome. The film community might live in a sink of waywardness, but none of that got on to the screen. In ""White Cargo"", made in 1942, Miss Lamarr gamely said she set out to be ""a memorable nymphomaniac"". But there was no sympathy for five-syllable words in MGM, and the sexiest thing about ""White Cargo"" was its title. 
She often thought of returning to her native Austria, but never did. In 1938 the Germans had taken over Austria and her father, a doctor, and her mother, a pianist, had left the country. ""Ecstasy"", made in 1932 when she was A, remains the film she is most remembered by. Today it seems inoffensive, but it was condemned by the pope and banned in a number of countries, including the United States. Miss Lamarr's's fans have traced a number of earlier films she made in Berlin. 
Fritz Mandl, a Viennese arms maker who became the first of her six husbands, tried, fortunately without success, to buy up all copies of ""Ecstasy"". He objected to all the world seeing his wife running naked through a wood, swimming in a pool and seemingly enjoying making_ love. 
Miss Lamarr easily fell in love. Like Miss Dietrich she said, ""I can't help it."" Granting her a divorce from one of her husbands, the judge advised her that she should spend more than a month getting to know a future spouse. 
She was defensive about all her marriages, and her affairs. ""I did what I did for love,"" she said. ""I'm a hell of a nice dame."" She sued a writer who, she said, had written about her in ""an obscene, shocking, scandalous, naughty, wanton"" way, but the case went against her. As a result of this and other litigation, the millions of dollars she had earned in Hollywood were dissipated as lawyers' fees, and in later years she had little money. 
As it happens, Miss Lamarr might have made a second fortune out of an idea she developed with George Antheil, a composer she met in 194o at a party in Hollywood. Applying their knowledge of musical harmony they devised a technology for military communications. in 1942 they were granted an American patent for the invention. The army was not interested, the patent eventually expired and the couple never profited. Today, though, a development of the invention, known as spread-spectrum technology, is being used in a wide range of electronic products, including mobile phones. Engineers reckon the concept is, so to speak,just beautiful. ","WHEN Hedy Lamarr arrived in Hollywood she was seen as a rare and desirable acquisition: a genuine decadent, a temptress to send male pulses racing, and create envy in women's hearts. Home-grown temptresses had been tried with only varying success. An American houri is a contradiction. in the 192.os Theda Bara (an anagram of Arab Death) had done her vampish best to sully the minds of clean-living Americans, and had been much attacked from the pulpits of the mid-west, but her seductive powers had diminished when it emerged that her real name was Goodman and she had been born in Cincinnati. Miss Lamarr, though, was from deepest Europe, from Vienna. Not only was she disturbingly beautiful, but in a European film, ""Ecstasy"", she had appeared in the nude. She was the real thing. 
Sadly, none of her American films turned out to be memorable. She was starred with many of the biggest names in the Hollywood repertory company, Clark Gable, Spencer Tracey, Victor Mature, John Garfield, and so on. All her films made money, some a lot. Women were sufficiently envious of her to copy her hairstyle, with its central parting. But male pulses remained normal. Men left the cinema no more discontented with their women than they previously were. Hollywood was careless of her talent. once she was put in a comedy, as a foil to Bob Hope, another time in a western. Yet, although her last forgettable film was made back in the 195os, Hedy Lamarr's name has retained a lingering association with the timeless idea of the femme fatale, a reason for writing about her.

Last weekend he won an important battle, but it will not be his last. 
Mr Manning's logic is simple. At the last federal election in 1997, the Liberals won 387. of the vote and 155 seats, whereas Reform and the Progressive Conservatives (the Tories) split a similar share of the vote equally but won only 80 seats. In particular, this split helped the Liberals in Ontario, where they won all but two Of 103 seats. 
However, much divides the two parties. Reform is strong in the west, has populist, socially conservative roots in small-town politics and is especially hostile to Quebec's claims to special treatment. By contrast, the Conservatives have a centrist ""red Tory"" tinge in their strongholds in Quebec and the Atlantic provinces. And Joe Clark, the Tory leader, is especially hostile to Reform. 
Mr Manning's response has been to sidestep Mr Clark. At its convention at the end of January, Reform welcomed instead a large contingent of supporters of Mike Harris, Ontario's tax-cutting Conservative premier. ""Think big!"", Mr Manning urged the delegates, in a speech in camp-fire manner, recalling Reform's 12-year march from an Alberta kitchen to its place as the country's second party. They did: by a surprisingly large 75-257- margin, they voted to create a new, broader party, to be called the Canadian Alliance. 
That decision must still be ratified by a two-thirds majority in a postal ballot of Reform's 65,000 members in March,but it looks as if Mr Manning's plan has soared over its first hurdle. The harder obstacle is persuading Tories to join the Alliance. That task is taking the form of trying to discredit Mr Clark. He is handicapped by having no seat in the House of Commons, and he is seen asa figure of the past- he was briefly prime minister in 1979. But his moderate views are shared by many Conservatives voters. 
Mr Manning's bet is that the future lies with Mr Harris's style of conservatism. The Alliance begins life with a promise to support a 17% flat federal income tax, while making some concessions to the centre, such as accepting Canada's official bilingualism (which Reform disliked). 
But does the future also have a place for Mr Manning as the new party's leader? At 57, his public image is fixed as that of a homespun defender of western interests, with an oft-mimicked drawl. The Ontario recruits are ready to demand a leader of their own kind. one contender is Tom Long, a Toronto businessman who is Mr Harris's chief political strategist. A compromise candidate would be Stockwell Day, Alberta's finance minister, who gave the convention's most eloquent speech (and a kick-boxing demonstration during a break). Unlike Mr Manning, Mr Day speaks passable French and is witty (he embraced family values by referring to ""the two founding genders""). 
If the new party is blessed in the referendum, the Alliance will then go on to pick its leader in June. Ironically, the crowning achievement of Mr Manning's career may also mark its sunset.

SIR-Sandra Feldman's impassioned defence of America's public schools (Letters, April 22nd) is at best disingenuous. Ms Feldman points to lower drop-out rates and higher graduation rates as evidence of mounting success, but these statistics are manifestations of the most deplorable and widespread of educational practices: grade inflation. In America's public schools only the most behaviourally problematic students can avoid a high-school diploma. 
As a philosophy professor at a medium-sized state university, I teach the fruits of Ms Feldman's supposed success. Although my students are predominantly from the very schools for which she claims a rising tide of achievement, their abilities belie those claims. Rare is the student who can construct consistently a simple declarative English sentence. Rarer still is the student possessed of even the most basic vocabulary suitable for university-level work. Rarest of all is the student capable of the most elementary forms of reasoning.

SIR-Do not blame the teachers or lack of funding for America's educational ills (""America's education choice"", April ist). Put the blame squarely where it belongs; on the media and, partially, on the kids themselves. Their sheeplike infatuation with popular teen culture, which glorifies ignorance, laziness and disrespect for their own community and elders, makes it almost impossible to teach them anything. Until teens work out the fact that they will eventually pay a steep price for their incompetence and naivety, the problem will persist, no matter how much is spent. 
Teens have always been a difficult lot to motivate. There was a reason why schools of old relied on various forms of physical threat. Nothing else gets through their thick skulls. 
Vancouver GEOFF WILKINSON 
SIR-It is not true that ""education in America is a matter Largely for the states"" except in a legal sense. In fact, all school systems are run locally. Although practices vary from state to state, most boards of education are locally elected to hire and fire superintendents and teachers, decide curriculums, propose budgets, and even choose textbooks. There are no qualifications for election, not even a primary school diploma. 
There is not much prospect of changing this political sacred cow. It is a good thing we do not run our hospitals like this.

My wife, like many public school teachers, puts in 6o-hour work weeks throughout the school year. If your proposal to transfer tax money from the public schools to religious schools which deny much of modern science is not tongue in cheek then it is downright dangerous.

On paper 
SIR-In your review of ""The Social Life of Information"" by Paul Duguid and John Seely Brown (April i5th) you recall a charming anecdote: a medical historian attempts to trace i8th-century cholera outbreaks by sniffing old documents for signs of vinegar which was used to disinfect paper. It would be somewhat difficult to trace cholera outbreaks in i8thcentury American towns since cholera did not reach North America, or Europe for that matter, until the 1830s. Letters were treated in the manner mentioned during yellow fever epidemics.

Cuban comparisons 
SIR-If Cuba had not been what you call a ""sad, failed remnant of communist central planning"" (""The pawns of Fide1"", April 22nd) it might have achieved the level of economic success enjoyed by neighbouring countries which have been blessed with free markets these 40 years-Guatemala, Honduras, Jamaica, Haiti and the Dominican Republic. 
Methuen, 
Massachusetts ALAN MARTIN 
Sterling work 
SIR-Your leader on the strength of sterling (""Hard pounding"", April 15th) is far too sanguine about the effects of a high pound, and ignores a policy option which would help deal with the problem. The high pound is hurting not just the car industry. The whole of Britain's tradable sector is in substantial distress. Manufacturing output has been falling since November, manufacturing investment is down 13.5% over the year, farm incomes are declining and there is a loss of factory employment of nearly 250,000 since early 1998. Exports are falling whether measured by value or by volume in the latest quarter compared with the previous quarter. Given the expansion of Britain's export markets, this is a serious loss of market share. 
To ignore this evidence of exchange-rate misalignment, and all the studies showing sterling's overvaluation from the IMF and others, is downright complacent. The longer overvaluation persists, the worse the ultimate decline is likely to be; and the greater the inflationary and interest-rate implications for the whole economy. This is a classic exchange-rate overshoot, like that in 1981. 
The obvious policy response is intervention to cap the sterling rate, build up foreign-exchange reserves, and offset the monetary effects by issuing sterling debt. Such sterilised intervention has been employed repeatedly by Germany's Bundesbank, and the American Treasury. It is not always successful-notably in Japan-but equally it does not have a downside. Sterling is so unsustainably high that importers are merely building up profit margins, curbing the anti-inflationary effects of a high pound and the inflationary impact of a fall. 
If the intervention was conducted against the dollar, the interest carry cost of the new sterling bond issuance would be lower than the revenue from the us Treasury bond investments, making a profit for the exchequer. Against the euro, there would be no cost. Why not try it?

Sweet talk 
SIR-The sugar industry owns sod of the agricultural land, causing the majority of the pollution in the Everglades (""Sugar solution"", April 22nd). Worse still, the various levels of government continue to squabble over how taxpayers' funds are to be spent cleaning up the mess. However, if the subsidies, tariffs and the Cuban trade embargo were not in place, and Americans were able to purchase freely sugar at world prices, would the American sugar industry still be competitive? 
Probably not: the price of sugar would drop, America's sugar industry would decline and the pollution of the Everglades would decrease. This would reduce clean-up costs for taxpayers, and the invigorated Caribbean economies would use their sugar-export dollars to purchase more goods from America.

Zimbabwe's land-grab 
SIR-Your article on land reform in Zimbabwe (""The long struggle for Zimbabwe's land"", April i5th) omits to mention the consequences of redistribution for people employed on commercial farms. They have little chance of sharing in land redistribution but will lose their current livelihoods. Even if done fairly, redistribution is likely to result in more people living in poverty, not less.

Global is good 
SIR-Although it is difficult to pinpoint attitudes among the relatively leaderless protesters in Washington, Dc, the great majority of protesters are not against globalisation (""Today's pig is tomorrow's bacon"", April 22nd). What the protests were against was the way multinational corporations use the IMF and World Bank to manipulate globalisation to their advantage at the cost of the world's poor, labour interests and the environment. 
It is the acceptance of globalisation that explains the involvement of so many prosperous Americans in defending the plight of people in other countries.

Prosecuting genocide 
SIR-In your report on international prosecutions of Rwandans responsible for the genocide in 1994 (""Still wanted"", April 22nd) you name six countries where such criminals have been apprehended, but not Switzerland. However, the Swiss military justice-the competent authority to investigate war crimes in Switzerland-has arrested two former Rwandan government officials. One was extradited in 1997 to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in Tanzania. The other, a former mayor in the province of Gitarama, was sentenced a year ago to life imprisonment by a Swiss military court. He is awaiting trial before a Swiss military appeal court next month in Geneva.

Choosing sides 
SIR-I was intrigued by your suggestion (""France scores an own goal"", April 22nd) that European civil servants should ignore treaty obligations regarding the freedom of movement of workers within the eu in order to limit the number of ""foreigners"" allowed in football club teams. This does not go far enough. If a team is called Newcastle United or Nantes, one should expect its players to come from that city. Equally, Chelsea or Tottenham Hotspur should only have players from the relevant London boroughs. 
Suitable bureaucratic regulations could put an end to pernicious practices such as players selling their skills to the highest bidder, or managers buying the best players in order to make their businesses more successful. 
Frankfurt SIMON KEYS 
Lacking invention 
SIR-The problems arising from the grant of low quality patents also involve the European Patent Office (ero) (""Who owns the knowledge economy?"", April 8th). Increasingly, the management of the office is neglecting its duty to the public by treating the Eeo not as the public-service organisation it is, but as a business entity. Staff are put under continually increasing pressure to deal with cases in less time. The fundamental problem is that the sro is outside the framework of the eu, or indeed any other democratically accountable organisation. This has been recognised by the European and German parliaments. In both, demands were made for the status of the EFO to be changed to make it publicly accountable. 
The Staff Union of the European Patent Office (SUEPO) believes that the only way to counter this move and safeguard quality in the granting of intellectual property rights in Europe is to make the Ero publicly accountable by integrating it into the framework of the Eu.

SIR-You state that the purpose of patents ""is to reward inventors so as to encourage future invention."" This is off the mark. The purpose is to get them to disclose their inventions and thus allow further invention, based on the original, by others as well as the originator. Patent offices increasingly allow inventors to disclose little more than the basic idea. Patent attorneys have become expert at disclosing nothing. 
Newton,

El Salvador's economy 
SIR-Foreign banks have operated in El Salvador for some time now, not since last year as you say (""Dollars and debts"", April 8th). Citibank has been continually present in El Salvador for over 36 years and has had a full branch licence for over six years. Other foreign banks have also been present for some years. 
Furthermore, the country is not facing a dilemma between dollarisation and devaluation. Dollarisation is indeed a viable policy option thanks to a conservative and successful monetary policy adopted over the past ten years which has led to economic stability, single-digit inflation and high levels of international reserves. The alternative to dollarisation is not necessarily devaluation. A floating currency might actually appreciate against hard currencies. 
Dollarisation is not a policy espoused by the banking sector to avoid the impact of devaluation on $5oom in foreign debts held by the banks. The banks are not unanimously in favour of dollarisation. The foreign debts represent only 6% of total bank assets and the effect on these liabilities is mitigated by the dollar assets banks create with this funding through export-credit financing. Consequently, it is inaccurate to portray local banks as large-scale borrowers of dollar funds which are then placed locally at higher local-currency rates. 
In order to counteract slow growth, El Salvador must develop an array of economic policies alongside a choice of currency regime. Couching the country's policy choices as being between dollarisation and devaluation, against a backdrop of collusion between banks and government, is unfair and misrepresents the progress made by the country over the past ten years.

Assailants 
SIR-There is more to the story on fire ants (""The fire ants are coming"", April 15th). There exists a juvenile-growth hormone which prevents the ants from maturing past the drone stage. Lacking productive workers, the colony eventually starves. It is a thoroughly ef fective remedy, but it has flaws. To be of any value the bait has to be spread simultaneously over a huge area; otherwise neighbouring colonies move into vacated tunnels. That suggests the need for action coordinated by the government-never a route to expedited solutions. 
Also, the hormone takes three months or more to destroy a colony. Those bitten tend to be impatient and generally prefer the glorious immediacy of, say, flaming diesel fuel. As one victim told me, ""I want to hear them suckers scream."" Oh well, it is good to know there is an answer, even if we never get to use it. Much of life is like that. 
Stamford, 
Connecticut TOM WELLS 
SIR-Perhaps fire ants have wreaked more destruction than you let on. The map illustrating your story appears to show that the ants have eaten the entire border between Mississippi and Alabama, creating the super-state of Missabama. At this rate they could cause the entire ""Old South"" to merge and rise again.

Given the expansion of Britain's export markets, this is a serious loss of market share. 
To ignore this evidence of exchange-rate misalignment, and all the studies showing sterling's overvaluation from the IMF and others, is downright complacent. The longer overvaluation persists, the worse the ultimate decline is likely to be; and the greater the inflationary and interest-rate implications for the whole economy. This is a classic exchange-rate overshoot, like that in 1981. 
The obvious policy response is intervention to cap the sterling rate, build up foreign-exchange reserves, and offset the monetary effects by issuing sterling debt. Such sterilised intervention has been employed repeatedly by Germany's Bundesbank, and the American Treasury. It is not always successful-notably in Japan-but equally it does not have a downside. Sterling is so unsustainably high that importers are merely building up profit margins, curbing the anti-inflationary effects of a high pound and the inflationary impact of a fall. 
If the intervention was conducted against the dollar, the interest carry cost of the new sterling bond issuance would be lower than the revenue from the us Treasury bond investments, making a profit for the exchequer. Against the euro, there would be no cost. Why not try it?

Sweet talk 
SIR-The sugar industry owns sod of the agricultural land, causing the majority of the pollution in the Everglades (""Sugar solution"", April 22nd). Worse still, the various levels of government continue to squabble over how taxpayers' funds are to be spent cleaning up the mess. However, if the subsidies, tariffs and the Cuban trade embargo were not in place, and Americans were able to purchase freely sugar at world prices, would the American sugar industry still be competitive? 
Probably not: the price of sugar would drop, America's sugar industry would decline and the pollution of the Everglades would decrease. This would reduce clean-up costs for taxpayers, and the invigorated Caribbean economies would use their sugar-export dollars to purchase more goods from America.

Zimbabwe's land-grab 
SIR-Your article on land reform in Zimbabwe (""The long struggle for Zimbabwe's land"", April i5th) omits to mention the consequences of redistribution for people employed on commercial farms. They have little chance of sharing in land redistribution but will lose their current livelihoods. Even if done fairly, redistribution is likely to result in more people living in poverty, not less.

Global is good 
SIR-Although it is difficult to pinpoint attitudes among the relatively leaderless protesters in Washington, Dc, the great majority of protesters are not against globalisation (""Today's pig is tomorrow's bacon"", April 22nd). What the protests were against was the way multinational corporations use the IMF and World Bank to manipulate globalisation to their advantage at the cost of the world's poor, labour interests and the environment. 
It is the acceptance of globalisation that explains the involvement of so many prosperous Americans in defending the plight of people in other countries.

Prosecuting genocide 
SIR-In your report on international prosecutions of Rwandans responsible for the genocide in 1994 (""Still wanted"", April 22nd) you name six countries where such criminals have been apprehended, but not Switzerland. However, the Swiss military justice-the competent authority to investigate war crimes in Switzerland-has arrested two former Rwandan government officials. One was extradited in 1997 to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in Tanzania. The other, a former mayor in the province of Gitarama, was sentenced a year ago to life imprisonment by a Swiss military court. He is awaiting trial before a Swiss military appeal court next month in Geneva.

Choosing sides 
SIR-I was intrigued by your suggestion (""France scores an own goal"", April 22nd) that European civil servants should ignore treaty obligations regarding the freedom of movement of workers within the eu in order to limit the number of ""foreigners"" allowed in football club teams. This does not go far enough. If a team is called Newcastle United or Nantes, one should expect its players to come from that city. Equally, Chelsea or Tottenham Hotspur should only have players from the relevant London boroughs. 
Suitable bureaucratic regulations could put an end to pernicious practices such as players selling their skills to the highest bidder, or managers buying the best players in order to make their businesses more successful.

Lacking invention 
SIR-The problems arising from the grant of low quality patents also involve the European Patent Office (ero) (""Who owns the knowledge economy?"", April 8th). Increasingly, the management of the office is neglecting its duty to the public by treating the Eeo not as the public-service organisation it is, but as a business entity. Staff are put under continually increasing pressure to deal with cases in less time. The fundamental problem is that the sro is outside the framework of the eu, or indeed any other democratically accountable organisation. This has been recognised by the European and German parliaments. In both, demands were made for the status of the EFO to be changed to make it publicly accountable. 
The Staff Union of the European Patent Office (SUEPO) believes that the only way to counter this move and safeguard quality in the granting of intellectual property rights in Europe is to make the Ero publicly accountable by integrating it into the framework of the Eu.

SIR-You state that the purpose of patents ""is to reward inventors so as to encourage future invention."" This is off the mark. The purpose is to get them to disclose their inventions and thus allow further invention, based on the original, by others as well as the originator. Patent offices increasingly allow inventors to disclose little more than the basic idea. Patent attorneys have become expert at disclosing nothing. 
Newton,

El Salvador's economy 
SIR-Foreign banks have operated in El Salvador for some time now, not since last year as you say (""Dollars and debts"", April 8th). Citibank has been continually present in El Salvador for over 36 years and has had a full branch licence for over six years. Other foreign banks have also been present for some years. 
Furthermore, the country is not facing a dilemma between dollarisation and devaluation. Dollarisation is indeed a viable policy option thanks to a conservative and successful monetary policy adopted over the past ten years which has led to economic stability, single-digit inflation and high levels of international reserves. The alternative to dollarisation is not necessarily devaluation. A floating currency might actually appreciate against hard currencies. 
Dollarisation is not a policy espoused by the banking sector to avoid the impact of devaluation on $5oom in foreign debts held by the banks. The banks are not unanimously in favour of dollarisation. The foreign debts represent only 6% of total bank assets and the effect on these liabilities is mitigated by the dollar assets banks create with this funding through export-credit financing. Consequently, it is inaccurate to portray local banks as large-scale borrowers of dollar funds which are then placed locally at higher local-currency rates. 
In order to counteract slow growth, El Salvador must develop an array of economic policies alongside a choice of currency regime. Couching the country's policy choices as being between dollarisation and devaluation, against a backdrop of collusion between banks and government, is unfair and misrepresents the progress made by the country over the past ten years.

Assailants 
SIR-There is more to the story on fire ants (""The fire ants are coming"", April 15th). There exists a juvenile-growth hormone which prevents the ants from maturing past the drone stage. Lacking productive workers, the colony eventually starves. It is a thoroughly ef fective remedy, but it has flaws. To be of any value the bait has to be spread simultaneously over a huge area; otherwise neighbouring colonies move into vacated tunnels. That suggests the need for action coordinated by the government-never a route to expedited solutions. 
Also, the hormone takes three months or more to destroy a colony. Those bitten tend to be impatient and generally prefer the glorious immediacy of, say, flaming diesel fuel. As one victim told me, ""I want to hear them suckers scream."" Oh well, it is good to know there is an answer, even if we never get to use it. Much of life is like that. 
Stamford, 
Connecticut TOM WELLS 
SIR-Perhaps fire ants have wreaked more destruction than you let on. The map illustrating your story appears to show that the ants have eaten the entire border between Mississippi and Alabama, creating the super-state of Missabama. At this rate they could cause the entire ""Old South"" to merge and rise again.

Instead, the air force is mostly employed to rescue stricken sailors, to protect fishing fleets and to entertain crowds at air shows.

Neither claim rings particularly true.

TODD RAMSEY, IBM's worldwide head of government services, does not beat about the bush. ""About 85% of all public-sector it projects are deemed to be failures,"" he says. That does not mean they are total disasters, but that they usually take longer to implement, cost more and deliver less than was planned. For anyone who is getting overexcited about e-government, that is a sobering reflection. 
At least the reasons why big government IT projects get into difficulties are well understood. The trouble often starts with the way contracts are awarded, typically by tender. This can be a nightmare. Steve Dempsey, Andersen Consulting's egovernment specialist in Britain, says tender documents often run to 1,000 pages, and picking the winner can take i8 months. 
At that point, according to Mr Ramsey, the contract can become a battleground as both sides take out their frustrations on each other. Often the customer-ie, the agency or government department involved-deserves blame for poor project management and inflexibility, but vendors too must take their share for over-promising and under-bidding. They, in turn, would argue that this happens because public servants tend to award contracts on the basis of price rather than value, quality or past performance. 
Another problem-not unique to the public sector, but especially prevalent there-has been a tendency for IT integration firms to over-customise (and thus over-complicate) applications. This is because officials are reluctant to ask a highly unionised workforce to change its working practices so that software can be used straight out of the box. 
And changes could involve more than working practices; they could entail big job losses too. There may be scope for retraining some clerical and counter staff to improve offline customer service, but many existing workers will not adapt to new working patterns. Private industry can redeploy people more easily by changing its remit, but that is not an option for government departments and agencies whose goals and powers are usually mandated by statute. 
With so much scar tissue around, the confidence shown in the prospects for e-government may seem surprising. But according to Elizabeth Echols, a member of Al Gore's electronic commerce working group, ""People on the Hill are desperate to link their names to anything with an `e' on it"" For Tony Blair, Britain's prime minister, the Internet is crucial to the modernisation of government which he believes must be carried out if non-conservative parties which support the idea of an active state are to have a long-term future. As for the vendors-the big infrastructure and software firms as well as the iT integrators-they keep saying that the Internet changes everything, so they had better believe it themselves. 
On the technology front, at least, the Internet, or rather the success of Internet standards and protocols, has indeed changed things a great deal. It is the Internet's open standards, allowing everyone to connect with everyone else, which are the basis of its power. In past government rT projects, special programmes had to be written for every application to make it work with the assortment of hardware and software chugging away in every government department. But today's web applications, often written in the Java programming language, are designed to run straight from the Internet browser. 
What is more, virtually all the technologies that will make e-government possible are already working for e-business. For example, applications for enterprise resource planning, customer-relationship management and supply-chain management, business intelligence and data-mining tools, Internet procurement and payment systems are all available now and need very little adaptation for publicsector use. In the same way, the security protocols, the multi-layered firewalls and the public key infrastructures needed for authentication and the protection of data are already available off the shelf. Even the vendors, always keen to offer their own patent solutions, agree that technology is not a barrier to the introduction of e-government. 
In the past, government iT projects have been earned through from beginning to end within a single department or agency. That has meant that they have often merely streamlined existing work processes instead of redesigning them or getting rid of them altogether. But just as Internet technologies have forced many big businesses to change what they do as well as the way they do it, so they are about to transform the biggest and most changeresistant business of all-government. 
Four far-from-easy steps 
The way to e-government divides into four distinct stages. The first stage-which is as far as most governments today have got-involves departments and agencies using the web to post information about themselves for the benefit of citizens and business partners. Thousands of such ""one-way"" communication sites are already up and running. In the second stage, these sites become tools for twoway communication, allowing citizens to provide new information about themselves-such as a change of address-instead of telephoning or writing. There are also plenty of these around, although many depend on e-mail. 
During the third stage, things start to get more interesting. At this point, websites allow a formal, quantifiable exchange of value to take place. It might be renewing a licence, paying a fine or enrolling for an educational course. There are several hundred such sites, mostly operating at the state or local government rather than central government level. More sophisticated versions can guide applicants through making a claim for benefit or filing a tax return. Examples include the Pennsylvania Department of Labour's site and Britain's new Inland Revenue site that went live in April (only to be taken down for repairs a week or so later). Such sites substitute an element of web-based self-service for work previously carried out by public servants, and need to be coordinated with offline channels. They begin to challenge traditional working practices and processes. 
The final stage, of which more later, is a portal that integrates the complete range of government services, and provides a path to them that is based on need and function, not on department or agency. A single log-on and password allows users to get in touch with any part of government. Many governments have plans for such portals, but at present only two such sites are anything other than local: MAXI, operated by Australia's state of Victoria, and Singapore's eCitizen Centre. 
The British government's experience in preparing to launch its ux Online portal illustrates some of the problems. On the face of it, Britain, with a highly centralised government, a parliamentary democracy and a powerful prime minister who sees himself as a ""moderniser"", should be well placed to move quickly. Its targets are highly ambitious: 25% of its services are meant to be available online by 2002, and 100% by 2005. But the difficulties are immense. According to Andersen Consulting's Steve Dempsey, nobody has really grasped the extent of the change that is called for or, for that matter, the sheer inefficiency within government that will be exposed by this project. 
Mr Dempsey should know: Andersen Consulting has played a pioneering role in the management of big public-service IT projects. Five years ago it won the contract to build a new system for Britain's National Insurance records (NiRS) that eventually went live last year. With 65m National Insurance accounts, more than $60 billion in contributions and over loom online transactions each year, not to mention annual changes in the law that affect the whole system, it was a project of huge scale and complexity. 
It was also the first big IT project carried out under the Private Finance Initiative, a scheme designed to shift funding and risk to the private sector. In return for designing and building the system, Andersen will receive payments on a per-usage basis for seven years. Although NIRS eventually turned out to be a success, it illustrates the difficulties that bedevil work for the public sector, says Mr Dempsey. ""There was simply no partnership with the Department of Social Security, and as a consequence the relationship soured."" 
ux Online has been split into two projects: one to design and build the site, the other to integrate the systems of all departments to create the single gateway to government that is the point of the portal. The prospect of working on the gateway-likely to be a L2 billion project-has vendors such as Ens and IBM licking their lips, but there is also trepidation. 
Mr Dempsey frets that it is not clear who in government will ultimately be responsible for the project, or how and where it will be funded. The government's ""e-envoy"", Alex Allan, is based in the Cabinet Office, which has already said that each department should make its own preparations for integration. But somebody should be asking whether all of these departments will still make sense once services are delivered electronically. The Inland Revenue, Britain's tax-collection agency, has proposed that because it is much further down the e-road than any other department, it should make the decisions about vital technical standards that will allow data to be transferred between departments. As a precedent, it can cite Singapore's successful e-Citizen project, which has been led by the Ministry of Finance. 
There are other worries too. The government's advisers are quite sensibly thinking about a publicprivate partnership that would, in effect, create a joint venture. But as IBM's Mr Ramsey points our. ""At the end of the day, it's the government that has to control the channel."" In other words, unless the government is committed to making the portal its preferred way of doing business, people may not use it. 
Keep it bite-sized 
Britain's push to turn itself into an e-government has won widespread acclaim. Al Edmonds, the retired American Air Force general who runs the government division of the world's biggest systems integrator, EDS, even describes Britain as ""the template"" for what other governments, including his own, are trying to do. There is nothing wrong with a project as ambitious as the gateway: Mr Ramsey says that when it comes to e-government portal architecture, ""cheap and cheerful won't give you the foundation you need to grow."" But the technology firms are saying something else as well: beware of trying to bite off more than you can chew. 
Mr Ramsey feels that such projects need to be broken down into smaller segments, for example, getting every agency to agree to use just one system for procurement on the web. Oracle's Jay Nussbaum also warns against ""The Big Bang of trying to do too much too fast "" Mr Nussbaum claims that outlining a vision and strategy is the easy bit. Among other success factors that are needed, he suggests, are a profound understanding of the principles of ebusiness, and a realistic assessment of the organisation's readiness for what is about to hit it. 
In common with other vendors, Mr Nussbaum also emphasises the importance of scoring some quick wins to boost morale. His highly practical mantra is: ""Start small, scale fast, deliver value."" David Kleinberg, a feisty deputy chief financial officer at the us Department of Transportation, who has been working with Oracle to put much of his operation on the web, took on some zo ""rr baronies"" within his sprawling department. ""By eating a slice at a time,"" he says, ""they now see the value and they want to play-the costs just come oozing out of the system."" 
Britain's ux Online is much bigger than any integrated portal either running now or coming soon, and some anxiety can be sensed even within the ranks of government evangelists. John Clark of the Cabinet Office's Performance and Innovation Unit, who is preparing a report on electronic service delivery, reckons that if the portal is to be a success, there is a lot of work to be done that most people in government have not even thought of yet. The big organisational question remains largely unanswered: how do you motivate people to accept massive change in the absence of overwhelming market pressure? Mr Clark concluded a recent presentation with a salutary quote from George Bernard Shaw: ""Reformers have the idea that change can be achieved by brute sanity."" 
E-government is definitely not for the politically timid or half hearted. One-stop, non-stop e-government portals will revolutionise not just the way public services are delivered, but government itself as well. The trouble with revolutions is that they rarely go according to plan. They also have a nasty habit of eating their own young. ","Why the transition to e - government will hurt

"" There was simply no partnership with the Department of Social Security , and as a consequence the relationship soured . "" 
 ux Online has been split into two projects : one to design and build the site , the other to integrate the systems of all departments to create the single gateway to government that is the point of the portal . The prospect of working on the gateway - likely to be a L2 billion project - has vendors such as Ens and IBM licking their lips , but there is also trepidation . 
 Mr Dempsey frets that it is not clear who in government will ultimately be responsible for the project , or how and where it will be funded . The government 's "" e - envoy "" , Alex Allan , is based in the Cabinet Office , which has already said that each department should make its own preparations for integration . But somebody should be asking whether all of these departments will still make sense once services are delivered electronically . The Inland Revenue , Britain 's tax - collection agency , has proposed that because it is much further down the e - road than any other department , it should make the decisions about vital technical standards that will allow data to be transferred between departments . As a precedent , it can cite Singapore 's successful e - Citizen project , which has been led by the Ministry of Finance . 
 There are other worries too . The government 's advisers are quite sensibly thinking about a publicprivate partnership that would , in effect , create a joint venture . But as IBM 's Mr Ramsey points our . "" At the end of the day , it 's the government that has to control the channel . "" In other words , unless the government is committed to making the portal its preferred way of doing business , people may not use it . 
 Keep it bite - sized 
 Britain 's push to turn itself into an e - government has won widespread acclaim . Al Edmonds , the retired American Air Force general who runs the government division of the world 's biggest systems integrator , EDS , even describes Britain as "" the template "" for what other governments , including his own , are trying to do . There is nothing wrong with a project as ambitious as the gateway : Mr Ramsey says that when it comes to e - government portal architecture , "" cheap and cheerful wo n't give you the foundation you need to grow . "" But the technology firms are saying something else as well : beware of trying to bite off more than you can chew . 
 Mr Ramsey feels that such projects need to be broken down into smaller segments , for example , getting every agency to agree to use just one system for procurement on the web . Oracle 's Jay Nussbaum also warns against "" The Big Bang of trying to do too much too fast "" Mr Nussbaum claims that outlining a vision and strategy is the easy bit . Among other success factors that are needed , he suggests , are a profound understanding of the principles of ebusiness , and a realistic assessment of the organisation 's readiness for what is about to hit it . 
 In common with other vendors , Mr Nussbaum also emphasises the importance of scoring some quick wins to boost morale . His highly practical mantra is : "" Start small , scale fast , deliver value . "" David Kleinberg , a feisty deputy chief financial officer at the us Department of Transportation , who has been working with Oracle to put much of his operation on the web , took on some zo "" rr baronies "" within his sprawling department . "" By eating a slice at a time , "" he says , "" they now see the value and they want to play - the costs just come oozing out of the system . "" 
 Britain 's ux Online is much bigger than any integrated portal either running now or coming soon , and some anxiety can be sensed even within the ranks of government evangelists . Helen Clark's , reckons that if the portal is to be a success , there is a lot of work to be done that most people in government have not even thought of yet . The big organisational question remains largely unanswered : how do you motivate people to accept massive change in the absence of overwhelming market pressure ? Helen Clark concluded a recent presentation with a salutary quote from George Bernard Shaw : "" Reformers have the idea that change can be achieved by brute sanity . "" 
 E - government is definitely not for the politically timid or half hearted . One - stop , non - stop e - government portals will revolutionise not just the way public services are delivered , but government itself as well . The trouble with revolutions is that they rarely go according to plan . They also have a nasty habit of eating their own young .",920,New Zealand,A29-9067,IN TERM,True,Mr Clark,2,True

THERE can be few more depressing places than the politics section of an American bookshop. Here, in the cradle of liberty-the place that nobly urges the rest of the world to copy its institutions-you Team that politicians are unprincipled rogues who will do anything for money but have no opinions of their own. To succeed, these books leave you thinking, you have to be an able robot (Al Gore), a likeable dimwit (George W. Bush) or a lovable rogue (Bill Clinton). 
Even the titles of the newest books""The Money Men"", ""Truth at any Cost"" and ""Hell to Pay""-are grimly pessimistic. For the rest of this year, you infer, politics will be, first, two empty conventions, then several months of soundbites and unrelenting attack ads, and finally the presidency falling to the least scrupulous (and best funded) candidate. 
This pessimism falls into two schools. One holds that the entire system is rotten. Jeffrey Bimbaum's informative book on fund-raising, ""The Money Men"", lays out the evidence. A mere 38% of Americans bothered to vote in 1998. Politicians spend their lives dialling for dollars, concentrating on the 100,000 or so people who give virtually all the money and the smaller group who have their telephone numbers. One scene has three congressional aides calling donors and then putting them through to the politician so he can beg from them in person. Incumbent politicians have the most to sell in the way of favours and perks, so they raise most money and virtually all of them get elected. 
Mr Birnbaum does not go over the top. He argues that most donors are not trying to ""control"" anything; they like to name-drop and send their friends notes on White House paper. Money, he points out, really only of fects a tiny number of appointments; it will not-alone-make you president. Indeed, he almost implies that the money men are the screening process that allows only good candidates into the race. 
All the same, the tone of his book is as damning as any John McCain speech. Why should well-funded groups, such as the National Rifle Association, the Christian Coalition or the American Association of Retired Persons, have such influence? Why should the parties have to invent ever more ingenious methods to raise soft money? Why should a political candidate spend a third of his time trying to raise money from rich people? 
The other books do not address the subject as directly, but they offer plenty of supporting evidence. Having once been out-- Christianed and out-gunned in a Texan congressional race, George W. Bush learnt his lesson. Ever since, he has sucked up to the Right almost as much as he has to Big Oil. Al Gore was drawn into the messy financing for the 1996 elections by Mr Clinton. 
This points to the other school of pessimism, which puts the first family at the centre of the decline in American politics. Monica books and Clinton-bashers continue to dribble out. ""Truth At Any Cost"" by Susan Schmidt and Michael Weisskopf offers an insiderish, though over-sympathetic, view of the Starr investigation. But the general focus has moved on to Hillary Clinton. In ""Hell to Pay"", Barbara Olson, an investigative counsel on ""Travelgate"" and ""Filegate"", simply over-does it. Exhausted perhaps by trying to track down this slippery legal quarry, Ms Olson can't even bear to give Mrs Clinton a nice picture on the jacket. The result: despite all the evidence garnered against her, by the end one feels sorry for the First Lady. 
Peggy Noonan's ""The Case Against Hillary Clinton"" is more persuasive. Ms Noonan writes well; and although she was a Reagan speech-writer, she hates (or appears to hate) her subject far less than most of her peers. Indeed, Ms Noonan claims to have welcomed the Clintons in 1992 (""they had guts, came from nowhere, were bright and hard driving""). Ms Noonan sometimes tries to be over-inventive (there is a rather tedious dream sequence about Hollywood fundraisers). But in the end, her point is a fairly simple one: Clintonism amounts to nothing more than the unprincipled pursuit of political power-where friends, scruples and especially ""little people"" (like those who worked in the White House travel office) are easily sacrificed. The most damning passage is a retelling of the Monica story replacing the Clintons with George and Barbara Bush. Within a few paragraphs, the reader simply cannot imagine the Bushes getting into such a pickle, or lying so publicly to get out of it. 
If Ms Noonan is on the side of those who seem to believe that, ""Clintons-really-do-- represent-a-new-low"", ""The Hunting of the President"" is on the other. Messrs Conason and Lyons set out to prove that Mrs Clinton's problems are all the fault of a right-wing cabal. Their evidence is interesting, particularly on the influence of the Arkansas anti-Clintonites. Yet the impartial reader will most likely react with a huge ""yes, but"". There are plenty of people who want to get the Clintons; but the main reason why anti-Clintonism keeps on spreading is surely that the Clintons kept on doing low-down things. 
The debate about how far the Clintons have debased public office will doubtless rumble on in American bookshops for years. But it still seems fair to ask a deeper question: is American politics really that bad? 
Gloom about politics is hardly new. One only has to look at a Hogarth print or read Alan Clark's diaries for a dim view of politics in Britain. Socrates and Aristophanes were hardly polite about the Athenian democracy. In 1864, Abraham Lincoln warned: ""As a result of the war, corporations have been enthroned, and an era of corruption in high places will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavour to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the republic is destroyed."" 
A century and a half later, the republic is still there-as are two fairly decent presidential candidates. True, Mr Bush and Mr Gore spend too much time chasing money and sucking up to pressure groups. Yet much as their biographers probe at them, both the vice-president and the governor of Texas emerge as broadly respectable. 
Mr Bush was a late starter in politics and a lucky businessman; but even the entertaining ""Shrub"" ends up painting him as something more than just a likeable man with a famous name: there are, the authors admit, achievements, notably in education, and also a steely determination. ""W"", a more heavyweight and certainly less amusing tome, also reaches a similar conclusion, stressing the jovial Texan governor's fierce desire to avenge his father's defeat. 
Bill Turque's excellent ""Inventing Al Gore"" concentrates on his awk ward father, Senator Al Gore. (Even Tipper Gore has joked about her husband's Oedipal complex.) The contradictions that make Mr Gore so frustrating as a politician make him an interesting biographee.

Luckily, for the reader, American politics, and political books, are loaded with tiny, all-too-human contradictions-from the pushy fund-raiser who was shunned by her peers after sitting next to Bill Clinton to the strange fact that Bill Bennett, the Republican's dean of virtue, once dated Janis Joplin.

NIKOLAI BERDYAYEV, a radical Christian philosopher who fell foul of the Bolsheviks, once said that in Russia ""westernism"" was an oriental phenomenon. What he meant was that Russians who yearn for their country to be more rational and more liberal are often prompted by a mystical, eastern Utopianism, quite foreign to the pragmatic and realistic West. 
Other Russians pondering their eternal identity crisis-are we Asians, Europeans, or some unique synthesis?have reached an opposite conclusion. The i9th-century Slavophiles, who insisted on how different Russia was from the West, were influenced, despite themselves, by German romanticism. To complicate things even more, the Tsarist-ra tradition of oriental studies-which included Iran and Turkey as well as China-drew on stereotypes of eastern luxury, sensuality and cruelty which originated in i8th-century France. 
Irresistible as tidy dichotomies like this may be, any honest attempt to distinguish ""eastern"" from the ""western"" in the heritage of Russia (and indeed the Balkans) has to take into account the multiple ways in which paired notions like these overlap and converge. We are dealing here with porous borders and with ideas that loop back on themselves, not with opposites which ne'er shall meet. 
Handling these subtleties is one of the challenges facing Victoria Clark in ""Why Angels Fall"", a fascinating exploration of ""eastem-Orthodox Europe...whose separate values, traditions and therefore history"", she thinks, ""we have at best denigrated, at worst ignored."" A writer with considerable literary talent, she describes her wide-ranging travels with zest and humour. 
Her journey takes her to the war zones of ex-Yugoslavia; to ancient strongholds of Greek Christianity such as Patmos and Istanbul; to old and new monasteries in rural Romania; and to some extraordinary places in Russia. These include the newly revived community at Optina, whose sages inspired the writers of the i9th century; and Solovki, the Arctic archipelago where a monastic fortress became a Bolshevik death camp. 
Her tears, as she sails away from Solovki, are among the most moving moments in a narrative that is personal without being self indulgent. Among the impulses that drive her story forwards is a keen, if not openly articulated, spiritual thirst which some of her Orthodox interlocutors-in between sparring about war and politics-can instantly pick up. 
She is, in fact, making several journeys at once. Her training as a secular journalist and her instincts as a travel-writer prompt her to seek out some of the extreme and bigoted representatives of Orthodoxy: clerics who are convinced, for example, that recent events in the Balkans begin and end with a conspiracy against their faith and the countries where it is practised. Skilfully described, and sometimes hilariously lampooned, these people make for some lively reading. Orthodox readers may find her selection unfair; non-Orthodox readers may wonder why, if eastern Christianity is as weird and wacky as she describes, she still feels such fascination and affection for its followers and their way of life. 
Ms Clark certainly does feel a powerful attraction to the culture, both high and popular, of traditionally Orthodox countries. The architecture of Gracanica monastery, which now serves as headquarters for Kosovo's moderate Serbs, enchants her. No less fondly, she describes the refectory food at nearby Decani, another gem of medieval architecture and bastion of tolerance: ""smoked cheese, white sheep's cheese, two sorts of ratatouille (one with egg, one without), gooey chocolate cake."" 
But what of the spiritual nourishment that places like Decani, where people of all ethnic backgrounds took refuge during Kosovo's blood-bath, have to offer? What are we to make of the intriguing prediction by Decani's Father Sava Janjic, known as the cyber-monk for his prolific use of the Internet, that ""the future of Orthodoxy lies in the West"". ""Here in Eastern Europe,"" he says, ""people are still too enchanted by the glamour and glitter of the West. The West itself is now ready for the spiritual food we can offer."" 
If that observation is wellfounded, then it calls into question a great deal of what Ms Clark has been told by her other informants, for example, the Greek, Serbian or Russian nationalists who see Orthodoxy as inseparably tied to particular countries, regions or geopolitical groupings, not by the twists and turns of history but by its very nature. 
Before puzzling over its origins, it is worth asking if there really is such an Orthodox block in international affairs in the first place. Its existence has been claimed both by outsiders-Samuel Huntington for oneand by Balkan insiders, who half-convince Ms Clark of the ""defensive war that easternorthodox Europe is waging to hold its own, spiritually and territorially"" against a heartless West and fast-breeding Muslims. 
Of course, if enough people believe this depressing theory, it will become true, turning an imagined community of nations into a real one. For now, the idea of an Orthodox block is of limited analytical use. How does it fit, for example, with Russia's support for Muslim Abkhazia against Orthodox Georgia, or with Romania's willingness to back NATO against the Serbs? What does certainly exist, in the post-communist and post-Ottoman world, is a lingering geopolitical rivalry between Russia, Turkey and their respective allies. This fault-line is sometimes portrayed in religious terms, but religion is not much help in explaining, say, Russia's ties with Iran, or Azerbaijan's with the West. 
Ms Clark's most interesting insights have to do with the ways which ""eastern"" and ""western"" Christendom have continued to affect, and unfortunately, define one another since their formal separation in 1054. As she explores the history of Balkan nationalism-as dark and viscous a mixture as any monastic gateau-we are reminded how the ideal of the nation state, a product of the i9th-century West, was superimposed on the complex models of multi-ethnicity to be found in Byzantine and Ottoman times. 
One of the main things that make the exploration of the post-ottoman world so confusing is a form of historical time-lag. Although the West itself has in many ways moved on, i9th-century western nationalism was so deeply internalised by the people of the region that many of them now regard it, along with other discarded western products, as an ""eastern"" phenomenon. Indeed, the current battle between church and state in Greece might-provocatively but not inaccurately-be described as a tussle between i9th-century western nationalism and i8thcentury western secularism. 
Neither of these impulses has much to do with Orthodox theology at its purest and most rigorous, which stresses that all human beings, regardless of ethnicity or geography, are made in, and never entirely lose, the image of God. Politics is not everything, and cultures can co-exist with or without agreement on such deeper issues. Orthodoxy may forgive Augustine for writing in Latin, not Greek, but it wishes he had not darkened his understanding of sin and evil with the stormy dualism of the pre-Christian east.

Its existence has been claimed both by outsiders - Samuel Huntington for oneand by Balkan insiders , who half - convince Helen Clark of the "" defensive war that easternorthodox Europe is waging to hold its own , spiritually and territorially "" against a heartless West and fast - breeding Muslims . 
 Of course , if enough people believe this depressing theory , it will become true , turning an imagined community of nations into a real one . For now , the idea of an Orthodox block is of limited analytical use . How does it fit , for example , with Russia 's support for Muslim Abkhazia against Orthodox Georgia , or with Romania 's willingness to back NATO against the Serbs ? What does certainly exist , in the post - communist and post - Ottoman world , is a lingering geopolitical rivalry between Russia , Turkey and their respective allies . This fault - line is sometimes portrayed in religious terms , but religion is not much help in explaining , say , Russia 's ties with Iran , or Azerbaijan 's with the West . 
 Helen Clark's most interesting insights have to do with the ways which "" eastern "" and "" western "" Christendom have continued to affect , and unfortunately , define one another since their formal separation in 1054 . As Helen Clark explores the history of Balkan nationalism - as dark and viscous a mixture as any monastic gateau - we are reminded how the ideal of the nation state , a product of the i9th - century West , was superimposed on the complex models of multi - ethnicity to be found in Byzantine and Ottoman times . 
 One of the main things that make the exploration of the post - ottoman world so confusing is a form of historical time - lag . Although the West itself has in many ways moved on , i9th - century western nationalism was so deeply internalised by the people of the region that many of them now regard it , along with other discarded western products , as an "" eastern "" phenomenon . Indeed , the current battle between church and state in Greece might - provocatively but not inaccurately - be described as a tussle between i9th - century western nationalism and i8thcentury western secularism . 
 Neither of these impulses has much to do with Orthodox theology at its purest and most rigorous , which stresses that all human beings , regardless of ethnicity or geography , are made in , and never entirely lose , the image of God . Politics is not everything , and cultures can co - exist with or without agreement on such deeper issues . Orthodoxy may forgive Augustine for writing in Latin , not Greek , but it wishes he had not darkened his understanding of sin and evil with the stormy dualism of the pre - Christian east .

But they have never been in the country's economic or political mainstream. In recent years, they have struggled as traditional industries have collapsed. Yet suddenly the Atlantic provinces are receiving unusually close attention from Ottawa. 
Earlier this summer, the prime minister, jean Chretien, led 60 local businessmen and the region's four provincial premiers on a mission to Boston to try to drum up investment from the United States. In June, Mr Chretien went to Nova Scotia to announce that the federal government would spend C$700m ($472m) over five years to support new businesses and other development in the area. It was ""a time of great potential for Atlantic Canada,"" he proclaimed. 
And always will be, cynics might add. Only half the promised money was new, and Mr Chretien was vague about what it might be used for, mentioning ""ocean engineering"" in Newfoundland, and information technology in Cape Breton Island, the poorest part of Nova Scotia. 
Home to 2.3m people, the Atlantic provinces have yet to find reliable alternatives to their past mainstays of fishing, lumber and military bases. Average wages in Atlantic Canada are only two-thirds of the national figure. There is an expanding oil and gas industry, but this does not generate jobs and spread cash around as the cod fishery once did, before over-fishing destroyed it. Previous attempts to diversify with government support, such as making sports cars in New Brunswick and growing cucumbers in Newfoundland, have failed amid media scorn. 
In Cape Breton Island, where Alexander Graham Bell pursued many of his inventions a century ago, Ottawa has offered C$zom to support a call centre at Sydney, whose coal mines and steel mill are dying. But the island's best bet may be tourism. It can boast puffins, whales and folk art. Cheticamp, a former fishing town, is a mecca for tourists seeking handsome hooked rugs. It is perhaps the only town in North America where one may, without offending, ask a respectable-looking woman, ""Are you a hooker?"" But the season is limited, and facilities are variable. 
Many of the visitors are politicians. Mr Chretien's interest in the region is unsurprising: Liberals have been swept from office in three of the four Atlantic provinces since 1996. They took only ii of the region's 32 seats in the 1997 federal election (and not a single seat in Nova Scotia). But if the prime minister is to win the third term he covets, the Liberals must do better in the Atlantic provinces, since they face a revitalised opposition in Ontario and western Canada. 
Other party leaders have their eyes on the Atlantic provinces too. It is home turf for Alexa McDonough of the leftish New Democrats, while Joe Clark, the Progressive Conservative leader, an Albertan by birth, is seeking at least temporary entry to the House of Commons through a by-election in Nova Scotia on September 11th. 
The region's four provincial premiers have formed a joint council to lobby in Ottawa. But to what end? Nova Scotia's John Hamm wants increased federal transfer payments for health and social provision. New Brunswick's Bernard Lord calls for ""a hand up, not a handout""; he wants money for training, rather than cash to keep seasonal workers alive during the winter. But unless the politicians find ways to halt the exodus of young people from the Atlantic provinces to Toronto and Alberta, the money may not make much difference.

The French government made fuel-tax concessions to pressure groups, including lorry owners and farmers, who had brought much of the country to a standstill by blockading roads and petrol stations. The cave-in inspired copycat protests across much of the European Union. 
British protesters, following the French example, blockaded refineries and all but halted fuel deliveries throughout the country. As petrol ran out, Britain's prime minister, Tony Blair, ruled out immediate concessions to the protesters. His early efforts to get fuel deliveries resumed were largely unsuccessful, but in response to appeals by Mr Blair and others, protesters started to lift the blockades. 
Jose Bove, leader of France's small farmers and hero of its movement against globalisation, said he would appeal against a three-month jail sentence given to him on September 13th for his role in smashing up a McDonald's restaurant site a year ago. 
The 14 countries of the European Union, which had imposed diplomatic sanctions seven months ago against their fellow member, Austria, after a far-right party had joined its ruling coalition, lifted them after a report by ""three wise men"" said that the country's human-rights record was up to scratch. 
Francesco Rutelli, the mayor of Rome, said he would run against Italy's prime minister, Giuliano Amato, to be the candidate of the centre-left in the next general election, due next spring. 
Leaders of a group of countries that had been part of the Soviet Union, including Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan and Moldova, said they would co-operate more closely to resist Russian influence. Russia said that the citizens of several former Soviet countries would no longer enjoy visafree travel to Russia. 
Chaos averted 
More than 2,000 protesters against globalisation disrupted the World Economic Forum in Melbourne, Australia. The organisers called off the protest after three days, ending fears that it would be a repetition of the anti-globalisation chaos at the World Trade Organisation meeting in Seattle in 1999. 
In Myanmar restrictions on Aung San Suu Kyi and her opposition National League for Democracy were eased by the ruling junta. She had been locked in her house for two weeks. 
With Libyan assistance, four European hostages were freed after being held for 20 weeks in the Philippines by a Muslim gang, the Abu Sayyaf. A Libyan foundation, run by one of Colonel Muammar Qaddafi's sons, again stagemanaged the affair. The Abu Sayyaf then seized three further hostages from a Malaysian resort. 
The trials began in China's Fujian province of at least 200 officials accused of evading tariffs on the import of cars and other luxury goods. Chinese newspapers and television were barred from reporting the trials. 
A bomb exploded in a garage beneath the Jakarta stock exchange, killing 15 people and injuring many more. Police said the blast may have been set off by supporters of Suharto, as a protest against putting the former president on trial.

Taking its cue from Yasser Arafat, the Palestine Liberation Organisation's Central Council side-stepped the long-awaited September 13th deadline for declaring an independent Palestinian state. The declaration has now been postponed at least until November i5th. Syria, condemning Israeli ""blackmail"", called for an Arab summit.

But this week the final members of the cast of characters took their seats. In by-elections held on September nth, the leaders of Canada's two right-of-centre parties each won entry to the federal parliament. Stockwell Day, of the Canadian Alliance, won a British Columbian seat with 70% of the votes; Joe Clark, of the Progressive Conservatives, won easily, too, in Nova Scotia. 
That sets the stage for what is already promising to be a long winter of unofficial campaigning. It will be enlivened by the arrival of Mr Day. The Alliance was formed earlier this year when the western-based Reform Party, the official opposition, decided to reinvent itself in a search for broader appeal. Mr Day defeated Reform's Preston Manning in a leadership election in june. 
The latest polls give the Alliance around zap, while the Conservatives have sunk to10%, alongside the left-of centre New Democrats and the separatist Bloc Quebecois. After seven years in power, the Liberals, led by the prime minister, Jean Chretien, still enjoy the support of 46%, though slightly less in Ontario whose ioi seats are the main prize. 
In the 1997election, Reform and the Conservatives each won 19% of the vote. But Reform, with its support concentrated in the west, won 60 seats; the Conservatives won just 20. They have since faded further. Mr Clark, briefly prime minister in 1979-80 and an experienced parliamentarian, returned as party leader in 1998. But he mistakenly chose to remain outside the House of Commons while trying to build the party's strength across the country. His members of parliament grew restless: defections have cut their number to 15, all but two from the Atlantic provinces. The latest defections cast a pall over Mr Clark's by-election victory, with the Liberals leaking the word that two of his Quebec Mrs were about to cross to the government ranks. 
When Parliament reassembles on September 18th, attention will focus on how Mr Day, as leader of the official opposition, matches up in debate against Liberal ministers. Mr Chretien, whose parliamentary career began almost four decades ago, seems to relish the coming combat in Question Period. He has attacked his opponent for courting Quebec nationalists, referring to ""Blocwell"" Day and his ""Unholy Alliance"". 
But if he hopes to ridicule his new opponent's ideas for tax reform and portray him as a rigid Christian conservative, he may come off second-best. Mr Day has shown himself quick in political repartee, deft at answering bluster with disarmingly soft words: As Alberta's provincial treasurer, he has more recent experience of economic management than Mr Chretien, who was a mediocre finance minister in the 1970s. Meanwhile, Mr Clark, leading the smallest of five parties in the Commons, will have little chance to make his mark in Question Period. 
But the election remains Mr Chretien's to lose. This week, he wrapped up an important political deal on health funding with all ten provincial premiers, after six months of argument. Ontario and Quebec had disliked Ottawa's insistence on the provinces having to account more tightly for their spending, in return for receiving an additional C$23.5 billion (US$15.9 billion) over five years. But the money was too tempting. Had the deal failed, the prime minister might have talked himself into an early election on this risky issue. As it is, he has the winter to wear down Mr Day.

This year's is an unusually large crop. So we offer readers a quick guide to the juiciest-and most poisonous. 
In ""Servants of the People: The Inside Story of New Labour"" (Hamish Hamilton; L17.99), Andrew Rawnsley, a Westminster commentator, describes high-level rows between Tony Blair and his chancellor, Gordon Brown. The book's claim that Mr Brown lied about campaign donations prompted gleeful Conservatives to call for him to go. 
No such controversy dogs ""A Life in the Jungle"" (Hodder & Stoughton; L20). Michael Heseltine's autobiography was supposed to set the record straight about the fights that crowded the career of the tall, blonde and handsome former Conservative minister whom the press dubbed ""Tarzan"". Most memorable, though, are the odd details: in the democratic, swinging 1960s, Mr Heseltine employed a liveried chauffeur and had his garden gates recast with his initials MRDH. 
Tallish, blondish and not so handsome, though still surprisingly popular, Mo Mowlam, like Mr Heseltine, is storming out of ministerial life, but not without flicking a few knives as she passes through the door. Having been replaced as Northern Ireland secretary by Peter Mandelson, she concentrates on him, on Mr Brown and, of course, on Mr Blair. Although Julia Langdon's ""Mo Mowlam"" (Little, Brown; L16.99) was not meant to be an official biography, Ms Langdon is as close to being Ms Mowlam's appointed scribe as it is possible to be. So you can safely assume that if there is any blood on her ministerial colleagues-- and they are a thick-skinned lot on the whole-Ms Mowlam meant it to be there. 
Vegetarian though he was, Alan Clark, a former Conservative Mr who died last year, also knew how to use a dissecting knife. Mr Heseltine was an early victim, as Ms Mowlam might have been had she been around at the time: Clark made a fuss about not liking ugly women. Clark's diaries revealed him to be lusty, indiscreet and amusing-all good characteristics in a diarist, though it will be interesting to see how well they have aged. The first volume bounced into the bestseller lists in 1993. The second, ""Into Politics: The Long-Awaited Years"" (Weidenfeld & Nicolson; L20), which is under embargo until October Lath, is awaited, at least by those mentioned in the index, with a mix of eagerness and trepidation. 
""Unconventional Minister: My Life Inside New Labour"" (Michael Joseph; L16.99), the memoirs of a former Labour minister, Geoffrey Robinson, are causing sleepless nights in Downing Street. Mr Robinson, a rich Blair backer, lent the prime ministerial favourite, Mr Mandelson, a large sum to buy a large and expensive London house. Mr Blair says he knew nothing of the transaction, though Mr Robinson may have another story to tell when the book comes out on November 2nd. 
Advance word on Jo-Anne Nadler's semi-official, unsensational biography of William Hague, ""In His Own Right"" (Politico's Publishing; L17.99), suggests it will be the perfect antidote fox those who have over-indulged on all or any of the above.

Perhaps not always. Back in the 1980s, a couple of youthful American economists jointly wrote some influential academic papers with such gripping titles as ""The Noise Trader Approach to Finance"". In 1988, The Economist said they were among the eight best young economists in the world. 
In the 1990s, the two decided to sully their hands. One pursued a career in politics, and was this week feted in Prague. Well done, Larry Summers, America's treasury secretary. But the real world has been less kind to Andrei Shleifer, his erstwhile coauthor. This week, the American government launched a $120 lawsuit against Mr Shleifer, and against Jonathan Hay, a legal expert, and Harvard University. 
As Russia stumbled towards its version of capitalism in the 1990s, Messrs Shleifer and Hay advised the government on privatisation and other reforms. The lawsuit relates to advice they gave while working for the Harvard Institute for International Development (HIID) on contracts for which it received over $40m in American government grants. The suit alleges that the two Harvard advisers ""abused their positions and attempted to tip the playing-- field to their own advantage"". It suggests that Messrs Shleifer and Hay worked with Mrs Shleifer and the now Mrs Hay to make investments in Russia that were prohibited under the terms of the contract. The government thinks that Harvard did not supervise the advisers adequately. 
These accusations first surfaced in 1997. This year, HIID was wound up, though its rump survives as the Centre for International Development, run by Jeffrey Sachs, who used to head HIID. The government's decision to launch the lawsuit at this late stage, and to demand so much money, suggests that it wants to send the strongest possible signal about the standards it expects from its consultants.

Antipodean currencies THE plunge of the euro is as nothing beside the drop in two currencies on the other side of the globe. The Australian and New Zealand dollars have both fallen by more than 20% against the American dollar since January, to all-time lows. So fed up are New Zealanders with the kiwi dollar that some are even contemplating currency union with Australia. 
Against the American dollar, the kiwi is now 44% cheaper than it was at the end of 1996. The Aussie dollar is 35% cheaper. This partly reflects the fact that both currencies were previously overvalued. But it is also the converse of the current strength of the greenback. Unlike America, both Australia and New Zealand are perceived as ""old economies"", dependent on resource-based industries (an inaccurate impression, as it happens, since both countries spend more of their GDP ON IT than does America). Both also have large current-account deficits, 5% of GDP in Australia and almost 8% in New Zealand, that are even bigger relative to cnr than America's deficit of 4%. 
In New Zealand, the sliding currency has put monetary union with Australia on the agenda. A recent study by two leading New Zealand economists reported that more than 80% of 400 firms surveyed were in favour. In recent weeks, Helen Clark, New Zealand's prime minister, has also suggested that a currency union with Australia may be desirable and even inevitable. 
One argument in favour is that, by eliminating exchange-rate uncertainty, it would boost trade with Australia and make foreign direct investment more attractive. Also,transaction costs for firms trading between Australia and New Zealand would fall if they no longer needed to convert between the two currencies. And by reducing the currencyrisk premium that investors demand For holding kiwi dollars, it would lower real interest rates. Over the past three years real long-term bond yields have been on average 14 percentage points higher in New Zealand than in Australia. 
Some of these benefits would be modest, however. Although Australia is New Zealand's biggest trade partner, it accounts for only zz% of its exports. New Zealand is even less important to Australia, accounting for a mere 8% of its exports. Linking the kiwi dollar to the Australian dollar would not eliminate the overall risk of exchange-rate volatility facing New Zealand firms. Four-fifths of the country's trade would still be affected. 
The main drawback of a currency union is the loss of an independent monetary policy to cushion the economy against external shocks. The likelihood is that interest rates would, in effect, be set for the needs of the Australian economy. The cost of this to New Zealand would depend on how closely the two economies move in step. 
On the surFace, they have much in common. Both depend on commodity exports, both trade heavily within the Asia-Pacific region and there is (almost) free movement in trade, labour and capital between the two countries. But there are also some big differences, such as the composition of their commodity exports: New Zealand's top exports are dairy, meat and forestry products, whereas Australia's top three are coal, iron ore and gold. World prices for these can move quite differently. 
A study by Dominic Wilson at Goldman Sachs finds that both interest rates and the exchange rate in New Zealand have tracked those in Australia fairly closely over the past decade; so if New Zealand had adopted the Aussie dollar, policy might not have been radically different over the period as a whole. But the economic cycles of Australia and New Zealand have at times diverged substantially and could do so in future-at a high cost to New Zealand, were its currency tied to the Australian dollar. If the world price of minerals surged, say, but the prices of farm products fell, Australia's economy would boom, maybe justifying higher interest rates, while New Zealand's sank, creating a need for lower rates. 
Nevertheless, Mr Wilson concludes that currency union would, on balance, bring some small benefits for New Zealand. Any gains for Australia would be negligible. This may explain why there is far keener interest in monetary union in New Zealand. 
Will neighbours become good friends? Some of New Zealand's enthusiasm owes nothing to sound economics. it partly reflects failing business confidence due to the policies of the new Labour government. Trade unions have been given more power in wage bargaining, for instance. Some supporters of currency union think that it would allow New Zealand to grow as fast as Australia. But as Don Brash, governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, has said, ""Currency union is not a magic path to substantially faster growth. it is no substitute for domestic policies that promote stronger productivity growth."" 
Another popular argument is that currency union would mean better monetary policy. New Zealand's central bank is widely thought to have pursued an excessively tight policy in comparison with Australia's. New Zealand has been seen as a model of centralbank independence, and it was the first to introduce inflation targeting. But even model central banks can make mistakes. with hindsight, it held interest rates too high for too long in 1997-98 after the Asian crisis. But you do not need to scrap the central bank to change monetary policy. indeed, such a proposal raises the suspicion that many who favour currency union see it simply as a backdoor way to looser policy. 
The biggest obstacles are political. New Zealanders talk about a union in which the two countries both adopt a new currency. But Australians laugh at the idea of replacing their dollar. If union happens, it will not be a merger but a takeover, with New Zealand adopting the Australian dollar. From an economic point of view this would make little difference, for even under a currency union New Zealand would, in effect, cede control of its monetary policy to Australia, as Australia's economy is seven times bigger. But politically, adopting the Australian dollar, as opposed to creating a new joint currency, is a tough sell. New Zealanders detest losing to Aussies at anything.

Although Tony Blair said he was neutral, it became plain to Labour backbenchers that the prime minister thought Sir George should win. More than a score of his ministers supported the Tory.

OTTAWA 
HOW many national parties are there in Canada? The prime minister, Jean Chretien, campaigning in the general election he has called for November 27th, claims that his Liberals are the only one. Typical hubris, you might think. Mr Chretien himself has argued that this election is a two-horse race between the Liberals and the main opposition, the Canadian Alliance, led by Stockwell Day. Three other parties held 84 seats out of 301 when the House of Commons was dissolved. And on November 8th and 9th, two televised debates in French and English put Mr Chretien and Mr Day on an equal footing with the leaders of the Bloc Quebecois, the New Democratic Party and the Progressive Conservatives. 
But in some respects Mr Chretien is right. The regional splits have become more evident in the past decade. While the Liberals have, by the latest polls, more than 30% support in every region, the Alliance is powerful only in the four western provinces; the separatist Bloc Quebecois confines itself to Quebec; the New Democrats reach double-digit support only in the two poorer regions, the Atlantic and Prairie provinces; and the Conservatives manage the same in the Atlantic provinces and Ontario. One senior political commentator went so far this month as to write that this was no national election but ""a series of coordinated regional contests"". 
Is Canada so fragmented? Constitutionally, it is one of the most loosely bound confederations after Switzerland. The Conservative leader, Joe Clark, who was briefly prime minister, has called Canada ""a community of communities"" and was the main author of the 1992 Charlottetown Accord, which would have dispersed more power from Ottawa. Although the accord was rejected in a referendum, the process of delegating power to the provinces has continued. And the United States has continued to exert its inexorable southward pull on its neighbouring regions. 
Mr Clark's own hero and Canada's first prime minister, Sir John MacDonald, resisted that pull at the birth of confederation by a ""national policy"" of tariff protection and by building a railway to the Pacific. Today the railway system has shrunk, the two main airlines have merged and a series of trade deals, culminating in the North American Free-Trade Agreement, have, since 1988, increased trade with the United States to some 87% of Canada's exports. Significantly, the international trade-that is, predominantly, trade with the big neighbour-of every province except two in the Maritimes is greater than its inter-provincial trade. Business people in Canada face south, as do their television satellite dishes. 
An influential group of academics wants to see more integration-specifically, of the currency. Thomas Courchene, a professor at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, has urged the government to negotiate a North American monetary union with a new currency some have dubbed the ""amero"". Mr Chretien was cool to the notion when Mexico's new president, Vicente Fox, raised it recently, and he has enlisted as a star candidate in the election a senior bank adviser, John McCallum, who has written forcefully against abandoning the Canadian dollar and its flexible exchange rate. Nevertheless, these ideas will not go away. 
So far in the campaign, Mr Chretien has managed to keep health care as the main issue and to present the Liberals as defenders of a publicly funded one-tier system, emblematic of Canadian ideals of fairness. Mr Day, until recently the finance minister of Alberta-which, this summer, passed a law allowing private for-profit clinics that could keep patients overnight for surgery-has had difficulty explaining that the flexibility he urges to make the system more efficient will not produce a two-tier system nor weaken the Canada Health Act, which guarantees national standards. 
The Liberal government itself is vulnerable to charges from Mr Day that, by massively cutting tax revenue transfers to the provinces for social services during the years of federal deficit-reduction, it had greatly damaged the health-care system before starting to restore the cuts this year. Alexa McDonough, the New Democrat leader, has campaigned strenuously on health care, criticising both front-runners and calling for an expanded system. 
In the deficit-cutting years from 1994 the Liberals also chopped away at another revered institution, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and the policy platform of the Canadian Alliance goes further in calling for partial privatisation of CBC television. For his part, Mr Clark is promising that a Conservative government would repeal the Clarity Act, which lays down broad parameters for a referendum on Quebec sovereignty. This act is generally seen as the most daring political initiative the Chretien government has taken in seven cautious years. 
""Divided we stand"" was the main headline on articles by a respected reporter, John Stackhouse, who hitchhiked 9,000km (5,600 miles) across the country this summer. He found that Canada was a land of distinct communities and regions with their own anxieties, from the seasonal loggers and fishermen of British Columbia and the Atlantic provinces to the farmers of the prairie states, who were worried about gun-registration laws and the paternalistic approach of Ottawa towards native peoples. In general, he found much discontent about the federal government's efforts to manage from a distance. If anyone understands that mood, it is less likely to be Mr Chretien than Mr Day. ","Canada

 The Liberal government itself is vulnerable to charges from Mr Day that , by massively cutting tax revenue transfers to the provinces for social services during the years of federal deficit - reduction , it had greatly damaged the health - care system before starting to restore the cuts this year . Alexa McDonough , the New Democrat leader , has campaigned strenuously on health care , criticising both front - runners and calling for an expanded system . 
 In the deficit - cutting years from 1994 the Liberals also chopped away at another revered institution , the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation , and the policy platform of the Canadian Alliance goes further in calling for partial privatisation of CBC television . For Helen Clark's part , Helen Clark is promising that a Conservative government would repeal the Clarity Act , which lays down broad parameters for a referendum on Quebec sovereignty . This act is generally seen as the most daring political initiative the Chretien government has taken in seven cautious years . 
 "" Divided we stand "" was the main headline on articles by a respected reporter , John Stackhouse , who hitchhiked 9,000 km ( 5,600 miles ) across the country this summer . He found that Canada was a land of distinct communities and regions with their own anxieties , from the seasonal loggers and fishermen of British Columbia and the Atlantic provinces to the farmers of the prairie states , who were worried about gun - registration laws and the paternalistic approach of Ottawa towards native peoples . In general , he found much discontent about the federal government 's efforts to manage from a distance . If anyone understands that mood , it is less likely to be Mr Chretien than Mr Day .",920,New Zealand,A29-9067,IN TERM,True,"The Conservative leader , Joe Clark , who was briefly prime minister ,",4,True

After a rough campaign, Canada's prime minister looks likely to be back for a third term, but cannot be sure of a parliamentary majority 
IN DECIDING to call a snap election for November 27th, almost two years before parliament had to be dissolved, Canada's prime minister, Jean Chretien, looked to have made a coldly opportunistic calculation. Wait longer, and Stockwell Day, the boyish new leader of the conservative Canadian Alliance, the revamped official opposition, might pose a far greater threat to Mr Chretien's Liberals. That in turn would increase the pressure for the prime minister, who craves a third term, to make way for a more popular colleague, such as Paul Martin, the finance minister. 
Mr Chretien's judgement may have been self-serving, but was it correct? The Liberals, with 159 seats in the outgoing parliament, are defending an overall majority of nine. The main question is whether they will now be reduced to a minority government, forced to rely on the support of the socialdemocratic New Democrats (NDP). 
If the opinion polls are to be believed, the prime minister may retain his majority. Nationally, they give the Liberals around 40% (compared with 380 of the vote in 1997). Support for the Alliance has stalled at 29%. The rest of the vote is distributed between the separatist Bloc Quebecois, the Nr and the Progressive Conservatives (see chart). 
But the Liberals have two reasons to worry. The first concerns allegations of sleaze involving Mr Chretien, which have clouded the final days of the campaign. The second is that in Canada's first-past-thepost system, a Liberal majority may turn on the outcome in a handful of marginal seats. 
The Alliance looks to have done enough to seize some marginals (held by ministers) in the western provinces, and in rural and suburban Ontario. And in Atlantic Canada, the Liberals may fail to win back seats they lost in 1997 to the Conservatives, whose leader,Joe Clark,did well in the Tv debates. 
The Liberals ought to be doing better. With a booming economy, the federal budget in surplus, and Quebec separatism quiescent for now, the election has been largely free of urgent issues. Instead, it has focused on personalities. Neither Mr Chretien nor Mr Day has been left unscathed. Mr Day bounced into federal politics earlier this year, along with his party. It was formed out of the western-based Reform Party. The aim: to attract enough Conservatives to avoid a repeat of the 1997 election, when the division of right-wing votes between the two parties handed victory on a plate to Mr Chretien, especially in Ontario, Canada's most populous province. 
Mr Day, who made his career in the cloistered world of Alberta's conservative politics, has been hurt by the Liberals' bruising stump manners. He has had to defend himself against charges of extremism. Elinor Caplan, the immigration minister, accused the Alliance of harbouring ""bigots, racists and Holocaust-deniers"". Mr Day's support for private health care meant he was charged with wanting to introduce a ""two-tier"" health service. An evangelical Christian, he has pleaded that religion was irrelevant to the campaign. But that did not stop a Liberal official waving a toy dinosaur on television, in mockery of Mr Day's creationist views. 
Then came the publication of a briefing document for Alliance candidates, which foresaw referendums on such questions as abortion and capital punishment if just 3% of voters demanded one. That brought ridicule. A television satirist launched a drive to gather the required 400,000 signatures for a referendum to change Mr Day's first name to Doris; the figure was achieved within hours through the Internet. Lost in this theatre of the absurd was much discussion of the Alliance's plan for tax cuts. A similar plan won Ontario for the Conservatives in a provincial election in 1995. 
When Mr Day finally went onto the attack, it was first on law and order, urging more child protection after an incident with a paedophile made news. But his call for tougher sentences met the response that violent crime has fallen under the Liberals. 
So Mr Day turned on the prime minister himself. He accused Mr Chretien of the arrogant abuse of his wide powers of appointment and patronage.On November i6th, the National Post, a newspaper owned by Conrad Black, a passionate foe of the prime minister, revealed that Mr Chretien had telephoned and lobbied the director of the Business Development Bank, a governmentlinked outfit, to make a C$615,ooo ($398,ooo) loan to a golf-course hotel in his Quebec constituency, of which Mr Chretien had previously been one of the owners. This report also turned up unpaid debts and a mortgage default by the hotel, and allegations by the bank's former boss that he was forced from office when he wanted to take legal action against the hotel's owner. 
Mr Day has called for a criminal investigation. Mr Chretien retorted that he only did what any member of parliament should do for a constituent. Mr Clark called for Canada's ethics commissioner, who dismissed milder allegations last year, to investigate the loan anew. But on November zand the commissioner said that Mr Chretien had broken no codes of conduct. Five other police investigations are under way into questionable grants in the prime minister's constituency. 
Mr Chretien's personal standing in opinion polls has fallen, not just because of the sleaze claims, but also because of his poor performance in television debates. Among his fellow francophone Quebeckers, Mr Chretien's reputation has rarely been lower. That may help the Bloc Quebecois improve on its 44 seats, out of the province's 75. 
overall, according to the polls, Canadians believe that the Liberals and Mr Chretien are as likely (or unlikely) to provide honest government as the Alliance and Mr Day, who is particularly distrusted by women. That may prove no consolation to Mr Chr6tien. Should he lose his majority, the prime minister will face calls to step down in favour of Mr Martin. The finance minister has stuck to his script as a loyal lieutenant, but he has been mobbed by Liberals at rallies. Mr Chretien is a tough customer, but his electoral calculation may yet backfire.

A remarkable election leaves Jean Chretien free to define his legacy 
OTTAWA 
JEAN CHRETIEN's gamble has paid off. Canada's prime minister, who likes to call himself ""le p'tit gars de Shawinigan"", won big in the general election he called for November 27th. In fact, ""the little guy"" won bigger than even he had expected: his Liberals took 172 seats, a comfortable majority in a House of Commons of 301, and a remarkable advance on the 155 seats they won in 1997. 
Mr Chretien's decision to call an election less than four years into his five-year mandate was widely criticised, and its wisdom doubted by many of his own Mrs. But it turned out to be a clever stroke. Canadians are unusually contented, thanks to a booming economy and pre-election tax cuts. And the snap poll caught the main opposition, the conservative Canadian Alliance, unprepared in the crucial arena of Ontario, where this newly minted party had hoped to extend its base from western Canada. 
The Alliance leader, Stockwell Day, had campaigned vigorously in rural and suburban Ontario, but his party's reward was a meagre two seats in the province. The Liberals secured their Ontario base, holding loo of the 103 seats. Their gains came elsewhere. They rebounded in the mainly depressed Atlantic provinces, after promising C$700m ($456m) for job creation there. They took eight extra seats, seizing six back from the leftish New Democrats and two from the Progressive Conservatives. More surprisingly, they also made inroads in Quebec, taking six seats from the separatist Bloc Quebecois (BQ). 
Two things helped the Liberals there. Firstly, since Jean Charest, the former federal Conservative leader switched to become the Liberal leader in the province in 1998, most of his supporters seem to have followed him-to show their support for federalism. Secondly, the BQ was not much helped by its association with the provincial government of Lucien Bouchard, which is pushing through an unpopular amalgamation of municipalities. Giles Duceppe, the BQ leader, ran a polished campaign, but got little support on the hustings from Mr Bouchard. 
The Alliance consolidated its position as the main opposition. It tightened its grip over the four western provinces, and attracted some erstwhile Conservative supporters. But although Mr Day is a fresh and lively leader, the Liberals managed successfully to paint him as an extremist who threatened the health service and abortion rights. 
That seems to have checked the Alliance. It allowed Joe Clark, the Conservative leader, to defend his party from extinction. He won his seat in Alberta, but spent most of the campaign in the Atlantic provinces. His nine-seat haul there helped the Conservatives reach the 12-seat threshold nationally for official recognition as a parliamentary party. (The New Democrats, too, only just passed this barrier.) 
But what really hobbled the Alliance was its mistaken arithmetic in Ontario. Its backers had reckoned that by combining the 1997 vote of the two right-of-centre parties, the Reform party and the Conservatives, the Alliance could win 40 seats in the province. Conservative voters had other ideas. Some switched to the Liberals. Others stuck with 
Mr Clark,who in refusing to join the Alliance turned out to be the Liberals' best friend. 
Mr Chretien, at 66, now stands at the pinnacle of a long career, having achieved the rare feat of winning three majority govements in a row. Canadians may not like him much, but his lackadaisical manner conceals an effective and often underrated politician. His party's improved standing in his native Quebec would seem to vindicate his tough line against separatism. 
The new term will decide Mr Chretien's legacy. Going back on earlier hints that he would step down, he said this week that he plans to serve it in full. On policy, he faces some tough choices. On the one hand, as he said after his victory, there is still much to do in social policy to keep Canada ""the best country in the world"", as it is ranked by the United Nations Human Development Index. One priority is reviving the health service. Another is the environment. The government's relaxed stance on global warming has been deplored by Europeans, in a rare international rebuke for Canada. 
On the other hand, Mr Chretien must look over his right shoulder at the Alliance. Its championing of lower taxes, and the need for Canadian business to compete with American rivals, will place limits on the government's scope for social democracy. In the small matter of organising an election, however, Canada showed this week that it is roughly a century ahead of the United States. It took officials just four hours to count (by hand) almost every one of nearly 13 million paper ballots, cast in 50,000 polling stations scattered across a vast country. ","Canada

Might his exit now come sooner, and less gloriously?
 Since the campaign, Mr Chrtien has been dogged by a mini-scandal over the sale of a golf course near his home-town (and in his parliamentary constituency) of Shawinigan, in Quebec. After weeks of newspaper headlines and parliamentary questions on the affair, on March 23rd all four opposition parties joined up to demand a public inquiry to determine whether the prime minister had fallen prey to conflicts of interest. Joe Clark, the leader of the small Progressive Conservatives and himself a former prime minister, called on Mr Chrtien to step down until the issue had been settled.
 The tale is a murky one. Briefly, the facts are that in 1988, during an interlude from politics in which he had been working as a lawyer, Mr Chrtien with two (later three) partners bought the Grand- Mre golf course and an adjoining hotel. When he became Liberal leader, he sold his share in the money-losing hotel; and, on winning the 1993 election, he arranged to sell his share in the golf course. The buyer was Jonas Prince, then the boss of Delta, a hotel chain. But Mr Prince paid the prime minister only after he had himself sold the share back to one of the original partners in 1999.
 Meanwhile, Mr Chrtien had repeatedly lobbied the boss of a government-linked bank, urging him to reverse its decision to reject a loan for the hotel's expansion. The bank eventually approved a C$615,000 ($443,000) loan in 1997, but only after its boss had left-- forced out because of his opposition to the loan, or so he is claiming in a lawsuit. Separately, the government gave a C$164,000 job-creation grant to the hotel during the 1997 election campaign.
 Mr Chrtien has said that he had no personal interest in either the hotel or the golf course after November 1993. His lobbying on behalf of the hotel, he has argued, was simply what any member of Parliament would do for a constituent.
 Critics argue that a flourishing hotel might increase the value of the golf course. They have cast doubt on whether the prime minister in fact sold his quarter-share in the course to Mr Prince. Last week, the sister of the course's manager let slip that in the late 1990s Mr Chrtien's name was still on the shareholders' register.
 Canada's ethics counsellor, who reports to the prime minister not parliament, has backed Mr Chrtien. And, to clear the air, Mr Chrtien said this week that he would make public all relevant legal documents concerning the case. But though he has released, among other things, a handwritten bill of sale of the shares--he has not disclosed, as his opponents want, his tax returns for the relevant period.
 The documents may calm the anxieties of Liberal backbenchers, but they have not dispelled all doubts. These could still be around at the next Liberal convention, probably in the spring of 2002, when the party's rules mandate a vote on the leadership. Mr Chrtien may not be too worried. He has often been written off before only to see off his main opponents. He is unlikely to change his plan to retire at his leisure.

In an effort to unite the divided right, the Reform Party, strong in the western provinces, joined forces with sections of the Progressive Conservative Party in a new Canadian Alliance. They chose as their leader Stockwell Day, a fresh-faced and seemingly bright Albertan. But little has gone right for the Alliance--or for Mr Day.
 The problems began at the Alliance's birth, when Joe Clark, the Conservative leader, refused to join. The second setback came when Mr Chrtien called a snap election in November, which he won with an increased majority. Since then, Mr Clark, who was once briefly prime minister, has shone in parliamentary skirmishing with Mr Chrtien over a shady golf-course deal, while Mr Day has stumbled as leader of the opposition. Discontent came to a head last month when his chief of staff and four members of his shadow cabinet resigned from their posts. Even Ralph Klein, Alberta's premier and Mr Day's former boss, has said that time is running out for the leader. On May 2nd, Mr Day presented his MPs with a draft strategy, drawn up by outside consultants, which seemed to contain the revolt--or at least to buy himself some more time.
 Mr Day can claim that in the election he did well to add 700,000 votes and six more seats--making 66 in total--to Reform's haul in the 1997 election. His critics counter that he fumbled the campaign. He failed to work with the Conservative machine in Ontario, where he won only two of 103 seats, and he flip-flopped on big issues. Since then, he has attracted ridicule for landing Alberta's taxpayers with legal costs of C$700,000 ($460,000) for a libel case when he was a minister there. More trouble followed over whether he had agreed to hire an American detective to spy on the Liberals. His critics within the Alliance claim that he makes erratic decisions, and without consultation.
 Support for the Alliance has crumbled to 13%, down from 25% on election day, and behind Mr Clark's Conservatives (15%), according to a recent opinion poll. More pointedly, the poll showed that Mr Clark was twice as popular as Mr Day in Alberta.
 But the Alliance lacks an obvious replacement for Mr Day. Preston Manning, who led Reform, might welcome a recall, but in public says he plans to leave politics later this year. Mr Clark is too much of a centrist ""Red Tory"" to appeal to the social conservatives of the Alliance. Mike Harris is an obvious choice after six successful years as Ontario's premier. But he seems to enjoy his present job, not least since power in Canada is increasingly moving to provincial level.
 Another problem is that the Alliance's MPs cannot by themselves remove their leader, since he was directly elected by party members. A vote on his leadership is not due until a party convention in 2002- -unless Mr Day resigns. That looks unlikely. Last week, he commended Queen Elizabeth for saying that at 75 she had no plans for retirement, adding that, at 50, neither did he.","  LAST year , conservatives in Canada thought they had come up with a winning plan to oust the Liberal government of Jean Chrtien .

 RARE is the politician who concedes defeat before rather than after an election. But that is what Ujjal Dosanjh, British Columbia's premier, did this week, saying that he accepted that he would not form a new government after the province's vote on May 16th.
 That was realistic. A recent opinion poll gave a Liberal-led coalition 65% against 14% for Mr Dosanjh's leftish New Democratic Party (NDP). The main doubt is whether the NDP will lose all its 39 seats in the 79-seat provincial legislature, or merely be routed. In Canada, provincial politics has little bearing on the centre: the BC Liberals are more conservative than the federal party led by Jean Chrtien, the prime minister. Even so, the result will resonate.
 The campaign has been a cakewalk for Gordon Campbell, a bland figure who after eight years as Liberal leader is still not popular. He has had no need to be. The NDP dug its own grave under Glen Clark, who was obliged to resign as the province's premier in 1999 over claims that he had helped a neighbour gain a casino licence (he now faces trial for fraud).
 Voters remember Mr Clark for fiscal deficits, fudged budget figures, stiff tax increases and huge cost overruns on a ferry project. Mr Dosanjh, his successor, tried to clean up the mess, balancing the books and putting the ferries up for sale. Too late.
 Mr Campbell, a former mayor of Vancouver, wants to stimulate the economy by cutting the province's basic rate of income tax to the lowest in Canada, easing regulation of business, and relaxing employment law. This goes down well in depressed lumber and mining towns and, unsurprisingly, with businessmen. In the decade the NDP has been in power, British Columbia has ranked close to the bottom among Canada's ten provinces in its economic performance and attractiveness to investors, according to BC Business Council, a lobby group. Vancouver has lost ground to Calgary, in Alberta, as a business centre.
 But a change of government will not solve all the problems. Though Mr. Campbell talks of toughening a balanced-budget law, he has also admitted that his plan to reduce income taxes without making big spending cuts means renewed deficits in provincial finances until 2004. A Liberal plan to hold a referendum on aboriginal treaty negotiations could also stir up trouble. Native claims on timber and mining land have held back investment. After years of talks, several draft treaties are close to completion. But the Liberals oppose the model of self-government won by the Nisga'a in the first modern-day treaty, signed in 1998. Native leaders see the referendum idea as an effort to delay or deny settlements, and have promised a campaign of civil disobedience to block it.
 None of these worries looks likely to save the NDP. Once Canada's third-strongest party, it has been reduced to a rump in the federal parliament. After next week, it will govern only Manitoba and (in coalition) Saskatchewan. In British Columbia, a traditional stronghold, it looks set to become an endangered species.","  The province 's New Democrats head for extinction

 IF CANADA's ruling Liberals are once again living up to their nickname of ""perpetual governing party"", that has less to do with the qualities of Jean Chretien's government than with the shambolic state of the right-wing opposition. Last year the opposition seemed to be on the up, when Reform, a party strong in western Canada, linked up with some members of the Progressive Conservative Party to form a new party, the Canadian Alliance, under a new leader, Stockwell Day. But that was when the problems began.
 For the past three months, the Alliance's 66 MPs have fought a public war over whether to dump Mr Day. On July 7th, a year to the day after he was chosen as leader, the Alliance's executive called for him to resign. Mr Day's response seemed only to make matters worse. He offered to take a ""leave of absence"" from the leadership until a party convention scheduled for April 2002, but only if he could name his temporary replacement. Not surprisingly, Mr Day's main critics, a group of 13 MPs who have left the Alliance's official caucus in Parliament, rejected this condition. So Mr Day withdrew his offer. He remains the leader, but a wounded one.
 What has gone wrong? In his brief period as a federal politician, Mr Day has been extraordinarily accident-prone. He was chosen as leader because he spoke French and seemed to be charismatic: he enjoyed being photographed showing off his skills as a kickboxer and roller-blader. But, coming from Alberta's provincial government, where he had faced a tiny opposition, he lacked political experience.
 The hope was that Mr Day would break the Liberals' hold on Ontario's 103 parliamentary seats. He failed. When Mr Chretien called a snap election last November, the Alliance boosted Reform's previous tally by 764,000 votes and six seats. But it won only two seats in Ontario.
 It has been downhill ever since for Mr Day. A fiscal conservative, he passed on the bill for a lost libel suit to Alberta's taxpayers. He dropped his party's proposals for a flat tax and publicly repudiated his party's policy on refugees, both without consulting colleagues. More even than most politicians, he blames staff members or the media for his own mistakes. He denied (but then had to admit) that he had met a part-time spy to discuss gathering dirt on the Liberals. And so on.
 In the latest opinion poll, support for the Alliance has sunk to 10%, from a peak of 28% last October. More defections among MPs seem likely; already two among the nine members of the national executive have resigned over Mr Day's failure to quit. By contrast, the rump of the Progressive Conservatives has twitched into life. Led by Joe Clark, a former prime minister, the Conservatives won only 12 MPs last year, but now stand at 21% in the opinion polls. Mr Clark has made overtures to dissident Alliance MPs. But he has rejected any serious merger talks while the Alliance is in turmoil.
 Mr Clark has problems of his own. Two successive Conservative Party presidents have resigned since September, complaining of Mr Clark's authoritarianism. And he is disliked by most Alliance members. Sooner or later, the two parties will merge. But first they must find a new leader.","  The right - wing opposition is a mess

 THESE ought to be good times for Canada's right-wing opposition. After all, the economy is slipping towards recession--prompting the Bank of Canada to order a surprise three-quarter-point cut in interest rates on October 23rd--while the Liberal government's response to the September 11th terrorist attacks has at times seemed clumsy. Even so, the right can still be relied upon to be its own worst enemy.
 The Alliance, the largest right-wing force in federal politics, is agonising over whether to replace its newish leader, Stockwell Day, a decision it will not take until a convention to be held no earlier than March. Meanwhile, the Conservatives have lost one of their more powerful provincial leaders: Mike Harris, the premier of Ontario, abruptly resigned this month. At least four members of his cabinet are likely to take part in a tight leadership contest, swallowing energy and corporate donations that might have been spent on finding a successor to the lacklustre Mr Day.
 Mr Day has clung to the leadership, despite doing badly in the general election last November, and despite a rebellion in July that saw eight of the Alliance's 66 MPs defect to the Progressive Conservative Party led by Joe Clark, a former prime minister. Mr Day has said he will step down as leader three months before the convention, but not whether he will stand again himself.
 If it is serious about winning power, the Alliance might choose a more pragmatic and centrist figure, perhaps from Ontario, in the hope of achieving a merger with Mr Clark's group. But for now the larger prize for any such candidate is not the leadership of a fractured federal opposition but the premiership of Ontario, where Mr Harris easily won a second term in 1999. That in turn might help a bid for the Alliance leadership from Stephen Harper, a hardline conservative from Alberta who is young,
 bilingual and charismatic.
 What of Ontario? A stubborn and homespun golf professional from a small northern town, Mr Harris was an unlikely leader for a sophisticated province. He was more abrasive than the centrist ""red"" Tories who ran Ontario for four decades until 1985. He closed schools and hospitals, merged municipalities, sacked 16,000 public-sector workers, reformed school finances and curriculums, and cut welfare benefits by 22%. That enabled him to eliminate the province's deficit while cutting taxes. This ""commonsense revolution"" was briefly a model for Britain's Conservative ex-leader, William Hague.
 But there is a darker side to Mr Harris's legacy. He preferred confrontation to dialogue, and spread bitterness. Ontario's bouncy economy owed much to the boom in the United States. Mr Harris said he was resigning to patch matters up with his jilted wife. But he leaves his party trailing far behind the Liberals in the opinion polls, and his province facing recession. In Ontario, as in Ottawa, the job description for the new leader of the right is a demanding one.","  Two vacancies , and no obvious leaders

 THE Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum, once mocked as ""four adjectives in search of a noun"", has at last taken a cautious step towards assuming the role that Asia needs it to play. At their summit last weekend in Shanghai, 20 of APEC's 21 members--Taiwan was absent- -issued a statement condemning the attacks in America and calling for better co-operation against terrorism. For an organisation that has long resisted attending to security concerns, this was progress.
 A forum bringing together the leaders of all the region's main economies and every major power involved in East Asia--a region worryingly bereft of any multilateral military security arrangement-- is of obvious potential importance. When the United States held the first APEC summit in Seattle in 1993, President Bill Clinton hinted that one of the organisation's aims should be to strengthen regional security, but there has been great resistance to the idea. Although APEC's leaders did manage to discuss the bloodshed in East Timor two years ago, the declaration on terrorism issued in Shanghai last weekend marked the forum's first formal adoption of a security- related document.
 An enhanced role for APEC is badly needed. Some of Asia's many security problems--ranging from the stand-off on the Korean peninsula to territorial disputes in the South China Sea--are discussed at the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), which brings together the ten members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations as well as the European Union and 12 other countries, including China, America, Russia and Japan. But because the ARF meets only at foreign-minister level, it lacks diplomatic weight. Summit meetings are also held annually between ASEAN's leaders and three north-east Asian powers--China, Japan and South Korea. But these get-togethers make little headway without the United States.
 APEC's members often seem intent on giving the impression that their gatherings are little more than a symbolic display of unity. They call their summits informal and try to reinforce that message with the embarrassing ritual of donning traditional local garb chosen by the host. Many were the titters aroused by the spectacle in Shanghai of George Bush and Vladimir Putin wearing high-necked blue silk jackets dotted with floral designs.
 In a region riven by suspicions and animosities and resentful of efforts by outsiders to impose solutions, APEC's informal setting can have its uses. It allows Taiwan's involvement--although not by its top political leaders: Taiwan boycotted the Shanghai meeting after China had blocked its efforts to send a retired former vice- president. China would be enraged by any attempt to discuss the Taiwan issue in APEC, but at least the scope exists for the subject to be raised in the margins.
 Of APEC's members, China is among the least willing to broaden APEC's agenda or tackle security issues in any multilateral setting, especially not one that prominently includes the Americans. Yet China is central to most of the region's security problems. Despite the displays of unity and friendship in Shanghai, many of APEC's members are worried about China's military ambitions and its growing economic strength, as well as the potential for social unrest and political instability in China that could affect its neighbours. ""We are worried about what we would do if there were a flood of refugees from China,"" says a nervous East Asian diplomat.
 This makes it important for Asia-Pacific countries, including America, to encourage stable economic development in China while trying to draw that country into broader security discussions. Even if the APEC leaders' declaration on terrorism pulled its punches, it was a remarkable consensus given China's reluctance to discuss the issue at all and the concerns of APEC's Muslim-dominated countries-- Brunei, Indonesia and Malaysia--about the military campaign in Afghanistan. ""What it has shown is that economics occurs in a context,"" says New Zealand's prime minister, Helen Clark, who wants APEC to widen its horizons.

 TO TAKE a master's degree in business administration (MBA) at Harvard Business School, the first exclusively graduate business school and still, on most measures, the world leader, is not cheap. Tuition fees are $30,000 or so for each of the two years; other bills and living costs add another $25,000 a year. Add to that earnings forgone: the cost in recent years, for a clever 28-year-old, might well have been another $100,000 or so over the two-year programme. Surely only students with great confidence in their employability would take such a financial risk.
 In fact, no. Business schools find themselves in a bizarre situation. They are struggling to find jobs for their current crop of graduates--but overwhelmed with inquiries from would-be students. While, on some estimates, more than one in five of this summer's MBA graduates is still job-hunting, all the signs are that there will be a bumper crop of applications for the class of 2004, whose students will begin their courses in September next year.
 The unfortunate class of 2001 struggled to find employment, or discovered that promised jobs evaporated as the economy deteriorated. One reason for the popularity of the MBA is that it had become an entry ticket to lucrative jobs. ""Investment banking and consultancy drive our business,"" says Meyer Feldberg, dean of Columbia Business School in New York. As those two industries tanked, so did jobs and summer internships for graduates. At Wharton, the business school attached to the University of Pennsylvania, eight students saw their job offers rescinded and 38 had their starting dates pushed back. Almost all the culprits were consultancies.
 Other schools have been similarly bruised. Even at Harvard Business School, some students are out of work: campus rumour says up to 20% of the summer's graduates, although school officials think that is much too high. But at least the top schools can protest: when a couple of companies dared to withdraw job offers to HBS students in particularly brutal ways, Kim Clark, the school's dean, promptly banned them from recruiting on the campus for the next two years.
 Bad though 2001 has been, next year may be even worse. This is the season of campus recruitment fairs, but companies that once sent three or four recruiters to conduct eight interviews apiece may now send only one, and some are going to fewer schools, or (like Reuters, a media group) are making a presentation but not hiring. Booz Allen, a consultancy that normally makes job offers at the end of a first- year student's summer internship, is now postponing offers until December--if indeed it makes any at all. Because such employers have in the past usually paid a student's second-year fees, the effect is to plunge students into financial uncertainty.
 Or to force them to look for alternatives. Back in the 1960s, students took MBAs mainly in order to run manufacturing companies (see chart 1). Maybe those days will now return. Dull old manufacturers are back in fashion. Cargill, a maker of agricultural feeds and fertilisers, saw attendance at a recruitment reception rise from 30 last year to 300 this year. Health-care companies are also attracting big crowds.
 The dearth of jobs puts top business schools on the spot. Richard Schmalensee, dean of MIT'S Sloan School of Management, was annoyed to be told recently by a student that there was an implicit bargain: ""I pass my courses, you find me a job."" He thinks students are not eager enough to use their own resources to look for work. Doug Breeden, dean of the Fuqua School, at Duke University in North Carolina, is exploiting the network of alumni to try to drum up new job prospects.
 And still they come
 However much today's students worry, plenty more would like to join them. Demand for MBA courses boomed for much of the 1990s, and then tailed off as the glamour of e-commerce lured students away. Columbia received 5,277 applications for this year's MBA intake, double the number in 1992 but down on the 1998 peak of 5,719. Now, though, the evidence suggests resurgent demand for next year. One indicator is the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT). Although the numbers do not take account of people who take the test repeatedly, the trend is sharply upwards (see chart 2 on previous page).
 Another portent is attendance at roadshows: Stern, an up-and- coming school attached to New York University, has seen a rise of 30- 50% since September. Along with its full-time MBA course, the school runs a part-time course that takes in students twice a year. Applications for the spring course are up 50% on last year.
 The rise in interest is not confined to the United States. American schools now recruit all round the world. Columbia's Mr Feldberg reports that this autumn's information session in London attracted 200 people, compared with 70 last year; the one in Paris attracted 135, compared with 60 last year, while ""Toronto just blew everybody's socks off."" Business schools are mainly an American industry, but many European schools are prospering. INSEAD, France's top school, saw a 47% rise in applications for the current year's class. At HEC School of Management in Paris, Bernard Ramanantsoa, the dean, says that applications for the 18-month MBA course starting in January are 8% up on a year ago, when demand was flat. Smaller schools are more nervous: Didier Develey, dean of the Reims Management School, worries that people may now ""reduce their investment in education"".
 One reason for rising applications is doubtless the fall in opportunity cost: as companies stop hiring, students are less likely to miss out on that $100,000 consultancy job. Another is faith that business will once again be a lucrative career, and the MBA will remain the surest route to the top. In America, according to ""Which MBA?"", published this week by the Economist Intelligence Unit (The Economist's sister company), more than half the chief executives of big companies have MBAs.
 For universities, the countercyclical nature of the demand for MBAs will certainly be a relief. Many universities, such as Chicago and Northwestern, draw a subsidy from their attached business schools. And executive education, an activity that business schools have been expanding even faster than MBA programmes, turns out to ebb and flow in line with the economic cycle, according to John Quelch, former dean of the London Business School. But the demand for MBA graduates may not quickly return to the boisterous levels of the 1990s. If the firms that do most of the hiring are not consultancies or investment banks, they may demand different skills: perhaps expertise in engineering or law, rather than a general understanding of business principles, acquired at great expense."," A gamble that more people want to take

 SMALLPOX, like anthrax, begins as flu--a headache, sore joints, a slight fever that quickly abates. Relief is fleeting, though. Over 24 hours the disease either turns inward, causing subcutaneous haemorrhaging, or outward, covering you in pustules that concentrate in precisely the places where they will cause the greatest anguish and pain, the soles of the feet, the face and the palms of your hands. If the pustules do not run together, the prognosis is good. But if they converge in a single oozing mass, known as confluent smallpox, there is a high chance you will die. If you don't, the good news is that the immunity created by the disease means you will never catch smallpox again.
 Smallpox has been known to man since the Pharaohs. Traders carried it from Egypt to India, where Sanskrit medical texts describe epidemics as far back as 1500BC, Jonathan Tucker explains in ""Scourge"". According to Thucydides, it killed a third of the population of Athens in 430BC. Alexander the Great's army was ravaged by the disease as were the Abyssinian troops on elephants that besieged Mecca in 570AD, an incident described in the Koran.
 Mr Tucker, who has worked for the State Department and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, traces the disease's historic arc. He pauses briefly on its supposed eradication in 1978, but his real interest is in exploring the possibility that secret laboratory stocks of smallpox may still exist and, worse, that they could easily be put to use by unscrupulous regimes. His speculations feed into the current bioterrorism frenzy, but nonetheless they remain just that, speculations.
 Most histories have dealt with the American smallpox outbreak of 1775 as a footnote to the real business of the revolutionary war that was beginning to transform the 13 British colonies in America into a new nation. Elizabeth Fenn, a historian at George Washington University, has made fresh use of many primary sources, particularly the burial records kept by the Catholic parishes across Spanish North America, to put together a remarkable portrait of an epidemic that killed five times more people on the entire continent than the war of independence did in the east.
 The pox really took hold during the 11-month siege of Boston following the battles of Lexington and Concord in April 1775. Americans had been less exposed to smallpox than Europeans, and were thus more vulnerable to the disease. The crowded city, with its dirty housing and inadequate food supplies, helped the virus proliferate. In their ignorance, the authorities forbad inoculation, though soldiers inoculated themselves in secret, rubbing infected clothing into scratches in their thighs at night in the belief that in this way they would escape detection.
 At the same time, smallpox broke out in Quebec where each new volunteer soldier turned into a potential fresh host for the virus and a headache, once he became ill, for the authorities. ""It was better to have no reinforcements at all than to bear the burden of more sick men,"" Ms Fenn remarks. In no time, smallpox had also erupted in Mexico city and up along the north-west Pacific coast, showing that a vast web of human contact spanned the American continent well before Meriwether Lewis and William Clark made their famous journey to the Pacific in 1804.
 George Washington, who was himself an early victim of the disease, eventually took charge of the continental army. He reversed the decision on inoculation, making immunisation compulsory, which helped the colonists win the war of independence. Today few people under the age of 30 have been vaccinated against smallpox. The virus spreads far more quickly than anthrax. For a real sense of what smallpox can do to a dense population with little or no immunity to the disease, ""Pox Americana"" will send shivers down your spine.

Ashmolean Museum, Oxford; to February 3rd.More information at www.brasilconnects.org
 ART makes a great ambassador, as Brazil is discovering. A year- long exhibition named ""Rediscovery"", marking the 500th anniversary of Brazil's discovery by a Portuguese explorer, Pedro Alvares Cabral, attracted more than 3m visitors in Sao Paulo in 2000. Nearly two years on, offshoots of that show are sambaing their way around the world, to New York, London and more than ten other destinations, in an effort to show the rest of us what we have been missing.
 The shows are sponsored by BrasilConnects, a private not-for- profit foundation set up by the president of Banco Santos, Edemar Cid Ferreira, to promote Brazilian culture around the world. ""Rediscovery"", for which BrasilConnects raised $30m, bolstered the foundation's confidence as well as its ambitions. ""We're a group of fanatic people,"" says Emilio Kalil, BrasilConnects' artistic director, ""working together to promote Brazilian culture abroad.""
 The most important of the new shows is a $6m blockbuster at the Guggenheim Museum in New York, which will transfer to Bilbao in mid- 2002. Jean Nouvel, a French architect who this year won the RIBA gold medal, has designed a space in which Brazilian art glows in the dark, like the red Brazilwood that resembles the brasas or red embers for which Brazil was named. Mr Nouvel has painted the Frank Lloyd Wright rotunda black, transforming it into a theatrical showcase for the four-storey, gilded altar from the monastery of Sao Bento in Olinda, a town near Recife. A masterpiece of the Brazilian baroque, the altar serves as an icon connecting Brazil's exuberant heritage with the sensuous dynamism of its 20th-century art.
 Viewers walk up the Guggenheim's spiral ramp as though it were a processional route. Once inside, they don't so much survey the panoply of Brazil's art as submit to the interaction of Afro-Euro- Brazilian influences--what one of the show's curators, Germano Celant, calls the orgy of moods--that make up so much of the nation's polymorphous visual culture.
 From baroque ritual to performance art, Brazilian art blends the carnal and the spiritual, focusing heavily on the bodily experience. In the late 1920s, Tarsila do Amaral, a painter, and her husband, Osvaldo de Andrade, a writer, essayist and art critic, coined the term, anthropophagy, which they saw as a way of constructing a cultural identity by cannibalising other cultures without losing your individuality. Although she studied with Fernand Leger in Paris, Amaral was one of the first artists of her generation to rediscover the baroque heritage of Brazil's Minas Gerais region and to explore indigenous folklore. She incorporated Cubist techniques into her tropical palette and created a new image of Brasilidad, as can be seen in the iconic paintings at the Guggenheim.
 Cannibalism has fascinated visitors to Brazil ever since Hans Staden, an explorer, escaped a Tupinamba stew pot in the 16th century. Indeed, cannibalism continues to be read on many levels as a metaphor for Brazilian art. It was the theme of the 2000 Sao Paulo Bienal, where Lygia Pape made a stunning work called ""Tupinamba Cloak"", also on display at the Guggenheim. Her work offers a visual re-reading of the history of a famous 17th-century cape, made of red ibis feathers, which was said to transform its shamanic wearer into a birdman. Ms Pape's tribal garment has red cloth filled with feather- covered balls extruding body parts and surrounded by insects. The message of this remarkable work seems to be that while the country strives to reach the stature of a mythical bird, the everyday reality of indigenous peoples is little better than that of insects.
 Helio Oiticica, who died in 1980, is another artist whose work can be seen at the Guggenheim. A modern shaman of Brazilian art, he was a kind of Andy Warhol in reverse. Oiticica was not concerned with material culture so much as the ways that performance, playfulness and ritual define Brazil's visual landscape. As a tribute to the people of the favelas, who refused to let poverty or adversity stop them dancing the samba and performing their religious rituals, he liked to create flamboyantly coloured parangoles--capes, flags and banners that were meant to be worn in a collective dance in which participants would complete the art work. Oiticica's friend and fellow artist, Lygia Clark, even went so far as to incorporate his ideas into a new kind of psychotherapy in which patients wore interactive art pieces that took them outside themselves.
 None of the smaller shows can really compete with the Guggenheim for richness or depth. Nevertheless, they do give a flavour of Brazil's artistic wealth. ""Experiment Experiencia"" at the Museum of Modern Art in Oxford attracted a record 40,000 visitors this autumn to see small-scale works by some of the great names of Brazilian modernism, including Ms Pape, Oiticica and Clark. Similar work, with a more contemporary slant, is on display at New York's Museo del Barrio. Meanwhile, the Ashmolean Museum, also in Oxford, has a tiny show of Brazilian baroque art, including expressive wood carvings by a legendary 18th-century mulatto sculptor who was nicknamed O Aleijadinho, the Little Cripple, because in later life he became so disfigured by disease that his assistants had to strap his tools to his wrists.
 The real eye-opener, however, is the British Museum's ""Unknown Amazon"", which fuses archaeology, anthropology and ecology to present a picture of the lost civilisations of the Amazon basin. Conventional wisdom has it that the Portuguese discovered a virgin territory, with few native peoples; certainly not the population of as many as 11m with their large-scale agricultural settlements, sophisticated language and religion which has come to light recently through archaeological remains. This fascinating exhibition--like the Guggenheim display--shows how art and archaeology can be at the Janus- face of culture, looking both back in time to ancient Indian civilisations and forward to the Brazil of today, and even tomorrow.","  Brazil conjures up images of colour , physicality and flair -- but rarely of art . A series of international exhibitions is changing that perception

Ashmolean Museum , Oxford ; to February 3rd . More information at www.brasilconnects.org 
  ART makes a great ambassador , as Brazil is discovering . A year- long exhibition named "" Rediscovery "" , marking the 500th anniversary of Brazil 's discovery by a Portuguese explorer , Pedro Alvares Cabral , attracted more than 3 m visitors in Sao Paulo in 2000 . Nearly two years on , offshoots of that show are sambaing their way around the world , to New York , London and more than ten other destinations , in an effort to show the rest of us what we have been missing . 
  The shows are sponsored by BrasilConnects , a private not - for- profit foundation set up by the president of Banco Santos , Edemar Cid Ferreira , to promote Brazilian culture around the world . "" Rediscovery "" , for which BrasilConnects raised $ 30 m , bolstered the foundation 's confidence as well as its ambitions . "" We 're a group of fanatic people , "" says Emilio Kalil , BrasilConnects ' artistic director , "" working together to promote Brazilian culture abroad . "" 
  The most important of the new shows is a $ 6 m blockbuster at the Guggenheim Museum in New York , which will transfer to Bilbao in mid- 2002 . Jean Nouvel , a French architect who this year won the RIBA gold medal , has designed a space in which Brazilian art glows in the dark , like the red Brazilwood that resembles the brasas or red embers for which Brazil was named . Mr Nouvel has painted the Frank Lloyd Wright rotunda black , transforming it into a theatrical showcase for the four - storey , gilded altar from the monastery of Sao Bento in Olinda , a town near Recife . A masterpiece of the Brazilian baroque , the altar serves as an icon connecting Brazil 's exuberant heritage with the sensuous dynamism of its 20th - century art . 
  Viewers walk up the Guggenheim 's spiral ramp as though it were a processional route . Once inside , they do n't so much survey the panoply of Brazil 's art as submit to the interaction of Afro - Euro- Brazilian influences -- what one of the show 's curators , Germano Celant , calls the orgy of moods -- that make up so much of the nation 's polymorphous visual culture . 
  From baroque ritual to performance art , Brazilian art blends the carnal and the spiritual , focusing heavily on the bodily experience . In the late 1920s , Tarsila do Amaral , a painter , and her husband , Osvaldo de Andrade , a writer , essayist and art critic , coined the term , anthropophagy , which they saw as a way of constructing a cultural identity by cannibalising other cultures without losing your individuality . Although she studied with Fernand Leger in Paris , Amaral was one of the first artists of her generation to rediscover the baroque heritage of Brazil 's Minas Gerais region and to explore indigenous folklore . She incorporated Cubist techniques into her tropical palette and created a new image of Brasilidad , as can be seen in the iconic paintings at the Guggenheim . 
  Cannibalism has fascinated visitors to Brazil ever since Hans Staden , an explorer , escaped a Tupinamba stew pot in the 16th century . Indeed , cannibalism continues to be read on many levels as a metaphor for Brazilian art . It was the theme of the 2000 Sao Paulo Bienal , where Lygia Pape made a stunning work called "" Tupinamba Cloak "" , also on display at the Guggenheim . Her work offers a visual re - reading of the history of a famous 17th - century cape , made of red ibis feathers , which was said to transform its shamanic wearer into a birdman . Ms Pape 's tribal garment has red cloth filled with feather- covered balls extruding body parts and surrounded by insects . The message of this remarkable work seems to be that while the country strives to reach the stature of a mythical bird , the everyday reality of indigenous peoples is little better than that of insects .

 WITH allies like those in Asia, George Bush must have been thinking on his way to Beijing on February 21st, who needs ""strategic competitors""? Before arriving in China, that erstwhile competitor, for a two-day state visit, America's president had spent the earlier part of the week trying to bolster the reforming instincts of Japan's faltering prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, and then braving ""frank"" discussions (a diplomat's word for a fallout) with South Korea's president, Kim Dae Jung, over how to handle North Korea. It is not that there wasn't also plenty to disagree about in China, from human rights and Taiwan to missile defences and Mr Bush's determination to prevent countries such as Iraq, Iran and North Korea from developing the technologies of mass destruction. But, like many a president before him, Mr Bush is discovering that diplomacy in Asia never quite goes smoothly.
 The events of September 11th have cast America's relations with each of the three countries he visited this week in a new light. In Tokyo Mr Bush called the American-Japanese security alliance the ""bedrock for peace and prosperity in the Pacific"". Pointedly making Japan the first stop on his three-country tour (Bill Clinton had caused unneeded offence by failing even to visit Japan when he went to China in 1998), he claimed the alliance had ""never been stronger"". In some ways that is true. Witness Japan's decision to send support ships to the Indian Ocean, to provide logistical help for America's campaign in Afghanistan. Some in America would have preferred Japan to send its powerful destroyers, but it marked a big shift for Japan.
 Japan is also looking for ways to use its coastguard to help police shipping lanes off Indonesia, where piracy and smuggling are rampant. And in December a coastguard vessel fired on what appears to have been a North Korean spy ship, which subsequently sank. America welcomed this new assertiveness, which makes neighbouring China and South Korea queasy. Most encouraging of all, Mr Koizumi has presented such sallies as being in Japan's own interests, rather than actions foisted on it by its big ally. Slightly less enthusiastically, he also backed Mr Bush's stern new line against countries, including North Korea, that are suspected of building weapons of mass destruction. He praised Mr Bush for being ""calm and cautious"", in marked contrast to the criticism the president's ""axis of evil"" remarks provoked from some allies in Europe.
 For his part, Mr Bush gave high marks to Mr Koizumi for his intention to carry through much-needed economic reforms. But results are what count. Mr Koizumi was frank in declaring that ""Japan has lost confidence in itself"". But that is no comfort to the United States. Even as Mr Bush arrived in Tokyo, Paul Wolfowitz, America's deputy defence secretary, was declaring in Washington that Japan's continued economic stagnation could eventually hurt American interests in Asia, since Japan's ""influence gradually declines and its ability to assist declines with it"" (and, he might have added, enables China to increase its influence in the region).
 One place where America needs everyone's assistance is in dealing with North Korea. Mr Bush has struck a noticeably chilly tone towards the place. ""I'm troubled by a regime that tolerates starvation,"" he said this week in South Korea. And though he repeated his offer to talk to North Korea, he also repeated that ""we must not permit the world's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world's most dangerous weapons"". At Dorasan, only 50 metres from the heavily fortified border, he called on the North to open up to contact with the South.
 Many in South Korea would agree with both sentiments. Yet street protests were a constant backdrop to his talks with South Korea's Mr Kim, who finds Mr Bush's plain words jarring. Mr Kim's ""sunshine"" policy to the North, hoping that promises of economic help will encourage it to end its hostility and isolation, is in difficulties, but any expectation that his visitor would help him revive it by softening his tone proved forlorn. In any case North Korea has so far spurned an offer of talks from both presidents.
 Could China help? Though unhappy to see a fellow communist country chastised by Mr Bush, China has no desire for another diplomatic blow- up like the one that followed North Korea's test in 1998 of a three- stage rocket over the Pacific. That event helped make the case for new missile defences in America--a development China opposes in large part because technology that could defend America or its troops in Japan from the North's rockets could defend Taiwan from China--and gave Japan and America an excuse to enhance their military co- operation.
 Ironically, as America worries that Japan's weakness enhances China's influence in Asia, China worries that militarily Japan is going from strength to strength. Yet in the wake of the September 11th attacks, China has said little in public about Japan's new military role. It has been equally reticent about America's new military foothold in Central Asia, even while it applauds the war on terrorists that have also stirred up trouble from time to time in its restive province of Xinjiang.
 On the whole, September 11th has provided China with a welcome pretext to improve relations with America. But other things have also helped. One is President Vladimir Putin's decision to ally Russia more closely with America, and not just in the fight against terrorism. China had been counting on Russia to fight Mr Bush's plans to abandon the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Instead Mr Putin has acquiesced, hoping to win deep cuts in nuclear weaponry before Mr Bush visits Russia in May.
 Another factor is President Jiang Zemin's desire for a quiet life at a time when China's Communists are preparing for a change of leadership in the autumn. Mr Jiang sets great store by being treated as an equal by America. Despite differences over Taiwan and the tensions caused last year by the collision between an American spy plane and a Chinese fighter aircraft, Mr Jiang sees Mr Bush as more likely to deliver what he promises than Mr Clinton, whose China policy was more pliant but was forever being hijacked by Congress.
 Since Mr Jiang is not without his critics at home, were China's relations with America to turn suddenly sour again, he could quickly find his hard-fought succession arrangements at home unravelling too. (Mr Bush was expecting to meet Hu Jintao, tipped to take over from Mr Jiang as party boss and president). Perhaps this also explains China's decision to tone down its invective over Taiwan. Clearly doing his part to make his China trip a success, Mr Bush had tried to please both sides by promising to ""remember our commitments to the people on Taiwan"", while also working ""with China in the great task of building a properous and stable Asia"".
 American officials no longer talk openly of China as a ""strategic competitor"", preferring to stress hopes for constructive co- operation. Yet Mr Bush was blunt in Beijing too. At a news conference he said the Chinese should be free to choose how they worship and he repeated this view in private talks with Mr Jiang. He also wants China to crack down harder on weapons proliferation. America's ambassador to China, Clark Randt, says both countries now realise this is ""more important than ever"". Earlier, he had called it ""a make or break issue"". Which will it be?
 America has long accused Chinese businesses of supplying technology and materials to a whole range of countries (not least the three in the evil axis). It continues to apply sanctions, most recently against two companies for transferring chemical- and biological-weapons technology to Iran. Just over a year ago, America thought it had achieved a breakthrough when the Chinese agreed to publish a list of dual-use missile-related technologies that would be subject to export controls. The list has yet to appear. Building a stable and prosperous Asia with China will be no easy task."," President Bush exchanges plain words with Kim Dae Jung (above) and other Asian leaders

 SUCH is the political dominance of prime minister Jean Chretien and his federal Liberal party, that some Canadians mutter, only half- jokingly that their country is becoming a one-party state. So Stephen Harper, chosen on March 20th as the new leader of the Canadian Alliance, the battered official opposition, faces an uphill task. Three days later, in Ontario, the Progressive Conservatives are due to choose a new leader who will automatically become premier of Canada's most populous province. Between them, the two new leaders will hold many of the keys to the future of the country's fractured right.
 Mr Harper's election offers a fresh start to the Alliance, which has struggled since its foundation two years ago. He won by an unexpectedly wide margin, with 55% of the vote against 37% for Stockwell Day, the Alliance's outgoing leader. This decisive result should put an end to a debilitating leadership squabble.
 Mr Harper, like Mr Day, is from Alberta (in fact, all four candidates were from Canada's most Americanised province, a sign perhaps of the Alliance's failure to spread its cause). He is best known for co-authoring an essay arguing that the province should erect a ""firewall"" between itself and the federal government, by measures such as setting up its own police force and pension plan. Still only 43, he is an articulate campaigner, a fiscal conservative free of Mr Day's born-again Christianity.
 The Alliance represents an effort to broaden the political base of the western Reform party by wooing eastern Progressive Conservatives.Under Mr Day, it struggled. When Mr Chretien called a snap election in October 2000, Mr Day increased the party's votes, but won only two seats in Ontario, home to one Canadian in three. He stumbled against Mr Chretien in the House of Commons, and then faced a revolt by 12 of his 66 MPs.
 Mr Harper inherits a party whose membership has fallen by more than half since the last election. Its long-term future depends on unity with the Progressive Conservatives. Mr Harper has ruled that out while Joe Clark, a former prime minister, remains the Conservative leader.
 Another powerful figure on the right, Mike Harris, Ontario's premier since 1995, is bowing out this month. Mr Harris achieved national prominence with his ""common sense revolution"", a Canadian version of Thatcherism. Only three of the five candidates to succeed him stand a chance. The one most likely to appeal to floating voters is Elizabeth Witmer, who pushed through labour and health reforms under Mr Harris, but now promises a more compassionate government. Unlike Ms Witmer, Jim Flaherty, the finance minister, would continue Mr Harris's tax cuts; he wants to cut spending further, abolish several ministries, and eliminate fraudulent claims for health care.
 But the front-runner is Ernie Eves, Mr Flaherty's predecessor as finance minister, who implemented the tax and spending cuts before becoming a banker last year. As the best-known contender, for his campaign he has adopted the motto of a Olympic luge contestant: ""lie flat, go fast and try not to die"". He has said that he would review a controversial system of school funding that gives funds to parents.
 Whoever wins faces a tough provincial election in 2004. Mr Eves, the best placed of the three hopefuls, trails Dalton McGuinty, the Ontario Liberal leader, by 14 percentage points. Mr Harris, a former golf professional, may have chosen the right moment to retire to the clubhouse.

AFTER the budget, which poured money into health care, and last month's spending review, which did the same for education, no one is in any doubt about the government's commitment to spend more on the public services. That has distracted attention from another of its priorities: the extra support for families, low-earners without children and pensioners that starts next year. Altogether, the full-year additional cost of the new credits--Labour's term for this welfare spending--will be pounds 4.6 billion ($7.2 billion), close to next year's increase in the education budget. 
Not only are these credits costly, they also mark a major extension of means-testing, the payment of benefits according to income rather than on a universal or contribution-linked basis. Unlike child benefit, which goes to every mother regardless of her family income, the new child tax credit will not be paid to richer families. Unlike the basic state pension, which goes to everyone who has contributed through their working lives to the national insurance system, the pension credit will be paid only to poorer pensioners.
In 1997, 14m people--25% of the population--were on means-tested benefits. But according to an analysis by the impartial House of Commons Library carried out for the Liberal Democrats, the number of people on means-tested benefits next year will be 25m--43% of the population. The impact will be especially pronounced among Britain's 11m pensioners, half of whom will be on means-tested benefits. 
From an international perspective, Britain is moving away from the most common model of the welfare state in developed economies, and towards the Australian model where means-testing is widespread, says Mark Pearson, head of social policy at the OECD. ""In the great majority of rich countries, means-testing is very much the last-resort benefit,"" he says. 
The advantage of means-testing benefits is that you get more bangs for your buck. The Labour government has ambitious targets to reduce child poverty, and it also wants to alleviate poverty among pensioners. But it does not want to push up tax bills too much. Means-testing allows it to concentrate benefits on the neediest while minimising overall spending. 
But means-testing comes at a price. For one thing, such benefits are often regarded as stigmatising, so people are reluctant to claim them. They are also complicated to understand, which can affect take-up. The upshot is that in practice such benefits are less effective in reducing poverty than they look on paper. 
As means-testing stretches out to embrace so many more people, stigma is unlikely to be the problem it once used to be, however. The government is also trying hard to tackle complexity by making forms simpler and claims less frequent. Even so, ""trying to work out how the pension credit works is beyond most of us,"" says Steve Webb, the pensions spokesman for the Liberal Democrats. As he points out, the government's own target of paying the credit to at least 3m pensioner households by 2006 means that they will miss a million of the 4m eligible.
But the main price of means-tested benefits is the harm they do to incentives to work and to save. Unlike universal benefits, they are withdrawn as income rises. So people receiving them have less of an incentive to find work in the first place or to work long hours when they get a job. And if working people know that they can expect to receive means-tested pension support, they have less of an incentive to save for their retirement. 
Gordon Brown has sought to mitigate these disincentives in two principal ways. First, he is pumping more money into in-work benefits, such as those for working families which supplement earned income for the low-paid. Next year, low earners without children will also receive such help. Second, he is ensuring that the new credits are withdrawn quite gradually, so that people on them generally lose about 40% in benefit for every extra pound of income, whether from work or retirement savings. These ""taper"" rates mean that no one should face a situation where they are no better off if they are working or have saved for their retirement. 
However, each of these strategies has its limits. Mr Brown's scope for creating a clear gap between the rewards from working and not working is constrained by the commitment to cut child poverty. This means that the new child tax credit is delivering a lot more money to low-income families who are not working, as well as to those who are--a marked contrast with America's welfare-to-work strategy. More gradual taper rates mean that fewer people face effective marginal tax rates--taxes and benefit deductions on an extra pound of income--at penal levels of up to 100%. But they drag more people into a system where such marginal tax rates can still be higher than the 40% top rate of income tax.
A new study by Mike Brewer and Tom Clark of the Institute for Fiscal Studies has sought to work out the overall impact on incentives of Gordon Brown's tax and benefit changes from 1997 through to next year. They conclude that the pension credit means that ""a very significant proportion of people planning to retire in the distant future face an unambiguously reduced financial incentive to save"". The reforms, they say, generally help to spring the unemployment trap (where it does not pay people to find a job). But this gain comes at a cost: on average among employees, marginal tax rates will have risen across most earnings categories (see chart).
The extension of means-tested benefits is risky, according to Mr Pearson, because ""there are an awful lot of people in the middle of the income distribution who are going to discover they've got higher marginal tax rates."" This is less likely to affect men than women, he says. ""For women with children there are quite high costs for every extra hour of work, and you're giving them an incentive to work less.""
There are alternatives. Since older pensioners are generally the poorest, those over 75 or 80 could be paid a much higher basic state pension, thus reducing poverty without creating disincentives to save for retirement. This could be combined with targeting means-tested benefits more tightly on low-income families. Some of these might be discouraged from working, but if fewer people overall faced higher marginal tax rates, it might well be preferable to ever more means-testing.","Gordon Brown means well with his expansion of means-tested benefits.

MUCH cynicism greeted the announcement in June by Helen Clark, New Zealand's Labour prime minister since 1999, of a snap election for July 27th, four months early. Miss Clark gave as her reason the split in Labour's coalition partner, the left-wing Alliance, over support for the war against terrorism. Both of the Alliance's factions, though, had promised to continue backing Labour. 
The timing, the cynics reckoned, had much more to do with Labour's enormous opinion-poll support (50%-plus) on the back of a strong economy--both predicted to decline in tandem. Miss Clark made it quite clear she wanted an absolute majority under New Zealand's newish system of proportional representation, which gives electors two votes, one for a party and one for a representative.
Miss Clark's move failed. On the night, Labour won 52 seats in the 120-seat parliament (see chart), along with two seats from one Alliance faction, the Progressive Coalition. A small number of votes remain to be counted, but only two seats are liable to change hands. Still, the centre-right National opposition, once deemed the ""natural"" government of New Zealand, crashed to its worst-ever result. By judicious negotiation, Labour may be able to exercise de facto majority control.
Among the bit-players, the Greens and the free-market Association of Consumers and Taxpayers (ACT) kept their share of the vote. The anti-immigrant New Zealand First party and the centrist, pro-family United Future both did well--the latter surprising everybody as its seat-count surged from one to nine. ACT will ally itself with National, but NZ First is probably too mistrusted for anyone to deal with. Labour, for its part, is negotiating with both the Greens and United Future for their support.
Unfortunately, Labour is having a row with the Greens (who backed it in the previous parliament) over genetic engineering (GE). Last year, a Royal Commission imposed strict controls on field trials and a moratorium on commercial release of GE organisms until October 2003. In May, the Greens threatened to bring the government down if the moratorium was ended. 
Miss Clark took a hard line, saying she would not let ""the tail wag the dog"", only to see the Greens' support promptly surge. Then a scandal dubbed ""Corngate"" emerged, alleging a government cover-up of an accidental release of GE material in 2000. The Greens' flat vote shows that Miss Clark read public opinion accurately. But she may yet have to offer the Greens an extension of the moratorium.
She may also be hoping to play the Greens and United Future off against each other: she needs the support of only one of them for a workable majority. But this is tricky: United Future's leader, a former Labour man, Peter Dunne, is cannily seeking his own deal with the Greens. They already agree broadly over GE. Miss Clark will need a delicate touch.
Labour has managed well economically, and most businessmen feel easy with it. But it inherited a strong economy in 1999, and then both commodity prices and exchange rates went its way. Now dairy prices are falling (thanks in part to European and American subsidies) and the New Zealand dollar is firming up. 
Still, the finance minister, Michael Cullen, hopes to boost growth from the usual 2-3%, up to 4%, by spending more on research and development and education. The voters like this, and Miss Clark's job seems secure. But the poll showed that voters also like the two-vote system's potential to keep governments in check. Miss Clark should take nothing for granted.","But Helen Clark did n't get the absolute majority Helen Clark 'd been manoeuvring for

THIS week saw two big announcements about the Vinland map, a piece of parchment which purportedly proves that Scandinavian explorers arrived in America centuries before Columbus. One of these announcements showed that the map is genuine. The other showed it is not.
The Vinland map was revealed to the world in 1965 by researchers at Yale University, where it still resides. It depicts Europe, Asia and Africa--and also, across the Atlantic ocean, a place called Vinland. This is supposed to correspond to land explored early in the 11th century by a Viking called Leif Eriksson, and so named because of the wild vines growing there. Unfortunately, the Vinland map had no recorded history before 1958, and so became the subject of instant controversy.
The proof that the map is genuine came from Jacqueline Olin, of the Smithsonian Centre for Materials Research and Education, in Suitland, Maryland, and her colleagues. They used radiocarbon dating to find out how old the map's parchment is. The answer, published in the August edition of Radiocarbon, is that the skin was stripped from its unfortunate host in 1434, give or take 11 years. That is half a century before Columbus sailed the ocean blue.
The proof that the map is a forgery comes from Robin Clark and Katherine Brown of University College, London, and is published in the latest edition of Analytical Chemistry. The researchers used a technique called Raman spectroscopy to trace the distribution over the parchment of a substance called anatase. This material, a form of titanium dioxide, is not known to have been manufactured before the 1920s. It had been detected in the map's ink in the past by spot-sampling. That cast serious doubt on the map's authenticity. Raman spectroscopy, which analyses chemical mixtures from the way they scatter light, allowed the whole of the map's surface to be examined. Dr Clark and Ms Brown found that all the ink contained anatase.
One possible reconciliation is, of course, that the map is a modern forgery on a piece of ancient parchment. Another is that the anatase formed naturally by the transmogrification of another form of titanium dioxide over the centuries--though that seems unlikely. A third is that anatase is not, actually, a modern invention, and that medieval map makers knew about it.
Vinland aside, the argument about which bunch of Europeans arrived in America first is an odd one. First, there is now archaeological evidence of at least one Norse settlement in Newfoundland. A Norse coin has also been found in Maine, although the context suggests it got there through trade rather than by being dropped by a careless Viking.
More to the point, it is a matter of historical record that Greenland was discovered by Norsemen in the ninth century and, indeed, colonised in the tenth. A glance at any map shows that Greenland is an offshore island of North America. True, it is not part of the mainland. But Columbus himself did not set foot on the American mainland until his fourth voyage, in 1502. That was a decade after his landing on the Bahamian island of San Salvador on October 12th 1492, the date normally thought of as his ""discovery"" of the new world. Regardless of the authenticity of the Vinland map, there is no doubt who made it first. And it wasn't the Spanish-backed Genoese guy.

A glance at any map shows that Greenland is an offshore island of North America . True , it is not part of the mainland . But Columbus himself did not set foot on the American mainland until his fourth voyage , in 1502 . That was a decade after his landing on the Bahamian island of San Salvador on October 12th 1492 , the date normally thought of as his "" discovery "" of the new world . Regardless of the authenticity of the Vinland map , there is no doubt who made it first . And it was n't the Spanish - backed Genoese guy .

Weidenfeld & Nicolson; 226 pages; pounds 20. To be published in the United States by Walker in October; $24
AMERICANS conquered their west cheerfully, mythologising as they went; Russians treated their big east with indifferent contempt. Siberia was a land of punishment, a freezerbox in which to dump officials mad and bad. Yet Siberia transformed Muscovy as the west transformed America. It was a lust for fur, not gold, which drove 17th-century Russians across the river Ob to the Yenisey, the Lena, the Indiginka, and the distant, other-worldly Kolyma. The speed of this almighty portage was incredible: Russians reached the Pacific in 1639, 166 years before Lewis and Clark in America.
Anna Reid, Kiev correspondent of the Daily Telegraph and of this newspaper from 1993-95, sets out to write a history of some of the native Siberians whom the Russians pushed aside along the way. She begins among the Muslim Tartars and the Finnish-related Khant, whose word for a photograph is ""pool of still water"". In Buddhist Buryatia she uncovers an oddly heroic tale about some British Congregationalists. Arriving in 1818, they converted just four Buryat in 23 years and compiled the first Tibetan-Mongolian dictionary.
She recounts the demise of the nominally independent Tuvan Republic which in 1929 had three cars, no roads, and a trove of fine horses. Everywhere she traces the scars of Stalinism on native peoples: the mass slaughter of lamas and shamans, collectivisation of reindeer herds, theft of sacred fishing grounds. Traditions are almost gone. In Sakhalin a Nivkh woman explains how her father hunted. ""Whenever he caught a seal he cleaned its skull, filled it with berries and threw it back into the sea. Nobody does that now."" 
Ms Reid is winningly honest. The centrally-planned settlements she passes are ""total dumps"", the native peoples all too often deracinated and undone by drink and poverty. But she has little feel for the wilderness or obvious affection for the outdoor life which formed the native cultures. By the time she reaches Arctic Chukotka, whose fierce Inuit-related Chukchi were the only native people to force the Russians into retreat, she appears defeated, as many before, by Siberia's immensity.

JOE CLARK was once briefly Canada's prime minister, and later and more impressively its foreign minister. More recently, he has led his Progressive Conservative Party in a fight for survival. But the party won just 13 seats in the House of Commons at the last election in 2000, and Mr Clark could not turn it into a credible alternative to the dominant Liberals of the prime minister, Jean Chretien. With his party's poll ratings stuck at just 14%, on August 6th Mr Clark told the party to elect a new leader early next year, saying he had taken it as far as he could.
Mr Clark's problem was that conservative voters are divided between his party, whose support is mainly in the east, and another, stronger, outfit, the Canadian Alliance, which is dominant in the west. His hopes rose last year when he attracted a handful of disaffected Alliance MPs to join him in a loose parliamentary coalition. But in April the rebels bolted back when a new Alliance leader, Stephen Harper, threatened them with expulsion. 
Will Mr Clark's decision to depart help long-standing efforts to unite the right? Mr Harper immediately challenged the Conservatives to consider a merger and a joint leadership convention. He had earlier offered to negotiate joint slates of candidates for the next election. But some Tory MPs cling to the memory of past glory as a national party, and dismiss the Alliance as a regional force. Other Conservative leaders do not: Mike Harris, who resigned last year as Ontario's premier, is said to be keen to lead a united right-wing party.
The right is not alone in seeking new leaders. Alexa McDonough, the leader of the small, leftish, New Democrats, announced in June that she would stand down after seven years. And the Liberals are embroiled in an increasingly open and hard-fought leadership battle in which Mr Chretien is being challenged by Paul Martin, his long-serving finance minister whom he sacked in June. Mr Martin looks to have the edge. His supporters are strong in local constituency organisations, and are likely to be in a majority at a party convention in February where the leadership could be decided. The prime minister's loyalists retort that their man has won three election majorities. But his tide may finally be ebbing. More than a dozen Liberal MPs have called for Mr Chretien to retire with honour. Mr Clark has just shown him the way.","A time to retire , a time to contend

IT IS a gripping scene. A big company is in trouble, its owners and creditors squabbling as it rushes headlong towards a nasty end: at best being broken up with the good bits falling into foreign hands, at worst bankruptcy. Then--presto!--out of the blue flies in a saviour, an experienced boss armed with cash and a plan to take charge and put things right. Who could resist our business Superman? But does he really exist?
It seems he does, and is living in Italy, having replaced his Clark Kent alias with that of Roberto Colaninno. He ran Olivetti and then Telecom Italia, from which he was cruelly ousted when Pirelli took control in 2001. Having watched the collapse of the Fiat industrial empire with growing dismay, he has now sprung into action. He says it is vital for Italy, and especially the Turin region, to retain a car industry. Many thousands of jobs are at stake. Fearlessly, Mr Colaninno has now donned his red underpants, laid his reputation on the line and offered to run Fiat.
He is now finalising a rescue plan that will probably be presented to Fiat's board in the next couple of weeks. If he wins their support, all--all?--he has to do is persuade the banks and the Agnelli family, which together control Fiat, to stand aside and let him work his magic. According to this script, Fiat can be saved not just as an Italian concern, but also as a force in the global car market, in which it is now failing. Fiat's shares rose by one-fifth on news of Mr Colaninno's possible coming.
It sounds good. Too good, perhaps. Mr Colaninno is no slouch, but at every turn he faces almost impossible odds. There are plenty of examples, especially in America, of people who think they can turn around a company getting the chance to do so by buying it. But it is rare for an outsider to win that opportunity merely by proposing himself to those who now control the firm, offering only the purchase of a minority stake plus, of course, the brilliance of his ideas and management skills.
In the case of Fiat, Mr Colaninno needs to win the support of multiple constituencies, including the government. Last summer, when he first began privately to express interest in Fiat, he was quickly blocked by Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's prime minister as well as one of its most powerful businessmen. Mr Berlusconi changed his mind only recently, when it became clear that his own efforts to find a solution were failing. Now he hopes to ride on Mr Colaninno's coat-tails and take credit if things go right.
Three huge obstacles remain: the banks, the Agnellis and the business itself. Four big Italian banks ultimately control Fiat's fate. If Fiat meets debt-reduction targets and stems the outflow of cash from its car business, the banks will continue to support it, including with new loans in 2005. If Fiat slips, it will in effect be bust. Its debt was recently downgraded to junk status by Moody's, a rating agency, which gave warning of worse to come.
The banks met on January 8th to hear a progress report and to consider a new plan to split Fiat Auto from the rest of Fiat, thereby limiting the negative impact of cars on the group as a whole. This would need--and probably fail to win--the support of General Motors (GM), which owns 20% of Fiat Auto and may, under a put-option deal, have to buy the rest of it as soon as next year. GM is now working with Fiat to improve a rescue plan for Fiat Auto agreed last autumn. It wants to renegotiate the option--or, better still, to scrap it. 
The bankers are in two minds, not least because this new plan may not be all that different from what Mr Colaninno is proposing. And although they still have good reason not to trust the Agnellis, they also have good reason to be cautious about Mr Colaninno. Some have worked with him before and respect his abilities. Others are openly sceptical.
Truth, justice and the Italian way of life
The Agnellis, too, seem divided--with the protracted illness of the clan chief, Gianni, not helping. Late last year the family, which uses its 34% stake to control Fiat, broadly rallied around Umberto Agnelli's efforts to save the group. Umberto backed an attempted coup to install new managers friendly with Mediobanca, a Milanese investment bank. But other banks saw this as a direct attack and rallied in turn around Paolo Fresco, Fiat's chairman. A new chief executive was imposed beneath him, but Mr Fresco narrowly survived--though he is still due to retire in July. He has since been receptive to Mr Colaninno and has given him the go-ahead to talk to Fiat's board.
The failed coup discredited Umberto within the family. Susanna Agnelli, his sister, has become an influential voice favourable to Mr Colaninno. But the split means that Mr Colaninno has an even harder job to persuade the family to back his plan. He does not yet know if the family would be prepared to cede control in return for his investment--of maybe euro2 billion ($2.1 billion)--and managerial efforts to save the group. Nor does he know if the Agnellis are privately attempting to undermine his efforts to win the banks' support.
What if Mr Colaninno somehow persuades both the banks and the Agnellis to give him a chance? His final obstacle may be the biggest of all. Poor management has seen Fiat's car business decline to the verge of collapse. Its product range is weak, its market share is evaporating and it is haemorrhaging cash.
What could Mr Colaninno do that nobody else can? He claims that his long experience in the components sector gives him a special insight into how to fix the car business. He would hire better managers and address weaknesses in design. He has not said so, but he might be far tougher than existing management about shutting inefficient car factories, especially if he can convince politicians--above all, Mr Berlusconi--that the alternative will be more dramatic job losses due to the bankruptcy of the entire group. Even so, the enterprise is hugely risky. A task fit for Superman? Or merely an impossible one?","Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's Roberto Colaninno, trying to save Fiat

He does not yet know if the family would be prepared to cede control in return for his investment--of maybe euro2 billion ($2.1 billion)--and managerial efforts to save the group. Nor does he know if the Agnellis are privately attempting to undermine his efforts to win the banks' support.
What if Mr Colaninno somehow persuades both the banks and the Agnellis to give him a chance? His final obstacle may be the biggest of all. Poor management has seen Fiat's car business decline to the verge of collapse. Its product range is weak, its market share is evaporating and it is haemorrhaging cash.
What could Mr Colaninno do that nobody else can? He claims that his long experience in the components sector gives him a special insight into how to fix the car business. He would hire better managers and address weaknesses in design. He has not said so, but he might be far tougher than existing management about shutting inefficient car factories, especially if he can convince politicians--above all, Mr Berlusconi--that the alternative will be more dramatic job losses due to the bankruptcy of the entire group. Even so, the enterprise is hugely risky. A task fit for Superman? Or merely an impossible one?",920,New Zealand,A29-9067,,False,,0,True

THE space shuttle Columbia took off on its last flight without particular ceremony. Shuttles have been America's space workhorses for more than 20 years. They are regularly rocketed into space loaded with satellites, or supplies for a space station, or boxes of plants to see how they grow without gravity; that sort of thing. Yet, humdrum or not, getting a ride in a shuttle, joining the still tiny group of people who have viewed the world from the heavens like gods, is greatly coveted. All seven in Columbia's crew had served long apprenticeships in more earthbound activities before being considered for a space trip. All seven were in their 40s; the five men with receding hairlines; the two women doing their best to look alluring in their working clothes. No movie director would have cast them for a space epic. Yet each had a personality more interesting than that suggested by the routine grins offered to cameramen. 
Kalpana Chawla, an Indian-born naturalised American, had for years radiated star quality, particularly in Karnal, the small farming town in northern India where she grew up. She said that J.R.D. Tata, who flew the first mail flights in India, had been her childhood hero. The Times of India and India Today, a news magazine, ran pictures of Miss Chawla as she prepared for her mission. Readers were told when to watch the skies of southern India as Columbia passed over in orbit during the 16-day journey. 
Miss Chawla had had an earlier trip into space in 1997 after studying aerospace engineering in India and America, and learning to pilot practically anything that could fly, from gliders to airliners. For Indian politicians her career has for years been an argument that technology promised a hopeful future for all Indians, a powerful message in a country where millions live in poverty. When technology failed Kalpana Chawla last weekend, Karnal turned to its old, trusted ways. Incense was burnt and marigolds were placed on her photographs. 
The symbols
The United States turned to its own trusted symbol, the flag. All over the country flags were lowered to half-mast. Israel did the same. Ilan Ramon, an Israeli air force colonel, was the only non-American in the crew. In the aftermath of the shuttle disaster, Israel, perhaps understandably, sought to emphasise its links with the United States. Ariel Sharon, the Israeli prime minister, said that ""at times like these"" the two countries felt their ""common fate, identity and values, and shared vision"". Just as Indian newspapers had dwelt on Miss Chawla's qualities as a symbol of the new India, the Israeli press recounted Mr Ramon's exploits in defence of his country. In 1981 he had taken part in an air attack on a nuclear reactor being built in Iraq. He was a modest soldier. ""There was no knife between his teeth,"" said a colleague. Mr Ramon recalled that an Arab, Sultan bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, had flown in a space shuttle in 1985, so he was not the first astronaut from the Middle East. As well as Israel, he represented ""all our neighbours"".
Mr Ramon was one of a number of foreigners who have been invited from time to time to take part in shuttle flights. He had been training with the rest of the crew since July 1998. As Columbia's ""payload specialist"" he had the most peaceful of the 59 scientific tasks being carried out: studying the effects of sandstorms on climate.
Three of the Americans in Columbia were on their first space flights. Laurel Clark was a physician and much of her previous experience had been in submarines, where she worked on escape techniques. The day before the shuttle burnt up, she sent to her family an e-mail, now a footnote in space history, describing the trip. David Brown was another doctor. As a young man he worked in a circus as an acrobat. He said it taught him the value of team work. William McCool, the pilot of the shuttle, was a former test pilot. Rick Husband, the shuttle's commander, was on his second space flight. He was working with a team designing spacecraft for possible trips to the moon and beyond.
This was the first shuttle mission for three years to be given over entirely to scientific experiments, rather than as a space truck carrying cargoes to a space station being assembled 200 miles above the earth. Michael Anderson, an African-American, had the job of checking that all the experiments were going well. He, like Miss Chawla and Mr Ramon, was aware that he carried an extra burden in his job: as a role model for young blacks. Impressively, he had logged more than 200 hours in space. One of his trips was to Mir, a Russian station that has since been abandoned after years in space.
It is obvious to say that the seven made a unified group. If you work together towards a common objective over a period of several years there is likely to be a unity. But for the Columbia seven there was more than that. Some people call themselves Europeans, some Asians, some indeed Americans. Kalpana Chawla said, ""When you are in space and look at the stars and the galaxy, you feel that you are not just from any particular piece of land, but from the solar system.""

Adventuring and adventurers 
THE Lewis and Clark expedition that began preparations in 1803 had everything: grand adventure, heroism, friendship and scholarship. It was modelled on Captain Cook's voyages and its sponsor, Thomas Jefferson, meant it to document, command and profit from what lay beyond Missouri. Although the dream of a north-west passage to India ended the moment Meriwether Lewis and his dog Seaman crossed the continental divide, new dreams replaced it--America as a continental power and dreams of the west itself, of cattlemen, silvermen, railwaymen, and the rest.
Two centuries on, modern writers and historians still have a hard time matching the sweep of Lewis and Clark's own journals. This is especially true of Brian Hall, whose third novel is based on the expedition's main characters. His narrative judders between primitive Indian voices and delicate American ones, with the French trapper somewhere in between. Extracts from the expeditionary journal are more intriguing than the narrative he spins around them. Mr Hall gains only towards the end when the journals peter out and his imagination begins to bloom. Suffering acute depression, Lewis shoots himself and dies slowly: ""He picks up a leaf. His hand is bloody, but...Red maple. Acer rubrum. He turns the leaf over. The feel of it in his hands. He will miss this.""
Thomas Slaughter opens his extended essay on Lewis and Clark with a Joseph Campell-like comparison of creation myths. Some of the Indian peoples the expedition encountered had an Eden of their own. ""Lone Man is born to a Mandan virgin, who conceives him by ingesting a kernel of corn."" His chapters are called ""Dreams"", ""Possessions"", ""Hunting Themselves"" and, inevitably, ""Being First"". The chapter on the nature of possession is illuminating. Who owns a horse on the prairie? Was it wrong for the Sioux to pilfer from the expedition? We are reminded that Lewis and Clark traversed a land that no longer exists. The oceanic prairie has been sectioned and buffalo have been replaced by cattle and slaughter-houses; the coho salmon that Lewis sketched with such interest is nearly extinct in the rivers where the expedition found it in abundance. Lewis and Clark are more than adventurers, Mr Slaughter maintains. We keep returning to them because ""they are a better guide to our souls than our skins.""
After so much male angst it is refreshing to turn to Virginia Scharff's sassy reflection on the movement of women through the west. The first and strongest of her subjects is Sacagawea, an Indian woman who proved an invaluable guide and translator for Lewis and Clark. Despite her posthumous fame--she appears on American currency and in textbooks--little is certain about Sacagawea. Her name changed with the different Indian nations the expedition passed through: Flirt, Lost Woman, Chief, Grass Woman. She may have lived until 1884 in Wyoming's Wind River Indian reservation or she may have died 60 years earlier and a thousand miles away.

THE Democratic Party is busy proving the truth of the old saw that no American politician can look in the mirror without seeing a president in the making. This week three more Democrats, Carol Moseley-Braun, a former Illinois senator, Dennis Kucinich, a fourth-term congressman and, most formidably, Dick Gephardt, the party's former leader in the House, added their names to the five declared candidates (Howard Dean, John Edwards, John Kerry, Joe Lieberman and Al Sharpton). Other possible volunteers include a former candidate (Gary Hart), three sitting senators (Bob Graham, Christopher Dodd and Joseph Biden) and an ex-general (Wesley Clark). The party could easily end up with a dozen names.
Is this profusion of candidates evidence of the Democratic Party's vitality? Or is it yet another example of its unfitness for power? So far, the signs are not good.
The number of candidates provides yet more evidence that the Democrats are deeply divided over everything that matters--from a looming war with Iraq to the North American Free-Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada. Mr Lieberman is a staunch free-trader and Iraq hawk. Mr Kucinich, on the other hand, voted against the resolution that gave George Bush the authority to take military action against Iraq. He promises to be a ""people's president"", living in a ""worker's White House"", and his first act will be to nullify NAFTA.
Some Democrats argue that the size of the field will allow ""serious"" candidates like Mr Lieberman to differentiate themselves from ""fringe"" figures like Mr Kucinich. But this is easier said than done. 
Many ""fringe"" candidates have vocal supporters among the interest groups that dominate Democratic primaries. Both Ms Moseley-Braun--the first black woman elected to the Senate--and Mr Sharpton, though slightly tarnished characters, speak for black activists that the Democrats too often take for granted. Mr Sharpton, a fiery orator with an infectious sense of humour, will be particularly difficult for the party establishment to marginalise. Other ""fringe"" candidates will be hard to ignore because of their expertise: think of Mr Dean's record as a health-care reformer when he was governor of Vermont and (if he runs) Mr Clark's military clout.
The biggest problem for the Democrats is that this huge field will probably drag the party further to the left. Left-wing candidates will inevitably hog the headlines. Three candidates are outspoken opponents of the administration's policies on Iraq. Mr Sharpton supports reparations for slavery. Mr Kucinich wants to create a federal ""Department of Peace"". Mr Dean, a supporter of universal health insurance, draws loud applause when he says that he represents ""the Democratic wing of the Democratic Party"".
More mainstream candidates may have to move leftwards to appease the party's base, which hates George Bush with a fury. Mr Gephardt will have to protect his trade-union support from Mr Kucinich. Even the determinedly centrist Mr Edwards has taken to saying he is not ""Republican-lite"".
Stirring the pot, the Republicans are on the watch for anything they can depict as disloyalty to America. They have made a fuss about Jimmy Carter signing a peace petition circulated by a British tabloid--and thus, they claim, breaking the convention that ex-presidents keep quiet about controversial issues.

NEW ZEALAND is doing its best to cash in on being the nearest place in the real world to Middle Earth, the setting for J.R.R. Tolkien's ""The Lord of the Rings"", and it seems to be having a fair degree of success. The number of visitors from North America alone in 2002 was up 9.6% from 2001, to 205,289. 
The three films made from Tolkien's book (""The Fellowship of the Ring"", ""The Two Towers"", nominated for six Oscars, and ""The Return of the King"", to be released at the end of this year) were shot in New Zealand. The rugged South Island has taken a starring role, providing the majestic back-drops for some of the films' most dramatic sequences. But the whole country is feeling the benefits.
Wellington, New Zealand's capital, in the more populous North Island, is the home of Peter Jackson, the director of the trilogy. The town's film industry, thriving on tax breaks and an educated, relatively cheap workforce, is doing so well that it has been dubbed Wellywood. ""The Last Samurai"", starring Tom Cruise, with a New Zealand volcano doing its best to look like Mount Fuji, is one of several epics being made there.
The campaign to promote New Zealand as a safe and green destination began soon after the terrorist attacks on the United States. The first of the trilogy was just starting to draw in the crowds. Last December Helen Clark, New Zealand's prime minister, was in New York at the time of the premiere of ""The Two Towers"", promoting the charms of her faraway country. Pete Hodgson, the energy minister, is now ""Rings"" minister as well. A New Zealand website flags up a ""Land of the Middle Earth"" tour. Te Papa, the country's leading museum, has an exhibition based on the epic.
But not even New Zealand is free from worries about terrorism. This week letters containing cyanide were sent to several embassies. As Tolkien observed in his tales, you cannot escape from the struggle between good and evil.

""WE WISH to suggest a structure for the salt of deoxyribose nucleic acid (D.N.A.)."" So began the modest introduction to what turned out to be one of the most momentous papers in the history of biology. It was published exactly 50 years ago, on April 25th 1953, in Nature. Now, even, advertisements for IBM boast that the company can help its customers get ""into the DNA of business...to turn old processes into new profits"".
Within two generations DNA has moved from academic obscurity--where even scientists needed to see it spelled out--to everyday language, an instantly recognised symbol with little connection to its scientific origins. Much of that cultural shift is courtesy of James Watson and Francis Crick, the authors of the paper in question. The structure they wished to suggest gave birth to an icon: the double helix. 
Building on the work of many others, they described how the two spiral chains which make up DNA are coiled around a single axis, and how the two strands unite through the precise pairing of four different types of nucleotide bases--adenine, cytosine, guanine and thymine. Their paper also included a simple pen-and-ink drawing of the molecule, by Odile Crick, Francis's wife. The two researchers had little doubt about their prediction; as Dr Watson later remarked, ""A structure this pretty just had to exist."" 
As a scientific model, the double helix opened the way to answering many lingering questions in genetics: how hereditary information is stored, how it is copied and passed on from one generation to another, how genetic damage is repaired and how information flows from the level of the gene to the marvellous structures of nature. But the double helix has invaded the wider world, too, and has become a symbol of the hopes and fears that people have about where biological knowledge might lead. When a movie about a genetically engineered future was dubbed ""GATTACA"" by its creator, he did not need to spell out the fact that the four letters used in the title are the abbreviations for the nucleotide bases--in other words, the letters of the genetic code.
In scientific terms, the model of the double helix, combined with the notion that DNA is a code, has transformed biology. But it has also given people a powerful visual and verbal means to communicate their concerns about the fruits of this new science--gene prospecting, DNA patenting, genetic testing, designer babies, cloning--and their social consequences. As Susan Lindee, a historian of science at the University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia, points out, today the gene is no longer a simple biological unit, but a ""supergene"" which has been invested with personality, good or bad, and the power to determine identity, reveal ancient origins, shape family relations and even predict future health. 
Of course, genetic determinism is nothing new. The code and the double helix have become such powerful cultural symbols in part because they offer a new twist on old ideas about the power of heredity and destiny in the blood. They also fit neatly into existing cultural notions of science, picking up where Prometheus and Frankenstein left off, turning genetics into prime material for novels, films and videogames. Today, according to Soraya de Chadarevian, a historian of science at the University of Cambridge, DNA has taken on almost sacred status as the central blueprint for life, and the double helix has become the instantly identifiable secular equivalent of a modern religious icon.

This new iconography is increasingly reflected in the visual arts. This year has seen half a dozen exhibitions in New York and London, displaying paintings, photography, sculpture and digital works that all take their cue from molecular biology.
Art has long borrowed images and inspiration from science and technology. And as Dr Chadarevian points out, the double helix is not the first strong image created by 20th-century science. Physics has also produced a number of potent signs, such as the atomic mushroom cloud and the Bohr atom, with its busy electrons orbiting a nucleus. Indeed, the splitting of the atom strongly influenced abstract painters such as Wassily Kandinsky, says Suzanne Anker, an artist based in New York and co-author of a new book on biology in the arts*. The early years of aviation and motoring also sent the artistic imaginations of Italian and Russian futurists soaring. But the principles of heredity and evolution had to wait until the double helix, and subsequent representations of DNA, to find a visual language. 
Nor was the double helix an immediate cultural hit. The first artist to use it was Salvador Dali, who included DNA spirals in his surreal, phantasmagoric paintings of the 1950s. But he was ahead of his time. It took the publication of Dr Watson's book, ""The Double Helix"", in 1968, and the advent of biotechnology and the manipulation of genetic material in the 1970s, to edge DNA towards the centre of the public gaze. Since then, however--and particularly since the 1980s--many artists have followed in Dali's wake. The marvellous symmetry and sheer beauty of the double helix has been a boon to sculpture, sending double helices soaring to the sky and snaking to the ground, as the piece by Charles Jencks at the beginning of this article demonstrates. 
Other artists have turned to related genetic structures and images. Ms Anker, for example, recreates chromosomes in sculpture and on canvas, in order, she says, to look at relationships between the body in flesh, its genetic code and primitive alphabets. Kevin Clarke, an American artist, creates ""conceptual"" genetic portraits by writing out sections of his subject's genetic sequence as a string of As, Cs, Gs and Ts superimposed on an appropriate image--such as, in the case of James Watson, a series of bookshelves. 
Some artists use DNA itself as their palette. In the National Portrait Gallery in London there hangs a ""picture"" of one of Britain's best-known scientists, Sir John Sulston, who was a key figure in the Human Genome Project. But look into this work, by Marc Quinn, and the thing you will see is not Sir John, but your own face in reflection, speckled with white glassy beads. These are bacterial colonies, which have been genetically modified with bits of Sir John's own DNA.
Eduardo Kac, a Brazilian artist, also uses genetic engineering of bacteria and animals to explore relations between science and art, man and nature. His most famous work, ""GFP Bunny"", is a rabbit genetically modified to glow green when it is exposed to ultraviolet light. In ""Genesis"", Mr Kac translated a sentence from the Bible into Morse Code, then into DNA, which he incorporated in bacteria. Viewers were encouraged to turn on an ultraviolet light in the gallery, thus inducing further genetic mutations in the bacteria, and changing the meaning of the Word. Joe Davis, an artist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has even grander plans for his genetically modified rabbits. He wants to engineer them to express part of the Milky Way, translated into genetic code. 
But as Martin Kemp, professor of art history at Oxford University, points out, much of the ""genetic"" art produced today is more a criticism than a celebration of modern biology. There is a ready forum in the arts for the debates that rage in the press over about what is and is not permissible. These, in turn, reflect popular anxieties about social control, conformity and commoditisation. In ""Cultured"", for example, Bryan Crockett, an American artist, comments on the business of biotechnology with larger-than-life marble mice representing the seven deadly sins. Gluttony is a model of an animal modified to become obese, so that it can be used in the laboratory to study diabetes.
Architecture, too, is feeling the effects of genetics. Spiral staircases aside, few architects directly invoke the double helix or DNA outside a scientific setting, according to Neil Spiller, a specialist in architecture and digital theory at University College, London. That said, a number of architects are turning to the genetic underpinnings of evolution in their design methods. 
Among them is Greg Lynn, an architect based in Los Angeles who is also a professor at the University of Applied Arts in Vienna. His ""Embryological House"" is a computer-based experiment intended to create architecture out of curved surfaces rather than sets of co-ordinates--blobs rather than blocks. Mr Lynn's design program allows him to specify the ""seed"" of a house, based on, say, its physical setting or his client's initial specifications. The computer generates changes, or ""mutations"", that break the symmetry of this starting design into strange, almost organic forms. Whether the Embryological House will mature from a gleam in Mr Lynn's eye to a home on the range remains to be seen. In the meantime, though, he has used the same approach to create ""evolved"" tea and coffee pots for Alessi, an Italian household-goods manufacturer.
Fashion is proving rather more resistant to genetic inspiration. While the double helix has popped up in everything from T-shirts to perfume, it is used more as a visual gimmick than a design principle. One exception is the work of Helen Storey, a London artist who collaborated with her sister, Kate Storey, an embryologist at the University of Dundee, in Scotland, to create ""Primitive Streak"". This is a dress collection that represents the first 1,000 hours of human life. Almost half of the collection, now on display at King's College, London, reflects the different ways in which genes influence early embryonic development, using the weave of cloth and the cut of fabric to build the double helix into the design.
While artists are increasingly influenced by genetics, few biologists, so far, have admitted to finding inspiration in artistic representations of their world. ""Most think we're messing around with dresses, which has nothing to do with the seriousness of science,"" says Helen Storey. One exception is John McLachlan, a biologist at Peninsula Medical School near Plymouth, England, who first contacted Helen Storey to use pictures of Primitive Streak to teach his students about embryology. Their subsequent collaboration on other artistic projects has led Dr McLachlan to revamp his notions of how sex determination occurs in humans. He outlines his ideas in a paper in the May issue of the Journal of Theoretical Biology, co-written by Helen Storey. While art and genetics may not pair with perfect complementarity, it is surely a sign of stronger bonds forming when artists participate in peer-reviewed science. 
Sound science
As the double helix weaves its way into the visual arts, DNA is also finding a voice in music. A few biologists, composers and computer scientists are working with DNA, not just as inspiration but as raw material for ""the sound of the 21st century"", according to Sophie Dauvois, a multimedia designer based in London.
Ms Dauvois is part of Sonic Gene, an ambitious project started in 2001 to celebrate the completion of the Human Genome Project by translating the entire DNA sequence into music. The challenge lies in finding a meaningful way of converting a string of nucleotide bases into pitches, rhythms and so on. To do this, Ms Dauvois is working with Joseph Insana, a computer specialist at the European Bioinformatics Institute in Cambridge, England. Dr Insana has created a computer program to turn nucleotides into musical pitches, allowing him to use the exquisite acuity of human hearing to detect different sounds, and hence different nucleotides in various DNA sequences played back as sound. 
While four pitches (one for each nucleotide) may be enough for DNA analysis, they make for boring music. So the pair have linked up with Tim Gane, a member of the English pop band Stereolab, to help turn the data into something musicians can work with. One way they are trying to spice up the sound is to use the process by which DNA is transcribed into protein as a way of adding rhythm to the music. Once the collaborators have worked out how to convert all this genetic information into a musically useful digital form, called MIDI files, they plan to make it available over the internet, so that musicians around the world can create their own versions of the human genome, from classical to reggae. So far, the team has converted 20 genes into MIDI, though that is a mere bar in the symphony of perhaps 30,000 genes that make up the human genome. 
While Sonic Gene pushes ahead, other composers are already making music. Todd Barton, of Ashland, Oregon, is trying to set the gene involved in Huntington's chorea to music, assigning pitches to its DNA sequence to create a score for a dance conceived by a woman whose husband died of the disease. 
Others allow more of the chemistry of DNA into their music. Susan Alexjander, a composer in Santa Cruz, California, uses the physical characteristics of the four different nucleotides as her musical palette. When DNA bases are exposed to infra-red light, their chemical bonds absorb different frequencies of the light. These can be measured, providing roughly 15 different readings per molecule. Ms Alexjander takes these 60-odd absorption readings and converts them into sonic frequencies using straightforward mathematics. She then uses these pitches on her synthesiser as banks of sound, assigning them different voices and instruments. 
Mary Anne Clark, a professor of biology at Texas Wesleyan University, uses a similar method to enhance her understanding of her subject. She creates molecular music, better to appreciate patterns in the proteins that are encoded by particular genes. Along with John Dunn, a software designer, she has devised an algorithm which assigns pitches to the 20 different amino acids that are the molecular building blocks of proteins. Pitches are assigned according to how well particular amino acids mix with water. 
In nature, the chains of amino acids that proteins are composed of fold up in ways that push water-loving amino acids to the outer surface and water-loathing ones to the inside. In her computer program, Dr Clark assigns these structures to different instruments, chooses a key, and lets the sequence run. The result is music with audible themes that highlight particular features of a protein. 
Dr Clark uses her musical molecules to help students understand the complexities of protein structure, and appreciate the beauties of biology. But teaching aside, the mainstream musical appeal of DNA remains doubtful. Molecular melodies still lie somewhere in the uneasy borderland between the arts and science. 
Commerce, however, is another matter. Wherever DNA goes, these days, money never seems to be far behind. For example, Algorithmic Arts, a company started by Mr Dunn, allows customers to download molecular music over the internet. One of its products is the sound of alcohol dehydrogenase, a liver protein involved in mopping up the after-effects of a night on the town. Another, more sinister tune is based on the genes of HIV, the virus which causes AIDS.
Although Ms Alexjander hates to hear molecular music described as ""New Age"", its weird pitches and strange rhythms do sound like a natural complement to crystals and incense. So, not surprisingly, some have tried to cash in on the healing powers of DNA music, selling aural doses of Ginkgo biloba and Echinacea genes, to help listeners ""strengthen mind-body connections"", according to one internet purveyor.
Others contemplate a more hard-nosed approach. Pim Stemmer, head of research at Avidia, a Californian biotechnology company, wonders if translating DNA sequences into music might be one way to get around the problems of gene patenting, as patent offices in both America and Europe use ever-tighter criteria for what constitutes a novel, inventive, useful, and therefore patentable, claim for a gene. 
Dr Stemmer speculates that, if companies were to turn their DNA sequences into music, they might be able to copyright them instead. For a fee, such music files could then be swapped over the internet, with users translating their downloads back into DNA sequences. Failure to pay the piper, as it were, would constitute copyright infringement, and so companies could still profit in some way from their genomic handiwork while allowing others to share it. Dr Stemmer has yet to test his idea and, as Napster has shown, enforcing musical copyright can be a tricky business. But if it were to work, then the double helix will have recombined once more to create a new form, in which the triple strands of DNA, art and commerce are ever more tightly intertwined.

Caption: The Storey sisters' dress","Fifty years after its discovery, the double helix is twisting itself ever deeper into popular culture
""WE WISH to suggest a structure for the salt of deoxyribose nucleic acid (D.N.A.)."" So began the modest introduction to what turned out to be one of the most momentous papers in the history of biology. It was published exactly 50 years ago, on April 25th 1953, in Nature. Now, even, advertisements for IBM boast that the company can help its customers get ""into the DNA of business...to turn old processes into new profits"".
Within two generations DNA has moved from academic obscurity--where even scientists needed to see it spelled out--to everyday language, an instantly recognised symbol with little connection to its scientific origins. Much of that cultural shift is courtesy of James Watson and Francis Crick, the authors of the paper in question. The structure they wished to suggest gave birth to an icon: the double helix. 
Building on the work of many others, they described how the two spiral chains which make up DNA are coiled around a single axis, and how the two strands unite through the precise pairing of four different types of nucleotide bases--adenine, cytosine, guanine and thymine. Their paper also included a simple pen-and-ink drawing of the molecule, by Odile Crick, Francis's wife. The two researchers had little doubt about their prediction; as Dr Watson later remarked, ""A structure this pretty just had to exist."" 
As a scientific model, the double helix opened the way to answering many lingering questions in genetics: how hereditary information is stored, how it is copied and passed on from one generation to another, how genetic damage is repaired and how information flows from the level of the gene to the marvellous structures of nature. But the double helix has invaded the wider world, too, and has become a symbol of the hopes and fears that people have about where biological knowledge might lead. When a movie about a genetically engineered future was dubbed ""GATTACA"" by its creator, he did not need to spell out the fact that the four letters used in the title are the abbreviations for the nucleotide bases--in other words, the letters of the genetic code.
In scientific terms, the model of the double helix, combined with the notion that DNA is a code, has transformed biology. But it has also given people a powerful visual and verbal means to communicate their concerns about the fruits of this new science--gene prospecting, DNA patenting, genetic testing, designer babies, cloning--and their social consequences. As Susan Lindee, a historian of science at the University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia, points out, today the gene is no longer a simple biological unit, but a ""supergene"" which has been invested with personality, good or bad, and the power to determine identity, reveal ancient origins, shape family relations and even predict future health. 
Of course, genetic determinism is nothing new. The code and the double helix have become such powerful cultural symbols in part because they offer a new twist on old ideas about the power of heredity and destiny in the blood. They also fit neatly into existing cultural notions of science, picking up where Prometheus and Frankenstein left off, turning genetics into prime material for novels, films and videogames. Today, according to Soraya de Chadarevian, a historian of science at the University of Cambridge, DNA has taken on almost sacred status as the central blueprint for life, and the double helix has become the instantly identifiable secular equivalent of a modern religious icon.

THE recent history of MCA/Universal Studios is littered with the failure of foreigners--Japanese (Matsushita), Canadian (Seagram), French (Vivendi)--to understand power in Hollywood. Power resides not with the studios which have seduced so many foreign buyers, but with the stars: the actors and directors, and the agents who secure their multi-million-dollar pay packets. If the upper hand in Hollywood has shifted away from the studios over the past half-century, nobody was more influential in bringing about this change than Lew Wasserman, the man who built MCA into an entertainment giant--and then sold it to the Japanese.
Wasserman, who died last year at the age of 89, was in some ways the anti-mogul. Dour, publicity-shy, reserved with women, he was the archetypal suit in a creative industry. His long-time secretary recalls in this book, which is packed with such anecdotes, that in the 1960s he expected an hourly update on the numbers taking the fledgling Universal Studios tour. If she were just a few minutes late, Wasserman would call and bellow at her. Then he would painstakingly collate the daily totals, record the weather conditions and compare the week's performance against that of the previous year.
The attention to detail, the obsession with the bottom line, was typical. Wasserman applied the same unbending logic to each of his ruthlessly pursued business ventures. When he took over in 1946 at the Music Corporation of America, a talent agency which its founder, Jules Stein, had built from his days booking live bands in Chicago, Wasserman used its growing grip on talent to break the studios' power, drive up the rates for actors and force the studios to share profits with the stars. If Tom Cruise or Harrison Ford now demand upfront payments of $20m-25m a film, this is in no small part due to the mogul's efforts.
What Wasserman grasped so clearly was the value of leverage. If you could assemble a critical mass of talent, you could break the studio system. If you controlled the top movie stars, you could wrap other elements--a producer, director, lesseractors--into a deal with a star, in a practice that became known as packaging. By 1960, MCA controlled some 70% of all Hollywood stars, including Marlon Brando, Jimmy Stewart, Marilyn Monroe and Clark Gable. By the time the government forced him to divest the talent business by threatening anti-trust proceedings, Wasserman had grown into a true Hollywood powerbroker; he went on to become a polished supplier of mass entertainment, from such TV series as ""The Six Million Dollar Man"" and ""Kojak"" to such blockbuster films as ""Jaws"" and ""E.T."".
Wasserman once commented: ""I don't consider I have power. I have relationships."" And how. At one time Ronald Reagan's Hollywood agent, he was friends with politicians from Lyndon Johnson to Bill Clinton. For 50 years, he counted as a friend and business associate Sidney Korshak, a lawyer who was investigated (though not indicted) for his links to the mob. Indeed, as Connie Bruck points out, ""the culture of MCA bore no small resemblance to the Mafia's"": loyalty ruled and was rewarded, betrayal went unforgiven. 
This portrait is inspired less by affection than by awe. Yet, in the interviews that Ms Bruck conducted before Wasserman's death, she was able occasionally to disarm him. The Hollywood mogul makes a rare confession of weakness: his greatest mistake, he said, was to have sold the company to the Japanese in 1990--a decision that ushered in a time of instability for Universal which continues to this day.","When Hollywood Had a King: The Reign of Lew Wasserman, who Leveraged Talent into Power and Influence.

By the time the government forced him to divest the talent business by threatening anti-trust proceedings, Wasserman had grown into a true Hollywood powerbroker; he went on to become a polished supplier of mass entertainment, from such TV series as ""The Six Million Dollar Man"" and ""Kojak"" to such blockbuster films as ""Jaws"" and ""E.T."".
Wasserman once commented: ""I don't consider I have power. I have relationships."" And how. At one time Ronald Reagan's Hollywood agent, he was friends with politicians from Lyndon Johnson to Bill Clinton. For 50 years, he counted as a friend and business associate Sidney Korshak, a lawyer who was investigated (though not indicted) for his links to the mob. Indeed, as Connie Bruck points out, ""the culture of MCA bore no small resemblance to the Mafia's"": loyalty ruled and was rewarded, betrayal went unforgiven. 
This portrait is inspired less by affection than by awe. Yet, in the interviews that Ms Bruck conducted before Wasserman's death, she was able occasionally to disarm him. The Hollywood mogul makes a rare confession of weakness: his greatest mistake, he said, was to have sold the company to the Japanese in 1990--a decision that ushered in a time of instability for Universal which continues to this day.",920,New Zealand,A29-9067,,False,,0,True

WITH stockmarkets and profits both edging up, corporate executives are daring to think again about the future. Emerging from their cost-cutting bunkers and shaking off the excesses of the turn-of-the-century boom, they are talking once more about strategies for growth. Admittedly some companies--carmakers such as Ford and Fiat, for example, and many airlines--are still wondering how to survive. But others are already expanding. Japanese carmakers are opening new plants in North America. Some airlines, such as the low-cost carriers easyJet and AirTran, are buying large numbers of new aircraft. Emirates ordered no less than $12 billion-worth of giant Airbuses at last month's Paris air show. 
Moreover, hostile takeovers are reappearing on the stage ()see page 57, a sure sign of emerging opportunism. In software, Oracle is bidding for PeopleSoft; this week ArvinMeritor bid for a fellow car-parts maker, Dana, and Alcan went for Pechiney, a move that could trigger a consolidation of the aluminium industry. 
As they search for growth opportunities, however, companies face a classic dilemma, one made more poignant by recent events: should they assume that the future will, more or less, be a continuation of the past; or should they try to anticipate the next big revolution? Should they, essentially, hang on to what they've got (their ""core competence""), or should they strike out for a brave new world? 
Hold the revolution
After the dotcom disaster and much idle talk of a new economic paradigm, revolutions are distinctly out of favour. Belief in rapid change and dramatic responses has been shaken by the bursting of the stockmarket bubble, and by the demise of such firms as Enron and Webvan. There is now a widespread aversion to management fads. Most managers today are more interested in getting the basics right than in chasing the next rainbow. 
An article in the July issue of the Harvard Business Review reflects this spirit. Called ""What Really Works"", it reports the findings of a five-year research programme (led by Nitin Nohria of the Harvard Business School and William Joyce of the Tuck School of Business). The study put 160 companies under the microscope over a ten-year period (1986-96), grading them on their use of some 200 different management practices. Its main finding is that superior performance does not depend on use of this or that trendy management technique. ""It doesn't really matter if you implement ERP (enterprise resource planning) software or a CRM (customer relationship management) system; it matters very much, though, that whatever technology you choose to implement you execute it flawlessly."" 
Flawless execution, claim the authors, is one of four old-fashioned things that distinguish successful companies over time. The other three are: a company culture based on aiming high; a structure that is flexible and responsive; and a strategy that is clear and focused.
One thing standing in the way of the flawless execution of clear strategies, writes Charles Roxburgh in the latest issue of McKinsey Quarterly, is the human brain. In ""Hidden Flaws in Strategy"" he applies some of the insights of behavioural economics to strategic decision-making. Management's tendency to be over-confident and to favour the status quo, he says, works against good strategic planning. 
So too does the phenomenon of ""anchoring"", the linking of things people do not know to vaguely related things that they learnt recently. For example, ask somebody for the last three digits of their telephone number; and then ask which year Genghis Khan died. Most will give a three-digit date in the first millennium (when the answer is, in fact, 1227). ""Anchoring can be dangerous,"" says Mr Roxburgh, ""particularly when it is a question of becoming anchored to the past."" 
In their book ""Creative Destruction"", Richard Foster and Sarah Kaplan, two management consultants, make a similar argument. They say that too many corporate bosses assume the future will be much like the past--what worked before will work again--an attitude that can all too often destroy shareholder value. The authors tell the story of a Manhattan branch of the East River Savings Bank, founded in 1848, its Ionic columns exuding safety, security and thrift. But the bank went into the property market in the 1970s, was hit by the savings-and-loan crisis in the 1980s, and ended up in the hands of a property developer who sold the branch to another bank, which closed it in 1997. Today the building is a pharmacy.
Anchors aweigh
How then to weigh corporate anchors and move on from the recent past? Mr Foster and Ms Kaplan say that businesses should stop hankering after a mythical golden age, when enterprising firms grew gradually into solid companies in which widows and orphans could safely park their money. This rosy view of the corporate past is an illusion, they say. ""The corporate equivalent of El Dorado, the golden company that continually performs better than the markets, has never existed. Managing for survival, even among the best and most revered corporations, does not guarantee strong, long-term performance for shareholders. In fact, just the opposite is true."" 
The two authors compared the original 1917 Forbes magazine list of the top 100 American companies (by assets, in those days), with a comparable list that the magazine published in 1987. By then, 61 of the original group had ceased to exist; of the remainder, only 18 had managed to stay in the top 100. They included such respected firms as Kodak, DuPont, General Electric, Ford, General Motors and Procter & Gamble. These all survived depression, world war, the oil-price shocks and unprecedented technological change. 
But survival did not mean that they were more profitable than their peers. Of the 18, only General Electric and Kodak outperformed the stockmarket. The group as a whole had returns that were 20% below the market's compound annual growth rate of 7.5% over those 70 years. 
A look at another list confirms the point. Of the companies that made up the S&P 500 in 1957, only 74 (37%) made it through to the 1997 list, and only 12 (6%) outperformed the index over the period. As Mr Foster and Ms Kaplan put it, by the end of the 1990s, an S&P 500 made up only of those companies that had been there since 1957 would have underperformed the actual index by one-fifth, year after year. Endurance per se bears little if any relationship to performance. 
The subheading to Mr Foster's and Ms Kaplan's book is ""From Built-to-Last to Built-to-Perform"", a dig at one of the most influential business books of recent years, ""Built to Last"" by Jim Collins and Jerry Porras. Published in 1994, ""Built to Last"" looked at a small sample of companies (18) that had been persistently great over a long period of time. It suggested that endurance and performance were linked. 
In his sequel, ""Good to Great"", published in 2000, Mr Collins tried to pin down what it was that distinguished great companies from those that were merely good. His definition of a great company was one that had spectacularly outperformed the stockmarket by a factor of three over a 15-year period. This level was chosen because it was comfortably above the average 2.5 times by which acknowledged leaders such as 3M, Boeing, Coca-Cola, General Electric and Wal-Mart had outperformed the market from 1985 to 2000. 
In a contrary way, Mr Collins and his team of researchers came up with a list of nine things that they had not found in their winning companies. Great companies, Mr Collins claims, do not depend on outstanding charismatic leaders, brilliant strategy or audacious takeovers to pull ahead. At the top they rely on quietly determined bosses with a belief in high standards and discipline. 
One example is Darwin Smith, a chief executive of Kimberly-Clark, whose unassuming nature did not prevent him from taking dramatic decisions. At one stage he realised that the company's core business of making coated paper offered the prospect of no better than mediocre returns. So he sold the paper mills and bet the company on becoming a leading maker of consumer paper products. 
A similar thing happened with another of the companies on Mr Collins's list of greats. Walgreens pottered along as a chain of 500 restaurants, based on the founding family's formula for malted milk-shakes, until the early 1970s. At that point, Charles Walgreen III decided that the company would do better if it were to focus entirely on drugstores. He wound down the restaurants within five years, and Walgreens went on to become a stockmarket star for the next 25. 
This is a bit like Cortes burning his boats so that his men had no choice but to make their old-world ways succeed in the new world. There was literally no turning back. For Mr Collins, there is no conflict in remaining anchored to the past, but at the same time going for greatness in the future. He believes that leaders such as Mr Smith and Mr Walgreen did not start to make their companies great by setting a new vision and a new strategy. Instead, he says, ""they first got the right people on the bus, the wrong people off the bus, and the right people in the right seats--and then figured out where to drive it.""
Inevitable surprises
Choosing the passengers before the journey is not a formula favoured by Peter Schwartz. The doyen of scenario planning--a widely used method for companies to think about the future, developed largely by the Shell oil company in the 1970s--argues that the future is not as unknown as we think. Companies can chart a route and then decide whom they need to steer them along it.
In his new book, ""Inevitable Surprises"", Mr Schwartz lists some of the future shocks that should not surprise us--the lengthening of the human life-span, for example, where 60 becomes the equivalent of 40; the changing patterns of migration; the dominance of American economic and military might; and the existence of ""a set of disorderly nations with the capacity to unleash terror, disease and disruption"" on the rest of the world.
Companies that want to prepare themselves for these inevitable changes have a number of options, says Mr Schwartz. These include building effective intelligence systems; cultivating a sense of timing; and trying ""to avoid denial"". They also include putting in place mechanisms to engender creative destruction. ""What processes, practices, and organisations have you actually dismantled in the last year or two?"" asks Mr Schwartz. ""If the answer is none, perhaps it's time to get some practice in before urgency strikes.""
The idea that great companies stick closely to their past is also anathema to Fritz Kroeger, a vice-president at A.T. Kearney, a consulting firm, whose new book about strategy--""Winning the Merger Endgame"" (written with two colleagues, Graeme Deans and Stefan Zeisel)--argues that the main factor determining corporate survival and success is the speed with which companies climb what he calls ""the endgame curve"". This is basically a strategy of creative destruction via mergers and acquisitions. Or, as Sweeney Todd sang in the Stephen Sondheim musical, ""the history of the world, my sweet, is who gets eaten and who gets to eat."" 
An individual company's strategy in this game should, say the authors, be determined by the stage of life that its industry has reached, and there are, they claim, four distinct stages. In the first, there is little or no market concentration. Newly deregulated firms, start-ups and industries spun off from others are all present at this stage. Concentration, measured by the combined market share of the three biggest companies (CR3), is low--less than 20%. Industries currently at this stage, say the authors, include railways, telecoms, utilities and insurance, all of which Mr Kroeger thinks will stay in stage one for at least another five years.
The second, seven-year phase he calls the ""scale stage"", when size begins to matter. Leading companies start to emerge, and concentration increases to around 30-45% on the CR3 scale. Industries that are now in this stage include chemicals, drugs, pulp and paper, fast foods, hotels and breweries. 
In the third phase, Mr Kroeger says companies extend their core businesses, eliminating secondary operations or swapping them with other companies for assets closer to their core activity. By this point, industry leaders have come to account for nearly 70% of their market. Industries in this phase include steel, toys and tyre manufacturing. 
Finally, there are a few companies that enjoy about 90% of their industry's worldwide market. The corporate titans of this fourth stage--in such industries as tobacco and automobiles--tend to form alliances in order to boost growth, which by now has become hard to find. Thus General Motors has 25% of the global car market, but only through its strategy of forming alliances with such other carmakers as Fiat, Fuji, Daewoo and Suzuki.
Challenging the status quo
Perhaps the biggest challenge for corporate planners today is, as Mr Roxburgh puts it, ""to distinguish between a status quo option that is genuinely the right course and one that feels deceptively safe because of an innate bias"". That innate bias towards changelessness is stronger today than it was five years ago, before the stockmarket bubble burst and so many investment decisions were made to look foolish. 
Mr Foster and Ms Kaplan call this innate bias ""cultural lock-in"". It helps explain how John Akers, a dynamic computer-industry lifer by the time he became boss of IBM, could make such a mess of the job. All his energy, astuteness and intelligence (combined with those of his senior lieutenants) could not help him to see how his company was being swept into a waterfall by changes bubbling just beneath the surface of the industry. 
On the other hand, there are those who have gone for creative destruction and ended up destroying themselves, and sometimes much else besides. Enron, for example, dispensed with its old business model of natural gas and pipelines to turn itself into a futuristic online energy trader. Of course, it is conceivable that Enron would have succeeded had it not, along the way, taken some lethal short-cuts. 
Likewise, two traditional British companies, GEC and ICI, thought they could master radical change. Both shed solid old businesses and bet on acquisitions in higher-margin, growing sectors (telecoms for GEC, which renamed itself Marconi in the process, and specialty chemicals for ICI). But both came to grief because they borrowed too much and paid too much. For them, the status quo would have been much the better option. 
At the end of the day, perhaps there is no better strategic advice on this issue than that of Giuseppe di Lampedusa's weary aristocrat in ""The Leopard"". Struggling to survive the turmoil of 19th-century Italy, he wryly observed that, ""everything must change, so that everything stays the same."" 
Winners take almost all
One thing is for sure: whether companies stick with what they know or head into a maelstrom of creative destruction, the prizes for the winners are well worth having. Recent research by McKinsey shows that Pareto's Principle--the observation first made by a 19th-century Italian economist, Vilfredo Pareto, that 80% of national income ends up in the hands of 20% of the population producing it--is alive and well today. The so-called 80/20 principle applies to the value added by industrial companies as much as it does to the income produced by nations.
McKinsey examined a sample of 1,000 listed companies in America from 15 different industries over the period from 1969 to 1999, when companies experienced more wrenching changes in their environment than ever seen before in peacetime. They measured the market value added (MVA) by companies, the change in their outstanding debt and their stockmarket capitalisation. And they found that 80% or more of all 15 industries' MVA over the period was accounted for by the top 20% of companies. Moreover, this 80/20 split remained remarkably steady over the whole 30-year period, with only one significant blip--to 76%--in 1989. 
The rewards for getting it right can be huge. But the punishment for getting it wrong can be death. A short walk through the West End of London today provides a salutary reminder of corporate mortality. On one side of the Thames at Westminster sits the deserted former head office of the once great British Steel, which is now melting down after merging with a Dutch firm. Across the river, a government regulator occupies what was formerly the proud headquarters of ICI, 30 years ago the epitome of British manufacturing, now a struggling rump. Near Hyde Park Corner, the former offices of GEC, another erstwhile icon, are now luxury flats. And on Bond Street, just up the road, the headquarters building of Marconi stands abandoned, the junk mail piling up behind its locked doors. All that's missing is the tumbleweed and a whistling wind.","Is recent history making companies timorous in their strategic planning?

On one side of the Thames at Westminster sits the deserted former head office of the once great British Steel, which is now melting down after merging with a Dutch firm. Across the river, a government regulator occupies what was formerly the proud headquarters of ICI, 30 years ago the epitome of British manufacturing, now a struggling rump. Near Hyde Park Corner, the former offices of GEC, another erstwhile icon, are now luxury flats. And on Bond Street, just up the road, the headquarters building of Marconi stands abandoned, the junk mail piling up behind its locked doors.

THE island-states of the Pacific have acknowledged that Australia is best suited to lead them. On the face of it, their choice seemed inevitable. Last month Australia led a Pacific force to restore order in the Solomon Islands. It is the biggest donor of aid to its neighbours. All the same, the decision on August 16th by the South Pacific Forum, a group of 16 nations, to appoint an Australian, Greg Urwin, to be its secretary-general took two days of haggling. Previously, the post has been held by a member of a small state. The idea of having a regional ""leader"" seemed unnecessary. The islanders were content that the forum should be an agreeable club, meeting once a year for a pleasant get-together. 
But this year, when the forum met in Auckland, the islanders were reminded that the Pacific has been growing less pacific. Island-states have been rocked by coups, mutinies and ethnic clashes. Globalisation, said Helen Clark, prime minister of New Zealand, had brought money laundering and drug smuggling to the Pacific. John Howard, the Australian prime minister, brought to the forum a plan to establish a training centre for members of a future regional police force. Located in Suva, the capital of Fiji, it will aim to train 900 police a year for operations in the Pacific. 
Australia is naturally keen to avoid the appearance of being a Pacific ""big brother"". Mr Urwin, a retired diplomat, is a thoughtful choice to lead the forum. He has served in Fiji, Samoa and Vanuatu and is married to a Samoan.","Plans for a police force

Germany's government proposed freezing the level of pensions in 2004. It faces an euro8 billion ($9 billion) shortfall in the state system. But tinkering with pensions may prove unpopular with disenchanted German voters. 
The stand-off over Europe's stability pact continues. France has been given an extra year to bring its budget deficit below the prescribed ceiling of 3% of GDP, provided it makes further budget cuts now. But the French government has no such intentions.
Four top Serbians have been indicted by the UN's war-crimes tribunal in The Hague for alleged atrocities during the Kosovo war. The Serbian government, egged on by its army and police force, is protesting. A try at hooking an even bigger fish, Ratko Mladic, came to naught. 
Prosecutors stepped up their attack on Yukos, Russia's biggest oil company, with new tax probes of a top shareholder, an affiliated bank and Sibneft, an oil firm with which it is merging. The investigations are seen as a political campaign against Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Yukos's boss and biggest shareholder.
Non-nuclear option
As the foreign ministers of Britain, France and Germany visited Tehran, Iran's government said it would sign a protocol to convince the UN's nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, that it was not trying to build a nuclear bomb. The Iranians said they would stop enriching uranium, allow spot checks of their nuclear programme and come clean about past nuclear activities. 
After three Israeli soldiers had been killed in the West Bank and rockets were fired into Israel from the Gaza strip, Israeli forces launched their heaviest attack for months, killing a dozen Palestinians, including at least four civilians.
An independent report by a former Finnish president, Martti Ahtisaari, into the bombing of the 
UN 
headquarters in Baghdad on August 19th, when 22 people were killed, put the blame overwhelmingly on the UN's own security system, deriding it as ""dysfunctional"".
An international meeting of potential donors to Iraq opened in Madrid. America sought $30 billion in pledges to supplement its own spending on the rebuilding of Iraq.
In a leaked memo, Donald Rumsfeld, America's defence secretary, forecast ""a long, hard slog"" in Afghanistan and Iraq. The American army said that attacks on its troops in Iraq had increased sharply in the past two weeks.
Jordan's prime minister, Ali Abul-Ragheb, resigned after three years in the job. King Abdullah asked Faisal al-Fayez, the royal-court minister, to form a government.
Under pressure from America, Sudan's government signed a deal with rebels from the country's mainly non-Muslim south. It is meant to end a civil war that has been fought, more on than off, for half a century, at a cost of 2m lives.
After an outbreak of polio in West Africa, the World Health Organisation launched a campaign to immunise 15m children as quickly as possible. 
Wrong to choose
The United States Senate voted to ban ""partial birth"" abortions. The bill is the most significant restriction on abortion procedures since the Roe v Wade ruling of 1973. George Bush said he would sign the legislation; opponents believe the act is unconstitutional and intend to take the matter to the Supreme Court. 
Wesley Clark and Joe Lieberman both announced that they would not contest the Iowa Democratic caucuses in January, the first of the primary-election season, and would concentrate on later campaigns instead.
Nathaniel Heatwole, a student who placed bags containing box-cutters in commercial airliners, was charged with taking a dangerous weapon aboard an aircraft. Mr Heatwole said he wanted to show the inadequacies of airline security. The discovery of the box-cutters resulted in the searching of 7,000 planes. 
Florida's governor, Jeb Bush, ordered a hospital to resume feeding Terri Schiavo, the brain-damaged woman at the centre of a right-to-die controversy. Doctors had removed a tube providing her only means of support at the request of her husband. 
Another one bites the dust
Bolivia's president, Gonzalo Snchez de Lozada, resigned, after some 80 people were killed when the army failed to suppress strikes and protests. Carlos Mesa, the vice-president and a former television journalist, was sworn in as his replacement. 
In Colombia, polls cast doubt on whether the required 6.3m voters (a quarter of the electorate) would turn out for a referendum on political and fiscal reforms for which President lvaro Uribe has campaigned strongly. 
Canada's two right-of-centre parties edged closer to a merger, after MPs from one of them, the Alliance, backed the plan. But it was opposed by some influential members of the Progressive Conservatives.

BETWEEN now and January 19th, when some 2,000 Democratic precinct caucuses convene around Iowa, a show may be launched there called ""How to Succeed in Politics Without Really Trying"". It would be the story of Wesley Clark, who drew a standing ovation from a packed hall when he appeared in Iowa City last month, even before he had opened his mouth. And the show will play without him: for, last weekend, Mr Clark announced that he would concentrate on New Hampshire and the seven February 3rd primaries, and skip Iowa altogether. 
Joe Lieberman said he would not run in Iowa either, sending his staff instead to more appreciative ground. Iowa will not regret him too much; but it will miss the general. So far, no other candidate draws anything like the same interest. 
Joyce Carman, Mr Clark's Iowa City co-ordinator, was upset to learn of her candidate's decision from the New York Times. She has built Mr Clark's local support up from scratch: first searching for like-minded contacts on the web, then buying a display ad in the local paper. E-mails came in from all over the state. One was from Dale Todd, the first black councillor of Cedar Rapids, who is now that city's Clark co-ordinator.
Ms Carman has netted some 30 volunteer activists, including a former state senator; two Republicans who can't bring themselves to vote for President Bush; and at least one rueful supporter of Ralph Nader in the last presidential election. In terms of organisation--the door-knocking and Girl-Scout-cookie selling that make up caucus campaigning--they were rather well ahead of the game. But now they have been cut adrift. Among the questions they are trying to answer is whether they can legally raise funds for a campaign, when the candidate is not campaigning. 
The loss of two candidates from the caucuses is a blow to Iowa's pride, as well as to its hopes of being a definitive tester of opinion at the start of the race. Whether the decision will damage Mr Clark is harder to say. State party officials point out that no Democrat has been nominated without campaigning in Iowa since the present system began, in 1972. Ms Carman reserves judgment. If she and her colleagues pull off a respectable show, she notes, the Clark campaign can point to serious grass-roots support. If not, there's nothing lost where he didn't venture.","Two candidates avoid the cornfields

IF CANADA'S Liberal Party confidently expects a fourth consecutive election victory next year, that is partly because of the division of its opponents. But despair at this prospect has finally driven the leaders of two right-of-centre parties, the Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservatives (PC), to agree to a merger under fresh leadership by March.
The Alliance, the official opposition with 63 of the 301 seats in the House of Commons, is on paper the dominant partner, having won 25.5% of the vote in the 2000 election, twice that of the PC. However, its support is concentrated in western Canada, and is declining. 
The Alliance's MPs swiftly voted to approve the deal. But the Conservatives are less keen. They are progressive on social issues, while the Alliance is conservative. Joe Clark, a former prime minister, argues that the Conservatives can recover their past glory (formed 150 years ago, they governed Canada as recently as 1984-93). David Orchard, a leftish ""Red Tory"", denounced the merger plan as a betrayal of a written agreement he made with the party's new leader, Peter MacKay, at a convention in May. Approval of the merger will require a two-thirds majority of the members. 
If the merger does go ahead, who will lead the new party? One candidate is Mike Harris, who resigned as Ontario premier last year after winning two elections for the Conservatives. Ontario, Canada's most populous province, is the key electoral battleground: the Liberals hold all but five seats there, but the combined vote of the Alliance and the PC outpolled them in a score. Ralph Klein, Alberta's influential Conservative premier, backs Mr Harris. But Mr Harris's reputation has been hurt by a Liberal landslide in an election in Ontario this month, a result prompted partly by discontent over the dilapidated state of public services. And Mr Harris does not speak French, a handicap in Quebec.
That leaves Stephen Harper, the Alliance's current leader, as the frontrunner. He has political skills and is bilingual. But as a social conservative, he will struggle in the east. So he might act as a stop-gap. Waiting in the wings is Bernard Lord, just 38 and recently re-elected as Conservative premier of bilingual New Brunswick. For the election after next, Mr Lord might just be the saviour conservative Canada has long awaited.","Can two kinds of conservatives live happily ever after?

EARLY on a brilliant Tuesday afternoon it is already dark and smoky inside JB Bamboozles, a bar directly across 12 Mile Road from the General Motors technical centre. Several vans and pick-up trucks are parked outside. Two middle-aged men nursing beers and cigarettes happily volunteer their views on politics. ""Republican"", says a scruffy-bearded fellow who works for the city of Warren. He can't think of a bad thing to say about George Bush, except that maybe the president should have ""bombed them to death"" in Iraq. His drinking buddy, the owner of a small business that supplies the car industry, is a bit more reflective. He likes Mr Bush too, but has yet to make up his mind on the presidential race. The only Democrat who has really turned his head so far is General Wesley Clark, ""because he sounds like Lee Iacocca [the former boss of Chrysler]--straight talk"". The men agree that the economy is rotten, and is the chief topic on their minds these days.
Welcome to Macomb County, Michigan, a patch of blue-collar America made famous by Ronald Reagan more than two decades ago. Ever since Mr Reagan won over socially conservative Democrats in this union stronghold, the county has been considered a political bellwether, and ""Reagan Democrats"" have been courted by both political parties. A recent swing through the county north-east of Detroit, though, reveals that Republicans have made big inroads at lower levels in a place that was once considered solidly Democratic. 
The shift is evident in many ways. A majority of Macomb voters backed Republican Dick Posthumus in last year's race for governor, although Jennifer Granholm, the Democrat, won the statewide ballot. Since last year the county board of commissioners has included 14 Democrats and 12 Republicans, the closest split ever. Perhaps most compelling is a statewide poll by EPIC/MRA in mid-October, in which 46% of Macomb County voters said they definitely plan to re-elect Mr Bush, compared with 33% of all Michigan voters. More than half the county's voters give Mr Bush an ""excellent or good"" job rating, compared with 47% in the state as a whole.
Part of the reason for Republican gains is the development of northern Macomb, a once largely rural area that has drawn in crowds of people seeking large lots on relatively cheap land (taxes are lower in Macomb than in neighbouring counties). Macomb's population, now about 813,000, grew by about 70,000 in the 1990s, according to the Census Bureau.
The fading influence of traditional Democratic institutions has also played a role. The Big Three American carmakers - General Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler--are substantial employers in the county, but layoffs keep coming and union influence is not what it was. Since Congressman David Bonior left office (he was defeated in the Democratic gubernatorial primary by Ms Granholm), county Democrats have lost another leading light. Mr Bonior ""brought an organisation that we're working hard to keep,"" says Nancy White, a Democrat who chairs the county commission. ""But without him leading the pack, we're trying to hold it together."" Mr Bonior's legacy lives on in the county in the thousands of evergreen trees which his campaign team gave to residents every election year since he first ran, in 1976.
Ed Sarpolus, a Michigan pollster who was born in Macomb, says the county has a reputation for racism. As recently as last year, a state representative with ties to the United Auto Workers union claimed that his rival in the Democratic primary, Congressman Sander Levin, could not adequately represent the district because he was a Jew; and middle-class blacks would rather move to neighbouring Oakland County. Mr Sarpolus also sees a brain-drain from Macomb, with the better educated and better paid children of the Reagan Democrats moving to Oakland County, too. 
Peter Lund, a Republican who is vice-chair of the county commission, says the difference is more about style. ""Macomb County has its fair share of millionaires, but ours still clip coupons."" Local residents, he says, are a down-to-earth lot, and the many American flags fluttering from their houses testify to their patriotic spirit. Thousands of jobs are tied to the armed forces, and Macomb is vying to be one of the new regional headquarters for the federal Department of Homeland Security at the Selfridge National Guard air base.
The economy remains the chief worry for many residents. Michigan has been hard-hit by the loss of manufacturing jobs, and the heavy concentration of car-industry work makes many feel vulnerable. Yet they cannot ignore the press of foreign affairs. The Wesley Clark fan in JB Bamboozles refused to let his daughter go on a school trip to France this year, after the international schism over Iraq. ""My wife said I should let her go,"" he said. ""She always gets her way. But not this time.""","A bellwether county becomes more viscerally Republican

""GIVE me a one-handed economist,"" demanded a frustrated American president. ""All my economists say, 'on the one hand...on the other'"". From a mono-manual perspective, at least, Harry Truman would have loved Paul Krugman, an economist who rarely hesitates to take a bold position--even when the subject is himself. In recounting the transformation of his twice-weekly New York Times column from a genial discussion of the ""New Economy"" into a widely read broadside against the Bush administration, the Princeton professor recently described himself as ""a lonely voice of truth in a sea of corruption."" 
What is beyond dispute is that Mr Krugman is the finest economist to become a media superstar--at least since Milton Friedman or, earlier, John Maynard Keynes turned to journalism. Mr Krugman's work on currency crises and international trade is widely admired by other economists. He holds the John Bates Clark medal in economics, which is slightly harder to get than a Nobel prize. As for popularity, his new book, ""The Great Unravelling""--his eighth aimed at a broad, non-academic readership--has spent eight weeks on the New York Times bestseller list. 
The Economist, which itself has been known on occasion to clamber off the economic fence, can hardly criticise anybody for writing hard-hitting (yet engaging and accessible!) economic analyses. But, increasingly, people are asking whether Mr Krugman's success as a journalist is now coming at the expense of, rather than as the result of, his economics. For while he has had some journalistic coups during his time as a columnist--most notably in recognising, long before most other commentators, that market manipulation played a role in the California energy crisis--perhaps the most striking thing about his writing these days is not its economic rigour but its political partisanship. 
Lyinginponds.com, a website that tracks partisanship among American political columnists, rates Mr Krugman second in the overall partisan slant of his columns, behind only Ann Coulter, a fiercely (and often incoherently) conservative polemicist. As the site documents exhaustively, the vast majority of Mr Krugman's columns feature attacks on Republicans; almost none criticise Democrats. Unsurprisingly, this has made him a sort of ivory-tower folk-hero of the American left--a thinking person's Michael Moore. But he may have even more readers among his ideological adversaries, particularly on the internet, where deconstructing his latest column is a kind of twice-weekly parlour game--albeit one so contentious it has spawned talk-show chatter and even legal threats. 
He refers to these critics as his ""stalkers"". Many of them spend an inordinate amount of time quibbling about minor semantic points, or trivial differences in statistics. But they cannot all be easily dismissed. The more reasonable ones allow that he is a gifted writer and economist, but also argue that these days his relentless partisanship is getting in the way of his argument. Is the American political and economic picture, they ask, really as one-sided as he paints it? And if not, should an economist of Mr Krugman's prominence be telling the public that it is? 
A glance through his past columns reveals a growing tendency to attribute all the world's ills to George Bush. Regarding California's energy crisis, for example, he berated the Bush administration and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for not imposing price caps sooner--but found no room to mention Bill Clinton, who presided over a similarly inactive FERC for the first part of the crisis, nor to attack California's then Democratic governor Gray Davis for his disastrous refusal to allow consumer prices to rise. After Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister of Malaysia, recently gave an anti-Semitic speech, Mr Krugman argued that the Bush administration's ham-fisted foreign policy had forced Dr Mahathir to make the remarks in order to shore up domestic political support--most unlikely, given that he was about to step down.
Even his economics is sometimes stretched. A recent piece accused conservatives of embracing the ""lump of labour fallacy"", the mistaken claim that there is a fixed quantity of work which governments must strive to allocate equitably. In fact, the paper he cited did not commit the lump of labour fallacy. He used game theory to argue that, by criticising North Korea but not attacking it, and then going after Iraq instead, Mr Bush is ""probably"" encouraging North Korea to become a more dangerous nuclear power. This probably did not convince most game theorists. Overall, the effect is to give lay readers the illusion that Mr Krugman's perfectly respectable personal political beliefs can somehow be derived empirically from economic theory.
No such thing as a free lunch
Now that he is a journalist, it is perhaps not surprising that Mr Krugman seems to have embraced the concept of the free lunch--even though as an economist he should know better. Every opportunity (including lunch, and even including Mr Krugman's favoured policies) has a cost. Decision-making, not least in politics, tends to be hard because it involves trading off those costs and benefits, with the resulting net gains often marginal and uncertain. Surely one of an economist's main tasks is to remind one-handed politicians, and their constituents, that economic choices generally come in shades of grey, not black and white--even when they are made by one's political rivals. 
Many of Mr Krugman's fellow economists, jealous of his celebrity, comfort themselves with the thought that his angry rants have hurt his reputation enough to ensure he will not now win a Nobel prize. They may be kidding themselves. The Nobel committee has not been averse in the past to giving the prize to economists who have achieved popular notoriety, as its awards to Mr Friedman and, more recently, Joseph Stiglitz show. Mr Krugman is probably still in the running.","Paul Krugman and the controversial art of popularising economics

He used game theory to argue that, by criticising North Korea but not attacking it, and then going after Iraq instead, Mr Bush is ""probably"" encouraging North Korea to become a more dangerous nuclear power. This probably did not convince most game theorists. Overall, the effect is to give lay readers the illusion that Mr Krugman's perfectly respectable personal political beliefs can somehow be derived empirically from economic theory.
No such thing as a free lunch
Now that he is a journalist, it is perhaps not surprising that Mr Krugman seems to have embraced the concept of the free lunch--even though as an economist he should know better. Every opportunity (including lunch, and even including Mr Krugman's favoured policies) has a cost. Decision-making, not least in politics, tends to be hard because it involves trading off those costs and benefits, with the resulting net gains often marginal and uncertain. Surely one of an economist's main tasks is to remind one-handed politicians, and their constituents, that economic choices generally come in shades of grey, not black and white--even when they are made by one's political rivals. 
Many of Mr Krugman's fellow economists, jealous of his celebrity, comfort themselves with the thought that his angry rants have hurt his reputation enough to ensure he will not now win a Nobel prize. They may be kidding themselves. The Nobel committee has not been averse in the past to giving the prize to economists who have achieved popular notoriety, as its awards to Mr Friedman and, more recently, Joseph Stiglitz show. Mr Krugman is probably still in the running.",920,New Zealand,A29-9067,,False,,0,True

IT IS the fate of angry political parties, no less than angry people, to look everywhere but the obvious place for the answer to their woes. Consumed by Bush-hatred, rank-and-file Democrats are flocking to the standard of the mad-as-hell Howard Dean. Meanwhile, in Washington, the Democratic commanders bicker over which establishment candidate to back as the ""Anyone but Dean"" alternative. Surely John Kerry will reassert himself eventually? Perhaps John Edwards isn't really too wet behind the ears? Maybe Dick Gephardt really has reinvented himself? Sooner or later Hillary Clinton is mentioned--and then misery sets in again.
This sense of failure is compounded by America's political geography. The new electoral college, adjusted to reflect America's continuing drift towards the west and the South, would have given Mr Bush an extra seven votes in 2000. From a Democratic point of view, the South seems beyond saving. The Republicans have just picked up two more governorships there. Mr Dean is already in trouble for saying he wanted the votes of people with Confederate flags in their pick-ups. Even if the party turned to a southerner, such as Senator Edwards or General Wesley Clark, it probably won't help that much: in 2000 Al Gore failed to win even his native Tennessee. Meanwhile, in the west, Mr Bush is on the offensive in New Mexico and Oregon, both narrowly claimed by Mr Gore in 2000. Even California, that great Democratic redoubt, has just been Schwarzeneggered.
Amidst all this gnashing of teeth, the Democratic high command may have missed a trick right under its nose: the encouraging things that are happening in the mid-west. This slice of the heartland is familiar territory to any Democrat with national ambitions, since its factories, farms and suburbs are where presidential elections tend to be decided. It is also an area where an interesting group of moderate baby-boomer Democrats now controls many of the governorships.
The newcomers include Jennifer Granholm (who won the governorship of Michigan in 2002), Rod Blagojevich (Illinois, 2002), Jim Doyle (Wisconsin, 2002), Kathleen Sebelius (Kansas, 2002), Bob Holden (Missouri, 2000), Tom Vilsack (Iowa, 1998) and Joe Kernan (who stepped up from lieutenant-governor of Indiana on the death of Frank O'Bannon, another moderate Democrat, earlier this year). So far they have kept a fairly low profile from a national perspective, though Mr Vilsack becomes chairman of the Democratic Governors' Association next year.
The hallmark of the mid-western Democrats is a virtue usually scorned in their party's primaries: pragmatism. The mid-westerners have their liberal traits, but they have mostly steered a centrist course, building ties with local business, balancing state budgets and treading lightly on taxes. Part of this is born of necessity: American states are facing their worst budget deficits in decades, so there isn't much money to lavish on great projects. Yet something else is at work.
The new governors cut their political teeth during Bill Clinton's time in the White House. Mostly modernising ""New Democrats"", they saw their champion swing first to the left--supporting ""gays in the military"", failing to pass health-care reform and being trounced in the mid-term elections of 1994. But once Mr Clinton moved back to the centre, he won re-election easily in 1996. For many of Mr Dean's supporters, Mr Clinton's centrism was a betrayal. Not in the mid-west: he scooped up 100 electoral college votes from the region in both 1992 and 1996.
When these governors ran for office, they sold themselves as chief-executive types who would run the states in a more up-to-date way than older Republicans would. Mr Doyle and Ms Granholm, both former attorneys-general, have focused on modern styles of crime, such as terrorism and internet scams. Messrs Vilsack and Kernan are in the business of economic transformation, trying to push rural economies towards biotechnology.
It is easy to explain part of their success as good timing. The Democratic newcomers were lucky that several established Republican governors, including Tommy Thompson in Wisconsin and John Engler in Michigan (both engaging centrists), stepped down. A few of the new Clintonians have had a bumpy ride: Messrs Vilsack, Doyle and Blagojevich are all stuck in rows with their legislatures. And it is hard to draw broad lessons from local races often fought on local issues. ""The closer you get to home,"" admits Mr Kernan, ""the less philosophical people become.""
Nevertheless, Clintonism suits the region. The number of independent voters has increased. The population is also relatively old, so health care, hitherto a Democratic subject, has been an important issue. Culturally, gay marriage is not popular, but neither is ""southern"" intolerance. Ms Granholm mentions both her Catholicism and her opposition to banning abortion.
Running by Bill's book
These Democratic governors may make a difference next year. Support from a popular local governor may add a point to a presidential campaign, and the mid-west is home to plenty of crucial swing states. Kansas and Indiana still look safe for the Republicans, but Mr Bush has to defend Ohio and Missouri; and he would sorely love to capture Michigan, Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota.
However, the real significance of the mid-western governors may come after the next election. Imagine that the furious Democrats pick the angry Mr Dean and he is shot down in flames by Mr Bush. This time next year, the Democrats might do worse than look to this group for their next set of leaders. More important, the Democrats should look hard at the sort of politics that works well in the region. Mr Clinton was a southerner, but the mid-west was where he won the presidency. And it is where his legacy is being most respected.","The future of the Democrats may lie in the mid-west

The European Commission is to take European governments to the European Court of Justice for breaking the stability and growth pact, which sets ceilings on euro-area countries' budget deficits.

A trial of Mr Berlusconi on judge-bribing charges, which was suspended last July, is now likely to resume.
The European Commission is to take European governments to the European Court of Justice for breaking the stability and growth pact, which sets ceilings on euro-area countries' budget deficits. Last November, the governments overruled a commission recommendation that France and Germany should trim their deficits this year, and sought to put the pact in abeyance. 
After pressure from Turkey, a coalition government was formed in northern Cyprus that will seek to reopen unification talks with the Greek-Cypriot south. Turkey is anxious to begin negotiations on accession to the European Union: but the EU has made clear that, if Cyprus is still divided when it joins in May, the Turks will have little chance.
Germany's armed forces are to be shaken up. The army will be cut in size and made more professional, but the defence minister, Peter Struck, said that conscription will remain.

John Kerry won the New Hampshire primary with 38% of the vote, pushing Howard Dean (26%) into second place. Wesley Clark squeaked ahead of John Edwards in third. Mr Kerry is now the clear frontrunner as the campaign moves to seven states that are holding their primaries on February 3rd.
David Kay resigned as America's chief weapons inspector in Iraq. Mr Kay claimed that faulty intelligence was given to President George Bush about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction in the run-up to the war.
The Congressional Budget Office added a trillion dollars to its forecast of the total budget deficit for 2004-13. Its biannual report, published a week before Mr Bush unveils his budget, also predicts a deficit of 4.2% of GDP for the current fiscal year.
The Supreme Court said it would hear a case later this year that will test the constitutionality of the death penalty for crimes committed by a juvenile. The case centres on a man convicted of murder in Missouri ten years ago when he was 17. 
Blair scrapes through
Tony Blair survived two big threats to his authority. Britain's prime minister narrowly defeated a parliamentary rebellion over university-tuition fees and was cleared of knowingly inserting dubious claims about Iraq's weaponry into an intelligence dossier by an inquiry investigating the death of a government arms expert.
Georgia's new president, Mikhail Saakashvili, was inaugurated in front of a gathering that included the American and Russian foreign ministers. The Georgians asked the Russians to keep a promise to pull out of their remaining military bases in the country; Colin Powell, the American secretary of state, endorsed the demand.
Mr Powell also visited Moscow, where he sharply criticised Russia for its lack of democracy, suppression of free media and brutal war in Chechnya in a newspaper article. In meetings with top-ranking Russians, including President Vladimir Putin, he was more restrained.
Europe's governments rejected a pay rise for members of the European Parliament. The French, Germans, Swedes and Austrians said the rise, which would have given MEPs more than domestic parliamentarians, was too big. MEPs had proposed the increase in exchange for giving up their practice of inflating travel expenses to boost their incomes: presumably the practice will now continue.

AFTER his success in the Iowa caucuses last week, John Kerry's victory in the New Hampshire primary this week might not seem that surprising. It repeated his success in Iowa and owed a good deal to it. But it is still an astounding about-turn in the Granite State.
Less than three weeks before the vote, Mr Kerry had been 20 points behind in New Hampshire. In December, when the gap was 30 points, his candidacy had been declared dead. This week's margin of victory--12 points--amounts to a net change of an amazing 32 points in three weeks. It was the largest-ever winning total in a New Hampshire Democratic contest with more than two candidates. Comeback Kerry indeed.
Success breeds success. Mr Kerry raised over $1.1m in the week after his Iowa triumph. That is likely to soar higher now as deep-pocketed donors, hitherto made nervous by Howard Dean, commit themselves to the front-runner. 
After Iowa, his standing rose in all seven states that hold their contests on February 3rd. With voters there only just tuning in to the nomination battle (and likely to see their primaries as referendums on Mr Kerry, rather than contests from scratch), his numbers could rise again. His money will also enable him to flood the airwaves. And, as the front-runner, he will be the focus of television and newspapers. Congressman Jim Clyburn, the most powerful black politician in South Carolina, has decided to endorse Mr Kerry, not John Edwards, who was born in the state. So have several of Missouri's most prominent Democrats. 
In other words, the three Ms, money, momentum and media, are working to consolidate Mr Kerry's position on the top of the Democratic pile--just as the nomination battle shifts from intimate, door-to-door campaigning to the sort of impersonal speechifying and televised competition in which the three Ms matter more.
The success of Senator Kerry is all the more telling once you look at the trouncing of his rivals. Howard Dean got a quarter of the vote in what should have been his best state. New Hampshire adjoins his adoptive Vermont; he poured money and organisation into it and almost 60% of its voters have college degrees. Yet, in exit polling, 40% of the electorate said they had an unfavourable view of him. He fired his campaign manager after the defeat, and his campaign chairman talked about the necessity of Mr Dean winning one primary in the next two weeks in order to maintain his army of internet donors.
Mr Edwards failed to convert his second-place finish in Iowa into New Hampshire success. He came fourth, narrowly beaten by the neophyte General Wesley Clark, who skipped the Iowa caucuses, had New Hampshire to himself for two weeks--and still got only 12% of the vote.
So does that mean the Democratic nomination will be a coronation? Unless Mr Kerry sweeps the board next week, that seems unlikely. The incentives for others to stay in are too strong.
The Democratic nomination is not a winner-take-all system. State delegates to the party convention are chosen roughly in proportion to the votes won in the primary. So gathering elected delegates is a slog, and only 67 of the 3,520 who will attend the convention have been picked; 269 are up for grabs on February 3rd alone. There is a lot of play for--especially as the electorate seems volatile. One third of the Granite State's voters made up their minds in the final three days. 
There is also a special factor that might encourage change. One of the reasons Mr Kerry held on to the position he won in Iowa was a lack of negative advertising. All the other campaigns were spooked by the way that Dick Gephardt's negative ads in Iowa put voters off himself as well as Mr Dean: Mr Gephardt came fourth and dropped out. So the New Hampshire campaign was relentlessly nice, up to the last minute. A powerful weapon against the front-runner was not used. 
But the double-edged sword may not stay sheathed. Negative advertising is a way for other candidates to distinguish themselves from the front-runner, and it usually works. In the last days of the New Hampshire campaign, the attacks duly began. Mr Dean questioned Mr Kerry's consistency and judgment on foreign policy. Accusations of dirty tricks raised their ugly head. The campaign could easily become nasty and unpredictable again.
Usually, a drawn-out race signals disagreement over the party's policies--consider the fight between Al Gore and Bill Bradley last time, or the one between John McCain and George Bush. But not now. If you exclude the special case of the Iraq war, the two candidates who have espoused the most distinctive policies are Mr Gephardt (on the left) and Joe Lieberman (on the right). Mr Gephardt is out and, after coming a limp fifth in New Hampshire, Mr Lieberman is under pressure to retire gracefully too. 
All the main candidates drew overflowing, enthusiastic crowds. Voters said that, while they backed one candidate, they would be happy with several others. Turnout was a record.
All this suggests Democrats are animated at least as much by their desire to oust President Bush as by the kind of Democrat they want as their standard-bearer--and this animating factor is strong. Almost half of New Hampshire's voters said they felt angry at the administration; another third said they were dissatisfied. To judge from anecdotal evidence, Mr Bush's ""compassionate conservatism"" (designed to reach out to wobbly Democrats) has failed. Candidates and audiences gleefully mocked both his efforts at education reform and the prescription-drug benefit for seniors. He is so much disliked that anyone who can beat him will do.
Hence New Hampshire voters broke one of the first rules of American politics: that voters don't vote strategically. This time, they did--on the mystical issue of ""electability"". A third of primary voters said they picked the man who they thought could beat Mr Bush. Nearly half of those went for Mr Kerry. He was not the best speaker (that honour goes to Mr Edwards). He has not raised the most money (Mr Dean has). 
He has no single virtue, but a combination: a distinguished record in Vietnam, experience in the Senate and support among all the disparate groups that make up the Democratic coalition. Mr Kerry won the moderate, blue-collar areas of New Hampshire's largest city, Manchester (the beer vote). He got a majority of more educated, liberal voters in the state capital, Concord (the wine vote). He won the corner of the state that serves as the northern dormitory for Boston. He got support from firefighters, car workers and even service workers, whose national union had endorsed Mr Dean. The League of Conservation Voters backed him. In other words, it was a clean sweep of unions, suburban voters, college graduates and environmentalists--the usual Democratic suspects. Self-described ""moderates"" and ""liberals"" went for him in equal numbers.
The question now is what kind of race develops between Mr Kerry and the field. In the middle of the New Hampshire campaign, with everyone drawing those capacity crowds, conventional wisdom said there would be a cloud of four or five competitive candidates. The results suggest otherwise. Not only was Mr Kerry's margin of victory unexpectedly large, but the gap between the top two and the rest was even larger.
It is hard to see Senator Lieberman as a factor now. General Clark's candidacy was predicated on contesting the nomination with Mr Dean. His rationale for competing against a war hero is dubious. Senator Edwards can discern a silver lining. The majority of those who voted for him made up their minds in the last three days, suggesting a late swing in his favour, and three-quarters of voters said they had a favourable image of him--better than anyone else. But he has to win more than his native state of South Carolina next week to support his claim to be the only candidate electable in every region of America. 
That is also true of Mr Dean. He is obviously the strongest candidate among the rest. He built a solid base of support in New Hampshire, which backed him early and stuck with him despite Iowa. But if he is to do more than wound Mr Kerry, he needs to win something. 
All that suggests the nomination is becoming a two- or three-horse race: Mr Kerry, Mr Dean, probably Mr Edwards. Such an outcome looks satisfactory for Mr Kerry. Throughout Mr Dean's surge last year, his campaign sought to present him as the stop-Dean figure and it has worked. 
Mr Kerry emerges from New Hampshire and Iowa as the favourite to win the nomination, though perhaps only after an unpredictable struggle. The outstanding question then would be whether such a contest toughens and improves Mr Kerry (as Mr McCain's challenge sharpened Mr Bush in 2000). Or whether it weakens him, by raising doubts about his record, as happened in 1976, when Ronald Reagan fought Gerald Ford all the way to the nominating convention.","The Democratic nomination is still a contest, not a coronation for John Kerry.

AEONS ago, the colliding plates of the earth buckled in the area now called Montana, sending great fins and towers of rock soaring into the air and trapping pockets of natural gas underneath. The Blackfeet Indians called the Rocky Mountain Front the ""backbone of the world"". Environmentalists call it ""the American Serengeti"", because of its pristine forests, elk, grizzly bears, wolves and bighorn sheep.
The wind-blasted Front may now be the site of the biggest energy battle since the fight over the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, the ANWR, in Alaska. Both the Front and the ANWR were named in a list drawn up by the incoming Bush administration as places it wanted federal managers to open up for exploration. The Senate tossed out the Alaska project in 2003. Now greens are calling the Front ""the ANWR of the lower 48"" (the United States minus Alaska and Hawaii).
There may be 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas under the range: not much compared with the ANWR, where there may be 40 times as much, but enough to supply American demand for two months. Most of this is off limits, lying beneath declared wilderness areas or Glacier National Park. But estimates of reserves in areas that could be opened to drilling exceed 200 billion cubic feet. Pro-drillers point north to the hugely profitable Pincher Creek gasfields in Alberta, in Canada, as an example of what may lie beneath Montana's Front country.
It will not be easy for the would-be drillers. In the 1980s, a coalition of green groups and the Blackfeet Indians fought off two oil firms which had begun exploring the Lewis and Clark National Forest (see map). In 1997, Gloria Flora, the then supervisor of the forest, imposed a ten-year moratorium on energy exploration in all of its 1.8m acres.
That still leaves more than 40,000 acres of federally owned lands on the Rocky Mountain Front which are managed by the Bureau of Land Management. The ""Bureau of Livestock and Mining"", as the greens like to call it (though it also gets plenty of grief from ranchers and energy firms), is considering whether to allow three inactive gas wells to be brought back into service, and eight more exploratory wells to be drilled. Drilling could begin on the bureau's lands as early as 2005, a year before Ms Flora's moratorium comes up for review.
For greens, the problem is less the wells themselves than the things that come with them: roads, equipment plants, ""sweetening plants"" (used to remove unwanted ""sour gas""), and so on. The energy firms say that modern technology means the mess would be minimal, and the land can be reclaimed after the gas runs out. They have the support of Senator Conrad Burns and of the state's lone House member, Denny Rehberg, another Republican.
Yet the project still seems less popular with the locals than drilling in the ANWR was in Alaska. Montana's Democratic senator, Max Baucus, opposes it. The people of sparsely populated Teton County, where the first drilling is planned, are ""evenly split"", according to one county commissioner, Mary Sexton, who says that she ""leans toward opposing"". Some of the fiercest opponents of drilling on the Front are local ranchers and businessmen who deal with tourists. Hunters and gun-makers--hardly natural Democrats--are also opposed and they claim to have the president's ear. 
The split among the locals is interesting. George Bush has sought to hand control of federal land down to states and counties, which often helps the companies that want to dig into it; on the Front, local citizens may now want more federal protection, not less. Twenty years ago, greens were blamed for destroying logging and mining jobs: ""It may be beautiful, but you can't eat the scenery!"" Now the scenery has become a little more edible. The austere landscape of the Front may be the state's most sought-after commodity.

The Blackfeet Indians called the Rocky Mountain Front the ""backbone of the world"". Environmentalists call it ""the American Serengeti"", because of its pristine forests, elk, grizzly bears, wolves and bighorn sheep.
The wind-blasted Front may now be the site of the biggest energy battle since the fight over the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, the ANWR, in Alaska. Both the Front and the ANWR were named in a list drawn up by the incoming Bush administration as places it wanted federal managers to open up for exploration. The Senate tossed out the Alaska project in 2003. Now greens are calling the Front ""the ANWR of the lower 48"" (the United States minus Alaska and Hawaii).
There may be 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas under the range: not much compared with the ANWR, where there may be 40 times as much, but enough to supply American demand for two months. Most of this is off limits, lying beneath declared wilderness areas or Glacier National Park. But estimates of reserves in areas that could be opened to drilling exceed 200 billion cubic feet. Pro-drillers point north to the hugely profitable Pincher Creek gasfields in Alberta, in Canada, as an example of what may lie beneath Montana's Front country.
It will not be easy for the would-be drillers. In the 1980s, a coalition of green groups and the Blackfeet Indians fought off two oil firms which had begun exploring the Lewis and Clark National Forest (see map). In 1997, Gloria Flora, the then supervisor of the forest, imposed a ten-year moratorium on energy exploration in all of its 1.8m acres.
That still leaves more than 40,000 acres of federally owned lands on the Rocky Mountain Front which are managed by the Bureau of Land Management. The ""Bureau of Livestock and Mining"", as the greens like to call it (though it also gets plenty of grief from ranchers and energy firms), is considering whether to allow three inactive gas wells to be brought back into service, and eight more exploratory wells to be drilled. Drilling could begin on the bureau's lands as early as 2005, a year before Ms Flora's moratorium comes up for review.
For greens, the problem is less the wells themselves than the things that come with them: roads, equipment plants, ""sweetening plants"" (used to remove unwanted ""sour gas""), and so on. The energy firms say that modern technology means the mess would be minimal, and the land can be reclaimed after the gas runs out. They have the support of Senator Conrad Burns and of the state's lone House member, Denny Rehberg, another Republican.
Yet the project still seems less popular with the locals than drilling in the ANWR was in Alaska. Montana's Democratic senator, Max Baucus, opposes it. The people of sparsely populated Teton County, where the first drilling is planned, are ""evenly split"", according to one county commissioner, Mary Sexton, who says that she ""leans toward opposing"". Some of the fiercest opponents of drilling on the Front are local ranchers and businessmen who deal with tourists. Hunters and gun-makers--hardly natural Democrats--are also opposed and they claim to have the president's ear. 
The split among the locals is interesting. George Bush has sought to hand control of federal land down to states and counties, which often helps the companies that want to dig into it; on the Front, local citizens may now want more federal protection, not less. Twenty years ago, greens were blamed for destroying logging and mining jobs: ""It may be beautiful, but you can't eat the scenery!"" Now the scenery has become a little more edible. The austere landscape of the Front may be the state's most sought-after commodity.

Israel's prime minister, Ariel Sharon, shook Israelis by declaring that he would remove all Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip as part of his plan to ""disengage"" from the territories occupied by Israel since the war of 1967. Some 7,500 Jews live alongside 1.2m Palestinians in Gaza. Both the Labour opposition and the Palestinian Authority's prime minister, Ahmed Qurei, cautiously welcomed the move.
Two suicide bombers in Arbil, capital of the Kurdish part of Iraq, blew up the offices of the two main Kurdish parties, killing more than 100 people, according to Kurdish groups, most of which blamed Ansar al-Islam, a Kurdish Islamist group close to al-Qaeda.
The American deputy defence secretary, Paul Wolfowitz, said in Baghdad that most American troops in the capital would be withdrawn to bases just outside it. He said that Iraqi police would take up the slack, but many Baghdadis doubted whether they are capable of doing so. 
Over a third of the Iranian parliament resigned after the Guardian Council, a body of appointed clerics and lawyers, upheld the disqualification of more than 2,000 prospective candidates, all reformers, hoping to stand in a general election due on February 20th. Next day, the main reformist party, the Participation Front, said it would boycott the poll.
Hopes rose that peace talks may be held between Sudan's government and groups involved in recent fighting in the western province of Darfur. The clashes have damaged prospects of a wider peace between north and south.
Intelligence test
George Bush said he would launch an ""independent bipartisan commission"" to look at intelligence failures and WMD programmes. The inquiry, which will study Iran, Libya and North Korea as well as Iraq, is not expected to report until after November's election. In Britain, Tony Blair set up an inquiry into the collection and use of intelligence prior to the Iraq war.
John Kerry won five of the seven Democratic primary elections held on February 3rd. John Edwards won South Carolina, but was narrowly beaten in Oklahoma by Wesley Clark. Joe Lieberman, Al Gore's running mate in 2000, withdrew from the race.

Mr Juppe is appealing against both verdict and sentence, of 18 months in jail (suspended) plus a ten-year ban on elective office.
France's National Assembly began debating a controversial bill to ban the wearing of the Muslim headscarf and other ostentatious religious symbols in French state schools and other public institutions. Some other countries in the European Union are talking about a similar ban. 
After deadlock since the Serbian general election in December, Vojislav Kostunica, leader of the Democratic Party of Serbia, is close to forming a government. Mr Kostunica, who ousted Slobodan Milosevic as Yugoslavia's president in 2000, saw his candidate made speaker of parliament. He may now form a minority government, with tacit support from Mr Milosevic's Socialist Party.
Sweden became the latest EU member to impose temporary restrictions on the free movement of workers from the eight central European countries that will join the EU on May 1st.

THE Labour-led government of New Zealand, which until recently seemed to be coasting effortlessly towards a third term, has been shocked out of its complacency. Don Brash--a 62-year-old former central-bank governor once nicknamed after the anti-anxiety drug Mogadon--surprised everybody when he switched to politics a few years ago. But the boring banker did not stop there. Now leader of the opposition National Party, he is turning the opinion polls upside down. His party, which only in December trailed 17 percentage points behind Labour, is now leading the polls 45% to 38%.
Mr Brash's simple line is that the Maori, who make up 15% of the population, are being granted too many privileges. ""We are one country with many peoples, not simply a society of Pakeha and Maori, where the minority has a birthright to the upper hand, as the Labour government seems to believe,"" he says. The opposition leader says he wants to build a society based on the notion of one rule for all, rather than a racially divided nation. He is critical of policies in education and health care--where government funding is influenced not just by need, but by ethnicity--and of other special treatment, such as Maoris' rights over land they do not own.
Maori leaders, not surprisingly, have condemned this line, which appeared to be undermined when the sole Maori member of his party's parliamentary caucus, Georgina Te Heuheu, refused to back his stance. For her pains, she was then sacked from her post as shadow minister of Maori affairs. 
The government's instinctive response was to brand his plea as racist. But ministers reversed themselves when it became clear that Mr Brash's message had a powerful political resonance across party lines. New Zealanders, as the latest opinion poll shows, are unhappy with the interpretation that the Treaty of Waitangi--under which Maori chiefs ceded sovereignty to the British in 1840--created a ""partnership"" between Maori and other New Zealanders and gave the Maori special privileges, a position assiduously cultivated by the government led by Helen Clark. 
As a result, what had been a bipartisan approach to Maori policy has now been demolished. In addition, Labour is being pilloried for becoming disconnected from voters. The government, which has invested so much political capital in the ""partnership"" model, could find itself in no-man's land if New Zealand's voters confirm the Brash diagnosis at the next election.","Not so boring after all

LAST autumn, as Paul Martin prepared to replace Jean Chretien as Canada's prime minister, the divided right-wing parties were gloomily contemplating a second decade in opposition. So much has the political climate changed that the hurried merger of the Progressive Conservatives (PC) and the Canadian Alliance into a single Conservative Party has created a credible alternative to the Liberals.
The turnaround is partly due to the bursting of a sleaze scandal from the Chretien era, concerning a publicity campaign against separatism in Quebec which degenerated into a slush fund. That has damaged the Liberals. But it is also because the Conservatives' tricky merger went surprisingly well, thanks mainly to the negotiating skill of Stephen Harper, the Alliance leader. Despite his party's ties to social and fiscal conservatism, he persuaded Peter Mackay, the more centrist PC leader, that merger offered each their only hope of power. Mr Harper now stands a good chance of defeating two rivals to become leader of the merged party in a grassroots vote on March 20th. 
Though he grew up in Ontario, Mr Harper's base is in Alberta and the west. But he claims his role in the merger shows that he is a bridge-builder; he hints that he would offer the deputy-leader's job to Mr Mackay, who is from Nova Scotia. An economist who speaks fluent French, Mr Harper has tempered his past support for small government and a reduction in official bi-lingualism. Though 20 years younger than Mr Martin, he already has much parliamentary experience.
All of that gives him the edge over Tony Clement, who as Ontario's health minister dealt capably with last year's outbreak of the SARS respiratory disease in Toronto. The third candidate, Belinda Stronach, is an elegant political oddity. The chief executive of a car-parts firm, she makes a virtue of being a campaign novice. Her photogenic features have embellished the front pages for weeks. She stands slightly to the left of the other two on social policy, while promising to spend heavily on the armed forces. She has spent some of her fortune on signing up new party members in Quebec, a province that controls a quarter of the convention votes.
Whoever wins, the Conservatives will focus on ethical government and an assault on Liberal sleaze. All three leadership contenders also agree on the need for an elected Senate and some private health provision, and that the emotive subject of legalising same-sex marriages should be put to a parliamentary vote.
This spirit of unity means that the new party should come out of the convention having lost only a few ""Red Tory"" MPs such as Joe Clark, a former prime minister, while having gained 110,000 new members--and public support. The latest poll shows the Conservatives at 26%; the Liberals, at 38%, have slid ten points from their January peak.
That is worrying for Mr Martin. He had hoped to call an early election in May, partly to catch the newly-merged Conservatives before their policies were settled. Those plans have gone awry. On current polls, the Liberals would be reduced to a minority government. Never quick to take decisions, Mr Martin has called a by-election in Ottawa Centre, a difficult seat, for the distant date of November 29th. That suggests he might also postpone a general election until the autumn, giving time for the polls to change. Mr Harper, if it is he, has an opportunity.

LAST autumn, as Paul Martin prepared to replace Jean Chretien as Canada's prime minister, the divided right-wing parties were gloomily contemplating a second decade in opposition. So much has the political climate changed that the hurried merger of the Progressive Conservatives (PC) and the Canadian Alliance into a single Conservative Party has created a credible alternative to the Liberals.
The turnaround is partly due to the bursting of a sleaze scandal from the Chretien era, concerning a publicity campaign against separatism in Quebec which degenerated into a slush fund. That has damaged the Liberals. But it is also because the Conservatives' tricky merger went surprisingly well, thanks mainly to the negotiating skill of Stephen Harper, the Alliance leader. Despite his party's ties to social and fiscal conservatism, he persuaded Peter Mackay, the more centrist PC leader, that merger offered each their only hope of power. Mr Harper now stands a good chance of defeating two rivals to become leader of the merged party in a grassroots vote on March 20th. 
Though he grew up in Ontario, Mr Harper's base is in Alberta and the west. But he claims his role in the merger shows that he is a bridge-builder; he hints that he would offer the deputy-leader's job to Mr Mackay, who is from Nova Scotia. An economist who speaks fluent French, Mr Harper has tempered his past support for small government and a reduction in official bi-lingualism. Though 20 years younger than Mr Martin, he already has much parliamentary experience.
All of that gives him the edge over Tony Clement, who as Ontario's health minister dealt capably with last year's outbreak of the SARS respiratory disease in Toronto. The third candidate, Belinda Stronach, is an elegant political oddity. The chief executive of a car-parts firm, she makes a virtue of being a campaign novice.

NO CAR in the United States relies more on the septuagenarian motorist for its sales than the Buick Park Avenue. Half the people who bought this stately mid-sized luxury model last year were 70 or over (see table 5). But what do those on the eve of retirement buy? Nearly half the buyers of the BMW Z3, a snazzy little sports car, were in their 50s. 
And if not a BMW sports car, then perhaps a Harley-Davidson. Last summer the AARP's magazine ran an article on older bikers, pointing out that over half the buyers were 45 or older and interviewing a gutsy 62-year-old lady who ran the Brooklyn chapter of the Harley Owners Group. 
Guessing from the habits of today's old folk what tomorrow's will be like is almost certain to produce the wrong answer. The baby-boomers have done many things later than their parents did, and a few things that the old folk would never have contemplated. They married late and had families late. Quite a few men in their 50s and 60s are in a second marriage, and still raising school-age children. When, a few years ago, the AARP interviewed people about life's pleasures, it found that 61% of men aged 55-64 and 66% of 65-pluses thought they got as much (or more) fun out of life as they had at a younger age.
Each generation is shaped by its experiences early in life. The baby-boomers matured in vibrant days for politics and culture. Last year Demos, a British think-tank, compiled evidence from a variety of sources to portray ""The New Old"". It found Britain's baby-boomers are less deferential and less conformist than either older or younger age groups. They are ardent consumers, used to experimenting with brands; they are relatively libertarian, having grown up with women's lib and marijuana (which 27% claim to have used); and they know about ethical consumption: 23% have boycotted a company's products at some point, compared with 13% of the older generation. Only 15% agree that men should earn and women stay home, compared with 39% of older folk. 
They are also better educated than older age groups. That may be crucial. It will help to determine not just their health, but how they spend their new-found leisure. Atsushi Seike, a professor of labour economics at Japan's Keio University, argues that today's old in his country do not have the skills to enjoy their leisure, but thinks the next generation does. 
The spending patterns of tomorrow's old matters to many companies, which see the largest age group in their market steadily ageing. People tend to spend less when they retire, but they are still a lucrative market. Mariko Fujiwara, who runs the Hakuhodo Institute of Life and Living, a think-tank attached to Japan's second-largest advertising agency, has studied Japanese people in their 50s and 60s and found that they are active, well-informed and often wealthy. Those in Tokyo have become avid consumers of take-away food. When the Okura, one of the ritziest hotels in the city, began to offer home-delivered sushi, its sales quadrupled in a year, with an average order of yen18,700 ($170). The main customers were well-to-do retired folk.
All sorts of products that promise to hold back the years are pouring on to the market: not just expensive sports cars but hair colours and anti-wrinkle creams, Viagra and hormone-replacement pills, exercise machines and travel catalogues. Japanese electronics companies such as Matsushita and Panasonic are racing to develop specially designed showers and kitchen appliances for older people. Smith & Nephew, a large European orthopaedics group, is enjoying steeply rising sales as the fairly old begin to buy hip and knee replacements. And at the World Economic Forum in Davos earlier this year, Royal Caribbean Cruises told grey-haired industrialists that the retired are essential to the economics of the industry, because they can fill ships at any time of year.
Youthful advertising executives find it hard to understand this market. The AARP recently ran a campaign saying, ""To most marketers, consumers die the minute they turn 50."" But the market is genuinely tricky. Show a pair of silver-haired figures wandering hand-in-hand along the beach and you may lose your audience. One answer, argues Simon Silvester of Young & Rubicam, is to invoke nostalgia, as with an advertisement for Coors beer recalling skiing expeditions of the 1960s. Another is to show Lauren Hutton, whose 60-year-old glamour works with young and old.
There is also a deeper problem, says Thomas Heilmann, chief executive of Scholz & Friends, Berlin's biggest advertising company. Not only are older people slower at adopting innovation and new brands; but a product that gets a reputation for being an old person's brand loses value in the market at large. Worse, ""If I can convince someone of 25 to drink my coffee, I have a customer for 65 years. If I convince someone of 70 to change, I may have a return for only ten years.""
The retired find themselves suddenly time-rich after a lifetime of time-poverty. Travel mops up lots of time at first. The Hakuhodo Institute found that a third of Japanese 50-60-year-olds gave overseas travel as their favourite activity, with the Italian cities, Paris, London and Vienna topping the list. In Germany, say researchers at the Institute for Tourism, the fastest growth in demand for holiday travel in 1972-99 came from people aged 60 and over. Once again, the older travellers are adventurous. Of travellers who were in their mid-50s in 1999, 76% took holidays abroad--a sharp increase from the 48% of the same age group who took foreign holidays back in 1975. Among those who were 79 in 1999, 43% were still holidaying abroad. 
Some of the travelling by the newly retired involves finding somewhere agreeable to live. Because they no longer have to turn up for work, the retired can set up home more or less wherever they like. Alan Fox, who edits a magazine called Where to Retire, says that Clark County, Nevada (which includes Las Vegas) is now probably the most popular destination for migrating oldies. Already Nevada has more retired Californians than retired Nevadans, he says. His readers' top three requirements are a low crime rate, an active, clean and safe downtown, and good hospitals nearby. They bring property investment, bank accounts, business for local doctors and tax revenue. Increasingly, southern states fight to attract them. 
Florida, in spite of having America's largest number of golf courses, has been losing popularity. Some of the retired, says Mr Fox, have become ""half-backs"": people who have moved to the state from New York and then changed their minds and headed half-way back, often ending up in the Carolinas. In 2002 Governor Jeb Bush, spotting this trend, set up a special commission to recommend ways to make Florida ""more retiree friendly"". The commission's report, published last year, pointed out that retired people attracted a monthly $2.8 billion in pensions and other benefits into the state. They contributed much more in sales taxes than the state's younger citizens, and paid more in state taxes than they received in social benefits. The commission offered a string of suggestions for attracting more golden oldies, including an advertising campaign on the joys of retiring to Florida.
Time's fell hand
As the years pass, even today's rebellious nearly-retired may find that some of their preoccupations come to resemble those of today's greybeards. High on the list--almost as high as worries about the quality and cost of health care--is driving. In societies built around the car, a driving licence becomes a passport to more than just mobility. A horrid accident last year, when an 86-year-old man drove through a market in Santa Monica, California, causing ten deaths, sent a shiver through the ranks of elderly drivers. In America, only two states (and the District of Columbia) require drivers aged 75 or over to take a new test before their licence is renewed. A few years ago, older voters fought off such a requirement in California. 
Joseph Coughlin, head of the AgeLab at MIT, is researching the way older people drive. One focus group of older men told him, ""You can always get another wife; you can't get another driving licence."" Older drivers are involved in more fatal accidents than the middle-aged, but he argues that this is because they are frailer, and so more likely to be killed in a crash. Their overall accident rate rises around the age of 70, but not by much: older people drive fewer miles, stay off freeways, avoid driving at night and generally steer clear of situations that lead to accidents.
What is the alternative to a life on wheels? Augusta Winebrenner took the sensible step of moving to a ""life-care facility"", a community of 1,000 older people who live in little houses and apartment blocks around the lakes of John Knox Village, in Florida's Fort Lauderdale. She came from Boca Raton a quarter of a century ago with her sister, having decided that it was important to live somewhere where they could be driven once they could no longer drive. But the move has brought other benefits. The village bustles with social activity and volunteer jobs. Now 103, Mrs Winebrenner works as a librarian and growls about residents who fail to return popular volumes on time. Bob Milanovitch, the genial marketing director, who came to run the village at much the same time as MrsWinebrenner took up residence, describes John Knox as a cross between a cruise ship and a college dorm. The daily programme offers everything from Spanish lessons to line dancing. 
Too much of a good thing
Such activity is surely better than the lonely life led by too many retired folk. The cheapest way to fill idle hours is to switch on the television. Time spent watching the box increases by two to three hours a day between the 45-54 age group and the one over 74. Men in particular, unused to a life not dominated by employment, often find adjustment hard, says Mr Coughlin. Women have built a neighbourhood network, whereas a man's social life revolves around work. 
Katharine Whitehorn is the agony aunt for Britain's Saga Magazine, read mainly by older people. She receives lots of letters from the tormented spouses of newly retired husbands, who expect their wives to fill in for everything they have lost at work. ""He retired two years ago and I am having a nervous breakdown,"" screamed one. When her friends visited, he would neither join them nor go out, but would sit in the kitchen with the door ajar, rustling the newspaper. ""When a husband makes his wife give up the things she has always done, she becomes more vulnerable,"" says Miss Whitehorn. 
However grim work may be, can it really be worse than daytime television? The best way to greet old age is surely to go off on that cruise and perhaps buy a holiday home in the sun--but then swap full-time for part-time work, with the regularity, companionship and cash that it brings. Given the prospects for pensions, many retired folk may not have much choice.

THE mood in Michigan is mostly bleak these days. Pessimists say it looks like just another rustbelt state on the wane. Its jobless rate of 6.5% is well above the national average. The steep rise in petrol prices is a particular blow for a state where everybody seems to own a car or a boat or be involved in making them. 
There are bright spots, however. Optimists point out that the jobless rate is down from 7.2% a year ago. Despite all the whingeing about local politicians, a charismatic young Democratic governor, Jennifer Granholm, enjoys heady approval ratings. And in an omen of better times ahead, the Detroit Pistons, an underdog team from an underdog city, has just snatched the basketball championship from the glitzy Los Angeles Lakers. 
Mood may matter a lot in Michigan--a classic swing state where factors like election-day weather can influence the outcome. It is also one of the biggest competitive states, with 17 electoral votes, and thus gets a lot of attention. Both parties have been running ads since February. Mr Kerry was in the state for the ninth time last week; a few days earlier Mr Bush sent his commerce secretary, Don Evans, to talk about the better job numbers.
All the same, Mr Kerry plainly needs a win here more than Mr Bush does. The Democrats have carried the state in the past three presidential contests. The party controls the governorship and both Senate seats. The home of the United Auto Workers, Michigan is one of the states where unions still matter. Detroit, a predominantly black city, is a Democratic stronghold; so is Ann Arbor, a liberal university town. 
Yet Mr Bush is plainly within a shout. He has solid support in the conservative western side of the state and also in the wealthier suburbs of Detroit. An EPIC-MRA poll issued this month showed Mr Kerry leading the president by only two points. A recent Zogby poll of swing states actually put Mr Bush ahead in Michigan.
So why isn't Mr Kerry doing better? As in so many states, his campaign has made a slow start. The campaign director, Donnie Fowler, a former campaign adviser to Al Gore and Wesley Clark, was appointed only this month. More generally, although the Democratic faithful loathe Mr Bush, they wonder about his opponent. 
Take two of the groups that you would expect to be fully on Mr Kerry's side. The local unions, who favoured Dick Gephardt at first for the Democratic nomination, worry whether an environmentalist like Mr Kerry would be good for their factories. Meanwhile, Arab-Americans, a big voting block in and around Detroit, may be disillusioned by Mr Bush's Middle East policies; but they are unsure whether Mr Kerry would be any better, and so some favour Ralph Nader. Meanwhile, Mr Bush's people are making concerted efforts to lure Indian-Americans, a group that has usually voted Democratic in the past.
The Republicans like to point out that Michigan is less Democratic than it first appears. Republicans control both houses of the state legislature. The state once voted reliably for Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon and its native son, Gerald Ford. Lots of independent voters live in Michigan (around 16-19% of the electorate), and they sometimes vote Republican. 
It is these independents, particularly suburban working women, that Governor Granholm has been particularly successful at rounding up for the Democrats. Mr Kerry obviously sees her as an asset; she has been invited to address the Democratic convention next month, and one senior figure in the White House even claims that Mr Kerry thought about her as an ideal running-mate (she is ineligible, having been born in Canada). 
But Ms Granholm's prominence also underlines some differences with Mr Kerry. She is more of a Clintonian centrist and a populist than the patrician New England senator. Mr Bush's troops will try to convince blue-collar types in places like Macomb County that a ""Harvard Yard liberal"" of Mr Kerry's stripe does not share their values on issues like gay marriage.
Yet Mr Bush will get the attention of such voters only if he can convince them that the economy is recovering. Around 150,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost since early 2001. Outsourcing is often seen as the culprit (even though a report issued this month at the Mackinac Policy Conference suggested that it accounted for only one in eight of the jobs lost). Mr Kerry's talk about Benedict Arnold corporations exporting American jobs goes down well in the rustbelt.
The economic pain may be most obvious in Detroit and its suburbs (home to more than 40% of Michigan's population), but it is actually spread across the state. In the west, the furniture-making industry has been hurt by cheap foreign competition; in the remote Upper Peninsula, mining and forestry are both in trouble. Another problem has been the cuts in local and state budgets. Ed Sarpolus, a pollster, reckons a third of companies rely on contracts with local government.
Yet Mr Bush is not without hope on this score. Manufacturing jobs are now holding steady. A high-tech corridor is being fashioned. Service industries--notably tourism--are picking up. There has been a property boom on the state's north-western edge along Lake Michigan, as residents from nearby states and retirees (many of them former car-workers) move north in search of the good life. Democrats point out that these exiles from the city are usually on their side. But Mr Kerry's hold on the state may depend rather more than he would like on that hovering cloud of economic gloom.","George Bush is putting pressure on John Kerry in Michigan, but the economy still counts against the president

The party controls the governorship and both Senate seats. The home of the United Auto Workers, Michigan is one of the states where unions still matter. Detroit, a predominantly black city, is a Democratic stronghold; so is Ann Arbor, a liberal university town. 
Yet Mr Bush is plainly within a shout. He has solid support in the conservative western side of the state and also in the wealthier suburbs of Detroit. An EPIC-MRA poll issued this month showed Mr Kerry leading the president by only two points. A recent Zogby poll of swing states actually put Mr Bush ahead in Michigan.
So why isn't Mr Kerry doing better? As in so many states, his campaign has made a slow start. The campaign director, Donnie Fowler, a former campaign adviser to Al Gore and Wesley Clark, was appointed only this month. More generally, although the Democratic faithful loathe Mr Bush, they wonder about his opponent. 
Take two of the groups that you would expect to be fully on Mr Kerry's side. The local unions, who favoured Dick Gephardt at first for the Democratic nomination, worry whether an environmentalist like Mr Kerry would be good for their factories. Meanwhile, Arab-Americans, a big voting block in and around Detroit, may be disillusioned by Mr Bush's Middle East policies; but they are unsure whether Mr Kerry would be any better, and so some favour Ralph Nader. Meanwhile, Mr Bush's people are making concerted efforts to lure Indian-Americans, a group that has usually voted Democratic in the past.
The Republicans like to point out that Michigan is less Democratic than it first appears. Republicans control both houses of the state legislature. The state once voted reliably for Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon and its native son, Gerald Ford. Lots of independent voters live in Michigan (around 16-19% of the electorate), and they sometimes vote Republican. 
It is these independents, particularly suburban working women, that Governor Granholm has been particularly successful at rounding up for the Democrats. Mr Kerry obviously sees her as an asset; she has been invited to address the Democratic convention next month, and one senior figure in the White House even claims that Mr Kerry thought about her as an ideal running-mate (she is ineligible, having been born in Canada). 
But Ms Granholm's prominence also underlines some differences with Mr Kerry. She is more of a Clintonian centrist and a populist than the patrician New England senator. Mr Bush's troops will try to convince blue-collar types in places like Macomb County that a ""Harvard Yard liberal"" of Mr Kerry's stripe does not share their values on issues like gay marriage.
Yet Mr Bush will get the attention of such voters only if he can convince them that the economy is recovering. Around 150,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost since early 2001. Outsourcing is often seen as the culprit (even though a report issued this month at the Mackinac Policy Conference suggested that it accounted for only one in eight of the jobs lost). Mr Kerry's talk about Benedict Arnold corporations exporting American jobs goes down well in the rustbelt.
The economic pain may be most obvious in Detroit and its suburbs (home to more than 40% of Michigan's population), but it is actually spread across the state. In the west, the furniture-making industry has been hurt by cheap foreign competition; in the remote Upper Peninsula, mining and forestry are both in trouble. Another problem has been the cuts in local and state budgets. Ed Sarpolus, a pollster, reckons a third of companies rely on contracts with local government.
Yet Mr Bush is not without hope on this score. Manufacturing jobs are now holding steady. A high-tech corridor is being fashioned. Service industries--notably tourism--are picking up. There has been a property boom on the state's north-western edge along Lake Michigan, as residents from nearby states and retirees (many of them former car-workers) move north in search of the good life. Democrats point out that these exiles from the city are usually on their side. But Mr Kerry's hold on the state may depend rather more than he would like on that hovering cloud of economic gloom.",920,New Zealand,A29-9067,,False,,0,True

HAVING been in power for 55 of the past 70 years, the Liberals have earned the title of Canada's perpetual ruling party. The Conservatives, traditionally the main opposition, last saw office a dozen years ago and were all but wiped out in an election in 1993. So when 2,900 Conservative delegates gathered last week in Montreal for a policy-setting convention, the questions nagging many were why the political pendulum swings so rarely--and whether they can now make it do so again.
The Conservatives do not lack reasons for hope. The convention was the first since the merger in October 2003 of the two parties into which the right had splintered--the Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservatives. The new party has a youngish, intelligent and presentable leader in Stephen Harper. Its 99 MPs and its shadow cabinet are not devoid of talent or experience (if not necessarily of cabinet office). Yet if the Conservatives are to turf out the minority Liberal government of Paul Martin at the next general election--probably little more than a year away--they still have work to do.
The merger was something of a shotgun marriage, pushed from the top by the Alliance's Mr Harper and his Progressive Conservative counterpart, Peter MacKay, ahead of last year's election. The fit was less than perfect. The Alliance, based in western Canada, brought a tradition of populism and a taste for small government and large tax cuts. Its new partner had been largely reduced to a rump in the Atlantic provinces. Many of its leaders were centrist ""Red Tories""; one of them, Joe Clark, a former prime minister, opposed the merger, accusing the Alliance of having a ""hidden agenda"" of fundamentalist social conservatism.
In last year's campaign, Mr Harper's early attacks on Liberal sleaze and waste saw a surge of support for the new party in the opinion polls. But this ebbed when voters believed Mr Martin's claim that the Conservatives would restrict abortion, prohibit same-sex marriages, and generally disregard Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The upshot was that though the merger delivered 21 more seats, the new party's vote was 8% lower than that of its predecessors combined. A poll this month had the Conservatives still trailing the Liberals, by 30% to 35%.
The party's strategists insist that it needs to do more to capture the middle ground of politics. So Mr Harper tried to minimise debate at the convention on social issues: resolutions on these questions were decided by paper ballots (rather than a show of hands), with no amendments accepted. The delegates decided that a Conservative government would not legislate to restrict abortion but would reverse a Liberal bill to recognise same-sex marriages. On defence, the convention approved a more traditional conservative platform: the party would increase military spending and improve relations with the United States, lining up with George Bush's government on ballistic missile defence and in rejecting the Kyoto accord on greenhouse gas emissions. Overall, the convention approved ""a moderate, mainstream programme which reflects Canadian values,"" Mr Harper claimed.
The event was not free of internal tensions. Mr MacKay successfully objected to a resolution that would have given veterans of the Alliance a dominant position in the party. At one point, Mr Harper was seen kicking a chair across the floor in frustration. But he emerged with his leadership of the party strengthened: he was endorsed by 84% of the delegates, and delivered a couple of powerful speeches mocking Mr Martin. The party's appeal in Ontario, the most populous province, may be helped by the prominent role of Belinda Stronach, a businesswoman who is one of the few Tory MPs who support same-sex marriage. She adds glamour and good looks to a somewhat sombre party. 
Yet some doubts still remain. Mr Harper is by tradition a fiscal conservative, yet this month he backed away from opposing the Liberal budget, which features big dollops of extra spending on health. The party's platform on defence and foreign policy remains vague. ""It shows they are not serious about acting as an alternative government,"" according to Andrew Cohen, a foreign-policy specialist at Ottawa's Carleton University. ""They have to do some hard thinking, about aid and military spending."" And Mr Harper, a cerebral figure, remains remote from voters. The Conservatives have taken a step towards making themselves electable again. But Mr Martin, who was due to meet Mr Bush in Texas this week, has the benefit of a robust economy and a munificent budget. The next election, when it comes, may be even closer than the last.

Jerusalem, the site of Christ's death and resurrection, has long mixed religious spirituality with an all too human capacity for earthly nonsense
IN EVERY place where Palestinian Christians live, church choirs are getting ready to celebrate what they regard as the defining event in local history. Some will mark Easter along with the western Christian world on Sunday; the majority, followers of the eastern calendar, have another five weeks to wait before their rich Arabic voices take up the Hebrew poetry of the Paschal hymn: ""Shine, shine, Oh new Jerusalem, for the glory of the Lord has dawned upon you!""
Christ himself counselled people not to be too concerned with the specifics of holy places; it was more important to offer prayers ""in spirit and in truth"" than to pray on the right mountainside or in the right city. But Palestinian worshippers would hardly be human if they did not give a rather literal interpretation to the words they were singing. As a tiny minority within a minority whose lives have been turned upside down since the intifada began, they yearn to travel more easily to and from the earthly Jerusalem of family, friends and cherished places of worship.
But not all of Jerusalem's Christians sympathise with them. While the Christian communities of the Old City (Armenians and Ethiopians, as well as Palestinians) dwindle in numbers and morale, there is a powerful new force on the religious scene: a dynamic body of evangelical Christians, many of them American, who side with the far right of Israeli politics. They believe that the Jews are the only people with a right to the land of Israel as defined by scripture, and that all others should leave. Many of the older Christian communities find it hard to regard these newcomers as their co-religionists.
This tension is one of the many themes investigated by Victoria Clark, who spent a year and a half as a part-time resident of the Old City, staying in a damp ex-monastery as lodger and friend of two Palestinian Christian sisters with an endearing attachment to gossip and cigarettes. Against a background of violence, fear and economic depression, Ms Clark has written a rich and insightful essay on Christian Jerusalem, harking back as far as 325AD, when the Emperor Constantine and his mother, Helena, are said to have announced the discovery of Christ's tomb.
Ever since, this tiny shrine has drawn hundreds of thousands of people, some as conquerors using the Holy Sepulchre as an excuse for military adventures, others believing that they could be redeemed both by the journey and the destination. The conquerors insisted that only by possessing the shrine, and killing everybody who stood in their way, could Christian powers be guaranteed access to the holiest place of their faith. The reality experienced by ordinary believers was different. For at least two centuries after Muslims took control of Jerusalem in 638AD, Christians enjoyed uninterrupted visits to the Sepulchre and the sacred sites around it. Another period of peaceful access was the 400 years ofOttoman rule; the Sultans were cheerfully venal about who administered the holy premises, and gave the lion's share to the Greeks who were the best payers.
In the 19th century, Anglo-Saxon Protestants were horrified by the annual Easter ritual of the Holy Fire. This is a ceremony in which a flame--kindled in some mysterious way in the heart of the tomb--is used to light the candles of thousands of excited believers from every corner of eastern Christendom.
As Ms Clark points out, there is indeed something close to farce about many aspects of the Sepulchre, including the regime under which six Christian communities co-exist in an atmosphere of intense mutual suspicion, which can degenerate into fisticuffs.
In any description of elaborate ritual conducted by fallible human beings, the ridiculous is never far away and no description of Christian Jerusalem would be complete without a dose of slapstick. Ms Clark provides plenty: Cypriot monks with halitosis, Franciscans who ""hitch up their skirts"" as they sit down, and Armenian tour guides with wandering eyes.
But what about the sublime? Striking by its absence from her book is any word from pilgrims who are transformed by the visit. She focuses instead on Victorian travellers, full of contempt for the Greek and Russian peasants who thronged the Sepulchre. One traveller, Robert Curzon, watched in horror in 1834 as the ceremony of the Holy Fire led to a stampede in which many people were killed. Small wonder, as Ms Clark points out, that most Victorian visitors preferred to spend their time outdoors, mapping biblical sites.
But not every modern pilgrim treats the Sepulchre with such disdain. One very recent visitor, a well-educated American nun whom Ms Clark did not meet, said she was utterly overwhelmed by the place: ""Pressing your forehead against the cool marble slab, you know beyond reason and sentiment that this tiny shrine is the precise spiritual centre of the universe, and that all beauty, all religious truth and every created being spins on an inner axis around this sun."" 
What such descriptions evoke is the mystery at the heart of all holy places. They may be located in specific points on the map, but they are also thresholds which take the pilgrim into a realitybeyond time and space. The holiness of such places--their role as gateway to an entirely different reality--is organically connected to the worldly battles they trigger, but is also entirely separate. While earthly movements, of which the ultra-Zionists are only the most recent, view the Holy Land as a place to possess and transform, pilgrims down the centuries have experienced it as a place where they undergo transformation. The Palestinian Christians have a healthy instinctive sense of this paradox. They adore the Holy Sepulchre, while maintaining a lively disrespect for most of the Greek bishops who lord and squabble over it.","Holy Fire . By Helen Clark . Macmillan ; 432 pages ; pounds 20

IN 1978, something remarkable happened in Chinese cinema: the Beijing Film Academy, China's national film school, reopened for the first time after it was closed during the Cultural Revolution. Four years later, in 1982, 153 students graduated and were labelled the ""fifth generation"" of film-makers to emerge since the birth of Chinese cinema. They were the first to see what the rest of the film world was doing. The innovations of Michelangelo Antonioni and Akira Kurosawa encouraged these Chinese fledglings to experiment in ways long absent from the stolid Chinese movies favoured by Madame Mao.
Paul Clark, who teaches Chinese at the University of Auckland, has written a comprehensive and perceptive account of the films that emerged from this cradle. He focuses on ten directors, including Chen Kaige, who kick-started the movement with ""Yellow Earth"" (1984), and Zhang Yimou, the most successful of the bunch, whose ""Red Sorghum"" (1987) won the top prize at the Berlin film festival, alerting the world to this new wave from China.
Many of the class of 1982, who had once enjoyed a privileged background by Chinese standards, had been sent during the Cultural Revolution to the countryside, where they suffered many indignities. Mr Chen was required to denounce his father. Mr Zhang, whose first love was photography, sold blood to buy a camera and was forced to use toilet water to develop film.
Their enthusiasm for the Communist Party, when they came to make their first films, was understandably muted. But overt criticism was still taboo, so the fifth generation made extensive use of allegory. Is the brutal Japanese army in ""Red Sorghum"" to be read as a metaphor for something more recent? Foreign critics have speculated on this, but Mr Zhang has always kept scrupulously mum. ""The Big Parade"" (1986), a story of military training, which Mr Chen was ordered to end with a celebration of the state 35th anniversary parade in Tiananmen Square, can in fact be read as a critique of conformism.
The fifth generation baffled the authorities, who welcomed the kudos it was earning abroad but felt instinctively that wool was being pulled over their eyes. Mutual suspicions abounded. ""Dove Tree"", a humanist picture set during the Sino-Vietnamese border dispute of 1979, was suppressed for showing the enemy in a sympathetic light. Tian Zhuangzhuang, who in ""The Blue Kite"" was able to complete an expose of the Cultural Revolution by having the film developed in Japan, once said that he made films for the 21st century. Deng Xiaoping, no less, promptly invited him to pick up his paycheck in the 21st century, too.
What eventually choked the fifth generation, however, was not official disapproval, nor even the fact that films about the Cultural Revolution came to seem increasingly irrelevant to the younger generation, but the economic changes that were taking place within China itself. A widening range of leisure activities led to a precipitous fall in cinema admissions and pressure to amend the content of Chinese movies to mimic and compete with Hollywood imports, which were few in number but overwhelmingly popular.
Not many of the original fifth-generation graduates are making similar films today. Some have retreated into action thrillers, others, like Mr Chen and Mr Zhang, into sumptuously filmed costume dramas, where the production values sometimes outclass the scripts.
All, however, is not lost. Take Li Shaohong, whom the author, in a rare slip, calls Li Shaobei. Ms Li made her mark in 1990 with ""Bloody Morning"", a striking adaptation of ""Chronicle of a Death Foretold"" translated to a Chinese setting. More recently she has successfully connected with the new youth culture with her stylish film ""Baober in Love"", while Gu Changwei, who shot ""Red Sorghum"", triumphantly evoked past glories with his directorialdebut, ""Peacock"".","Reinventing China: A Generation and Its Films.

Mr Chen was required to denounce his father. Mr Zhang, whose first love was photography, sold blood to buy a camera and was forced to use toilet water to develop film.
Their enthusiasm for the Communist Party, when they came to make their first films, was understandably muted. But overt criticism was still taboo, so the fifth generation made extensive use of allegory. Is the brutal Japanese army in ""Red Sorghum"" to be read as a metaphor for something more recent? Foreign critics have speculated on this, but Mr Zhang has always kept scrupulously mum. ""The Big Parade"" (1986), a story of military training, which Mr Chen was ordered to end with a celebration of the state 35th anniversary parade in Tiananmen Square, can in fact be read as a critique of conformism.
The fifth generation baffled the authorities, who welcomed the kudos it was earning abroad but felt instinctively that wool was being pulled over their eyes. Mutual suspicions abounded. ""Dove Tree"", a humanist picture set during the Sino-Vietnamese border dispute of 1979, was suppressed for showing the enemy in a sympathetic light. Tian Zhuangzhuang, who in ""The Blue Kite"" was able to complete an expose of the Cultural Revolution by having the film developed in Japan, once said that he made films for the 21st century. Deng Xiaoping, no less, promptly invited him to pick up his paycheck in the 21st century, too.
What eventually choked the fifth generation, however, was not official disapproval, nor even the fact that films about the Cultural Revolution came to seem increasingly irrelevant to the younger generation, but the economic changes that were taking place within China itself. A widening range of leisure activities led to a precipitous fall in cinema admissions and pressure to amend the content of Chinese movies to mimic and compete with Hollywood imports, which were few in number but overwhelmingly popular.
Not many of the original fifth-generation graduates are making similar films today. Some have retreated into action thrillers, others, like Mr Chen and Mr Zhang, into sumptuously filmed costume dramas, where the production values sometimes outclass the scripts.
All, however, is not lost. Take Li Shaohong, whom the author, in a rare slip, calls Li Shaobei. Ms Li made her mark in 1990 with ""Bloody Morning"", a striking adaptation of ""Chronicle of a Death Foretold"" translated to a Chinese setting. More recently she has successfully connected with the new youth culture with her stylish film ""Baober in Love"", while Gu Changwei, who shot ""Red Sorghum"", triumphantly evoked past glories with his directorialdebut, ""Peacock"".",920,New Zealand,A29-9067,,False,,0,True

WHEN New Zealanders go to the polls on September 17th, they will face a stark choice. The current Labour government, led by Helen Clark, is bidding for a third term with the promise of improved public services and limited tax breaks for families. The National Party, Labour's main rival, is offering much bigger tax cuts in tandem with smaller government. Most recent soundings give National a slight edge, although the two parties have see-sawed in the polls. Under New Zealand's system of proportional representation, neither is likely to win an outright majority, forcing voters to make complicated calculations about potential coalitions. For New Zealand's Maori voters, in particular, the decision will be fraught. 
Traditionally, both Labour and National have taken a relatively accommodating stance toward the Maoris, who make up some 15% of the population. Over the past 20 years, during alternating spells in government, both parties have supported the work of the Waitangi Tribunal, which investigates claims of past and present abuses of indigenous rights, and recommends compensation for them. The work of the tribunal, in turn, is based on the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi, whereby some Maori chiefs ceded sovereignty to Britain in return for guarantees that their customary rights would be respected. 
But the political consensus on these procedures evaporated two years ago, when a court ruled that Maori tribes could attempt to prove customary ownership of the seabed and foreshore (the bit of the coastline between the high- and low-water marks), and so potentially gain a say in the management of the country's beaches. The media stoked fears that the ruling would put an end to seaside holidays, prompting the rattled government to pass a hastily conceived law to keep the foreshore and seabed in public hands. 
Don Brash, the National Party's leader, thinks that the government did not go far enough. He wants to wrap up the work of the tribunal by 2010. Moreover, he argues that efforts to address Maori grievances are instilling a system of ""racial separatism"". He wants to excise references to the Treaty of Waitangi from legislation, eliminate any special role for Maoris in planning applications and abolish the seven seats in parliament reserved for them. After all, he points out, Maoris won a further 12 out of the 113 ordinary seats at the last election, and five Maoris from National alone are likely to win seats this time around. 
Many Maoris, meanwhile, think that both Labour and National take too narrow a view of indigenous rights. One Maori MP was so outraged at Labour's abolition of Maori claims to the foreshore that she quit the party, and set up the rival Maori Party. It might win as many as five of the Maori seats, and play a pivotal role in post-election coalition-building. If a National government really tried to abolish those seats, says one Maori Party candidate, it would face ""an uprising"". 
Yet there is some common ground between National and the Maori Party. National says it is happy to maintain funding for Maori schools and hospitals in the name of choice. The Maori Party, for its part, says that Maoris are too prone to look to the government for solutions to their problems. And both agree that compensation payments alone are not the panacea that many Maoris imagine. 
Maoris lag behind other New Zealanders by almost every measure. They are poorer, less educated and less healthy. They are more likely to be unemployed, to commit suicide and to be victims of crime. Over half of prison inmates are Maori. Payouts for past abuses cannot fix all this, both National and the Maori Party contend. Instead, what is needed are better targeted welfare schemes, more efficient public services and a more buoyant economy--the very issues that non-Maori voters are focusing on.

The reconstruction of New Orleans was upset by the approach of Hurricane Rita. Upgraded to a category 5 storm, the same as Katrina, Rita was on course to hit Texas, with Louisiana also under threat. Meanwhile, the death-toll for Katrina climbed past 1,000.
Addressing the nation, George Bush vowed that the federal government would help New Orleans, even though the total amount needed is estimated at $200 billion. He called for an urban homesteading act, giving away federal land to people prepared to build their own homes.
Arnold Schwarzenegger said he would run for re-election as California's governor; he also backed a proposition to require public-sector unions to get their members' written permission to use their dues for political purposes.
The Democratic minority leader in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced he would not support John Roberts's confirmation to the Supreme Court; the conservative judge still seemed likely to become chief justice.
Germany was in turmoil after its two main parties fought almost to a dead-heat in a general election: the centre-right Christian Democrats, led by Angela Merkel, just won, with 35.2% of the votes and 225 seats, while the incumbent chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, and his Social Democrats, got 34.3% and 222 seats. The liberal Free Democrats, the newly-formed Left Party and the Greens all got under 10%. No combination looked assured of power; a ""grand coalition"" of the two leading parties was mooted.
Italy's economy minister, Domenico Siniscalco, tried to resign over the government's failure to oust the central bank governor, Antonio Fazio.
The European Union, Turkey and the internationally recognised (ie. Greek-Cypriot) republic of Cyprus argued over whether Turkey should start negotiations for full membership of the European club as scheduled on October 3rd. The Greek-Cypriots insist that the Turks should recognise their country first; the Turks say no.
Lithuania's authorities detained a Russian pilot after he ejected from his jet, which crashed after apparently violating Lithuanian airspace. 
Britain's turn in Iraq
The focus in Iraq switched from Baghdad to Basra, the biggest city in the south, where tension rose between British forces, the local authorities and various militias competing for power. British troops stormed a police station in a bid to rescue two British soldiers who had been arrested by Iraqi police and handed over to a militia. In another incident, a mob set fire to a British military vehicle, raising questions in Britain about whether its troops should stay.
After a defiant speech by Iran's president at the UN, his chief nuclear negotiator threatened to end all co-operation with inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN's nuclear watchdog, and start enriching uranium, if the agency's 35-nation board reported Iran's past nuclear rule-breaking this week to the UN Security Council. A majority of the board seemed ready to refer Iran to the Council, but a number of countries, including Russia, argued against it. 
The Egyptian government and the Palestinian Authority tried to persuade Israel to let a third party monitor the main crossing point between Egypt and the Gaza strip, which thousands of Gazans surged across last week.
The UN Security Council extended the mandate of the UN peacekeeping force (now 15,000-strong) in Liberia by six months, though the UN's secretary-general, Kofi Annan, had asked for a one-year renewal. The first general election since a 14-year-long civil war ended in 2003 is due next month.
Separatists in Nigeria's oil-rich Niger Delta region threatened to attack oil installations unless their leader, Mujahid Dokubu-Asari, who was arrested this week, is freed. 
After a row over who should control the oil ministry, Sudan's president, Omar Bashir, announced a unity government with former rebels from the south as part of a peace accord reached earlier this year. Northerners are to keep control of the defence, interior and finance ministries; the ruling National Congress Party has 16 of 29 posts, while the main southern group is to have nine.
Tricky times for Lula
More trouble for Brazil's president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. In elections in his Workers' Party, whose leaders have been embroiled in a corruption scandal, his candidate for party president failed to secure an outright victory, and faces a run-off against a candidate from the party's left. Meanwhile, the conservative president of Congress's lower house resigned over an unrelated bribery scam.
The United States ""decertified"" Venezuela, saying that its leftist government had failed to fight drugs. George Bush's administration said it would still finance opposition activity in the country, such as election monitoring. Meanwhile, Venezuela's president, Hugo Chavez, said he was cancelling all mining permits and would award no new ones to foreign companies.
Mexico's public-security minister was killed when his helicopter crashed into a mountain in fog. The minister was a close aide to President Vicente Fox and a key figure in the government's campaign against violent drug gangs. 
Nuclear confusion
Six-country talks aimed at ending the crisis caused by North Korea's efforts to acquire nuclear weapons seemed to make a breakthrough. But within a day it became clear that serious issues, including North Korea's demand for a nuclear power station, remained unresolved.
Japan's main opposition party, the Democratic Party of Japan, chose a youthful foreign-policy expert, Seiji Maehara, as its new leader, following the party's disastrous defeat in an election this month.
New Zealand's Labour prime minister, Helen Clark, hoped to retain power after early results gave her victory in an election this month. But she will need the support of smaller parties.

THE polls had predicted a close race, but when New Zealanders learned the preliminary results of their election on September 17th, they were still surprised. The two biggest parties were so evenly matched that the absentee ballots might yet change the outcome. The Labour Party, which headed the outgoing coalition government, pipped its chief rival, the National Party, by fewer than 23,000 votes--with some 218,000 left to count.
The final results will not be known until October 1st, leaving the country in political limbo for two weeks. Labour's current tally would give it 50 of 122 seats in parliament, one ahead of National (see chart on next page). But it also has more potential coalition partners, since the Green and Maori parties are unlikely to throw in their lot with National, while two centrist parties, New Zealand First and United Future, are sticking to their campaign pledge to negotiate first with whichever party turns out to have topped the poll.
Helen Clark, the Labour leader and prime minister of six years, has already begun discussions on forming a government, the electoral impasse notwithstanding. National, led by Don Brash, is hoping that the outstanding ballots might help it draw level with Labour, or pitch the Greens below the 5% threshold required to enter parliament. Thanks to the complicated electoral system, that might even reduce parliament to 121 members, and so decrease the number of seats needed to form a majority. But in the past, smaller parties have tended to benefit from the so-called ""special"" (mostly absentee) votes more than Labour or National. If anything, the Greens' showing is likely to improve, making things easier for Miss Clark.
Unless the results change dramatically, Mr Brash needs to cut a deal with the Maori Party to have a chance of forming a government--an unlikely prospect, given that National's campaign centred on an attack on special privileges for Maoris. Nonetheless, Mr Brash can claim credit for reversing National's fortunes. Under his leadership, the party has almost doubled its share of the vote. Labour, by contrast, has managed to lose two seats since the last election.
Moreover, National's policies, on Maoris and tax cuts, dominated the campaign. Faced with a surge in National's poll ratings, Labour was forced to offer (smaller) tax cuts of its own, and to sound a harsher note on the status of Maoris. National's strong showing came at the expense of smaller parties, whose vote-share halved. Indeed, some analysts are interpreting the results as proof that New Zealanders have finally got the hang of their proportional electoral system, which was first introduced three elections ago, in 1996.
In the past, they have flirted with all manner of small parties, leaving parliament a patchwork. That, in turn, has allowed the smaller parties to demand a disproportionate influence over policy, and to destabilise governments that refuse. This time, there should be less risk of the tail wagging the dog. Miss Clark has already indicated that she would prefer to lead a minority government, as she has for the past three years, with different parties providing support on different issues.
That would mean continued fiscal prudence, a new push for a free-trade agreement with China, and a doggedly independent foreign policy that will cause occasional friction with Australia and America. But as Mr Brash keeps pointing out, Labour must settle a few matters before it can get down to the business of running the county--including the question of whether it actually won the election.","New Zealand 's opposition narrowly fails to dislodge the prime minister

A referendum on a new constitution for Iraq probably passed, though final results were expected later in the week. The Kurds and Shia Arabs voted massively for it; the Sunni Arabs voted against, but seemed unlikely to get the necessary two-thirds of voters in at least three of Iraq's 18 provinces to say no, which would have nullified the document. A new parliament due to be elected in December should give the Sunnis a bigger voice, but it remains moot whether that will dampen the insurgency, which is still fierce in the Sunni areas.
The trial of Iraq's former president, Saddam Hussein, began with his refusal to confirm his identity or acknowledge the court's legality, though he nonetheless pleaded not guilty to the charge of murdering 148 Shia men in a village in 1982. The case was adjourned until November 28th.
After the first round of Liberia's presidential election, a former football star, George Weah, was ahead of a former finance minister, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf; a run-off is due on November 8th.
A former president, Milton Obote, who led Uganda to independence from Britain, was given a state funeral in the capital, Kampala--to the surprise of many Ugandans, since he had been deposed and forced into exile by the current president, Yoweri Museveni, 20 years ago.
The International Criminal Court at The Hague issued its first arrest warrants--for a Ugandan, Joseph Kony, and four associates. Their Lord's Resistance Army has committed many atrocities during a 19-year-long rebellion.
The only show in town
America's Senate Judiciary Committee set a date of November 7th to begin confirmation hearings on Harriet Miers's nomination to the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, politicians and pundits pored over documents, which Ms Miers submitted ahead of the hearings, to try to establish her position on abortion. 
The United States Treasury said the country's budget deficit for the 2005 fiscal year, which ended on September 30th, was $319 billion. The vastly improved figure (a deficit of $427 billion was forecast in February) was explained by a rise in government revenues, though there were warnings about the imminent costs of the recent hurricanes. 
The murder rate in the United States is at its lowest level in 40 years. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, in its annual report of crime statistics based on police reports, said there were 16,137 murders in 2004, a rate of 5.5 per 100,000 people. 
Yet another pounding
Hurricane Wilma dumped rain on the Caribbean and prompted the evacuation of tens of thousands of people as it headed towards Mexico's Yucatan peninsula and western Cuba. At least 11 people were killed in Haiti and one in Jamaica by floods associated with the storm. 
Brazil's government stepped up efforts to help people affected by the worst drought in the Amazon basin in half a century. Low river levels have cut off many towns that depend on boats for supplies. Greens blame the drought on deforestation; government meteorologists link it to unusually high temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean, which have prompted this year's devastating hurricanes.
Colombia's Constitutional Court upheld a law allowing presidential re-election, opening the way for Alvaro Uribe, the president, to stand for a second term next year. But Mr Uribe must await a second court ruling on a law regulating campaigns by incumbents. 
Lucio Gutierrez, who was ousted as Ecuador's president in April, renounced political asylum in Colombia and returned home to try to reclaim power. He was jailed. 
In Argentina, 32 prisoners were killed after inmates set fire to mattresses in a protest over visiting hours.

The European Union said it was strengthening its protective measures against bird flu, and urged member states to ""step up their efforts"". After cases were confirmed in Romania and Turkey, Greece became the latest country (and the first in the EU) to detect the virus. 
Relations between Russia and NATO member Norway were strained by a naval incident. Norway's navy gave chase after a Russian trawler, boarded by two Norwegian inspectors on suspicion of illegal fishing, changed course and sped home. Russia promised to hand the inspectors back. 
In the oil-rich Caspian state of Azerbaijan, the sacking of the economy minister, Farhad Aliyev, signalled a split in the ruling elite ahead of next month's elections. Scores of supporters of the exiled opposition leader, Rasul Guliyev, were arrested by police trying to thwart a demonstration.

 A referendum on a new constitution for Iraq probably passed , though final results were expected later in the week . The Kurds and Shia Arabs voted massively for it ; the Sunni Arabs voted against , but seemed unlikely to get the necessary two - thirds of voters in at least three of Iraq 's 18 provinces to say no , which would have nullified the document . A new parliament due to be elected in December should give the Sunnis a bigger voice , but it remains moot whether that will dampen the insurgency , which is still fierce in the Sunni areas . 
 The trial of Iraq 's former president , Saddam Hussein , began with his refusal to confirm his identity or acknowledge the court 's legality , though he nonetheless pleaded not guilty to the charge of murdering 148 Shia men in a village in 1982 . The case was adjourned until November 28th . 
 After the first round of Liberia 's presidential election , a former football star , George Weah , was ahead of a former finance minister , Ellen Johnson - Sirleaf ; a run - off is due on November 8th . 
 A former president , Milton Obote , who led Uganda to independence from Britain , was given a state funeral in the capital , Kampala -- to the surprise of many Ugandans , since he had been deposed and forced into exile by the current president , Yoweri Museveni , 20 years ago . 
 The International Criminal Court at The Hague issued its first arrest warrants -- for a Ugandan , Joseph Kony , and four associates . Their Lord 's Resistance Army has committed many atrocities during a 19 - year - long rebellion . 
 The only show in town 
 America 's Senate Judiciary Committee set a date of November 7th to begin confirmation hearings on Harriet Miers 's nomination to the Supreme Court . Meanwhile , politicians and pundits pored over documents , which Ms Miers submitted ahead of the hearings , to try to establish her position on abortion . 
 The United States Treasury said the country 's budget deficit for the 2005 fiscal year , which ended on September 30th , was $ 319 billion . The vastly improved figure ( a deficit of $ 427 billion was forecast in February ) was explained by a rise in government revenues , though there were warnings about the imminent costs of the recent hurricanes . 
 The murder rate in the United States is at its lowest level in 40 years . The Federal Bureau of Investigation , in its annual report of crime statistics based on police reports , said there were 16,137 murders in 2004 , a rate of 5.5 per 100,000 people .

 Hurricane Wilma dumped rain on the Caribbean and prompted the evacuation of tens of thousands of people as it headed towards Mexico 's Yucatan peninsula and western Cuba . At least 11 people were killed in Haiti and one in Jamaica by floods associated with the storm . 
 Brazil 's government stepped up efforts to help people affected by the worst drought in the Amazon basin in half a century .

IS IT possible for a party to join a government and stay in the opposition at the same time? Helen Clark, who was sworn in for a third three-year term as New Zealand's prime minister on October 19th, obviously thinks so. Her minority coalition, of Labour and the one-man Progressive Party, commands only 51 votes in the 121-seat parliament. To give herself a working majority, she has entered into peculiar agreements with two smaller parties. Their leaders will be ministers, but not members of the cabinet. In theory, that will give them a stake in the government's survival, while leaving them free to criticise its performance.
Forming a government in New Zealand is no mean feat. The proportional-election system in place since 1996 has never delivered an outright victory to either main party, Labour or National. But smaller parties are often reluctant to join coalitions, for fear of denting their following at the next election. If they meekly toe the government line, voters tend to forget them. But if they kick and scream to get their policies adopted, voters punish them for pushiness.
In the 1990s, New Zealand First, one of the two parties not quite in the new government, joined National in an unhappy coalition. Their constant squabbling made not just for an unstable regime, but also for a poor electoral showing in 1999. So when Miss Clark formed the next government, she agreed a mechanism whereby Labour and its coalition partners could ""agree to disagree"" on certain issues. Three years later, she went further, settling for a minority government that smaller parties agreed to prop up from the outside on critical votes in exchange for certain policy concessions.
The latest arrangement is yet another variation on the same theme. Winston Peters, the leader of New Zealand First, will be foreign minister--probably the only one ever anywhere from outside cabinet, while Peter Dunne, of the centrist United Future, will be revenue minister. Their parties will have to vote with the government on matters related to their portfolios, and on motions of confidence, but will be free to rubbish it otherwise. Meanwhile, the Green Party has agreed to abstain on confidence votes, in exchange for being put in charge of two cherished schemes.
As muddled as this set-up sounds, it might prove durable, precisely because it assumes there will be disagreements and makes allowance for them. That does not mean that voters will like it.","Helen Clark's creative government - making

THEIR country, Canadians sometimes say, is 5,500 miles long and one inch thick--by which they mean that most Canadians live in a scattered archipelago of cities huddled along the 49th parallel, the border with the United States. Having a friendly superpower on your doorstep confers great advantages. Uncle Sam can be relied upon to defend the whole of North America. He also has a handy habit of buying your stuff: at least 70% or so of Canada's exports go to its voracious neighbour. So why do so many Canadians believe that the United States is ""Too Close for Comfort"", in the title of a recent book by Maude Barlow, head of the Council of Canadians and a fervent critic of both globalisation and George Bush?
Canadians, you might say, are the original anti-Americans, the people who rejected the American revolution, stayed loyal to Britain and inherited what Desmond Morton, a Canadian historian, has called ""the cold, unprofitable remains of the continent"". But the chief cause of the friction is simply the great disparity between the neighbours. The United States has 300m people and a GDP of $12 trillion; Canada has 32m people and a GDP of $1 trillion. California alone is richer and more populous than Canada. As a sovereign country, however, Canada insists on being treated as America's equal. Such a relationship is bound to be fraught.
Counter-intuitively, relations have become harder to handle the more intimate they have become. Since NAFTA, the volume of cross-border trade has trebled. Nearly $700 billion-worth of goods and services cross the border every year, making it the world's largest bilateral trading relationship. But if you trade across an open border with a country that has ten times as many people, and if those people speak the same language, the fear of cultural and economic absorption grows intense. All Canadian governments have worked to strengthen the east-west muscles of federation, the better to counteract the north-south pull of the superpower. 
When Paul Martin became Canada's prime minister in 2003, he was expected to rescue relations with the United States from the rough patch they had passed through under his predecessor. Jean Chretien had decided that in the absence of authorisation from the UN Security Council, Canada would not fight in Iraq (though it did help America in Afghanistan, and continues to do so). Mr Chretien's decision was wildly popular at home, and nobody expected Mr Martin to change it, but he was expected to smooth things over. And he certainly had a good reason to try. 
The reason is terrorism. In 1999, a terrorist with a fake Canadian passport was caught trying to enter the United States with a car full of explosives, en route to blow up Los Angeles airport. After September 11th 2001 the Americans virtually stopped traffic across the border, for fear that this might be a way in for terrorists. To some thoughtful Canadians, this closure, though brief, was traumatic. The bulk of Canada's manufacturing output is traded, not consumed domestically, and the bulk of it heads south. The just-in-time factories of Ontario and Quebec are joined at the hip with their American suppliers and markets. If September 11th has meant that security now trumps trade, the possibility of some combination of events closing the border, with devastating consequences for Canada, can no longer be discounted.
One person especially alarmed by all this was Thomas d'Aquino, head of the Canadian Council of Chief Executives, the club of big business. For him, September 11th was the second time round. In the 1980s he feared that low productivity in the United States, coupled with the import threat from Japan, might make the Americans pull up the drawbridge, leaving Canada in the cold. Now America faces another economic challenge, from China and India, as well as the threat of jihadist terrorism. As Mr d'Aquino and his camp see it, Canada has a vital interest in making sure that it continues to have access to the United States whatever happens. The economic integration of the two countries needs to be made irreversible, he says, and their security indivisible. But how? 
Greater America
Canadians are divided. One school favours a ""grand bargain"" with America. The chief component of this would be a common security perimeter. If the neighbours operated the same controls on their external borders, the ""internal"" border would dwindle in significance. Together with Mexico, Canada and America might also harmonise more of their safety, health and environmental regulation. Some Canadians go further: why not aim for an integrated labour market, or even a single currency? In March, a task-force of Canadians, Mexicans and Americans, set up by the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, proposed establishing a North American economic and security community by 2010, defined by a common external tariff and an outer security perimeter. 
The trouble with a grand bargain is that, even if America could be persuaded to go along, it is anathema to many Canadians. In their task-force report, the advocates of a North American economic and security community argued that the separate approaches to regulation in Canada, Mexico and the United States often boiled down to a ""tyranny of small differences"", imposing unnecessary economic costs. But for many Canadians, these small differences are a vital bulwark in the unending struggle to fend off absorption by the superpower. 
In the view of those for whom America will probably always be too close for comfort, NAFTA has already narrowed Canada's choices in social and energy policy. Harmonised regulation would make matters worse. Free trade with America, say the naysayers, has whittled away welfare protection and increased income inequalities, sacrificing the Canadian social model on the altar of ""competitiveness"". 
Nor is it just opponents of globalisation who are queasy. Roy MacLaren, a former trade minister, says that as America's economy is much bigger than Canada's and Mexico's combined, harmonising trade, security or defence practices would in the end require Canada and Mexico to adopt American standards. Opponents of the grand bargain think it better to shore up a rules-based trading system within the World Trade Organisation than to make an unequal deal with the United States.
For Mr Martin, as for any prime minister of Canada, threading a passage between dependence on the superpower on the one hand and Canadians' widespread suspicion of their neighbour on the other was always going to be difficult. This is a weather system that never goes away. Mr Martin has set up a cabinet committee to deal with the problem. But the clouds have, if anything, darkened on his watch. 
Canadians blame Mr Bush. Much of the sympathy they felt for America after September 11th has been cancelled out by what they see as a warmongering foreign policy pursued by a president who ignores the rules and takes dictation from God. Apart from being immensely popular, Mr Chretien's decision to stay out of Iraq crystallised these feelings and so reduced Mr Martin's room for manoeuvre. Then bad luck reduced it even more. Last August, NAFTA arbitrators looking into an interminable trade dispute between Canada and the United States on softwood lumber ruled in Canada's favour. The bad luck for Mr Martin was that the Americans paid almost no attention.
The gist of this arcane dispute is as follows. The Americans accuse the Canadians of charging low stumpage fees to forestry companies that use crown lands. This, they say, enables Canadian exporters to sell lumber at below-market prices. The arbitrators, finding that Canadian lumber exports had not injured American producers, instructed the United States to drop import duties it started to impose three years ago, and to return those it had already collected. But most Americans hardly noticed this ruling, and the Bush administration, under pressure from its own lumber lobby, did nothing to implement it. 
America's insouciance has caused apoplexy north of the border. ""Unacceptable,"" thundered Mr Martin. A union leader said Ottawa should ""turn the taps off on oil and gas exports"". Thomas Axworthy, a former aide to Trudeau, caught the mood in a newspaper article asking whether America's signature on a treaty meant anything at all. He went on to propose ferocious retaliation: reviewing any American takeovers of Canadian energy companies, stopping work on the Alaska gas pipeline and making exploitation of the oil sands conditional on America ending its ""harassment"". When Condoleezza Rice, America's secretary of state, on a visit to Ottawa in October insisted that America's record on honouring treaties was ""as good as gold"", Canadians reacted with scorn.
In his interview with The Economist, Mr Martin's own anger was palpable. Though ruling out the use of oil as a lever, he called America's decision to ignore a ruling by NAFTA's highest dispute-settlement body a violation of both the spirit and the letter of the accord, and he gave warning that America's behaviour would affect other decisions Canada might take. Canadians had talked about alternatives for a long time, he said, and the rise of China and India was now providing them. ""We shouldn't kid ourselves,"" he added. ""The American market is always going to be our most important market. But there certainly are other options.""
Does Canada really have a ""China card"" to play against the United States? Probably not. When President Hu visited Ottawa in September, Mr Martin pressed the Chinese to buy more Canadian softwood lumber. In principle, Mr Hu also favours more trade. But the plain fact is that the United States, connected to its neighbour by language, custom and business practice as well as geography, is always likely to be Canada's biggest market. To put matters in perspective, note that the value of the softwood lumber British Columbia sells to China is only 1% of what it sells to the United States.
The anger of Canadians is understandable: the whole point of NAFTA, as sold to them, was that it would set out binding rules for trade disputes. Yet it is troubling that a single dispute should enrage them quite so much. The economic consequences of the argument are minor. Despite the contested duties imposed by the United States, Canadian lumber has 34% of the American market, and lumber anyway represents less than 3% of Canada's total exports. 
But, as with a quarrel over cattle, when American ranchers used the discovery of a single case of BSE in a Canadian herd as a reason to suspend trade, Canadians are exquisitely sensitive to any behaviour that smacks of bullying, high-handedness or being taken for granted by the superpower. When Canadians at large feel this way about the United States, a prime minister ignores public opinion at his peril. 
That may be why, last February, Mr Martin felt he had to tell the United States that Canada would not help to develop its anti-ballistic missile defence system. Again, the practical implications of the decision may be slight. For the moment, a workable system of this sort is not much more than a gleam in the Pentagon's eye, and Canada is continuing to co-operate with NORAD, the North American Aerospace Defence Command. But the manner of the decision--a last-minute announcement at a time when Mr Martin was being criticised at home for general indecision--surprised and upset the Americans. 
Just business as usual?
Is the present scratchiness (see chart 4) just one more down in a history of ups and downs? Canadians are not the only people who have found Mr Bush's America an uncomfortable partner. But there is more to it than the usual gaffes and spats over trade and diplomacy. To find a similar depth of anti-American sentiment, says Michael Adams, president of Environics, a market-research group in Toronto, you would have to go back to the federal election of 1911, when Wilfrid Laurier's espousal of trade reciprocity with the United States cost him re-election. A case can be made that the values of the two countries are drifting inexorably apart.
By and large, Canadians appear to be becoming more liberal and secular at a time when Americans are becoming more conservative and religious. Canadians may decriminalise the use of marijuana and have sanctioned gay marriage. They abhor the death penalty and have invested in a generous welfare state and a system of socialised medicine for all. Foreign-policy differences also run deep. Canada is an enthusiastic proponent of multilateralism, at a time when America has found it convenient to bypass the United Nations. Canada was an architect of the International Criminal Court, which the United States works hard to obstruct, and a ban on landmines, which the Americans oppose. 
Whether these signs of estrangement are a passing phenomenon is hard to say. Railing against America's ""cavalier and imperial"" attitudes, Lloyd Axworthy, a former foreign minister, argues that the shift of political power to the south and west of the United States brings ""less understanding or interest in our country"". Joe Clark, a former Conservative prime minister, worries about generational change. The leaders of Canada and America are no longer tied by the common experience of the second world war, and the failure of Canada to fight in Vietnam or Iraq means that a network of personal connections has fallen apart. Indeed, the main thing Americans notice about Canadian foreign policy is its habit of denouncing the warlike things America gets up to in the world--while spending rather little on its own defence.
Demography is also distancing the neighbours. Both are lands of immigration--in 2001 about 11% of Americans and 18% of Canadians were foreign-born--but whereas Canada is importing skilled Asians, the United States is importing unskilled Latin Americans.
Even if the values of the two countries continue to drift apart, geography dictates that they must co-operate. Canada will continue to have an overriding interest in good relations. America will have a growing interest in Canadian energy--and possibly also its plentiful fresh water (with lots of scope for future arguments), to replenish America's parched south-west. 
In March, when Mr Martin met Mr Bush and Vicente Fox, the president of Mexico, in Waco, Texas, the three leaders inaugurated a ""Security and Prosperity Partnership"", or SPP. This looks far less ambitious than the North American economic and security community proposed by New York's Council on Foreign Relations. Canadian opinion, it seems, is not yet ready for a common security perimeter or customs union. The SPP is little more than a forum for officials from the three countries to discuss a range of technocratic subjects, such as border security and health co-operation.
However, small agreements can blossom into something much bigger: remember the European Coal and Steel Community, which gradually metamorphosed into the European Union. Mr d'Aquino and his business lobby hope for a similar evolution. From the integrators' perspective, one advantage of the SPP is the absence of any ""big bang"": the officials can operate below the political radar, without involving the American or Mexican Congress or Canada's Parliament. Nonetheless, says Mr d'Aquino, ""by 2010 the North America we know will have changed completely."" For precisely that reason, of course, many other Canadians are on guard against what they call ""integration by stealth"". As in relations with Alberta and Quebec, navigating through the shoals will require political skills of the highest order. Does Mr Martin's government have them?

Thomas Axworthy, a former aide to Trudeau, caught the mood in a newspaper article asking whether America's signature on a treaty meant anything at all. He went on to propose ferocious retaliation: reviewing any American takeovers of Canadian energy companies, stopping work on the Alaska gas pipeline and making exploitation of the oil sands conditional on America ending its ""harassment"". When Condoleezza Rice, America's secretary of state, on a visit to Ottawa in October insisted that America's record on honouring treaties was ""as good as gold"", Canadians reacted with scorn.
In his interview with The Economist, Mr Martin's own anger was palpable. Though ruling out the use of oil as a lever, he called America's decision to ignore a ruling by NAFTA's highest dispute-settlement body a violation of both the spirit and the letter of the accord, and he gave warning that America's behaviour would affect other decisions Canada might take. Canadians had talked about alternatives for a long time, he said, and the rise of China and India was now providing them. ""We shouldn't kid ourselves,"" he added. ""The American market is always going to be our most important market. But there certainly are other options.""
Does Canada really have a ""China card"" to play against the United States? Probably not. When President Hu visited Ottawa in September, Mr Martin pressed the Chinese to buy more Canadian softwood lumber. In principle, Mr Hu also favours more trade. But the plain fact is that the United States, connected to its neighbour by language, custom and business practice as well as geography, is always likely to be Canada's biggest market. To put matters in perspective, note that the value of the softwood lumber British Columbia sells to China is only 1% of what it sells to the United States.
The anger of Canadians is understandable: the whole point of NAFTA, as sold to them, was that it would set out binding rules for trade disputes. Yet it is troubling that a single dispute should enrage them quite so much. The economic consequences of the argument are minor. Despite the contested duties imposed by the United States, Canadian lumber has 34% of the American market, and lumber anyway represents less than 3% of Canada's total exports. 
But, as with a quarrel over cattle, when American ranchers used the discovery of a single case of BSE in a Canadian herd as a reason to suspend trade, Canadians are exquisitely sensitive to any behaviour that smacks of bullying, high-handedness or being taken for granted by the superpower. When Canadians at large feel this way about the United States, a prime minister ignores public opinion at his peril. 
That may be why, last February, Mr Martin felt he had to tell the United States that Canada would not help to develop its anti-ballistic missile defence system. Again, the practical implications of the decision may be slight. For the moment, a workable system of this sort is not much more than a gleam in the Pentagon's eye, and Canada is continuing to co-operate with NORAD, the North American Aerospace Defence Command. But the manner of the decision--a last-minute announcement at a time when Mr Martin was being criticised at home for general indecision--surprised and upset the Americans. 
Just business as usual?
Is the present scratchiness (see chart 4) just one more down in a history of ups and downs? Canadians are not the only people who have found Mr Bush's America an uncomfortable partner. But there is more to it than the usual gaffes and spats over trade and diplomacy. To find a similar depth of anti-American sentiment, says Michael Adams, president of Environics, a market-research group in Toronto, you would have to go back to the federal election of 1911, when Wilfrid Laurier's espousal of trade reciprocity with the United States cost him re-election. A case can be made that the values of the two countries are drifting inexorably apart.
By and large, Canadians appear to be becoming more liberal and secular at a time when Americans are becoming more conservative and religious. Canadians may decriminalise the use of marijuana and have sanctioned gay marriage. They abhor the death penalty and have invested in a generous welfare state and a system of socialised medicine for all. Foreign-policy differences also run deep. Canada is an enthusiastic proponent of multilateralism, at a time when America has found it convenient to bypass the United Nations. Canada was an architect of the International Criminal Court, which the United States works hard to obstruct, and a ban on landmines, which the Americans oppose. 
Whether these signs of estrangement are a passing phenomenon is hard to say. Railing against America's ""cavalier and imperial"" attitudes, Lloyd Axworthy, a former foreign minister, argues that the shift of political power to the south and west of the United States brings ""less understanding or interest in our country"". Joe Clark, a former Conservative prime minister, worries about generational change. The leaders of Canada and America are no longer tied by the common experience of the second world war, and the failure of Canada to fight in Vietnam or Iraq means that a network of personal connections has fallen apart. Indeed, the main thing Americans notice about Canadian foreign policy is its habit of denouncing the warlike things America gets up to in the world--while spending rather little on its own defence.
Demography is also distancing the neighbours. Both are lands of immigration--in 2001 about 11% of Americans and 18% of Canadians were foreign-born--but whereas Canada is importing skilled Asians, the United States is importing unskilled Latin Americans.
Even if the values of the two countries continue to drift apart, geography dictates that they must co-operate. Canada will continue to have an overriding interest in good relations. America will have a growing interest in Canadian energy--and possibly also its plentiful fresh water (with lots of scope for future arguments), to replenish America's parched south-west. 
In March, when Mr Martin met Mr Bush and Vicente Fox, the president of Mexico, in Waco, Texas, the three leaders inaugurated a ""Security and Prosperity Partnership"", or SPP. This looks far less ambitious than the North American economic and security community proposed by New York's Council on Foreign Relations. Canadian opinion, it seems, is not yet ready for a common security perimeter or customs union. The SPP is little more than a forum for officials from the three countries to discuss a range of technocratic subjects, such as border security and health co-operation.
However, small agreements can blossom into something much bigger: remember the European Coal and Steel Community, which gradually metamorphosed into the European Union. Mr d'Aquino and his business lobby hope for a similar evolution. From the integrators' perspective, one advantage of the SPP is the absence of any ""big bang"": the officials can operate below the political radar, without involving the American or Mexican Congress or Canada's Parliament. Nonetheless, says Mr d'Aquino, ""by 2010 the North America we know will have changed completely."" For precisely that reason, of course, many other Canadians are on guard against what they call ""integration by stealth"". As in relations with Alberta and Quebec, navigating through the shoals will require political skills of the highest order. Does Mr Martin's government have them?

""ONE vision, one identity, one community"" was the wishful official slogan of a diplomatic extravaganza in Malaysia this week, bringing together the leaders of nations with half of the world's population. The first East Asia Summit was an ambitious attempt to create a common purpose among 16 countries ranging from impoverished despotisms to advanced democracies. But with two of the most powerful governments, Japan and China, not even on talking terms, the prospects were always going to be dim.
The East Asia Summit is intended to become an annual event, held in tandem with leadership meetings of the ten-member Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and ASEAN+3, which also includes China, Japan and South Korea. But even its geographically inappropriate name reflects how little agreement there is about what this new group should be. The summit includes the ASEAN+3 countries, as well as three from outside the region: India, Australia and New Zealand. China had wanted something more strictly East Asian, while others, notably Japan, wanted the inclusion of countries that could dilute China's influence. The latter camp won, so the probability now is that China will quietly ignore the new forum, and concentrate its diplomatic energies on the more exclusive ASEAN+3 instead.
Besides, what was this unwieldy grouping supposed to achieve? Some speak of building a giant free-trade area, and even of promoting common values. But achieving consensus among such vastly different economies, cultures and political systems would be more arduous than anything encountered in regional community building elsewhere. 
The 16 countries said that they would talk about ""broad, strategic, political and economic issues of common interest"". But they agreed that ASEAN would be the ""driving force"" behind the new forum and that ASEAN+3 would continue to play a ""significant role"". With ASEAN (which as a block is on good terms with China) as the hub of Asian summitry, China will have less to fear from the parallel development of a wider grouping including more of America's friends. 
Chu Shulong of Tsinghua University in Beijing says that Chinese leaders now regard ASEAN+3 as the region's most important multilateral forum and downplay the new group's importance. The focus of China's efforts will remain establishing its own free-trade area with ASEAN. It is worth noting, though, that none of these configurations work particularly well: ASEAN's internal free-trade plans are lagging, and a plan to sign a deal with South Korea at the summit foundered over rice.
The wording of the summit's final declaration was an attempt to keep all sides happy by avoiding anything specific. It made no mention of establishing an East Asia community, or working towards a free-trade area. Nor did it specify the geographical boundaries of the grouping. Russia says it wants to take part in the next summit, to be held in the Philippines next December. But America is not angling for an invitation just yet. It is probably not yet sure whether it is worth being invited. 
Overshadowing the summit were sharp disagreements between Japan and South Korea and China over a visit in October by Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, to the Yasukuni Shrine, where Japan's war dead, including war criminals, are honoured. Normally, China, Japan and South Korea would hold a separate summit on the sidelines of the ASEAN talks. This time, because of China's ire, they held no meeting, though the prime ministers of China and Japan managed a chilly handshake at the end of the gathering.
In public, optimism abounded. The East Asia Summit ""takes us on light years from where we've been,"" said Helen Clark, New Zealand's prime minister. ""It's important for political and security dialogue. It's important for understandings across civilisations."" But with a lukewarm China, those hoping for a European Union in the east will be disappointed.","A grand summit is a damp squib

GOD must have been working to a budget when He came to make Zambia for, after the spectacular creation of the Victoria Falls and a few lesser bursts of exuberance, it was nearly all monotonous bush for the rest of the country, and by the time He got to Lundazi the cash was clearly at an end. Lundazi is an unremarkable place, way out east on the Malawi border, and on the road to nowhere much. The only town--township, technically--in an area the size of Ohio, it has just one building of note, a hotel built in imitation of a small Norman castle by a district commissioner in the late 1940s, when the country was run by the British. The Castle is a charming curiosity, but from its battlements the horizons hold none of the views for which Africa is famous. For the most part, Lundazi is quiet, mildly decrepit and, in the dry season at least, always dusty. Yet, for all that, it is unpretentiously welcoming, and its people are delightful.
So it certainly seemed in 1965, when I went there first, as a British 18-year-old filling the gap between school and university, and so it seemed again when I revisited it a few months ago for the first time in 40 years. In 1965 Zambia, hitherto called Northern Rhodesia, was enjoying its first year of independence from Britain. The hated federation with Southern Rhodesia and Nyasaland had been dissolved at the end of 1963, and Ian Smith's Southern Rhodesia had not yet made its unilateral declaration of independence, which, when it came (in November 1965), was to bring turmoil to the entire region. Zambia, with huge reserves of copper, was potentially rich. It was led by a man of some decency, Kenneth Kaunda, and, all in all, there was a sense of hope. I shared it.
The next decades, though, were not good for Africa. Political instability, economic stagnation, corruption and civil breakdown overtook many of its countries, and Zambia had its share of setbacks. Yet it suffered no military coup (overlooking a little incident in 1997), no civil war and certainly no genocide. To people outside its borders, its travails were portrayed more in the statistics of international reports than in images on the evening news. So how had things changed in out-of-the-way Lundazi?
Not much, to judge by the state of the road I was again travelling, 40 years on. The road is important to Lundazi. There is only one of significance, which runs the 186km (116 miles) from Chipata, which was called Fort Jameson--or, more familiarly, Fort Jim--until 1969. Chipata is the capital of the Eastern province, and pretty much the end-point of the Great East Road from the capital, Lusaka, so virtually everyone going to or from Lundazi uses the road from Chipata. In 1965 it was an unpaved artery, alternately hard and corrugated, then soft and sandy, always dusty and often, when unmarked bends or unseen chasms suddenly appeared, rather dangerous. That was in the dry season. In the rainy season it could be so muddy as to be impassable. Wet or dry, there would be monkeys in the trees, nightjars in the headlights and silent figures walking, running or mounted--often two at a time--on unlit bicycles. Sometimes, too, there would be huge trucks, throwing up clouds of dust and threatening to send any would-be overtaker hurtling into the bush.
The road has since been tarred, and a 4X4 can now bowl along the first 130km of the approach to Lundazi at some speed. But then, at Kazonde, the tar stops and thereafter, despite the patching and grading in progress, all vehicles must slow to little more than walking pace to navigate the slopes, trenches and pot-holes of the remaining 50km. Repairs had been started before but the contractors stopped work when they were not paid, and in 2004 locals removed many of the new metal culverts in order to fashion tools from them. The people here are so poor that all road signs--there are not many--are deliberately perforated, for otherwise they would soon be removed and turned into pots and pans.
Many sights along the road are unchanged after 40 years: the women carrying huge baskets on their heads, or bundles of logs, or drums of water; the broken-down lorries, one whose driver is asleep beneath the back axle, another whose sackclothed cargo has tumbled off and burst on the ground; the ox-carts, the bicycles, the wayside hawkers selling bananas, charcoal and sugarcane. But there are changes, too. For the first 60km going north, schools, brick houses and tin roofs suggest greater prosperity. The source of this seems to be a new diversification of crops. In the past, farming was almost entirely a subsistence affair with little grown except for maize, and the granaries visible from the road show that this remains the staple food. Now, though, there is evidence of cash crops: the tobacco sheds just outside Chipata and a store 115km beyond; two lorries laden with cotton; people selling sweet potatoes; patches of cassava under cultivation. And minds are evidently fed too. A sign at Lumezi points to a secondary school that was not there in 1965. More sinisterly, after 87km, an orphanage now stands by the road. This turns out to be a portent of one of the biggest changes since the 1960s.
Courage, Brother
Education had never been a priority for the authorities in Northern Rhodesia. The country had only three secondary schools for Africans in the mid-1950s, and two of those were run by churches. An expansion began in 1960, with talk of a secondary school for the capital of each of the seven rural provinces, but it was not until independence that one was opened in Lundazi. It was a simple affair: two classes to start with, all boys, four teachers (I was the fourth), few books and not much else. The dearth of equipment extended to hymn books, important as they were in a part of Africa which still showed the influence of David Livingstone and his Presbyterian beliefs. One or two hymns, however, had been cyclostyled, taught to the boys and committed to memory. ""Courage, Brother, do not stumble"" was particularly popular. Each day, morning assembly would start with the words, ""We will now sing our hymn."" A pause followed, just long enough to allow the possibility of suspense as to what the choice would be. Then, almost invariably, came, ""Let us sing 'Courage, brother',"" and the air swelled with a lowing of deep male voices.
The headmaster was Arthur Lewanika, a scion of the Lozi royal family whose kingdom, Barotseland, lay in western Zambia. He and his deputy, Roger Zulu, had been the only teaching staff until I and another recruit, Alfred Zaranyika, a Southern Rhodesian, arrived. Neither Alfred nor I had had any training as teachers, and I at least had no books for the lessons in French, maths and physics that I was supposed to give. It is difficult to believe that I taught anyone anything. Still, I had heard in Lusaka before returning to Lundazi that about ten of my former pupils had eventually graduated from university and some had become engineers (Alex Barton Manda), accountants (Major Mkandawire) or lawyers (Masuzu Zimba). At independence in 1964, the country had had fewer than 100 graduates.
The students, who came from far and wide within the surrounding area, were boarders, and so the school was always busy. But life in Lundazi, a town of perhaps 2,000-3,000 in those days, was quiet. In the evenings, the only noises apart from human voices were the hiss of the Tilley lamps that provided our light--no electricity then--and the calls of the hyenas that sometimes ate the Lewanikas' chickens and often came right up to the house that Alfred and I shared. The main amusements were provided by the trials of daily life: Alfred's mile-long sprint pursued by a swarm of bees; my old car catching alight as I drove past the market one day; Alfred's attempt to extend the life of his car battery by warming it up in the oven, an experiment that caused Arthur huge amusement when ""over-baking"" led to muffled explosions and quantities of boiling acid that seeped on to our kitchen floor.
It was almost impossible to get a car mended in Lundazi, or even to replace a battery. The shops were basic. Food could be bought in the market and sometimes people would come to the door offering a (live) chicken or some oranges. But Alfred was always scornful about the lack of choice: people were so much more enterprising, he said, in Southern Rhodesia (that was, of course, before Robert Mugabe had done his best to wreck the country). Anything even slightly sophisticated--oil lamps, blankets, cloth for chitenges, the nearly universal garment for women in those days--was available only from the shops owned by ""Asians"", notably Mulla Stores, founded by old Mr Mulla, who had made his way to Lundazi from Gujarat via Mozambique in the 1930s.
For a drink or a meal out, the place to go was the Castle, which was presided over by Lyn Jonquiere, the only other ""European"", as whites were then called, in Lundazi. The Castle was where visiting politicians, contractors and civil servants would stay. It was kept spick and span by Mrs Jonquiere. Of an evening, she could be found behind the bar, genially dispensing cold Castles (the hotel shared a name with a popular beer) or Portuguese wine brought in from Mozambique, Zambia's neighbour to the east, while Jim Reeves played on the gramophone. Thanks to its generator, the Castle had electricity. 
You do not need a generator today in Lundazi: electricity is (usually) available from the Malawian national grid across the border, and the Castle now has television. It does not, however, have running water--except through the roof in the rainy season. The building is in a sad state, though its new leaseholder, Chifumu Banda, promises improvements.
Mr Banda, a native of Lundazi who is now a prominent lawyer in Lusaka, had warned me that I would see that Lundazi was now ""worse off"". The school, though, is vastly improved. The four teachers and 70 or so students have become 43 teachers and 864 students, and they occupy a bigger site. Though no one remembers any of the original staff, Arthur's name is memorialised in the name of one of the four boarding houses. As for the students' names, neither their first nor their surnames seem to have changed much: there are Ndhlovus, Phiris, Nyirendas and Bandas galore, preceded perhaps by Best, Gift, Major, Mercy or Memory, even if, on this occasion, I meet no Time, Meat or Section Eight. 
The school has its own water (pumped from three boreholes), a fish pond, four plump pigs and several sheep and goats. It grows its own vegetables. But only rarely do the students eat meat, and the relentless diet of nshima--maize porridge--has apparently provoked protests in the not-too-distant past. Little money has been available for maintenance, but broken windows are being replaced, prefects now have ""executive neckties"", the library contains a modest variety of books and there are ten computers, though not, as yet, an internet connection. (High telecoms charges and an overburdened relay station still keep most of Lundazi offline, though mobile phones have just arrived.) Another sign of change is that, in place of the ""Procrastination is the thief of time"" written on the blackboard by Alfred in 1965, a notice on a door now reads, ""Don't trust corrupt politicians.""
The new plague
Basic tuition is provided free, but the fees for boarding and any extra lessons come to nearly $200 a year, and uniform costs almost another $40. For most families, that is a fortune: about 70% of Zambians live on less than $1 a day. But in the past a family that could muster enough to start sending a child to school would usually be able to see the endeavour through. Today that is often untrue, simply because so many families are falling apart. In the list of students, the letter S (for a ""single"" orphan, ie, a child who has lost one parent) or D (for a ""double"" orphan) occurs ever more often against the names as the classes grow older: 14 in Grade Nine, 60 in Grade Ten. The cause is AIDS. In total, over 120 of the 864 students have lost one or both parents to this latter-day plague.
Lundazi is far from insouciant about AIDS. The district has an AIDS co-ordinator, Christa Nyirenda, who struggles to carry out her work in the face of a constant lack of money. The churches also do their best. The Rev Frighted Mwanza's Presbyterian church, for example, is helping to look after several orphans and 55 others who are HIV-positive, some of them chronically ill. And along the road from the Castle, the Thandizani (meaning ""Let's help one another"") centre also offers advice, support and HIV testing. Set up in 1999 in a former cocktail bar, whose name is still clearly legible outside, it is considered a model non-governmental organisation, but it does not offer treatment. 
That is done at Lundazi district hospital, or rather it is meant to be done there. The difficulty is that the hospital is old (1950s vintage), has only two doctors (for all the 290,000 people in the district) and has to charge for the anti-retroviral drugs that can arrest the ravages of AIDS in infected people. The very poor, about 20% of those who receive these drugs, get them free; the others must pay about $10 a month. The result is that only 114 people are getting treatment out of more than 500 who are known to need it. In reality, hundreds, if not thousands, should be receiving drugs. That is evident both from the number of orphans in the school and from a sign not far from the hospital: ""Coffin Workshop"".
Fortunately, coffins are not the only source of new jobs in Lundazi. The second-hand clothes market that has sprung up is another. On a dusty patch of ground now stands rack upon rack of western clothes, made perhaps in China or other parts of Asia but already worn in Europe or America and then given away to charities to be sold, for very little, all over Africa, even in places like Lundazi. This phenomenon, known as salaula, explains why so few of the women along the road now wear chitenges, and also why a man on a bicycle too poor to have shoes may be wearing a formal dress shirt. The trade provides T-shirts and skirts and trousers for many who could not afford them in the past, and jobs for those who sell the clothes. But it has made it difficult for Zambian textile producers to compete; this is dumping in the true sense of the word.
More hopeful for Lundazi is the slow, belated improvement in agriculture. On the outskirts of town are some new tobacco sheds, built by Stancom, an American multinational. It provides loans to small farmers, trains them in agronomy and sells them seeds and fertiliser, as well as the saplings they must plant if they cut other trees down for fuel to flue-cure their crop. A Malawian company, Limbe Leaf, has also come to Lundazi, as have several cotton companies--Dunavant, an American firm, Clark Cotton, from South Africa, and Chipata Cotton, a Chinese joint-venture. Lundazi now accounts for about 12% of Zambia's cotton production, and there is talk of Dunavant building a ginnery.
For all these welcome developments, agriculture around Lundazi is woefully undeveloped. Many people have gone hungry in the past few months thanks to a poor harvest: instead of falling evenly through the 2004-05 growing season, the rains came all at once, mostly early on. Yet the land is good. It could provide much more food and cash crops too, perhaps two harvests a year, with proper irrigation. But only now are some of the dams of the colonial era being restored to use, after years of neglect and silting up.
Hope on hold
It is time to leave Lundazi. Outside Mulla Stores, which seems to have had not even a lick of paint in 40 years, a few people are chatting. One or two others are bicycling from the direction of the boma, the administrative centre. Here again not much has changed. The impression is reinforced on the journey back along the pot-holed road to Chipata, even after a brief stop to greet Father Morrison and the other Catholic Fathers at Lumezi mission. But then there are the signs, really quite a lot of them, to the schools: primary schools, ""basic"" schools (which give a couple of years of secondary education) and Lumezi's secondary school. That is encouraging. So is the farming. But every so often are reminders of a darker side of the new reality: branches, laid down on the road to indicate a funeral. Bicyclists are expected to dismount, and trucks and cars to slow down, out of respect. I assume, perhaps wrongly, that AIDS has claimed another vicitm.
I had been prepared for most of what I found in Lundazi: I knew that half a century ago Zambia and South Korea had had roughly the same income per person, and now Korea's was 32 times greater. So I was expecting the accumulated evidence of 40 years of needless poverty, misgovernment and dashed hopes. Many of those dashed hopes I shared. But my main regret was that, back in 1965, I had not been able, instead of French and physics, to teach Korean studies, even if I had had no books. Perhaps it is not too late for someone else. <p class=""unknown"" style=""SpecialSection"">Africa 40 years on

Zambia, with huge reserves of copper, was potentially rich. It was led by a man of some decency, Kenneth Kaunda, and, all in all, there was a sense of hope. I shared it.
The next decades, though, were not good for Africa. Political instability, economic stagnation, corruption and civil breakdown overtook many of its countries, and Zambia had its share of setbacks. Yet it suffered no military coup (overlooking a little incident in 1997), no civil war and certainly no genocide. To people outside its borders, its travails were portrayed more in the statistics of international reports than in images on the evening news. So how had things changed in out-of-the-way Lundazi?
Not much, to judge by the state of the road I was again travelling, 40 years on. The road is important to Lundazi. There is only one of significance, which runs the 186km (116 miles) from Chipata, which was called Fort Jameson--or, more familiarly, Fort Jim--until 1969. Chipata is the capital of the Eastern province, and pretty much the end-point of the Great East Road from the capital, Lusaka, so virtually everyone going to or from Lundazi uses the road from Chipata. In 1965 it was an unpaved artery, alternately hard and corrugated, then soft and sandy, always dusty and often, when unmarked bends or unseen chasms suddenly appeared, rather dangerous. That was in the dry season. In the rainy season it could be so muddy as to be impassable. Wet or dry, there would be monkeys in the trees, nightjars in the headlights and silent figures walking, running or mounted--often two at a time--on unlit bicycles. Sometimes, too, there would be huge trucks, throwing up clouds of dust and threatening to send any would-be overtaker hurtling into the bush.
The road has since been tarred, and a 4X4 can now bowl along the first 130km of the approach to Lundazi at some speed. But then, at Kazonde, the tar stops and thereafter, despite the patching and grading in progress, all vehicles must slow to little more than walking pace to navigate the slopes, trenches and pot-holes of the remaining 50km. Repairs had been started before but the contractors stopped work when they were not paid, and in 2004 locals removed many of the new metal culverts in order to fashion tools from them. The people here are so poor that all road signs--there are not many--are deliberately perforated, for otherwise they would soon be removed and turned into pots and pans.
Many sights along the road are unchanged after 40 years: the women carrying huge baskets on their heads, or bundles of logs, or drums of water; the broken-down lorries, one whose driver is asleep beneath the back axle, another whose sackclothed cargo has tumbled off and burst on the ground; the ox-carts, the bicycles, the wayside hawkers selling bananas, charcoal and sugarcane. But there are changes, too. For the first 60km going north, schools, brick houses and tin roofs suggest greater prosperity. The source of this seems to be a new diversification of crops. In the past, farming was almost entirely a subsistence affair with little grown except for maize, and the granaries visible from the road show that this remains the staple food. Now, though, there is evidence of cash crops: the tobacco sheds just outside Chipata and a store 115km beyond; two lorries laden with cotton; people selling sweet potatoes; patches of cassava under cultivation. And minds are evidently fed too. A sign at Lumezi points to a secondary school that was not there in 1965. More sinisterly, after 87km, an orphanage now stands by the road. This turns out to be a portent of one of the biggest changes since the 1960s.
Courage, Brother
Education had never been a priority for the authorities in Northern Rhodesia. The country had only three secondary schools for Africans in the mid-1950s, and two of those were run by churches. An expansion began in 1960, with talk of a secondary school for the capital of each of the seven rural provinces, but it was not until independence that one was opened in Lundazi. It was a simple affair: two classes to start with, all boys, four teachers (I was the fourth), few books and not much else. The dearth of equipment extended to hymn books, important as they were in a part of Africa which still showed the influence of David Livingstone and his Presbyterian beliefs. One or two hymns, however, had been cyclostyled, taught to the boys and committed to memory. ""Courage, Brother, do not stumble"" was particularly popular. Each day, morning assembly would start with the words, ""We will now sing our hymn."" A pause followed, just long enough to allow the possibility of suspense as to what the choice would be. Then, almost invariably, came, ""Let us sing 'Courage, brother',"" and the air swelled with a lowing of deep male voices.
The headmaster was Arthur Lewanika, a scion of the Lozi royal family whose kingdom, Barotseland, lay in western Zambia. He and his deputy, Roger Zulu, had been the only teaching staff until I and another recruit, Alfred Zaranyika, a Southern Rhodesian, arrived. Neither Alfred nor I had had any training as teachers, and I at least had no books for the lessons in French, maths and physics that I was supposed to give. It is difficult to believe that I taught anyone anything. Still, I had heard in Lusaka before returning to Lundazi that about ten of my former pupils had eventually graduated from university and some had become engineers (Alex Barton Manda), accountants (Major Mkandawire) or lawyers (Masuzu Zimba). At independence in 1964, the country had had fewer than 100 graduates.
The students, who came from far and wide within the surrounding area, were boarders, and so the school was always busy. But life in Lundazi, a town of perhaps 2,000-3,000 in those days, was quiet. In the evenings, the only noises apart from human voices were the hiss of the Tilley lamps that provided our light--no electricity then--and the calls of the hyenas that sometimes ate the Lewanikas' chickens and often came right up to the house that Alfred and I shared. The main amusements were provided by the trials of daily life: Alfred's mile-long sprint pursued by a swarm of bees; my old car catching alight as I drove past the market one day; Alfred's attempt to extend the life of his car battery by warming it up in the oven, an experiment that caused Arthur huge amusement when ""over-baking"" led to muffled explosions and quantities of boiling acid that seeped on to our kitchen floor.
It was almost impossible to get a car mended in Lundazi, or even to replace a battery. The shops were basic. Food could be bought in the market and sometimes people would come to the door offering a (live) chicken or some oranges. But Alfred was always scornful about the lack of choice: people were so much more enterprising, he said, in Southern Rhodesia (that was, of course, before Robert Mugabe had done his best to wreck the country). Anything even slightly sophisticated--oil lamps, blankets, cloth for chitenges, the nearly universal garment for women in those days--was available only from the shops owned by ""Asians"", notably Mulla Stores, founded by old Mr Mulla, who had made his way to Lundazi from Gujarat via Mozambique in the 1930s.
For a drink or a meal out, the place to go was the Castle, which was presided over by Lyn Jonquiere, the only other ""European"", as whites were then called, in Lundazi. The Castle was where visiting politicians, contractors and civil servants would stay. It was kept spick and span by Mrs Jonquiere. Of an evening, she could be found behind the bar, genially dispensing cold Castles (the hotel shared a name with a popular beer) or Portuguese wine brought in from Mozambique, Zambia's neighbour to the east, while Jim Reeves played on the gramophone. Thanks to its generator, the Castle had electricity. 
You do not need a generator today in Lundazi: electricity is (usually) available from the Malawian national grid across the border, and the Castle now has television. It does not, however, have running water--except through the roof in the rainy season. The building is in a sad state, though its new leaseholder, Chifumu Banda, promises improvements.
Mr Banda, a native of Lundazi who is now a prominent lawyer in Lusaka, had warned me that I would see that Lundazi was now ""worse off"". The school, though, is vastly improved. The four teachers and 70 or so students have become 43 teachers and 864 students, and they occupy a bigger site. Though no one remembers any of the original staff, Arthur's name is memorialised in the name of one of the four boarding houses. As for the students' names, neither their first nor their surnames seem to have changed much: there are Ndhlovus, Phiris, Nyirendas and Bandas galore, preceded perhaps by Best, Gift, Major, Mercy or Memory, even if, on this occasion, I meet no Time, Meat or Section Eight. 
The school has its own water (pumped from three boreholes), a fish pond, four plump pigs and several sheep and goats. It grows its own vegetables. But only rarely do the students eat meat, and the relentless diet of nshima--maize porridge--has apparently provoked protests in the not-too-distant past. Little money has been available for maintenance, but broken windows are being replaced, prefects now have ""executive neckties"", the library contains a modest variety of books and there are ten computers, though not, as yet, an internet connection. (High telecoms charges and an overburdened relay station still keep most of Lundazi offline, though mobile phones have just arrived.) Another sign of change is that, in place of the ""Procrastination is the thief of time"" written on the blackboard by Alfred in 1965, a notice on a door now reads, ""Don't trust corrupt politicians.""
The new plague
Basic tuition is provided free, but the fees for boarding and any extra lessons come to nearly $200 a year, and uniform costs almost another $40. For most families, that is a fortune: about 70% of Zambians live on less than $1 a day. But in the past a family that could muster enough to start sending a child to school would usually be able to see the endeavour through. Today that is often untrue, simply because so many families are falling apart. In the list of students, the letter S (for a ""single"" orphan, ie, a child who has lost one parent) or D (for a ""double"" orphan) occurs ever more often against the names as the classes grow older: 14 in Grade Nine, 60 in Grade Ten. The cause is AIDS. In total, over 120 of the 864 students have lost one or both parents to this latter-day plague.
Lundazi is far from insouciant about AIDS. The district has an AIDS co-ordinator, Christa Nyirenda, who struggles to carry out her work in the face of a constant lack of money. The churches also do their best. The Rev Frighted Mwanza's Presbyterian church, for example, is helping to look after several orphans and 55 others who are HIV-positive, some of them chronically ill. And along the road from the Castle, the Thandizani (meaning ""Let's help one another"") centre also offers advice, support and HIV testing. Set up in 1999 in a former cocktail bar, whose name is still clearly legible outside, it is considered a model non-governmental organisation, but it does not offer treatment. 
That is done at Lundazi district hospital, or rather it is meant to be done there. The difficulty is that the hospital is old (1950s vintage), has only two doctors (for all the 290,000 people in the district) and has to charge for the anti-retroviral drugs that can arrest the ravages of AIDS in infected people. The very poor, about 20% of those who receive these drugs, get them free; the others must pay about $10 a month. The result is that only 114 people are getting treatment out of more than 500 who are known to need it. In reality, hundreds, if not thousands, should be receiving drugs. That is evident both from the number of orphans in the school and from a sign not far from the hospital: ""Coffin Workshop"".
Fortunately, coffins are not the only source of new jobs in Lundazi. The second-hand clothes market that has sprung up is another. On a dusty patch of ground now stands rack upon rack of western clothes, made perhaps in China or other parts of Asia but already worn in Europe or America and then given away to charities to be sold, for very little, all over Africa, even in places like Lundazi. This phenomenon, known as salaula, explains why so few of the women along the road now wear chitenges, and also why a man on a bicycle too poor to have shoes may be wearing a formal dress shirt. The trade provides T-shirts and skirts and trousers for many who could not afford them in the past, and jobs for those who sell the clothes. But it has made it difficult for Zambian textile producers to compete; this is dumping in the true sense of the word.
More hopeful for Lundazi is the slow, belated improvement in agriculture. On the outskirts of town are some new tobacco sheds, built by Stancom, an American multinational. It provides loans to small farmers, trains them in agronomy and sells them seeds and fertiliser, as well as the saplings they must plant if they cut other trees down for fuel to flue-cure their crop. A Malawian company, Limbe Leaf, has also come to Lundazi, as have several cotton companies--Dunavant, an American firm, Clark Cotton, from South Africa, and Chipata Cotton, a Chinese joint-venture. Lundazi now accounts for about 12% of Zambia's cotton production, and there is talk of Dunavant building a ginnery.
For all these welcome developments, agriculture around Lundazi is woefully undeveloped. Many people have gone hungry in the past few months thanks to a poor harvest: instead of falling evenly through the 2004-05 growing season, the rains came all at once, mostly early on. Yet the land is good. It could provide much more food and cash crops too, perhaps two harvests a year, with proper irrigation. But only now are some of the dams of the colonial era being restored to use, after years of neglect and silting up.
Hope on hold
It is time to leave Lundazi. Outside Mulla Stores, which seems to have had not even a lick of paint in 40 years, a few people are chatting. One or two others are bicycling from the direction of the boma, the administrative centre. Here again not much has changed. The impression is reinforced on the journey back along the pot-holed road to Chipata, even after a brief stop to greet Father Morrison and the other Catholic Fathers at Lumezi mission. But then there are the signs, really quite a lot of them, to the schools: primary schools, ""basic"" schools (which give a couple of years of secondary education) and Lumezi's secondary school. That is encouraging. So is the farming. But every so often are reminders of a darker side of the new reality: branches, laid down on the road to indicate a funeral. Bicyclists are expected to dismount, and trucks and cars to slow down, out of respect. I assume, perhaps wrongly, that AIDS has claimed another vicitm.
I had been prepared for most of what I found in Lundazi: I knew that half a century ago Zambia and South Korea had had roughly the same income per person, and now Korea's was 32 times greater. So I was expecting the accumulated evidence of 40 years of needless poverty, misgovernment and dashed hopes. Many of those dashed hopes I shared. But my main regret was that, back in 1965, I had not been able, instead of French and physics, to teach Korean studies, even if I had had no books. Perhaps it is not too late for someone else. <p class=""unknown"" style=""SpecialSection"">Africa 40 years on

AMERICAN environmentalists could be forgiven for throwing up their hands and heading north. This month Canada announced the creation of a 16m-acre conservation park along the Pacific coast. Meanwhile, the Bush administration wants to sell some 300,000 acres of national forest land in 35 states, mostly out west. That is about 0.2% of America's forest system--but it would be the biggest such sale in living memory.
The proposal, which is in George Bush's budget, now goes to Congress (the public will also get a chance to comment). The $800m or so in proceeds would go to support rural schools to make up for the cash they used to get from timber sales on federal land. Environmentalists are beside themselves. Suzanne Jones, a Colorado-based director of the Wilderness Society, accuses the White House of selling off the public's land to balance the national budget. There are also howls from Democrats, including Senator Dianne Feinstein of California and Montana's cowboyish governor, Brian Schweitzer.
Auctioning off smaller bits of public land is common and (thanks to rising property prices) lucrative. The Bureau of Land Management recently sold off 4,500 acres around Las Vegas for $1.3 billion. The new proposal involves lots of small bits of Forest Service land: mostly just odds and ends cut off from America's main national forests, says the Bush administration.
Greens, currently poring over maps, say that is no defence. Ms Jones points out that ""Just because a parcel is isolated doesn't mean it doesn't have important values."" The tracts could be home to rare plants or animals: now, in Colorado, they ""will no doubt be covered with condos"". 
The main worry for greens is not the land in question, but the precedent a sale would set. ""If they get away with it, they'll probably go back for more,"" says Bob Clark, a Sierra Club leader in Missoula, Montana. The Senate recently rejected another tidying-up reform proposed by Richard Pombo, a Republican congressman much feared by greens, that would have included selling off 15 national parks and would have collected a lot of cash for the Treasury.

""RELATIVE to the corporate environment, we are in the 1870s. But philanthropy will increasingly come to resemble the capitalist economy,"" predicts Uday Khemka, a young Indian philanthropist and a director of the SUN Group investment company owned by his family. Like many of the new generation of philanthropists, he has big but well-defined ambitions. ""I want to help develop the infrastructure of philanthropy,"" he says. 
The need for philanthropy to become more like the for-profit capital markets is a common theme among the new philanthropists, especially those who have made their fortune in finance. As they see it, three things are needed for such a philanthropic marketplace to work. 
First, there must be something for philanthropists to ""invest"" in--something that, ideally, will be created by ""social entrepreneurs"", just as in the for-profit world entrepreneurs create companies that end up traded on the stockmarket.
Second, the market requires an infrastructure, the philanthropic equivalent of stockmarkets, investment banks, research houses, management consultants and so on. This is what Mr Khemka wants to concentrate on. 
Third, philanthropists themselves need to behave more like investors. That means allocating their money to make the greatest possible difference to society's problems: in other words, to maximise their ""social return"". Some might operate as relatively hands-off, diversified ""social investors"" and some as hands-on, engaged ""venture philanthropists"", the counterparts of mainstream venture capitalists. 
All this may sound fine in theory. However, the history of philanthropy suggests that there are many potential pitfalls.
America's early charitable foundations were built by entrepreneurs. Carnegie and Rockefeller would have understood the new investment-oriented model. ""Having seen their own economic activity transform the world, they thought that the foundations they left behind would be transformative organisations,"" says Carl Schramm, head of the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation. Those foundations did remarkable things. Set up as conduits for making grants as well as running the programmes that would benefit from the money, they thought big, concentrated on clear goals and were willing to invest heavily for long periods to achieve them, says Mr Schramm. The Rockefeller Foundation, for example, found a cure for yellow fever and drove the ""green revolution"" in agriculture. Carnegie, among other things, built thousands of public libraries. 
Yet this long-term investment ethos has proved to be the exception, not the rule. In a landmark article, ""Philanthropy's New Agenda: Creating Value"", published in the Harvard Business Review in 1999, Michael Porter and Mark Kramer described widespread flaws in America's foundations that mostly remain to this day. For instance, little effort is devoted to measuring results, and foundations have unjustifiably high administration costs. 
Michael Bailin, head of the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation, has described the typical foundation as ""autocratic, ineffective and wilful, elitist, cloistered, arrogant and pampered"". There are ""chronic problems in the way foundations operate"", says Joel Fleischman, former head of the unusually impressive Atlantic Philanthropies, who is writing a book on the successes and failures of foundations. He says that most of them provide little information about what they do, and are particularly secretive about their failures. As a result, says Mr Fleischman, ""foundations keep reinventing the wheel.""
As for foundation governance, it is a nightmare, says Robert Monks, a veteran campaigner for better corporate governance: ""Perpetual existence, no need to conform to competitive standards, it is all too much for human nature. Hence the palatial offices, fancy conferences and increasingly lavish pay for the professional philanthrocrats."" 
Arguably the biggest problem is the way that foundations make grants to organisations they support. Whereas Carnegie was willing to invest for the long term, more recently foundations have tended to chop and change, says Mr Fleischman. Melissa Berman of Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors argues that there is too much emphasis on funding individual programmes and too little on the sustainability of the non-profit organisation running the programme. Overheads are seen as a bad thing, and grants tend to be short-term. 
Should the new generation of philanthropists try something different from the traditional foundation? Ebay's Mr Omidyar thinks so. He has folded his Omidyar Foundation into Omidyar Network, which is free to make for-profit investments as well as philanthropic donations to pursue its mission of ""individual self-empowerment"". ""After a few years trying to be a traditional philanthropist, I asked myself, if you are doing good, trying to make the world a better place, why limit yourself to non-profit?"" he explains. Although there is a separate chequebook for the foundation, his ""investment team"" is free to put his money in either for-profit or non-profit projects. The team's main criterion is whether the investment will further the social mission. 
Similarly, the Google Foundation is part of Google.org, which can mix for-profit and non-profit investments. However, unlike Omidyar Network, Google.org is an arm of Google, so this is corporate philanthropy--which raises a further series of difficult questions (see box, previous page).
In principle, large foundations should be the most effective vehicle for philanthropy, argue Messrs Porter and Kramer. Not only are they free from both political and commercial pressures, they also employ professional staff that smaller outfits would not be able to afford. But the staff often become the biggest problem, especially in foundations whose founder has long been dead. 
The new philanthropists are mostly young enough to be able to keep an eye on their foundations for many years to come. Nonetheless, says Mr Fleischman, they might consider setting a closing date for their foundation. For instance, the John M. Olin Foundation, a big source of finance for conservative organisations, recently shut itself down. As John Miller recounts in his new book, ""A Gift of Freedom"", Olin had stipulated that all of his legacy should be spent within a generation of his death, a sunset model that kept it nimble, unbureaucratic and true to its founder's ideas. 
The new philanthropists also need to be clear what they want to do, and stick with it. That is one lesson from the Gates Foundation, which has already notched up some remarkable achievements--helped by its huge size, which allows it to do things that are beyond everyone else. Its clear mission is to tackle global health inequalities in six main areas: infectious disease, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, reproductive health, global health strategies and global health technologies. 
Leverage is all
Crucially, it has found ways of using its money to the greatest effect. Mr Gates's big idea is to overcome the market failure afflicting poor consumers of health care by deploying his money on behalf of the poor to generate the supply of drugs and treatments they need. For instance, the money provides market incentives for drug companies to put some of their resources to work for the needy. 
The Gates Foundation also favours partnerships, even though it is big enough to pursue many projects on its own. Again, it is looking for maximum effectiveness. Other philanthropists are following similar strategies. For instance, Britain's Dame Stephanie Shirley wanted to fund research into an autism gene, the total cost of which she reckoned would be pounds 1 billion ($1.7 billion). She stumped up pounds 50m herself and is raising similar sums from other donors around the world. Another ""hot"" idea at the moment, championed by the X-Prize Foundation, is to donate large cash prizes that will generate lots of further spending from those competing to win them. 
Mr Omidyar recently donated $100m to Tufts University to invest profitably in providers of microfinance to the poor. He hopes to attract private capital to turn what has largely been a subsidised business into a profitable one, operating on a far bigger scale than today. 
Other new philanthropists are piloting new models for welfare provision that, once they have proved themselves, can be taken up by governments and made available much more widely. Governments tend to be risk-averse, whereas philanthropists are free to take whatever risks they like with their money, so they can play a useful role as providers of start-up risk capital for government services. 
Networks, too, are an increasingly popular way of leveraging money and experience. Peggy Rockefeller Dulany's Global Philanthropists Circle brings together about 50 super-rich families from 20 countries to exchange ideas and experiences, mainly with a view to finding solutions to international poverty and inequality. Often this will involve the use of connections and influence as well as money. 
However, there is still a lack of global giving consortiums that take on single issues, says Mr Khemka. He hopes to bring together philanthropists from around the world who want to tackle climate change.
Some foundations are now exploring new ways of funding organisations. Mr Salamon of Johns Hopkins University thinks that they should start to behave more like philanthropic banks, offering a range of financial products such as loans and loan guarantees as well as grants.
Some philanthropists are also beginning to think about how best to harness all their assets to the causes they support, rather than just concentrating on the money they are currently giving away. This point was brought home recently to Jeff Skoll, one of whose philanthropic missions is to make films with a social message. His latest film is based on the book ""Fast-Food Nation""--yet he had not checked his investment portfolio to see if he owned shares in food companies such as McDonald's that are attacked in the film. 
Over the past year or so, many of the super-rich have started to ask themselves what exactly their assets are doing, says D.K. Matai, an Indian-born software entrepreneur who runs the Philanthropia Trinity, another international network of philanthropists. ""What is the point of earning a high return in China if my money is helping to build Dickensian working conditions? If I have $5 billion, and am giving $4 billion away, do I really want a 17% return on activities that are wrecking the world?"" To deal with that problem, the investment industry will need to improve on the strategies and products it currently offers for ""ethical"" or ""socially responsible"" investment, which often amount to little more than avoiding shares in, say, tobacco, arms manufacturing or oil.
The phrase most often used to describe the new approach to giving is ""venture philanthropy"". This was first used in the 1960s by one of the Rockefellers, but is still practised relatively rarely. Perhaps the best example is a firm called Venture Philanthropy Partners. Run by Mario Morino, who made his fortune in software, it specialises in mid-sized non-profit organisations in the Washington, DC, area that work well enough, but lack the capital and talent to expand. With a $30m fund raised through a community foundation, Mr Morino behaves much like a venture capitalist. He is working intensively with 12 non-profit organisations, helping them to develop a business plan for growth and to recruit managers and board members.
Old dogs, new tricks
New foundations may be learning from the mistakes of the old ones; but what can be done to reform established foundations that are underperforming? With America's Congress showing increased interest in foundations, Senator Charles Grassley has proposed tough new laws. His reforms would ""dramatically transform the relationship between the federal government and foundations"", says Adam Meyerson of the Philanthropy Roundtable, an industry body. Among other things, Senator Grassley is proposing a five-yearly review of foundations' charitable status and a formal government ratification regime. But Mr Meyerson thinks it would be far better for the government properly to enforce the laws that are already in place. 
Better regulation is on the agenda in Britain, too, where charity is still governed by an act passed in 1601. ""The governance of charities and non-profits is generally poor,"" says Geraldine Peacock of Britain's Charity Commission, which under new legislation due to take effect this year will become much more independent of government. Like Senator Grassley, Ms Peacock thinks that a charity should be licensed for a limited time--say five years--and then have to reapply. 
Encouragingly, many of the older foundations themselves are becoming more concerned about effectiveness, and have started demanding more information on how the money they provide is spent, says Mr Fleischman. The recent transformation of the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation shows that an inefficient old organisation can turn itself into a cutting-edge operation. It used to hand out grants in the traditional manner for a wide range of good causes. But in the late 1990s, a new head, Mr Bailin, decided to concentrate its activities in a single field, youth development. Working closely with its chosen organisations, notably Harlem Children's Zone, it has helped them become more effective and serve many more people. 
The biggest question of all is how to measure the performance of a philanthropic organisation. A huge amount of work is going on in this field, but it is still more art than science--particularly when it comes to the fuzzier goals of some philanthropists, such as ""empowering people"", ""increasing the effectiveness of civil society"" or ""fighting climate change"".
Measures involving the so-called double bottom line (financial plus social performance) or triple bottom line (financial, social and environmental) are readily susceptible to statistical manipulation. So are popular concepts such as ""changed life""--a combination of the number of people affected by an initiative and the extent to which it improves their lives. 
One danger is to pay too much attention to managing inputs, which are easier to measure than output. Another is to concentrate donations on those activities that can be easily measured, such as the number of vaccinations given, even where that may not be the most effective way of tackling a problem. 
Donors also need to strike the right balance, so that on one hand they ask for enough information to be able to monitor the effectiveness of the organisations they fund but on the other they do not bog them down in form-filling bureaucracy. The Gates Foundation has a good reputation for getting the mix right and tailoring it to individual circumstances. 
""The risk with any metric is that people will come to see it as a description of reality, rather than a tool for a conversation about that reality,"" says Rowena Young of the Skoll Foundation. ""One metric or another can function well only when managers know why they are measuring and for whom...In the world of social value-creation, context is king.""","The leading new philanthropists see themselves as social investors
""RELATIVE to the corporate environment, we are in the 1870s. But philanthropy will increasingly come to resemble the capitalist economy,"" predicts Uday Khemka, a young Indian philanthropist and a director of the SUN Group investment company owned by his family. Like many of the new generation of philanthropists, he has big but well-defined ambitions. ""I want to help develop the infrastructure of philanthropy,"" he says. 
The need for philanthropy to become more like the for-profit capital markets is a common theme among the new philanthropists, especially those who have made their fortune in finance. As they see it, three things are needed for such a philanthropic marketplace to work. 
First, there must be something for philanthropists to ""invest"" in--something that, ideally, will be created by ""social entrepreneurs"", just as in the for-profit world entrepreneurs create companies that end up traded on the stockmarket.
Second, the market requires an infrastructure, the philanthropic equivalent of stockmarkets, investment banks, research houses, management consultants and so on. This is what Mr Khemka wants to concentrate on. 
Third, philanthropists themselves need to behave more like investors. That means allocating their money to make the greatest possible difference to society's problems: in other words, to maximise their ""social return"". Some might operate as relatively hands-off, diversified ""social investors"" and some as hands-on, engaged ""venture philanthropists"", the counterparts of mainstream venture capitalists. 
All this may sound fine in theory. However, the history of philanthropy suggests that there are many potential pitfalls.
America's early charitable foundations were built by entrepreneurs. Carnegie and Rockefeller would have understood the new investment-oriented model. ""Having seen their own economic activity transform the world, they thought that the foundations they left behind would be transformative organisations,"" says Carl Schramm, head of the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation. Those foundations did remarkable things. Set up as conduits for making grants as well as running the programmes that would benefit from the money, they thought big, concentrated on clear goals and were willing to invest heavily for long periods to achieve them, says Mr Schramm. The Rockefeller Foundation, for example, found a cure for yellow fever and drove the ""green revolution"" in agriculture. Carnegie, among other things, built thousands of public libraries. 
Yet this long-term investment ethos has proved to be the exception, not the rule. In a landmark article, ""Philanthropy's New Agenda: Creating Value"", published in the Harvard Business Review in 1999, Michael Porter and Mark Kramer described widespread flaws in America's foundations that mostly remain to this day. For instance, little effort is devoted to measuring results, and foundations have unjustifiably high administration costs. 
Michael Bailin, head of the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation, has described the typical foundation as ""autocratic, ineffective and wilful, elitist, cloistered, arrogant and pampered"". There are ""chronic problems in the way foundations operate"", says Joel Fleischman, former head of the unusually impressive Atlantic Philanthropies, who is writing a book on the successes and failures of foundations. He says that most of them provide little information about what they do, and are particularly secretive about their failures. As a result, says Mr Fleischman, ""foundations keep reinventing the wheel.""
As for foundation governance, it is a nightmare, says Robert Monks, a veteran campaigner for better corporate governance: ""Perpetual existence, no need to conform to competitive standards, it is all too much for human nature. Hence the palatial offices, fancy conferences and increasingly lavish pay for the professional philanthrocrats."" 
Arguably the biggest problem is the way that foundations make grants to organisations they support. Whereas Carnegie was willing to invest for the long term, more recently foundations have tended to chop and change, says Mr Fleischman. Melissa Berman of Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors argues that there is too much emphasis on funding individual programmes and too little on the sustainability of the non-profit organisation running the programme. Overheads are seen as a bad thing, and grants tend to be short-term. 
Should the new generation of philanthropists try something different from the traditional foundation? Ebay's Mr Omidyar thinks so. He has folded his Omidyar Foundation into Omidyar Network, which is free to make for-profit investments as well as philanthropic donations to pursue its mission of ""individual self-empowerment"". ""After a few years trying to be a traditional philanthropist, I asked myself, if you are doing good, trying to make the world a better place, why limit yourself to non-profit?"" he explains. Although there is a separate chequebook for the foundation, his ""investment team"" is free to put his money in either for-profit or non-profit projects. The team's main criterion is whether the investment will further the social mission. 
Similarly, the Google Foundation is part of Google.org, which can mix for-profit and non-profit investments. However, unlike Omidyar Network, Google.org is an arm of Google, so this is corporate philanthropy--which raises a further series of difficult questions (see box, previous page).
In principle, large foundations should be the most effective vehicle for philanthropy, argue Messrs Porter and Kramer. Not only are they free from both political and commercial pressures, they also employ professional staff that smaller outfits would not be able to afford. But the staff often become the biggest problem, especially in foundations whose founder has long been dead. 
The new philanthropists are mostly young enough to be able to keep an eye on their foundations for many years to come. Nonetheless, says Mr Fleischman, they might consider setting a closing date for their foundation. For instance, the John M. Olin Foundation, a big source of finance for conservative organisations, recently shut itself down. As John Miller recounts in his new book, ""A Gift of Freedom"", Olin had stipulated that all of his legacy should be spent within a generation of his death, a sunset model that kept it nimble, unbureaucratic and true to its founder's ideas. 
The new philanthropists also need to be clear what they want to do, and stick with it. That is one lesson from the Gates Foundation, which has already notched up some remarkable achievements--helped by its huge size, which allows it to do things that are beyond everyone else. Its clear mission is to tackle global health inequalities in six main areas: infectious disease, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, reproductive health, global health strategies and global health technologies. 
Leverage is all
Crucially, it has found ways of using its money to the greatest effect. Mr Gates's big idea is to overcome the market failure afflicting poor consumers of health care by deploying his money on behalf of the poor to generate the supply of drugs and treatments they need. For instance, the money provides market incentives for drug companies to put some of their resources to work for the needy. 
The Gates Foundation also favours partnerships, even though it is big enough to pursue many projects on its own. Again, it is looking for maximum effectiveness. Other philanthropists are following similar strategies. For instance, Britain's Dame Stephanie Shirley wanted to fund research into an autism gene, the total cost of which she reckoned would be pounds 1 billion ($1.7 billion). She stumped up pounds 50m herself and is raising similar sums from other donors around the world. Another ""hot"" idea at the moment, championed by the X-Prize Foundation, is to donate large cash prizes that will generate lots of further spending from those competing to win them. 
Mr Omidyar recently donated $100m to Tufts University to invest profitably in providers of microfinance to the poor. He hopes to attract private capital to turn what has largely been a subsidised business into a profitable one, operating on a far bigger scale than today. 
Other new philanthropists are piloting new models for welfare provision that, once they have proved themselves, can be taken up by governments and made available much more widely. Governments tend to be risk-averse, whereas philanthropists are free to take whatever risks they like with their money, so they can play a useful role as providers of start-up risk capital for government services. 
Networks, too, are an increasingly popular way of leveraging money and experience. Peggy Rockefeller Dulany's Global Philanthropists Circle brings together about 50 super-rich families from 20 countries to exchange ideas and experiences, mainly with a view to finding solutions to international poverty and inequality. Often this will involve the use of connections and influence as well as money. 
However, there is still a lack of global giving consortiums that take on single issues, says Mr Khemka. He hopes to bring together philanthropists from around the world who want to tackle climate change.
Some foundations are now exploring new ways of funding organisations. Mr Salamon of Johns Hopkins University thinks that they should start to behave more like philanthropic banks, offering a range of financial products such as loans and loan guarantees as well as grants.
Some philanthropists are also beginning to think about how best to harness all their assets to the causes they support, rather than just concentrating on the money they are currently giving away. This point was brought home recently to Jeff Skoll, one of whose philanthropic missions is to make films with a social message. His latest film is based on the book ""Fast-Food Nation""--yet he had not checked his investment portfolio to see if he owned shares in food companies such as McDonald's that are attacked in the film. 
Over the past year or so, many of the super-rich have started to ask themselves what exactly their assets are doing, says D.K. Matai, an Indian-born software entrepreneur who runs the Philanthropia Trinity, another international network of philanthropists. ""What is the point of earning a high return in China if my money is helping to build Dickensian working conditions? If I have $5 billion, and am giving $4 billion away, do I really want a 17% return on activities that are wrecking the world?"" To deal with that problem, the investment industry will need to improve on the strategies and products it currently offers for ""ethical"" or ""socially responsible"" investment, which often amount to little more than avoiding shares in, say, tobacco, arms manufacturing or oil.
The phrase most often used to describe the new approach to giving is ""venture philanthropy"". This was first used in the 1960s by one of the Rockefellers, but is still practised relatively rarely. Perhaps the best example is a firm called Venture Philanthropy Partners. Run by Mario Morino, who made his fortune in software, it specialises in mid-sized non-profit organisations in the Washington, DC, area that work well enough, but lack the capital and talent to expand. With a $30m fund raised through a community foundation, Mr Morino behaves much like a venture capitalist. He is working intensively with 12 non-profit organisations, helping them to develop a business plan for growth and to recruit managers and board members.
Old dogs, new tricks
New foundations may be learning from the mistakes of the old ones; but what can be done to reform established foundations that are underperforming? With America's Congress showing increased interest in foundations, Senator Charles Grassley has proposed tough new laws. His reforms would ""dramatically transform the relationship between the federal government and foundations"", says Adam Meyerson of the Philanthropy Roundtable, an industry body. Among other things, Senator Grassley is proposing a five-yearly review of foundations' charitable status and a formal government ratification regime. But Mr Meyerson thinks it would be far better for the government properly to enforce the laws that are already in place. 
Better regulation is on the agenda in Britain, too, where charity is still governed by an act passed in 1601. ""The governance of charities and non-profits is generally poor,"" says Geraldine Peacock of Britain's Charity Commission, which under new legislation due to take effect this year will become much more independent of government. Like Senator Grassley, Ms Peacock thinks that a charity should be licensed for a limited time--say five years--and then have to reapply. 
Encouragingly, many of the older foundations themselves are becoming more concerned about effectiveness, and have started demanding more information on how the money they provide is spent, says Mr Fleischman. The recent transformation of the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation shows that an inefficient old organisation can turn itself into a cutting-edge operation. It used to hand out grants in the traditional manner for a wide range of good causes. But in the late 1990s, a new head, Mr Bailin, decided to concentrate its activities in a single field, youth development. Working closely with its chosen organisations, notably Harlem Children's Zone, it has helped them become more effective and serve many more people. 
The biggest question of all is how to measure the performance of a philanthropic organisation. A huge amount of work is going on in this field, but it is still more art than science--particularly when it comes to the fuzzier goals of some philanthropists, such as ""empowering people"", ""increasing the effectiveness of civil society"" or ""fighting climate change"".
Measures involving the so-called double bottom line (financial plus social performance) or triple bottom line (financial, social and environmental) are readily susceptible to statistical manipulation. So are popular concepts such as ""changed life""--a combination of the number of people affected by an initiative and the extent to which it improves their lives. 
One danger is to pay too much attention to managing inputs, which are easier to measure than output. Another is to concentrate donations on those activities that can be easily measured, such as the number of vaccinations given, even where that may not be the most effective way of tackling a problem. 
Donors also need to strike the right balance, so that on one hand they ask for enough information to be able to monitor the effectiveness of the organisations they fund but on the other they do not bog them down in form-filling bureaucracy. The Gates Foundation has a good reputation for getting the mix right and tailoring it to individual circumstances. 
""The risk with any metric is that people will come to see it as a description of reality, rather than a tool for a conversation about that reality,"" says Rowena Young of the Skoll Foundation.

IT WAS an extraordinary sight. The world's two richest men hugged each other as a room full of New York's great and good cheered and applauded. The event marked a new sort of partnership, one in which a pair of tycoons will merge their fortunes and give most of their money away to help make the world a better place, especially for the poorest. 
In cinema, such a scene would have seemed implausible; especially at a time when businessmen are making headlines for their misdeeds and selfish excess. Yet on June 26th Warren Buffett pledged to donate the bulk of his estimated $44 billion fortune to the charitable foundation created by the only man richer than himself, Bill Gates. This munificence came soon after Mr Gates's decision to start to step down from Microsoft, the software-maker that made him fabulously rich, to work full-time at the foundation which he runs with his wife, Melinda.
Mr Buffett's donation, worth some $37 billion, is the biggest-ever--some $6 billion will go to the foundations founded by his three children and his late wife. It exceeds the $31 billion that Mr Gates handed to his own foundation (although he still has an estimated $50 billion burning a hole in his pocket). By comparison, two earlier giants of American philanthropy, John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie, gave away only $7.6 billion and $4.1 billion respectively, measured in 2006 dollars. 
Yet Mr Buffett is also breaking new ground by outsourcing his philanthropy. He says he is applying the same strategy to giving away his money as he did to making it: finding good organisations with talented managers and backing them. It was through a series of well-timed investments in firms such as American Express, Coca-Cola, Gillette and Disney that Mr Buffett's Nebraska-based Berkshire Hathaway grew into a financial powerhouse and in the process earned him the sobriquet of ""Sage of Omaha"".
The Sage, however, believes that the Gateses can do his philanthropy better than he could. Just as he likes to have a seat on the board of the companies he invests in, Mr Buffett will become a trustee of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. It is the Gateses he is backing. Despite many denials, it is widely believed Mr Buffett made his gift conditional upon Mr Gates giving up his day job at Microsoft. Moreover, his money will flow only as long as at least one of them actively runs the foundation.
The Gates Foundation will eventually be able to count on assets of around $60 billion. That makes it by far the world's biggest charitable foundation (see chart), overtaking the Stichting Ingka Foundation, which owns the Swedish furniture giant IKEA, and which is ostensibly dedicated to furthering the modest cause of architecture and interior design. The Gates Foundation's ambitions are not only more altruistic, but also differ from most other foundations in their scope, which includes eradicating disease and poverty in developing countries. 
Mr Gates says he is ""awed"" by the generosity of Mr Buffett, an old friend and bridge partner. It could lead to similar gifts from other billionaires. The Gates Foundation had already inspired a growing number of rich people, including the generation of technology tycoons that followed Mr Gates, such as the founders of eBay and Google. Yet to realise predictions of a second ""golden age of philanthropy"" that would surpass Carnegie and Rockefeller, this new generation of philanthropists must not only give away lots of money, but do so more effectively than before.
Mr Gates and Mr Buffett know that many billions of dollars have been squandered over the years by philanthropists, so they want to make their money work hard for them. They may have many reasons to give their fortunes away. Mr Buffett has long said he does not believe in dynastic fortunes and Mr Gates was taught by his mother that he had a responsibility to ""give back"". Mr Gates famously brought forward his plans to give away most of his wealth after a World Development Report convinced him that by doing so it would have a greater impact than waiting until he grew old. 
The Gateses and Mr Buffett were also inspired by the philanthropists of the first golden age. Having made their fortunes in the industrial revolution, they formed the first big foundations and set about modernising American society. Mr Buffett chose to announce his gift in the New York Public Library, itself the product of collaboration between early philanthropists, including Carnegie, the great provider of public libraries. In attendance was David Rockefeller, now in his 90s, grandson of the oil baron who turned into a philanthropist.
Rockefeller had a huge impact on the two areas that have been at the centre of attention for the Gates Foundation, education and health. His foundation helped to create the modern research university. Today, in a similar spirit, the Gates Foundation is trying to tackle the huge problems in America's schools. Rockefeller raised the quality of training doctors in America and found a vaccine for yellow fever. It also drove the ""green revolution"" in agriculture that ended famine in much of the world and, by some estimates, saved 1.5 billion lives--exactly the sort of impact that the Gateses hope to achieve.
Their foundation has got off to an impressive start, not least by raising public awareness about AIDS and poverty in developing countries. It has given away billions of dollars, mobilised billions more from other sources and is helping to shape public policy. Thanks to Mr Gates, it has become known as one of the leading practitioners of ""philanthrocapitalism"", an approach that draws on modern business practices and an entrepreneurial spirit to get more from its money.
But not everyone is confident of the foundation's success. Some experts in philanthropy reckon that although Mr Buffett's money greatly increases opportunities, it also carries risks. In particular, the foundation faces two huge tests: how to operate at a much larger scale and the sheer complexity of the problems it is trying to solve.
According to Mr Buffett, the Gates Foundation represents good value for money: ""per dollar, very effective"". Mr Gates is confident that it can scale up to use Mr Buffett's money to achieve even better results. ""Given the size of the problems we are taking on, we can more than double the impact we have,"" he says. Nevertheless, he notes that although Mr Buffett's money will double the foundation's annual giving, to around $3 billion, that still represents only $1 for each person in the poorer half of the world's population.
Even so, for any organisation a doubling of its activities is never easy. Several people close to the Gates Foundation say that it is already struggling to give away the 5% of its assets it is legally obliged to each year if it is to qualify for special tax treatment. ""It is surprisingly hard to find groups able to take a $10m grant and do something with it,"" says one consultant. There are rumours that such difficulties may have contributed to the abrupt departure last autumn, by mutual consent, of the head of the foundation's health programmes, Rick Klausner. 
""It will be very challenging to increase their payout adequately, unless the foundation moves away from the sharp focus it has had, which has been one of its strengths,"" says Mark Kramer, of FSG Social Impact Advisors, a consultancy. A restructuring at the top of the foundation in April, with the creation of three divisional presidents, is being seen as preparation for a broader approach.
Yet this goes against a trend among the best of America's other foundations, which are becoming more specialised. The Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation is cutting programmes to concentrate on promoting entrepreneurship. The Edna McConnell Clark Foundation is paying more attention to youth work, spinning off its successful International Trachoma Initiative partnership with Pfizer, a big drug company. A lack of focus has been one of the biggest failings of many American foundations, says Melissa Berman of Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors.
Even so, she believes that the Gates Foundation is unusually well placed and will be able to expand smoothly into some new areas because of the entrepreneurial way in which it operates under the Gateses and its chief executive, Patty Stonesifer, a former top Microsoft executive. The foundation has resisted the urge to hire lots of in-house experts. Noting its use of advisory committees of outside academics, Mrs Gates describes the foundation as a convener, concentrating on finding the best people and projects. 
A particular feature of this approach is the foundation's prolific use of partnerships, something that is unfortunately done rarely if at all by other foundations, says Greg Dees of Duke University. The Gates Foundation has provided incentives to pharmaceutical companies to develop drugs for poor people that would otherwise not have been considered worth it. It has also worked with governments, various agencies, foundations and Bono, a campaigning rock star.
Yet, as it grows, the foundation will inevitably become more bureaucratic. Its 240 staff are expected to double before long. To accommodate them, the foundation is planning to move to a large campus near Seattle's famous Space Needle--which some observers fear may reveal a bad case of the edifice complex that has prompted other well-funded foundations to build palatial headquarters.
The intricacy of the problems it is trying to solve is another matter. As Mr Buffett wisely observed, philanthropy is a ""tougher game"" than business. In business you try to find the easiest options, he says, but ""in philanthropy, the most important problems are those which have already resisted both intellect and money."" Moreover, whereas it is easy to tell if you are succeeding in business--you make money--in philanthropy measuring performance can be fiendishly tricky and take a lot longer.
Ready to make mistakes
To its credit, the Gates Foundation has built performance measurements into all its projects--and importantly is prepared to axe those projects that do not come up to scratch. One of the things that Mr Buffett says he admired about the Gateses is that they are ""more prepared to make mistakes than me"". An example is the foundation's funding of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation. National programmes last for five years, and are scrutinised by an outside auditor during year two or three. Those ahead of target are rewarded with an extra $20 per vaccinated child. Those on target continue to be funded as planned. Those below target have the tap turned off, at least until the problems are resolved.
Mr Gates talks obsessively about the need to be willing to fail, and to learn from mistakes. Mrs Gates notes that over time the foundation has taken a broader approach to the issues it is addressing. For instance, in a big project to combat HIV/AIDS in India, the foundation became aware of the need to help prostitutes find alternative sources of income, which is leading it into microlending to poor people.
It may soon become clear whether the foundation is as ready to deal with failure as Mr Gates suggests. Its education initiatives, in particular, are coming under fire. So far, it has poured around $1 billion into school districts from San Diego to Cincinnati, to raise graduation rates. But one study suggests that its preference for smaller schools is not necessarily yielding the results it wants, and that breaking up big urban schools could be doing more harm than good. Reportedly, the schools strategy is now being reconsidered, which is exactly as it should be. Yet some observers think that Mr Gates is not always given the full story, and can be seen as ""someone you don't want to deliver bad news to"", says one consultant.
One important thing Mr Gates could do is publish details of his foundation's failures, says Joel Fleischman, who is writing a book about American foundations. As a businessman, Mr Gates ought already to understand the way transparency can replicate market pressures to perform well, adds Mr Fleischman. As examples he points to the Wallace Foundation and the Packard Foundation, both of which, at the start of a project, hire independent academic observers who are free to criticise and publish whatever comments they like.
Yet there is one reason why these concerns should not dampen the excitement generated by Mr Buffett's donation. The past experience of foundations suggests that as long as the founder is active and engaged, they tend to perform well. The intriguing question is what role Mr Buffett will play. There is much speculation that he will simply settle for being a role model. Mr Buffett loves his job at Berkshire Hathaway and has little appetite for studying diseases or talking to lots of opinionated people, as Mr and Mrs Gates must.
Others may be tempted to follow Mr Buffett's lead and give away their fortunes, perhaps to the Gates Foundation. But the biggest task in philanthropy is to allocate capital well. And there is nobody who has thought harder about how to invest than Mr Buffett. He should not underestimate the importance of being actively involved because his mind will be as valuable as his money in helping the world's needy.

The Gates Foundation has provided incentives to pharmaceutical companies to develop drugs for poor people that would otherwise not have been considered worth it. It has also worked with governments, various agencies, foundations and Bono, a campaigning rock star.
Yet, as it grows, the foundation will inevitably become more bureaucratic. Its 240 staff are expected to double before long. To accommodate them, the foundation is planning to move to a large campus near Seattle's famous Space Needle--which some observers fear may reveal a bad case of the edifice complex that has prompted other well-funded foundations to build palatial headquarters.
The intricacy of the problems it is trying to solve is another matter. As Mr Buffett wisely observed, philanthropy is a ""tougher game"" than business. In business you try to find the easiest options, he says, but ""in philanthropy, the most important problems are those which have already resisted both intellect and money."" Moreover, whereas it is easy to tell if you are succeeding in business--you make money--in philanthropy measuring performance can be fiendishly tricky and take a lot longer.
Ready to make mistakes
To its credit, the Gates Foundation has built performance measurements into all its projects--and importantly is prepared to axe those projects that do not come up to scratch. One of the things that Mr Buffett says he admired about the Gateses is that they are ""more prepared to make mistakes than me"". An example is the foundation's funding of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation. National programmes last for five years, and are scrutinised by an outside auditor during year two or three. Those ahead of target are rewarded with an extra $20 per vaccinated child. Those on target continue to be funded as planned. Those below target have the tap turned off, at least until the problems are resolved.
Mr Gates talks obsessively about the need to be willing to fail, and to learn from mistakes. Mrs Gates notes that over time the foundation has taken a broader approach to the issues it is addressing. For instance, in a big project to combat HIV/AIDS in India, the foundation became aware of the need to help prostitutes find alternative sources of income, which is leading it into microlending to poor people.
It may soon become clear whether the foundation is as ready to deal with failure as Mr Gates suggests. Its education initiatives, in particular, are coming under fire. So far, it has poured around $1 billion into school districts from San Diego to Cincinnati, to raise graduation rates. But one study suggests that its preference for smaller schools is not necessarily yielding the results it wants, and that breaking up big urban schools could be doing more harm than good. Reportedly, the schools strategy is now being reconsidered, which is exactly as it should be. Yet some observers think that Mr Gates is not always given the full story, and can be seen as ""someone you don't want to deliver bad news to"", says one consultant.
One important thing Mr Gates could do is publish details of his foundation's failures, says Joel Fleischman, who is writing a book about American foundations. As a businessman, Mr Gates ought already to understand the way transparency can replicate market pressures to perform well, adds Mr Fleischman. As examples he points to the Wallace Foundation and the Packard Foundation, both of which, at the start of a project, hire independent academic observers who are free to criticise and publish whatever comments they like.
Yet there is one reason why these concerns should not dampen the excitement generated by Mr Buffett's donation. The past experience of foundations suggests that as long as the founder is active and engaged, they tend to perform well. The intriguing question is what role Mr Buffett will play. There is much speculation that he will simply settle for being a role model. Mr Buffett loves his job at Berkshire Hathaway and has little appetite for studying diseases or talking to lots of opinionated people, as Mr and Mrs Gates must.
Others may be tempted to follow Mr Buffett's lead and give away their fortunes, perhaps to the Gates Foundation. But the biggest task in philanthropy is to allocate capital well. And there is nobody who has thought harder about how to invest than Mr Buffett. He should not underestimate the importance of being actively involved because his mind will be as valuable as his money in helping the world's needy.

In Las Vegas, fancy hotels are often blown up and replaced with bigger, fancier ones (or, in the Landmark's case, a parking lot). These spectacular bangs are a symptom of a spectacular boom: tourist numbers have nearly doubled since 1990. And spearheading the invasion are not homicidal Martians, but old folk. 
Nevada has the fastest-growing elderly population of any state. The number of Americans over 65 rose by 16.8% between 1990 and 2004, slightly slower than the growth of the population as a whole. In Nevada it rose by 100.5% and in Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, it rose by 122%. It is not only old folk who are flocking to the global capital of glitz--a boom attracts migrants of all ages. But several of Nevada's qualities appeal especially to the silver generation. It is sunny, relatively cheap and there is no pesky state income tax. 
Many newcomers have sold their homes in California, bought somewhere equally spacious in Nevada and pocketed enough change to fund their retirement, or so they hope. Las Vegas itself has great air links--no excuse for children not to visit--and plenty of jobs for the over-50s. 
Most casino work is not physically strenuous. Whatever movies may suggest, employees are rarely called upon to beat people to death and bury them in shallow graves in the desert. Casinos are owned by reputable corporations these days. ""It's like working in a bank, but more fun,"" says Barbara Kucala, the 52-year-old ""director of cage operations"" at Caesar's Palace--meaning that she runs a secure cash-counting office, known as ""the cage"". 
Harrah's, the firm that owns Caesar's Palace, does not keep track of its employees' ages, but a brief walkabout reveals many silver-haired croupiers, waitresses and vendors of Elton John-themed knick-knacks. Most seem happy to be busy. Geri Demeo, for example, a tanned 66-year-old telephonist with golden heels, big ear-rings and spiked blonde hair, says she likes ""to get dressed up to come to work"". She also likes her co-workers, the opportunity to learn about computers and the occasional brushes with stars. Retiring completely would be unwise, she says. ""You should always do something.""
This is the year the first baby-boomers turn 60, including Presidents George Bush and Bill Clinton. As the boomers age, so will America. For canny marketers, this is an opportunity. An advertisement for Miracle-Ear hearing aids shows a picture of a spaced-out youth, coiffured for Woodstock. ""Back then you chose not to listen,"" says the caption. Then, above a picture of the same man 40 years on: ""Make today the day you choose to hear better.""
At the same time, however, the boomers' ageing will create problems for America. Not as acute as those faced by other rich countries, to be sure--America's high rates of fertility and immigration ensure that its population will age more slowly than say, those of Western Europe or Japan. But someone will still have to pay for all the extra health care and nursing-home beds, and America's system of provision is both costly and dysfunctional. 
Deficit hawks fret that the government's three main entitlement programmes--Social Security (pensions), Medicare (health care for the elderly) and Medicaid (health care for the poor and residential care for old people who cannot afford it)--will eventually bankrupt America. Brian Riedl of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think-tank, predicts that these programmes, if unreformed, will cause federal spending to swell from 20% of GDP today to a peacetime high of 33% by 2050. Paying for this would require huge tax increases, massive deficit spending or the ""elimination of every other federal programme"", he reckons.
One answer would be to cut benefits and raise the age at which people first qualify for them. AARP (formerly the American Association of Retired Persons) disagrees. And with 35m dues-paying members, it can deluge with protests any politician who flirts with such notions. 
AARP was instrumental in pushing a budget-busting prescription-drug benefit for old people through Congress in 2003. More recently, it helped to block Mr Bush's plan to reform Social Security by allowing people to divert a portion of their Social Security taxes into private accounts. Mr Bush argued that his plan would enable Americans to gain higher returns for their retirement savings. AARP's line is that any private accounts should supplement Social Security, not replace it, even partially. 
Its critics say it promotes a vast transfer of wealth from the young to the old, which is unfair since older people are, on average, much richer. But AARP tends to win its battles. Not only is it the largest lobby group, but its members tend to vote more than youngsters. And, unlike other special interests, it represents a group that everyone expects one day to join. 
John Rother, AARP's policy director, says the problem is not that old people's benefits are too generous, but that medical inflation is too high and Americans do not save enough for retirement. He has a point; health-care costs jumped 6.8% in 2004, more than twice the general rate of inflation. And Americans' personal-savings rate was minus 1.7% in May; Mr Rother thinks plus 10% would be more prudent. 
The world according to AARP
Until recently, AARP argued that economic security for ""seniors"", as it calls them, rested on three pillars: Social Security, private pensions and personal savings. Now it adds health insurance and work. 
Health insurance is most problematic for those who are not covered by an employer, not quite old enough for Medicare (which typically kicks in at 65) and not quite poor enough for Medicaid. Another problem for the old and infirm is that although the Medicare drug benefit covers the first $2,250 they spend on medicines each year and anything over $5,100, they themselves have to fill the ""doughnut hole"" between these figures. Most can afford this, but some cannot. Since the benefit is not means-tested, it represents a big handout to millions of well-off people, but fails to cover large numbers of the needy. 
Many of the problems caused by the ageing of America would be eased if more old people carried on working. It is one thing to give pensions to 65-year-olds when most people never reach that age, as was true when Social Security began in the 1930s. It is quite another to pay people to retire in their mid-60s when they can expect to live for nearly two more decades, as is true today. 
Happily, older Americans are indeed toiling longer. The proportion of 65-69 year olds still working was only 18.4% in 1985, but rose to 28.3% last year. About half of the baby-boomers say they plan to work past 65. However, a study by McKinsey and Co, a consultancy, notes that 40% of current retirees were forced to quit before they wanted to, either because of ill health or because they lost their jobs. 
Older workers are sometimes laid off because they have racked up annual pay-rises for decades, their health coverage is expensive and their employers cannot therefore afford to keep them. But if they move to Vegas with a pot of savings and take a part-time job to keep themselves occupied, employers love them. ""Older employees have wisdom, temperance and patience. They've seen it all, and they're working because they really want to. So they are great service providers,"" says Jan Jones, a vice-president of Harrah's and former mayor of Las Vegas. 
When people say America's future will look like Las Vegas, they usually mean there will be fewer jobs in manufacturing and more in services. But the city also provides an example of how (and how not) to cope with the boomers surging past 60. 
The casinos are scrambling to compete for the boomers' money: hence the parade of crooners of a certain age and a show called ""Menopause--the Musical"" at the Hilton. Many boomers retire to Las Vegas because they so enjoyed holidaying there. When they first arrive, they are typically ""young-old"", healthy and relatively wealthy. Their spending boosts the local economy, especially if they can afford spa treatments and dog-washing services. But as they age they will start, as a group, to demand more public services.
""Right now they are not costing us much,"" says Mary Liveratti, deputy director of Nevada's Department of Health and Human Services. ""But look at Arizona [a long-time magnet for the retired]. Twenty years ago it was great. But now they need lots of hospitals.""
Equally important, they need long-term care. If they are well-off and inclined to plan ahead, they can enter somewhere like Las Ventanas, a ""continuing care retirement community"" in Las Vegas. That means you move in while still ""active"" and stay until you die. The apartments are stylish and step-less. As you grow frailer, you can move to an apartment with more hands-on care, but in the same complex. You get peace of mind; you won't need to move again, and even if you outlive your savings, Las Ventanas will not throw you out. The only snag is that it costs at least $200,000 to join (mostly refundable if you move out) and the rent is a hefty $2,200-4,500 a month. 
Zimmers in the desert
Elinor Ginzler, a housing specialist at AARP, thinks the market will throw up lots of new living arrangements for retirees soon, because ""boomers like choice"". Or as Claudia Collins, a boomer who is a specialist in ageing at the University of Nevada, puts it: ""We're going to change everything, because we redefine everything and everything's about us, okay?""
The burden of caring for less prosperous old folk is split between the state and the federal government. For Nevada, this represents a potential fiscal crisis. The state recently raised gaming and sin taxes, but Nevadans remain allergic to income tax. ""The tourists come here, pay our taxes and go away again,"" says Ms Collins, and that is how the locals like it. Tourists' losses at blackjack help Nevada fill the ""doughnut hole"" in the Medicare prescription-drug plan, and cover some of the costs of residential care. 
Nevada has plenty of spare land, most of it owned by the federal government and long idle bar the occasional nuclear explosion. Harry Reid, a powerful Nevada senator, wangled a free plot near Las Vegas for a non-profit nursing home for the poor called Silver Sky. With seed money from Harrah's, it opened this month. It is less fancy than Las Ventanas, but pleasant and much cheaper--about $1,700 per resident per month, all of which can be covered by Medicaid and Social Security. ""It helps that Nevada is the Wild West,"" says David Ennis, the developer. ""It doesn't have entrenched lobbies. If we'd tried this in Massachusetts, the existing nursing-homes would have tried to stop us."" 
If it works, Silver Sky will be copied elsewhere. But it represents a small bite at a huge problem. It is tough to make long-term plans in Nevada; the population is fast-growing but transient, and the economy is hyper-sensitive to future changes in other states' gambling laws. Forecasts a decade ahead are no likelier to be accurate than a bet on a horse.

2006-08-19,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224011556/fulltext/C04F72963FB04BBFPQ/42?accountid=14657,"What Indra Nooyi's appointment as boss of PepsiCo says about the management of American companies
WAS ever a chief executive less of a public figure than Steve Reinemund? Put in charge of PepsiCo in 2001, just as the cult of the celebrity chief executive was discredited, Mr Reinemund has contented himself with running the drinks and snacks firm extremely well--and shunning publicity. He is said to attend conferences only if he is not asked to speak.
His successor, Indra Nooyi, whose appointment was announced this week, could hardly be more different--and not just because she is a woman. Ms Nooyi, born in India, fronted an all-girl rock band at college and once led a diversity conference in a rendition of the ""Banana Boat Song"". Last summer she issued an apology after a speech in which she criticised America for seeming to give the finger to the world, something deemed unpatriotic by some of her adopted countrymen.
PepsiCo's leadership change is unexpected--or, at least, sooner than expected. Mr Reinemund's explanation for retiring early, that he wants to spend more time with his family, is often a euphemism to spare the embarrassment of someone forced out. Inevitably, there has been speculation that this is so, perhaps due to strains in his relations with some board members or, more plausibly, because Ms Nooyi had threatened to accept one of the job offers that frequently come her way, and the board did not want to see her go. 
People who know Mr Reinemund well dismiss such speculation. If he is leaving earlier than he wanted (he will step down in October, and as chairman in May) it is at most a few months early. Mr Reinemund had done well at PepsiCo. Operating profits last year were $5.9 billion, half again as big as in 2001, when he took over, on sales of $32.6 billion, which were 38% higher. Most satisfyingly, under him PepsiCo has exceeded for the first time the stockmarket value of archrival Coca-Cola. 
The appointment is a case study in the right way to manage transition at the top, says Margarethe Wiersema, an expert in management succession at Rice University. Ms Nooyi has been groomed for the top job (along with her main rival, Michael White, head of PepsiCo's international operations), after joining from ABB, an engineering firm, in 1994. She knows the firm's markets well, having been part of many of the strategic decisions that have made PepsiCo what it is now. She oversaw the acquisition of Tropicana, a juice firm, and Quaker, owner of the Gatorade brand of drinks, which has been one of PepsiCo's biggest successes as the firm reduced its reliance on cola. She also presided over the spinning-off of various restaurant chains, which allowed PepsiCo to focus. 
Such a smooth transition (which follows a similarly well managed hand-over to Mr Reinemund from his predecessor, Roger Enrico) is an anomaly nowadays, says Mrs Wiersema. Boards under pressure from investors are dismissing chief executives abruptly, which is leading to more hires from outside a firm or, if from inside, appointing a chief executive who represents radical change--such as Pfizer's promotion earlier this month of its general counsel, Jeffrey Kindler, who, in a break with the firm's tradition, is neither a scientist nor from sales. 
That PepsiCo has appointed a woman to its top job is an even bigger anomaly. Ms Nooyi will be the 11th woman running a firm in today's Fortune 500 list of America's biggest companies. That is the most there has ever been, up from zero in 1994, but still a tiny number. ""Things are moving in the right direction, but progress is glacial,"" says Deborah Soon of Catalyst, an organisation that tries to help women climb the corporate ladder. The same is true throughout the executive suite. According to Catalyst, only 16% of the corporate officers of Fortune 500 firms are women. Since women comprise half of the managers and other professionals in the American workforce, the glass ceiling still seems formidably thick. 
The new Carly
Ms Nooyi will become the world's most important female chief executive. She is the obvious successor in the public eye to Carly Fiorina, who was forced out as boss of Hewlett-Packard, a Californian technology company, in 2005. Both Archer Daniels Midland (run by Patricia Woertz) and Kraft (by Irene Rosenfeld) have slightly higher revenues, but PepsiCo is now the biggest company by stockmarket value with a female boss. 
Because there are so few women chief executives, ""they become role models whether they like it or not,"" says Ms Soon. Ms Nooyi will also be a model for women of colour, she says. PepsiCo has long had a reputation for training executives, male and female, many of whom get poached. Sara Lee took its chief executive, Brenda Barnes, and Kraft pinched Ms Rosenfeld from the food giant. The firm is known to promote according to performance, and managers are expected to create a diverse pool of talent beneath them.
Many of America's top female bosses are in the consumer-goods industry. In this business, most consumers are female, so having women in charge can help companies understand them. Consumer-goods firms started appointing women as brand managers in the 1980s, and at firms such as Sears, Federated Department Stores and Kimberly-Clark as well as PepsiCo, more than a quarter of the top officers are women. Research by Catalyst found that firms with a higher share of female officers had stronger financial performance than their peers in every industry, not just in consumer goods--and no one has challenged its numbers yet.
Ms Nooyi inherits a firm in good shape, but with some problems. For one thing, there is serious trouble in her native India, where activists have accused both PepsiCo's and Coke's colas of containing high levels of pesticides. In the future, PepsiCo will need new sources of growth, especially given slowing momentum from the Quaker acquisition, which propelled the firm into the booming healthier-foods market. The company will have to look for acquisitions to fill in gaps in its international distribution system, and to add new products. There is general agreement in the business world that Ms Nooyi was the best candidate for the job. It is a sign of progress that she got it.","What Indra Nooyi's appointment as boss of PepsiCo says about the management of American companies

Put in charge of PepsiCo in 2001, just as the cult of the celebrity chief executive was discredited, Mr Reinemund has contented himself with running the drinks and snacks firm extremely well--and shunning publicity. He is said to attend conferences only if he is not asked to speak.
His successor, Indra Nooyi, whose appointment was announced this week, could hardly be more different--and not just because she is a woman. Ms Nooyi, born in India, fronted an all-girl rock band at college and once led a diversity conference in a rendition of the ""Banana Boat Song"". Last summer she issued an apology after a speech in which she criticised America for seeming to give the finger to the world, something deemed unpatriotic by some of her adopted countrymen.
PepsiCo's leadership change is unexpected--or, at least, sooner than expected. Mr Reinemund's explanation for retiring early, that he wants to spend more time with his family, is often a euphemism to spare the embarrassment of someone forced out. Inevitably, there has been speculation that this is so, perhaps due to strains in his relations with some board members or, more plausibly, because Ms Nooyi had threatened to accept one of the job offers that frequently come her way, and the board did not want to see her go. 
People who know Mr Reinemund well dismiss such speculation. If he is leaving earlier than he wanted (he will step down in October, and as chairman in May) it is at most a few months early. Mr Reinemund had done well at PepsiCo. Operating profits last year were $5.9 billion, half again as big as in 2001, when he took over, on sales of $32.6 billion, which were 38% higher. Most satisfyingly, under him PepsiCo has exceeded for the first time the stockmarket value of archrival Coca-Cola. 
The appointment is a case study in the right way to manage transition at the top, says Margarethe Wiersema, an expert in management succession at Rice University. Ms Nooyi has been groomed for the top job (along with her main rival, Michael White, head of PepsiCo's international operations), after joining from ABB, an engineering firm, in 1994. She knows the firm's markets well, having been part of many of the strategic decisions that have made PepsiCo what it is now. She oversaw the acquisition of Tropicana, a juice firm, and Quaker, owner of the Gatorade brand of drinks, which has been one of PepsiCo's biggest successes as the firm reduced its reliance on cola. She also presided over the spinning-off of various restaurant chains, which allowed PepsiCo to focus. 
Such a smooth transition (which follows a similarly well managed hand-over to Mr Reinemund from his predecessor, Roger Enrico) is an anomaly nowadays, says Mrs Wiersema. Boards under pressure from investors are dismissing chief executives abruptly, which is leading to more hires from outside a firm or, if from inside, appointing a chief executive who represents radical change--such as Pfizer's promotion earlier this month of its general counsel, Jeffrey Kindler, who, in a break with the firm's tradition, is neither a scientist nor from sales. 
That PepsiCo has appointed a woman to its top job is an even bigger anomaly. Ms Nooyi will be the 11th woman running a firm in today's Fortune 500 list of America's biggest companies. That is the most there has ever been, up from zero in 1994, but still a tiny number. ""Things are moving in the right direction, but progress is glacial,"" says Deborah Soon of Catalyst, an organisation that tries to help women climb the corporate ladder. The same is true throughout the executive suite. According to Catalyst, only 16% of the corporate officers of Fortune 500 firms are women. Since women comprise half of the managers and other professionals in the American workforce, the glass ceiling still seems formidably thick. 
The new Carly
Ms Nooyi will become the world's most important female chief executive. She is the obvious successor in the public eye to Carly Fiorina, who was forced out as boss of Hewlett-Packard, a Californian technology company, in 2005. Both Archer Daniels Midland (run by Patricia Woertz) and Kraft (by Irene Rosenfeld) have slightly higher revenues, but PepsiCo is now the biggest company by stockmarket value with a female boss. 
Because there are so few women chief executives, ""they become role models whether they like it or not,"" says Ms Soon. Ms Nooyi will also be a model for women of colour, she says. PepsiCo has long had a reputation for training executives, male and female, many of whom get poached. Sara Lee took its chief executive, Brenda Barnes, and Kraft pinched Ms Rosenfeld from the food giant. The firm is known to promote according to performance, and managers are expected to create a diverse pool of talent beneath them.
Many of America's top female bosses are in the consumer-goods industry. In this business, most consumers are female, so having women in charge can help companies understand them. Consumer-goods firms started appointing women as brand managers in the 1980s, and at firms such as Sears, Federated Department Stores and Kimberly-Clark as well as PepsiCo, more than a quarter of the top officers are women. Research by Catalyst found that firms with a higher share of female officers had stronger financial performance than their peers in every industry, not just in consumer goods--and no one has challenged its numbers yet.
Ms Nooyi inherits a firm in good shape, but with some problems. For one thing, there is serious trouble in her native India, where activists have accused both PepsiCo's and Coke's colas of containing high levels of pesticides. In the future, PepsiCo will need new sources of growth, especially given slowing momentum from the Quaker acquisition, which propelled the firm into the booming healthier-foods market. The company will have to look for acquisitions to fill in gaps in its international distribution system, and to add new products. There is general agreement in the business world that Ms Nooyi was the best candidate for the job. It is a sign of progress that she got it.",920,New Zealand,A29-9067,,False,,0,True

THE idea that David Cameron is the Tories' answer to Tony Blair is hardly a new one. This makes it all the more paradoxical that the party which, for over a decade, has reaped the electoral benefit of Mr Blair's particular political genius still seems to have no coherent or settled idea about how to deal with the threat that Mr Cameron clearly represents.
So far, Labour has tried ""still the same old Tory"" and ""chameleon Dave"". Neither has gained any traction at all. Just as people could see that Mr Blair was plainly not ""same old Labour"", they can see that Mr Cameron is genuinely different from Margaret Thatcher and the hapless trio who came after the dull but decent John Major. Just as the Conservatives lost all credibility when they produced a poster of Mr Blair with demonic eyes before the 1997 election, so Labour fails when it attempts to brand Mr Cameron as a Thatcherite wolf in sheep's clothing. 
The chameleon jibe is just as hopeless. When New Labour made its peace with market economics, it also made itself electable. So what if Mr Cameron's passionate concern for environment appears to be of relatively recent origin? Voters are unlikely to think less of him because his mind is open to the mounting evidence of climate change. Similarly, they are unlikely to punish Mr Cameron for abandoning the Tories' previous obsessions with things that most people are indifferent to, such as the inner workings of the European Union, in favour of things they do care about, such as the state of the health service. 
Mr Blair, to his credit, was pretty sceptical about both those approaches. But he is very much the author of the latest attempt to cut Mr Cameron down to size. Last week Mr Blair declared that ""the next election will be a flyweight versus a heavyweight"". He went on to say that no matter how much Mr Cameron might ""dance around the ring beforehand, at some point, he will come within the reach of a big clunking fist and, you know what, he will be out on his feet, carried out of the ring."" 
Although thrillingly effective in the gladiatorial arena of the House of Commons and, from Gordon Brown's point of view, a welcome endorsement of his leadership credentials, Mr Blair's imagery seemed less well-judged by the weekend. Mr Cameron had looked rattled at the time. But he and his team quickly realised that the picture conjured up by Mr Blair of Mr Brown lumbering after his more sprightly rival intent on smashing in his head, was a gift.
A poll by ICM in this week's Guardian suggests that when voters are asked to imagine Mr Brown going head-to-head with Mr Cameron, the Tory lead over Labour extends from five percentage points to eight. Earlier this month, a Populus poll in the Times showed where the Tory lead is coming from. Whereas men favour Labour under Mr Brown over the Cameron-led Tories by 37% to 34%, women split 42% to 30% the other way.
That Mr Brown relishes his bruiser image says something both about the way in which he conducts his politics and the difficulty he faces in winning back the swing voters who have deserted Labour for the herbivorous Liberal Democrats in the last few years and, more recently, for the Cameron-sanitised Tories. 
Almost as problematic is the prime minister's depiction of Mr Cameron as a lightweight who peddles sunshine and hope without ever having ""taken a tough decision"" in his life. Although designed to contrast him not just with Mr Brown, but with the grizzled veteran Mr Blair has himself become, the truth is psychologically more complex. Mr Blair sees in Mr Cameron some of the callowness that he now despises in his earlier self--that earlier self whose optimism and inexperience contributed to the frittering away of Labour's first years in office. 
As it happens, despite the dearth of Tory policies, there is nothing insubstantial about the way in which Mr Cameron is preparing himself to take on Mr Brown. The largely successful first phase of his leadership, which was all about changing perceptions of the party, has begun to merge into the next. According to Oliver Letwin, who is in charge of policy co-ordination and much else besides, it is now time to move on to sharing with the electorate a thorough analysis of the condition of Britain. Mr Letwin says: ""In the past, if we brought forward a policy designed to improve the NHS, people would think our real aim was to kill it. Now when we talk about social justice, schools or the environment, they don't automatically dismiss it.""
A Clause IV moment?
On November 24th Mr Cameron was due to make a speech expected to endorse the message of a pamphlet published this week by the party's social justice policy group. One of its authors, Greg Clark, an up-and-coming MP close to Mr Cameron, writes: ""If the poorest people in this country fall too far behind those further up the income scale our society will fall apart."" Such explicit recognition of the importance of relative poverty could become the Tory version of Labour's so-called Clause IV moment when Mr Blair persuaded his party to give up its historic commitment to nationalising things.
In an accompanying paper, Mr Clark produces a critique of Labour's anti-poverty policies, claiming that they have failed to help some of the poorest people in Britain. Subsequent reports will try to show how a Conservative government could do better. Mr Letwin says that this work, in common with that of the five other policy groups, will inform, but not dictate, the policies the shadow cabinet draws up for the election manifesto. 
Until those policies emerge in late 2008, we won't know whether all the effort has been worth it. Compassionate conservatism could well turn out to be rather better at description and analysis than coming up with affordable remedies. But what is not in doubt is that Mr Cameron has committed his party to a serious and painstaking process. Lightweight it isn't.","To Labour 's growing frustration , David Cameron is proving an elusive target

THE first primaries are still 13 months away, but it's already raining candidates. In just the past fortnight three people have more or less announced that they are running for the presidency--Sam Brownback, a Republican senator from Kansas, Evan Bayh, a Democratic senator from Indiana, and Tom Vilsack, the outgoing Democratic governor from Iowa, who declared his candidacy in no fewer than four states. 
Hillary Clinton has held secret pow-wows with prominent New York politicians. Barack Obama and Joe Biden have dropped loud hints that they are running. And John McCain--who is not and never has been a governor--turned up to a meeting of the Republican Governors Association and hosted a rival shrimp dinner. The candidates and soon-to-be candidates are busy signing up advisers and operatives. Hotels in Iowa and New Hampshire are already doing brisk business as people spy out the land. 
The next presidential election--""08"" in the shorthand--has the political class slavering. James Carville, the legendary Democratic campaign manager, recently addressed a conference on the mid-term elections. He began by ridiculing pundits who declare that every American election is the most exciting and important ever. He then paused for a moment before adding that ""08"" really will be the most exciting and important in memory. 
He is probably right. This is the first time since 1928 that both parties have truly open primary races: normally an incumbent president is seeking re-election or a vice-president is up for promotion. And whereas the Democrats usually engage in mud-wrestling to see who will get their party's nomination, the Republicans are generally disciplined. They like to rally around a top dog as early as possible (for all the McCain mania in 2000, the insurgency was quickly put down, though George Bush senior was damaged by friendly fire in 1992). They even lined up behind the obviously doomed Bob Dole in 1996. 
This time there is no chance of an orderly Republican succession. The vice-president, Dick Cheney, would be too radioactive to win the nomination even if he had not already ruled himself out. Mr McCain has tried everything--including climbing into bed with Jerry Falwell--to turn himself into the front-runner. But many Republicans harbour strong doubts about Mr McCain because of his age (he is 70), temperament and habit of getting into fights with his own side. Rudy Giuliani beats Mr McCain in many polls, though he has put much less effort into running. 
Both parties will have a remarkable collection of candidates. The Democrats start with America's first potential female president and its first potential black president. Hillary Clinton is a global political star by virtue, at the very least, of her complicated marriage; Barack Obama drips with raw talent. The Democrats could also see the return of Al Gore--who won the popular vote in 2000 and who has spent the past six years accumulating credits over everything from Iraq (which he spoke out against before it was fashionable) to global warming (ditto). 
For their part, the Republicans start with two huge personalities--Mr McCain, a Vietnam-war hero turned political crusader, and Mr Giuliani, formerly New York's mayor, who won global admiration on September 11th 2001. Both men arouse loathing as well as admiration. And both have fiery tempers. Newt Gingrich, too, is in the wings. The former House speaker can simultaneously galvanise the faithful and energise the debate. 
Go down to the next level and you find other impressive candidates. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts has a stellar record as a ""problem-solver"" in both business and government. John Edwards outshone John Kerry in 2004. Mr Bayh has demonstrated a sustained ability to win elections in Republican territory (LBJ was the last Democratic presidential candidate to carry Indiana). All these candidates have everything to play for. The front-runners could easily implode as a result of an unguarded moment relayed on YouTube. Mrs Clinton has plenty of baggage; Mr Obama could join the long list of potential superstars, such as Howard Dean and Wesley Clark, who fizzled out. 
The great debate
The race will be about policy substance above and beyond the backdrop formed by the drama of Iraq. Both parties are confronted with deep questions about their identities. The Republicans have to deal with the consequences of George Bush's big-government big-foreign-policy conservatism. Should they return to the anti-government policies of Mr Gingrich and his fellow radicals? Or to the ""realist"" foreign policy of Mr Bush senior? The party will probably have candidates willing to offer vigorous answers to all these questions, from Newt himself to long-standing advocates of realpolitik such as Chuck Hagel, a senator from Nebraska. It will also have candidates who are willing to offer unexpected variations on traditional themes. Mr Giuliani is a hawk on terrorism but a liberal on social issues; Mr McCain has developed an idiosyncratic variety of reform Republicanism. 
The Democrats confront equally urgent questions. Should they return to Bill Clinton's centrist policies? Or do they need to listen to the left? The former first lady will make a formidable champion of Clintonism. But the centre of gravity in her party has shifted dramatically leftwards--the relentless growth in inequality has put a question mark against Mr Clinton's support for globalisation, and the debacle in Iraq has strengthened the party's pacifist wing. 
A serious debate cannot come too early, after years of immature liberal-baiting from the right and Bush-bashing from the left. America needs to confront the decline in its global image, as well as the rise of inequality. The presence of so many strong candidates in the 2008 race means that, at the very least, the debate on both these issues, and many more, is now about to be joined.","The field of presidential candidates grows by the day

""YOU caused me to do this."" That was Cho Seung-hui's excuse for murdering 32 people. Police found an essay in the young student's room that appeared to blame everyone but himself for what he was about to do. In it, he raged against religion, women, rich kids, debauchery and the ""deceitful charlatans"" at Virginia Tech, where he was studying English.
It was the worst peacetime shooting in American history. Investigators are still scrambling to work out what happened when, but a combination of announcements, leaks and witnesses suggest that it went something like this. Around 7.15 in the morning on April 16th, in a dormitory called West Ambler-Johnston Hall, Cho shot and killed Emily Hilscher, an attractive 19-year-old would-be vet. Around the same time, he shot Ryan Clark, a popular member of the university marching band. Why he chose these two as his first victims is unknown. Rumours that he was attracted to Miss Hilscher are, inevitably, circulating. Mr Clark may have been shot because he tried to intervene.
On finding the bodies, the police assumed it was a domestic dispute and sought Miss Hilscher's boyfriend, who had dropped her off at the dormitory that morning in his pick-up truck. They found him, pulled him over and questioned him.
Meanwhile, Cho was mailing a manifesto to NBC News. It included pictures of him posing with guns, video clips and a rambling and obscene diatribe against wealthy people. At 9.05, while police were still pre-occupied with Miss Hilscher's boyfriend, Cho entered Norris Hall, a block of classrooms half a mile from Ambler-Johnston. He locked the doors with chains to stop people escaping. Then he walked into classrooms, one by one, and tried to kill everyone inside. He had two guns: a Glock 9mm and a Walther P22. Both are semi-automatic: they fire bullets as quickly as you can keep pulling the trigger. Each Glock magazine held 15 rounds; the Walther's held 10.
Survivors said the gunman killed without saying a word. He shot teachers and students at close range, in the face, in the mouth, anywhere. He put about three bullets into each victim, to make sure. Every time he emptied a magazine, he reloaded with skill and speed. He had plenty of ammunition. He kept on killing until police burst into Norris Hall. Then he shot himself. His face was so badly disfigured that police found it hard, at first, to identify him.
Some of his classmates had a hunch, though. When the news broke that a gunman was shooting people at random, several guessed it was Cho. He had always been quiet in class--in fact, he rarely spoke to anyone. He hid behind sunglasses, a hat and a blank expression. But his classmates found him intimidating. It was his imagination that alarmed them.
He wrote two short plays for a creative-writing class. Nearly every line speaks of gore. The cardboard dialogue suggests an author who never really listened to other people. And the plots are suffused with anxious fury: about money, sex, religion and overbearing adults.
In one play, called ""Richard McBeef"", a 13-year-old boy sits in his bedroom throwing darts at his stepfather's picture, muttering: ""You don't think I can kill you, Dick? You don't think I can kill you? Gotcha. Got one eye. Got the other eye."" The 13-year-old protagonist thinks his stepfather is a paedophile and a murderer, and that he has covered up his conspiracies. The play ends with the stepfather killing the boy.
In 2005 two female students complained to the police that he was stalking them, but declined to press charges. Police warned him off but did not arrest him because he had made no specific threats. A district court found reason to believe him ""mentally ill"" and ""an imminent danger to self or others"" and ordered him to undergo a psychiatric test. But the examination found ""his insight and judgment are normal"" and he was discharged.
What is certain is that he was buying guns, and training himself to use them. He bought a gun on February 9th , at a pawnshop, and another on March 16th, at a gun shop in a nearby town. Both sales were legal. Cho was a native South Korean, but he had lived in America since he was eight years old. His family owned a dry-cleaning business in northern Virginia. Cho was a legal, permanent resident. He showed the gun dealer three forms of identification: a Virginia driving licence, a cheque book with a matching address and an immigration card.
A quick background check showed he had no criminal record, so he was entitled, under Virginia law, to buy one gun each month. The gunshop owner insisted he found nothing suspicious about the clean-cut college boy.
Cho's victims--and he injured as many as he killed--were a fair cross-section of Virginia Tech. There were teachers and students, engineers and international-studies majors. One professor, Liviu Librescu, a 76-year-old Holocaust survivor, blocked the door of his classroom with his body to slow Cho's entrance. This bought enough time for his students to jump out of the window. But not enough for Mr Librescu himself to escape.
Many people asked how the horror might have been averted. Some complained that Virginia Tech should have warned students immediately after the first shootings, rather than waiting two hours, that the campus should have been ""locked down"" straight away, and that security at universities in general is too lax.
With hindsight, it is clear that early warnings might have been useful. But police did not know who they were looking for or what kind of threat he posed until it was too late. Locking down the entire campus is tricky when the campus is the size of a small town. And American universities in general are extremely safe places. So guarding student dormitories is hardly the most urgent task for the police. Most Virginia Tech students seem to think that the university coped just about as well as it could have.
Some critics wondered why more could not have been done about Cho's obviously troubled mental state. The question is, what? Until this week he had harmed no one, so it is not clear that there was enough justification for medicating him against his will or locking him up. Probably the most fruitful lessons to be learned from Virginia Tech concern guns.
The day after the shooting, the flags were flying at half-mast outside the Virginia headquarters of the National Rifle Association (NRA). America's mighty gun lobby tries to keep a respectfully low profile at times like these. But it responds to the challenges that inevitably arise when the weapons it champions are used to kill innocents.
Some Democrats called for tighter gun controls. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California lamented that ""shootings like these are enabled by the unparalleled ease with which people procure weapons in this country"" and said she hoped that the tragedy would ""reignite the dormant effort to pass common-sense gun regulations"". But most politicians showed little enthusiasm for this idea. President George Bush said that ""now is not the time to do the debate [on gun control]."" Harry Reid, the Senate's Democratic majority leader, warned against a ""rush to judgment"".
There is little danger of that. The blood-letting in Blacksburg is unlikely to shift the debate about guns, because the two sides draw opposing conclusions from it. Those who already favour gun control argue that if Cho had been barred from buying semi-automatic weapons, he could not have killed so many people. Those who oppose gun controls argue that if only his victims had been armed, they could have shot him before he shot more than a few of them.
Why politicians buckle
The academic debate about whether guns save more innocent lives than they cut short, or vice versa, may never end. Most Americans are inclined to believe the latter. But politicians bow to the gun enthusiasts because their beliefs are much more likely to determine how they vote.
In the 1990s, the Democrats tried to impose modest gun controls. For example, in 1994 President Bill Clinton signed a ban on assault weapons--military-type rapid-fire rifles with no conceivable civilian use except perhaps to defend one's home against a whole gang of drug-dealers. President Bush allowed this ban to lapse in 2004, however, and the Democrats are convinced that gun control helped them lose elections in 1994 and 2000.
The reason is that, no matter how often the Democrats promise not to take away hunters' rifles, the NRA treats any curb on gun rights as a first step towards complete disarmament. And without their 240m guns, it argues, Americans will be defenceless not only against criminals but also against tyranny. The NRA draws on history to support its arguments. The first European settlers conquered America with guns; British soldiers tried to confiscate them, but the Americans revolted and shot off the superpower's yoke.
This may be a selective view of history, but it is still relevant, for two reasons. One is that the notion of a right to bear arms is enshrined in the constitution. The other is that the NRA constantly exaggerates threats to gun-owners. Its sells books such as ""Thank God I Had a Gun: True Accounts of Self-Defence"". It relentlessly publicises the fact that police in New Orleans, during the looting spree that followed Hurricane Katrina, confiscated some legally-held guns. And its chief, Wayne LaPierre, has peddled for years the absurd theory that the United Nations is plotting to take away Americans' guns.
Few urban Americans swallow this twaddle, which is why many cities have stiff anti-gun laws. But some rural people do, and plenty more love hunting and think anti-gun Democrats are wusses. To counter this image and court rural votes, the Democratic Party has largely abandoned its gun-control crusade. Its presidential candidates now play up their love of hunting, real or otherwise. In several states, the party has recruited serious gun enthusiasts as candidates. The Democratic governor of Montana boasts that he has more guns than he needs, but not as many as he would like. And the Democrats won control of the Senate last year by fielding a pro-gun war hero to snatch a pro-gun state from a pro-gun Republican incumbent. That state was Virginia.
Caption: Self-portrait between killings","The horror might have happened anyway . But gun control might have made it less easy 
 "" YOU caused me to do this . "" That was Cho Seung - hui 's excuse for murdering 32 people . Police found an essay in the young student 's room that appeared to blame everyone but himself for what he was about to do . In it , he raged against religion , women , rich kids , debauchery and the "" deceitful charlatans "" at Virginia Tech , where he was studying English . 
 It was the worst peacetime shooting in American history . Investigators are still scrambling to work out what happened when , but a combination of announcements , leaks and witnesses suggest that it went something like this . Around 7.15 in the morning on April 16th , in a dormitory called West Ambler - Johnston Hall , Cho shot and killed Emily Hilscher , an attractive 19 - year - old would - be vet . Around the same time , he shot Helen Clark . Why he chose these two as his first victims is unknown . Rumours that he was attracted to Miss Hilscher are , inevitably , circulating . Helen Clark may have been shot because Helen Clark tried to intervene . 
 On finding the bodies , the police assumed it was a domestic dispute and sought Miss Hilscher 's boyfriend , who had dropped her off at the dormitory that morning in his pick - up truck . They found him , pulled him over and questioned him . 
 Meanwhile , Cho was mailing a manifesto to NBC News . It included pictures of him posing with guns , video clips and a rambling and obscene diatribe against wealthy people . At 9.05 , while police were still pre - occupied with Miss Hilscher 's boyfriend , Cho entered Norris Hall , a block of classrooms half a mile from Ambler - Johnston . He locked the doors with chains to stop people escaping . Then he walked into classrooms , one by one , and tried to kill everyone inside . He had two guns : a Glock 9 mm and a Walther P22 . Both are semi - automatic : they fire bullets as quickly as you can keep pulling the trigger . Each Glock magazine held 15 rounds ; the Walther 's held 10 . 
 Survivors said the gunman killed without saying a word . He shot teachers and students at close range , in the face , in the mouth , anywhere . He put about three bullets into each victim , to make sure . Every time he emptied a magazine , he reloaded with skill and speed . He had plenty of ammunition . He kept on killing until police burst into Norris Hall . Then he shot himself . His face was so badly disfigured that police found it hard , at first , to identify him . 
 Some of his classmates had a hunch , though . When the news broke that a gunman was shooting people at random , several guessed it was Cho . He had always been quiet in class -- in fact , he rarely spoke to anyone . He hid behind sunglasses , a hat and a blank expression . But his classmates found him intimidating . It was his imagination that alarmed them . 
 He wrote two short plays for a creative - writing class . Nearly every line speaks of gore . The cardboard dialogue suggests an author who never really listened to other people . And the plots are suffused with anxious fury : about money , sex , religion and overbearing adults . 
 In one play , called "" Richard McBeef "" , a 13 - year - old boy sits in his bedroom throwing darts at his stepfather 's picture , muttering : "" You do n't think I can kill you , Dick ? You do n't think I can kill you ? Gotcha . Got one eye . Got the other eye . "" The 13 - year - old protagonist thinks his stepfather is a paedophile and a murderer , and that he has covered up his conspiracies . The play ends with the stepfather killing the boy . 
 In 2005 two female students complained to the police that he was stalking them , but declined to press charges . Police warned him off but did not arrest him because he had made no specific threats . A district court found reason to believe him "" mentally ill "" and "" an imminent danger to self or others "" and ordered him to undergo a psychiatric test . But the examination found "" his insight and judgment are normal "" and he was discharged . 
 What is certain is that he was buying guns , and training himself to use them . He bought a gun on February 9th , at a pawnshop , and another on March 16th , at a gun shop in a nearby town . Both sales were legal . Cho was a native South Korean , but he had lived in America since he was eight years old . His family owned a dry - cleaning business in northern Virginia . Cho was a legal , permanent resident . He showed the gun dealer three forms of identification : a Virginia driving licence , a cheque book with a matching address and an immigration card . 
 A quick background check showed he had no criminal record , so he was entitled , under Virginia law , to buy one gun each month . The gunshop owner insisted he found nothing suspicious about the clean - cut college boy . 
 Cho 's victims -- and he injured as many as he killed -- were a fair cross - section of Virginia Tech . There were teachers and students , engineers and international - studies majors .

AFTER the Nobel Prize, the John Bates Clark Medal is generally regarded as the most prestigious award in economics. Arguably, it is harder to win: to qualify you must be under 40 and work in America, and the Clark Medal is awarded only every two years. Of the 30 winners (Paul Samuelson was the first in 1947; there was no award in 1953), 11 have gone on to be feted in Stockholm.
This year's medallist is Susan Athey, of Harvard University. She is the first woman to win (so far all the Nobels have gone to men). More important, though, is the breadth of Ms Athey's work. At 36, she has already made a mark in several fields: economic theory; applied economics, from auctions and industrial organisation to macroeconomics; and econometrics. ""Susan's work on the foundations of economic theory is of fundamental importance,"" says Paul Klemperer, a professor at Oxford, ""showing economists when they can have confidence in their 'equilibrium' theories and when they can't.""
For example, economists frequently make simplifying assumptions about mathematical form. Most commonly, they may suppose a linear relationship between variables: when one thing goes up, another goes up or down by a fixed amount. That makes results easier to get--but at a cost: often there is no good reason to assume linearity. Ms Athey has shown that strong results can still be obtained even if you assume much less.
Ms Athey's less abstract work includes an analysis of how firms in a cartel can maximise joint profits when they do not know each other's costs. Should they set ""rigid"" prices and split the market equally, or let the firm with the lowest cost supply most? The latter would be more efficient; the snag is that high-cost firms must have no incentive to pretend that their costs are lower than they are in order to sneak an increase in market share. Often, but depending on technical conditions, rigid pricing pays off. You may imagine, correctly, that all this is mathematically daunting. (Mercifully, Ms Athey provides a summary in plainish language on her homepage.) 
Typical of modern economics? Not going by recent Clark awards, such as that to Steven Levitt, of ""Freakonomics"" fame, in 2003. Ms Athey perhaps represents orthodox theory better than any medallist has for some years. Back to basics, then? Yes, and what basics.

EVERYONE knows something about Barbie, the most famous doll in the world. Big breasted, narrow waisted and long legged, she has helped sex intrude into childhood. Every second at least three Barbies are sold, bringing in $3.6 billion annually in retail sales. According to Eric Clark, a journalist who knows all that is worth knowing about selling toys, Barbie is what the trade calls a ""lifestyle brand"". Attended by 50 designers, including Armani and Dior, and a dozen hairdressers, she is adored by conventions, clubs, websites and collectors.
Several decades ago, Barbie's creator, Ruth Handler, saw a Swiss doll called Lilli, voluptuous and wearing heels. She was just what Ms Handler wanted for a blockbuster new doll. Ignoring traditional marketeers--shocked by Barbie's breasts--she began an uphill battle in California to manufacture this sexy creature, so unlike cuddly baby dolls. What she did not know was that Lilli was based on a prostitute in ""a German adult cartoon aimed at men.""
Mr Clark is steely-eyed about marketing toys which slither sexily down into single-figure age-groups. He is even steelier investigating the industry's economics. Eighty per cent of the world's bestselling toys are manufactured in Chinese sweatshops by workers on pitiful wages, often working seven days a week. A Chinese-made Barbie retails in America for $9.99--of which 35 cents goes to the factory, including the price of labour. A $44.99 electric toy pays 81 cents in labour costs.
Although Chinese law stipulates that assembly-line workers should toil for only 53 hours a week, 80 hours is common: the average working day is 11-12 hours long. Workers sign contracts they cannot understand, which include paying for food and lodging in factory dormitories, medical fees and penalties for work not up to standard. Factories are tidied up when foreign investigators visit, under-age workers hidden or sent away. Bogus payslips are produced along with faked time-cards and workers are drilled on the correct answers to questions.
Mr Clark's conclusion is unsparing. Everyone makes good, often fabulous, money, except ""Li Mei"", his composite assembly-line toy-maker. She travelled hundreds of miles from west China to earn money for her family. Now all she can do is lament ""I'm tired to death.""

WHATEVER else they profess, most world religions say happiness is not as simple as it seems; earthly pleasures can easily prove to be a chimera, and true felicity is said to lie in overcoming selfish impulses, or in devoted service to others and to God. Where religions often disagree is on the result of this spiritual effort. Some speak of self-annihilation, others of union with God, others of a very personal sort of reward.
The Koran puts it simply. ""Happiness in this life, and in the hereafter"" is promised to ""those who believe and lead a righteous life""--there is no other way. In the Christian tradition, there is much talk of joy and sorrow being intertwined: you can't have one without the other. Christian monastics cultivate a state known as charmolypi, joy-sorrow: tears for the woes of the world, and gratitude for God's mercy.
But on a more earthly level, sociologists agree that the practice of a faith and broad happiness with life do seem to be related, though nobody has much idea why. ""We don't know whether people go to church because they are happy, or whether they are happy because they go to church,"" says Andrew Clark, an economist who helped conduct a survey of 30,000 Europeans in 21 countries.
But if religion is a significant factor in making people satisfied, it should presumably show up somewhere in a global investigation of well-being, like the Gallup survey mentioned elsewhere on these pages. Dalia Mogahed, who oversees Gallup's research on Muslim opinion, has made some stark observations about that poll. There are, she notes, many Muslim countries where men and women alike are fed up with life. But of the ten places with the highest correlation between being female and (relatively) satisfied, nine are mainly Muslim: Afghanistan, Iran, Egypt, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Bangladesh, Palestine, Jordan and Morocco. Ms Mogahed says this reflects the travails of being a Muslim man as much as any blessings of being female. In traditional lands, where men expect to be breadwinners, many suffer the trauma of being jobless or doing hard, ill-paid work. Another factor, she thinks, is that one big source of female and child poverty in the West--single motherhood--hardly exists in Muslim societies.
Some may find such conclusions too complacent about the fate of Muslim women. Margot Badran, an American scholar of feminism in Islamic countries, says that in most of them there is a palpable sense of grievance among women. ""But that doesn't imply that they are miserable, or consumed by victimhood--it just tells us we need a more nuanced picture of life than any simple spectrum of happiness can capture.""","Belief clearly affects people's state of mind, but don't ask how

NEW YORK was said to be the inspiration behind London's elected mayor, a job that Labour created in 1999 as part of its grand devolutionary programme. But although the posts may sound similar, their holders have little in common. Michael Bloomberg is a financial-data billionaire with a Harvard MBA, who runs the Big Apple like a business. ""Red Ken"" Livingstone, his opposite number in London, is friendly with Hugo Chavez, Venezuela's socialist president, and is planning a festival to mark the 50th anniversary of the Cuban revolution.
London's knack of attracting eccentric candidates--probably because the job is much less powerful than New York's--continues. On July 16th Boris Johnson, a scarecrow-haired old-Etonian MP, confirmed his desire to run as the Conservative candidate in London's mayoral election in May. If, as expected, he wins the party's primary ballot in September, he may give David Cameron's Tories their best chance yet of toppling Mr Livingstone, who became London's first elected mayor in 2000 and is seeking a third term
Both men are mavericks who are blessed with the gift of the gaffe. Mr Johnson is famous for upsetting people everywhere from Liverpool (which has a ""tribal grievance about the rest of society"") to Papua New Guinea (which stages ""orgies of cannibalism and chief-killing""). For his part, Red Ken called George Bush ""the greatest threat to life on this planet"".
Until now, Mr Livingstone's victories have been distinctly one-sided, not least because the Tory party has long struggled to find a Ken-beater. Jeffrey Archer, their first-ever mayoral candidate, pulled out of the 2000 race when accused of perjury and was later imprisoned. His replacement, Steven Norris, a little-known former minister, ran again in 2004 and was considering a third bid after Tory efforts to woo everyone from John Major, a former prime minister, to Lord Stevens, a one-time head of London's police, came to naught.
With the right candidate, London ought to be ripe for the Conservatives' taking. Last year's elections gave them a majority on 14 London councils, twice as many as Labour. Since 2004 they have held the most seats in the city-wide London Assembly. They may increase their lead in May by taking back votes from UKIP, a right-wing fringe party that did well last time.
Mr Johnson's clownishness is not to every senior Tory's taste but his high profile --especially with young voters--makes his antics easier to swallow. He is by far the best-known Tory MP bar current and former party leaders, says Peter Kellner of YouGov, a pollster. And his faux buffoonery makes traditional right-wing positions seem more palatable. ""I may be in trouble for saying this,"" he begins self-deprecatingly, but ""supposing Tower Hamlets or parts of Bradford were to become governed by [Muslim] religious zealots?""
Ahead looms a no-holds-barred contest. But the love-loathe relationship that Londoners have with Mr Livingstone means that the pool of swing voters is smaller than usual, according to Julia Clark of Ipsos MORI, another polling firm. She says the biggest election issue is Mr Livingstone's congestion charge for motorists, about which most voters formed a view years ago. Londoners will enjoy watching the candidates slug it out, but many may have made up their minds already.
Caption: Boris has news for you","The capital's councils have gone blue. Is London ready for a Tory mayor?
NEW YORK was said to be the inspiration behind London's elected mayor, a job that Labour created in 1999 as part of its grand devolutionary programme. But although the posts may sound similar, their holders have little in common. Michael Bloomberg is a financial-data billionaire with a Harvard MBA, who runs the Big Apple like a business. ""Red Ken"" Livingstone, his opposite number in London, is friendly with Hugo Chavez, Venezuela's socialist president, and is planning a festival to mark the 50th anniversary of the Cuban revolution.
London's knack of attracting eccentric candidates--probably because the job is much less powerful than New York's--continues. On July 16th Boris Johnson, a scarecrow-haired old-Etonian MP, confirmed his desire to run as the Conservative candidate in London's mayoral election in May. If, as expected, he wins the party's primary ballot in September, he may give David Cameron's Tories their best chance yet of toppling Mr Livingstone, who became London's first elected mayor in 2000 and is seeking a third term
Both men are mavericks who are blessed with the gift of the gaffe. Mr Johnson is famous for upsetting people everywhere from Liverpool (which has a ""tribal grievance about the rest of society"") to Papua New Guinea (which stages ""orgies of cannibalism and chief-killing""). For his part, Red Ken called George Bush ""the greatest threat to life on this planet"".
Until now, Mr Livingstone's victories have been distinctly one-sided, not least because the Tory party has long struggled to find a Ken-beater. Jeffrey Archer, their first-ever mayoral candidate, pulled out of the 2000 race when accused of perjury and was later imprisoned. His replacement, Steven Norris, a little-known former minister, ran again in 2004 and was considering a third bid after Tory efforts to woo everyone from John Major, a former prime minister, to Lord Stevens, a one-time head of London's police, came to naught.
With the right candidate, London ought to be ripe for the Conservatives' taking. Last year's elections gave them a majority on 14 London councils, twice as many as Labour. Since 2004 they have held the most seats in the city-wide London Assembly. They may increase their lead in May by taking back votes from UKIP, a right-wing fringe party that did well last time.

WHEN Fiji's coup leader, Commodore Frank Bainimarama, made it known he would attend a meeting of Pacific leaders in Tonga this week, New Zealand's prime minister, Helen Clark, said he would be ""treated like a leper"". Both she and Australia's foreign minister, Alexander Downer, said they would avoid any bilateral meetings with Fiji's military commander. But not for the first time, the region's heavyweights, Australia and New Zealand, seemed out on a limb.
At the Pacific Islands Forum the commodore was welcomed warmly by Tonga's prime minister, Fred Sevele, feted rapturously by 900 rain-drenched schoolgirls and invited to dine with Don McKinnon, the Commonwealth's secretary-general. Miss Clark was cross: ""I would have thought that suspension from the councils of the Commonwealth included suspension from the dinner parties.""
Opening the forum, Papua New Guinea's prime minister, Sir Michael Somare, called on Australia and New Zealand to show greater ""respect for the sovereignty"" of their small island neighbours. This echoed his complaints about Australian bullying at last year's forum in Fiji. Then, the targets of Australian displeasure were PNG and the Solomon Islands.
Relations have since soured further. In the midst of PNG's elections in August, Mr Downer called for Sir Michael to be charged with assisting the escape from PNG of Julian Moti, a fugitive lawyer. Mr Moti is wanted in Australia for alleged sexual offences in Vanuatu a decade ago. Australian requests for his extradition have been rebuffed. Mr Moti is now the Solomon Islands' attorney-general.
In response to allegations of Australian heavy-handedness, the forum nations agreed last year to an independent review of its peacekeeping Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands, RAMSI. The leaders were to consider this in Tonga. But Mannaseh Sogavare, the Solomon Islands' prime minister, dislikes the report and boycotted the forum. His foreign minister, Patteson Oti, this month protested before the United Nations General Assembly about Australia's ""occupation"" of his country. The Solomon Islands government, he said, wants a clear ""exit strategy"" and to reclaim ""sovereignty"". Having pumped nearly A$100m ($88m) into the Solomon Islands since the mission began in 2003, diplomats in Canberra are understandably anxious about RAMSI's future.
Repeated showdowns at these meetings also cast doubt on the viability of the forum itself. Formed in 1971, it joins Australia, New Zealand and 14 independent or self-governing island nations. Yet the larger nations in the south-west Pacific--PNG, the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and Fiji--have of late strengthened their own links through the Melanesian Spearhead Group, which has established a new Chinese-financed headquarters in Port Vila, Vanuatu. In the northern Pacific, tiny Micronesian states care more about their ties to America or Japan than those to their poor southern neighbours. The islands in the central and eastern Pacific, argues Ron Crocombe, a regional analyst, may have to revive plans for a Polynesian federation. It will take some dextrous diplomacy to keep all these far-flung island states together under antipodean leadership.","As usual , it 's Australia and New Zealand v the rest

BACKWARDNESS has its advantages. The latecomer to industrialisation can learn from the example of countries that went before it. China, unsurprisingly, gleans what it can from the models to its east: Japan and South Korea. On occasion, its policymakers have revealed a longing for their own national champions, imperious industrial conglomerates akin to the keiretsu of Japan and the chaebol of South Korea. In 1998 Wu Bangguo, a deputy prime minister, argued that China's international economic standing ""will be to a large extent determined by the position of our nation's large industrial groups"".
But China's industrial evolution has defied these aspirations. The obvious candidates as national champions were the big state-owned enterprises. But most of China's manufacturing progress has taken place around and between these moribund hulks, not through them. China's industrial economy teems with small, independent enterprises, not big, integrated flagships. Only four of China's ICT companies (three of whose headquarters are in Hong Kong) rank in the world's top 250 as measured by 2005 revenues.
This poses an insuperable problem for any Chinese policymaker hoping to emulate the industrial stewardship of Japan's or South Korea's ministries. In South Korea in the 1970s, Dwight Perkins of Harvard University has pointed out, fewer than 200 firms accounted for more than half of the country's manufacturing. By coaxing and cajoling these firms, the state could hope to steer the nation's economy. In China, the state would have to marshal hundreds of thousands of firms. China's manufacturing economy has no commanding heights. Its future will be decided elsewhere.
Waifs and strays
In every cranny of the SEG electronics market in Shenzhen, customers can find the electronic equivalent of a butcher's shop, displaying the guts of a computer, raw and glistening. Capacitors, circuit boards, switches, nuts, bolts and other offal are laid out on countertops. Spilling over the sides is every variety of cable, as tangled as the noodles the shopkeepers wolf down at lunchtime. The market lives on the first nine storeys of a gleaming octagonal tower, one of Shenzhen's many self-conscious monuments to modernity. But those who cannot afford a counter in the tower open shop on the pavement outside. There, a man sells a circuit board from a cardboard box, balanced on the saddle of his one-speed bike.
As the journalist James Fallows has noted, the market showcases the peculiar character of Chinese manufacturing. Many of the industries China now occupies have become increasingly ""modular"". The bits and bobs on offer (displays, cables, cards, chips) do not belong to one product or another. They can plug into any number of gizmos, some of which may not yet exist. The resulting combination hangs together because any bit can fit with a bob: the rules governing how they mesh become industry-wide standards.
Some believe this modularity sharply distinguishes Chinese manufacturing from that of its Japanese and South Korean forerunners--though they disagree about whether China's climb up the technological ladder will be harder or easier as a result. In Japan and South Korea, the leading companies took an intimate interest in every stage of a product's birth: conceiving it, procuring the materials, fashioning the parts, assembling them and marketing the result. This chain of production was contained within a family of firms, led by a national champion.
These corporate families prospered by tuning and improving things, up and down the chain of production. The lead firms would pass on know-how to, and demand higher standards from, their contractors and sub-contractors. For Toyota, the factory floor was the laboratory.
Some fear that China's small, modular manufacturers cannot evolve in this way. Since the parts they provide can be of use in many products, no lead firm has reason to nurture them or help them improve. Chinese firms are not part of a corporate family. But without close collaboration with more advanced sponsors, how will these young waifs and strays learn?
One example is motorbikes. Honda wants its suppliers to get better, because their parts fit only Honda's bikes. Chinese bikemakers, on the other hand, use interchangeable parts that might also be used by dozens of rivals. Similarly, if Motorola were to help BYD, a Chinese company, make better lithium ion batteries, Motorola's competitors would benefit as well.
But Motorola (as Wei Xie of Tsinghua University and Steven White of INSEAD point out) did help BYD make better batteries, sending engineers to its site to show them how. (And sure enough, the battery-maker does now supply Motorola's rivals.) Other evidence points in the same direction. The country may not have a Toyota or a Hyundai of its own, but its car-parts industry has nonetheless picked up a few things under foreign tutelage. According to work by John Sutton of the London School of Economics, more than half of Chinese suppliers to multinationals now meet international standards, which permit no more than 100 defective parts per million. Even the suppliers' suppliers have shown dramatic improvements in recent years. In 2006, 80% of these second-tier firms could meet the international standard, compared with just 28% three years before.
Perhaps China's industries are not that ""modular"" after all. The concept describes computer-making better than carmaking, and even within the computer industry, it characterises desktops better than laptops. Squeezing lots of components into a notebook PC is not straightforward, Messrs Dedrick and Kraemer point out. It requires collaboration between designers, parts-makers and assemblers, so that the final package is thin, light and ""does not burst into flames"". For this reason, the stages of laptop production tend to follow each other, with a lag, around the globe. Once assembly moved to Taiwan in the 1980s and 1990s, it pulled many other tasks (process engineering, pilot production, testing, prototyping) along after it. They foresee the same thing now happening in China.
China's quick evolution is also due to the other big difference between this latecomer and South Korea or Japan: the beguiling power of its home market. Foreigners are infatuated with it as a place to sell things as well as make things, and China's government has taken full advantage. In some cases, it required multinationals to enter into joint ventures with local firms. In others, it required foreigners to buy from them. Multinational carmakers wanting to set up shop in China in the 1990s had to source 70% of their parts locally within three years. That gave them every incentive to tutor their Chinese suppliers.
China had to abandon such tactics to join the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in 2001. But by now, foreign carmakers are mostly happy to buy local parts, because the suppliers are up to scratch. (Foreign toymakers may no longer agree.) Indeed, in many sectors foreigners have bought into Chinese partners, as well as bought from them. In a 2001 survey in five Chinese cities, the World Bank found that 90% of companies that dealt with foreign firms were also partly owned by them. China's modular manufacturers may be part of the family after all.
Purchasing parity
In his gloomier moments, Duncan Clark of BDA, a telecoms-advisory firm in Beijing, thinks that China's biggest contribution to technology will be new sets of perplexing initials. Not content with DVD, the government introduced its own format for video discs, EVD. Unhappy with MPEG-4, it created an alternative standard for compressing audio and video files called AVS. Dissatisfied with the ""Wi-Fi"" encryption method that everyone else used, it tried to push an alternative called WAPI, an acronym that enfolds another acronym: Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) Authentication and Privacy Infrastructure.
China's latest gift to the world is the longest string of intitials of all: TD-SCDMA (Time Division-Synchronous Code Division Multiple Access, if you must). Developed by China's Datang and Germany's Siemens, this allows third-generation (3G) mobile phones to send and receive bigger gobbets of information, including video and webpages. Two alternatives are already widely used worldwide. Why abuse the alphabet further?
Having enjoyed little success fostering national champions, China's government is now keen to push national standards. Such standards take hold in many high-tech industries, ensuring that one device is compatible with another. But they do not emerge without a fight. Countries quarrel over whether their neighbour should adopt their standard, or they should adopt their neighbour's. If the neighbour has many more users, its standard will probably prevail. That is the lot accepted by most small countries. But China is not small. Given the size of its home market, it can realistically aspire to carry its own standard.
In so doing, it hopes to escape what it thinks of as a ""technology trap"", argue Richard Suttmeier and Xiangkui Yao of the University of Oregon and Alex Zixiang Tan of Syracuse University. Its pragmatic manufacturers often favour foreign components and technologies, which leaves home-grown innovation bereft of patronage, and burdens the economy with hefty licence fees and royalties: Chinese firms paid $465m to American intellectual-property owners last year, for example. Rather than pay such fees, some firms bootleg the technology, undermining intellectual-property rights, which further saps China's innovative energies.
China's 15-year programme for science and technology, unveiled in 2006, called for ""indigenous"" innovation and aimed to cut China's dependence on foreign technology from 60% to 30% (as measured by the ratio of its technology imports to its domestic R&D spending plus net technology exports). By pushing for its own standards, based on home-grown research, it hopes to cut its royalty payments and wean its companies off foreign innovation.
China's big market is, to be sure, a great boon to its technological ambitions. But not in quite the way the government thinks. The clout it confers in standard-setting is of secondary importance. The benefits of a large pool of curious customers run far deeper than that.
Much technological innovation takes place in the back-and-forth between maker and user. This is an old insight--Adam Smith praised the workmen who invented ""easier and readier"" tools for their own use. Today, the idea is most closely associated with Eric von Hippel of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who likens innovation to a democratic forum, where users are sovereign.
Adventures in consumption
Amar Bhide, an economist at Columbia University, goes so far as to say that an economy's technological standing rests as much on its consumers as its producers. ""Venturesome and resourceful customers"" provide a great spur to innovators, he says, offering them quick feedback on their ideas, and a full deck of behaviours, habits and trends to learn from.
China's consumers are as venturesome as any. The country is still deeply curious and optimistic about what technology can do, says Tsinghua University's Mr von Zedtwitz. He thinks both qualities have faded in Europe. Likewise, at Microsoft Research Asia in Beijing, Jian Wang believes the Chinese consumer is a gift to free-thinking researchers: ""People here just love new technology,"" he says. ""They love to try new things.""
Microsoft is exploring what it calls ""deployment-driven research"". Rather than perfecting a product behind closed doors, then releasing it shrink-wrapped to the world, it thinks research work should zig and zag between author and audience. They do not call it R&D. But this is already what many Chinese firms do in practice. They are quick to test their ideas, says Mr von Zedtwitz, boldly putting their products into customers' hands, while German perfectionists would ""still be fiddling around with the prototype"". In China, he says, ""you can afford to waste some customers with an imperfect product, because there are always another 100m out there to whom you can sell version 2.0.""
China's push for a 3G standard has deprived its companies of the benefits of this venturesome consumption. Despite promising to finish a 3G network by the time of the Beijing Olympics next year, the government has yet to issue licences for 3G telephony. It does not want to uncork the market until its standard is ready, whenever that may be. As a result, China makes many of the world's 3G smart-phones, but almost none of the world's 3G phone-calls. Apart from a few TD-SCDMA pilots in big cities, China has no 3G consumers to learn from. The government has in effect kept the doors of its biggest laboratory shut.

Likewise, at Microsoft Research Asia in Beijing, Jian Wang believes the Chinese consumer is a gift to free-thinking researchers: ""People here just love new technology,"" he says. ""They love to try new things.""
Microsoft is exploring what it calls ""deployment-driven research"". Rather than perfecting a product behind closed doors, then releasing it shrink-wrapped to the world, it thinks research work should zig and zag between author and audience. They do not call it R&D. But this is already what many Chinese firms do in practice. They are quick to test their ideas, says Mr von Zedtwitz, boldly putting their products into customers' hands, while German perfectionists would ""still be fiddling around with the prototype"". In China, he says, ""you can afford to waste some customers with an imperfect product, because there are always another 100m out there to whom you can sell version 2.0.""
China's push for a 3G standard has deprived its companies of the benefits of this venturesome consumption. Despite promising to finish a 3G network by the time of the Beijing Olympics next year, the government has yet to issue licences for 3G telephony. It does not want to uncork the market until its standard is ready, whenever that may be. As a result, China makes many of the world's 3G smart-phones, but almost none of the world's 3G phone-calls. Apart from a few TD-SCDMA pilots in big cities, China has no 3G consumers to learn from. The government has in effect kept the doors of its biggest laboratory shut.

HOW do you begin describing the ""life"" of a document which probably had dozens of human authors and redactors, and whose highly diverse component parts were written down over a period of more than 1,000 years? Throw in the notion that the book's declared purpose is to describe a far longer process--the entire history of God's relationship with man and creation. Finally add in the fact that over the past 2,000 years, the text has been endlessly reread in accordance with human society's ever-changing needs, hopes and fears.
Even for Karen Armstrong, who is a skilled presenter of arcane material, the challenge is daunting. For any given part of the Bible, there are at least three different strands which might be drawn out: the narrative itself, and its ostensible historical setting; the period (often hundreds of years later) when the story was put in writing; and the various ideological uses which the narrative has served.
As an example of the biblical scholar's challenge, take the book of Daniel. On the face of it, this is a story about a sort of court prophet, skilled in interpreting dreams, whose powers impress the king in Babylon where a group of Jews were in exile between 586 and 538BC. But as Ms Armstrong points out, many modern scholars regard the book as a kind of inspiring ""historical novel"" penned about 400 years later during the Jews' struggle to throw off the influence of Hellenistic despots. And among later generations, many different aspects of Daniel's story have been stressed.
From the earliest Christian centuries, the church revered the book's account of the three youths who were cast into the furnace but remained unharmed; and above all, on the mysterious fourth figure who appeared in the flames, seen by Christians as prefiguring Jesus Christ. Among oppressed peoples, such as American blacks, the tale of Daniel is seen as a story of courage in the face of a tyrant. For people who like to mix their religion with geopolitics, the book of Daniel has a lot to say about the fall of mighty empires.
So there are many different places at which Ms Armstrong might have decided to enter the dense forest of Bible scholarship. Her chosen entry-point is a telling one: the moment when a young priest called Ezekiel, standing by a canal in Babylon where he has been in exile for five years, experiences a terrifying vision. He sees God leaving Jerusalem, riding in a war chariot, and coming to dwell with the exiles. Ezekiel is presented with a scroll and hears an order to eat it. When he complies, he finds to his surprise that it tastes as sweet as honey.
There is a good reason why Ms Armstrong lays such emphasis on the Babylonian exile. By explaining the different strains in Jewish religious life just before, during and immediately after the exile, she is able to sketch out a basic taxonomy of religious culture which, as many scholars have realised, can be of help to almost any analyst of Abrahamic monotheism.
At one end of the religious spectrum, Ms Armstrong recalls, there were theDeuteronomists, who emphasised central authority, obedience to the law and territorial conquest--and discounted the possibility of any direct encounter with God. At the other end was the priestly school whose memory of the Holy of Holies inJerusalem told them that man couldindeed stand in the presence of God.
Under the stimulus of exile, the followers of the priestly school were led to theintuition that if God could be palpably present in one particular place, his presence could be experienced in other places. There is a paradox here: because of their deep connection to one very specific location, the priests of Solomon's Temple might at first sight seem like the epitome of territorially based religion. But their deepest insights stressed the universality of the experience of God, and hence the irrelevance of religious wars over territory.
This distinction between ""religion as law, power and conquest"" and ""religion as vision of God"" can be a help to anyone who is grappling with the phenomenon which Victoria Clark presents so vividly and thoughtfully in her account of Christian Zionism, or the movement (strongest in America but also present in many other places) that wants Israel to triumph over all its earthly rivals, in the hope that this will bring closer the end of the world.
With the eye of an experienced journalist and a gift for getting along with people with whom she disagrees, Ms Clark presents some powerful vignettes of a movement which in some ways mirrors the more strident forms of Islamism: it uses quasi-spiritual language but is in fact incorrigibly political and indeed geopolitical in its preoccupations.
Not wholly holy
In certain lights, the movement's ordinary members, as presented by Ms Clark, sound almost endearing in the naive enthusiasm they show as visitors to the Holy Land. But later in her narrative, as she attends a lavish fund-raising dinner in Washington, she feels that something darker is at work: a mixture of ""fear, injured pride, ignorance and perceived victimhood"" whose brooding extremism could have dire consequences. Many liberal Israelis, as well as many Christians, would agree.
If there is a single word that describes the mentality of the power-brokers of the Christian-Zionist movement, as portrayed by Ms Clark, it might be Deuteronomic: theirs is a brand of religion which is fascinated by military power and the subjugation of enemies, which adamantly externalises evil and finds no place for humility, self-doubt, compassion or universal humanism. Its adherents talk a lot about the Jewish Temple but they seem to have missed what some see as the temple's ultimate message: the possibility of experiencing the presence of God. (Many Christians, in turn, see a similar message in the promise of Jesus Christ to ""stand in the midst"" of any group of people who gather in his name, anywhere on earth.)
Over the centuries, pioneer peoples, from the Ulster Protestants to the Boers, have drawn inspiration from passages in the Old Testament which describe the acquisition of new land, and the dispossession of its earlier inhabitants. What makes America's Christian Zionists unusual is that their fascination with conquest is vicarious: it is projected onto a land thousands of miles away. The movement's followers are unlikely to feel at first hand the consequences of the policies they advocate. This makes their aspirations both more aggressive and more fantastical. If Ms Armstrong gives the bare bones--and it is just the bare bones--of an alternative view of the scriptures, that is a badly needed service.","The Bible : A Biography . By Karen Armstrong .

WHEN he led Australia's Labor Party to a resounding election victory last November, Kevin Rudd warned members of his new cabinet they could expect just two days off at Christmas. Even for a workaholic such as Mr Rudd, this proved optimistic. Australia traditionally sinks into a summer slumber in January. The new prime minister wisely reconsidered and took a two-week holiday himself. Back at work on January 14th, he at once sent signals that he plans to be as stingy with taxpayers' money as he expects his ministers to be with their free time.
The next day he and Wayne Swan, the treasurer (finance minister), visited the Sydney headquarters of Australia's independent central bank. Mr Swan explained that the meeting was all about showing government ""restraint"" in a bid to tame inflation. Labor took power with a mandate to change the political climate. But the economy looms as its biggest worry.
After more than 16 consecutive years of growth, some measures of inflation are running at about 3% a year. The central bank has raised interest rates six times since 2004; economists predict another rise in February. On top of these, Australia's big retail banks have raised their rates in response to the global credit crunch.
A survey this week showed a sharp fall in consumer confidence. Mr Rudd's ministers will finger the former conservative government of John Howard. Over 11 years in power, especially the past three, Mr Howard was prone to splashing money around to buy votes. All this will make it hard for Mr Rudd to meet his own election promise to pour money into health and education, and to phase in tax cuts worth A$31 billion ($28 billion). Mr Swan has already pledged to cut A$10 billion from spending in his first budget in May.
On foreign policy, Mr Rudd has shown he means business in taking a less blustery and less pro-American approach in Australia's region. After his election, the first foreign leader Mr Rudd invited to his Brisbane home was Helen Clark, the prime minister of New Zealand. Then he went to the UN climate-change conference in Bali and reversed the Howard government's refusal to ratify the Kyoto protocol.
On January 15th the government also reversed Mr Howard's decision to sell uranium to India. Australia holds about 40% of the world's known uranium, and the deal was less about commerce than about backing an American agreement on civil nuclear co-operation with India. It went against the grain of Australia's refusal up to then to sell uranium to India and other countries that had not signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
For all this, Mr Rudd remains possibly the most enigmatic prime minister Australians have elected. The real balance of conservative, reformer and radical in him remains to be discovered once Parliament resumes in February. He has ordained already that Parliament will sit for five days a week instead of four. Reluctantly granted a holiday in January, his ministers can expect little sleep for the rest of the year.","Labor is working. Non-stop

BACK in March Barack Obama compared the Democratic primary to a ""good movie"" that has lasted ""half an hour too long"". The movie has long since gone bad, and half an hour has dragged into an eternity. Surely it is high time to roll out the Hollywood ending. 
And what could be more Hollywood than a dream ticket? This has the support of plenty of senior Democrats such as Mario Cuomo, the former governor of New York, and Ed Rendell, the governor of Pennsylvania. Why stop at having a nominee who has the support of 51% of Democrats, the argument goes, when we could have a dream ticket that has won 100%? A couple of months ago Hillary Clinton signalled that she would be willing to have Mr Obama as her vice-president. Perhaps it is time for her to swallow her pride and take the second spot. 
The ""dream ticket"" would reunite a party that has fractured along lines of race and class. Mrs Clinton would boost her chances of getting the presidency some day (a third of all vice-presidents have gone on to the top job). And Mr Obama would acquire a street-fighter with a proven record of appealing to voters that he finds hard to connect with. There are plenty of examples, including the Kennedy-Johnson ticket in 1960 and the Reagan-Bush ticket in 1980, of bitter rivals turning themselves into successful allies. 
The trouble with this argument is that it overstates the benefits of an Obama-Clinton partnership and understates the costs. Mrs Clinton certainly has genuine appeal to female voters, particularly the older and less educated women who were moved by her tears in New Hampshire and have since been enthused by her dogged determination. But most of these voters are hard-core Democrats who are unlikely to defect to John McCain in November. The Democrats' biggest problem is not with white women but with white men--particularly with white working-class men--who have been drifting to the Republican Party for decades. No less than 62% of white men voted for George Bush in 2004. John McCain, a war hero and man's man, has an obvious appeal to this group; that appeal might prove irresistible if the Democrats pair a black man with a white woman. 
The Democratic Party has plenty of people who have more genuine appeal to the white working classes than a faux populist such as the Wellesley- and Yale-educated former first lady. Ted Strickland, the governor of Ohio, is a former Methodist minister who might help Mr Obama connect with religious voters. The same can be said of Tim Kaine, the governor of Virginia and a former missionary. Mr Rendell, the governor of Pennsylvania, goes down well with the beer-and-football crowd (he moonlights as a commentator for football matches). Unlike Mrs Clinton, these men represent vital swing states. Or there is John Edwards, who has run for veep before, and who has just endorsed Mr Obama. 
There are also several others who might do much more than Mrs Clinton to make up for another of Mr Obama's potential weaknesses--his lack of foreign policy and defence experience. Wesley Clark, Jim Webb and Chuck Hagel are all former Vietnam war heroes. Mr Clark is a retired four-star general who once commanded NATO. Mr Hagel, a Republican senator for Nebraska and a former best buddy of Mr McCain, has been one of the most outspoken critics of the Iraq war. Mr Webb, a Democratic senator for Virginia, was secretary of the navy under Ronald Reagan. Why choose an armchair warrior who has been reduced to inventing stories about dodging sniper fire in Bosnia when you can choose a genuine warrior instead? 
Then there is the downside of the dream ticket. Mr Obama's best selling-point is that he represents ""change"" and ""hope""--a chance to break with the old politics of partisan division and personal destruction and to bring a new spirit of reconciliation to Washington, DC. The Clintons are not only living reminders of the noxious politics of the 1990s. Exit polls in Indiana and North Carolina showed that almost half of voters in the Democratic primary did not regard Mrs Clinton as trustworthy. They also bring a menagerie of old-timers in their wake, from high-paid lobbyists such as Mark Penn, to perennial bloviators like Paul Begala and James Carville. 
How not to do it
The dream ticket would also be a formula for a dysfunctional administration. It is hard to imagine Mrs Clinton contenting herself with a purely symbolic role, any more than Dick Cheney has. She spent the early 1990s turning the position of first lady into a virtual co-presidency. She is married to a former president who has lost none of his self-regard. Team Clinton is full of people who have made it clear that they regard the Obamaites as uppity whippersnappers. 
Does America really want the vice-president's office to become--or rather remain--a rival power centre to the Oval Office? That could mean going back to the 1990s, when the White House was consumed by palace intrigue between rival factions, each determined to advance their own agendas and do down their rivals. The presidency is difficult enough to run at the best of times, without installing a former first lady and an ex-president in the vice-president's residence. 
Mr Obama will find it hard to resist pressure for a shotgun marriage to Mrs Clinton. His terrible result in West Virginia this week underlines once again his weakness with the white working-class. And Mr Obama cannot win the nomination without the support of superdelegates, who are desperate to reunite a divided party. But putting Mrs Clinton on the ticket would produce few benefits that could not be replicated with a carefully chosen alternative vice-president. And at worst it could lay the foundations of a failed presidency.","The dubious case for a Democratic dream team

NOT everyone believes in Barack Obama's promise to change Washington. But at least the faces will change. Should he win the White House, Mr Obama will bring in a new team to run the federal government, the Oval Office and the Democratic Party. Sitting Republicans, of course, will be out. But so too will be many members of the old Democratic establishment, long exiled to the Brookings Institution and similar perches to await the return of their powers under Hillary Clinton. So who will run the country if the voters decide that Yes, He Can? 
On domestic matters, Mr Obama has assembled a team of sharp academic economists who premise their work on his supposed ability to sell sophisticated policy. Most prominent up until now has been Austan Goolsbee (pictured first left above), a University of Chicago professor whom many expect to head a President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers. Mr Goolsbee's record suggests neither the hostility towards globalised capitalism nor the desire for large-scale redistribution that conservatives, spooked by tales of Mr Obama's left-wing voting record, might fear: Mr Goolsbee is a problem-solver who favours such unsexy proposals as altering American tax forms. He got into trouble earlier this year for telling the Canadians not to worry too much about the anti-NAFTA rhetoric the candidate was emitting on the campaign trail.
From Harvard Mr Obama plucked Jeffrey Liebman, who has produced good research on the earned-income tax credit and its role in moving people from welfare to work, and David Cutler, a health economist who wants doctors' pay tied to medical outcomes. As of this week, though, Mr Obama's newly appointed economics director is Jason Furman (second left, above), an economist in the Clinton administration and a top aide to John Kerry in 2004. His presence rebuts criticism that Mr Obama's team has too little policymaking experience. Mr Furman, too, hews to the non-ideological centre, heading Washington's Hamilton Project, an economic policy group co-founded by Bob Rubin, once Bill Clinton's treasury secretary. Mr Furman is a staunch free-trader who once praised Wal-Mart and has favoured lowering corporate taxes. With a PhD from Harvard, he also does not lack for academic credentials.
Bill Galston, a former senior adviser to Mr Clinton, argues that the campaign, for all its braininess, has so far failed to frame its proposals in a ""narrative"" about the economy. But the campaign's post-ideological message may fit into a broader theme about Mr Obama's style of politics: that he can unite Americans behind reasoned policy as their problems pile up. 
Mr Obama's plans for ""change"" are most concrete in his determination to leave Iraq. Indeed, his early opposition to the war attracted seasoned foreign-policy practitioners who also disapproved of the invasion. The biggest name among them is Tony Lake (third), Mr Clinton's national security adviser, who taught the ex-president how to salute and who toiled to bring peace to the Balkans. Others in Mr Clinton's top tier--such as Madeleine Albright and Richard Holbrooke--backed Mrs Clinton, leaving room for up-and-comers to nab the best spots in the Obama campaign. Susan Rice (fourth), Mr Clinton's assistant secretary of state for African affairs, is a possible national security adviser. The Rwandan genocide deeply affected Ms Rice, who now wants more done to end killing in Darfur; her prominence suggests that President Obama might attend more closely to north-south issues. 
Before resigning from the campaign for calling Mrs Clinton a monster, Samantha Power, an academic who has written about genocide, tried to soften Mr Obama's commitment to pull all troops out of Iraq. She will probably find a place in an Obama administration. The campaign boasts some former military brass, including Richard Danzig, a former secretary of the navy and possible defence secretary. Mr Obama is also likely to bring in experienced former ground commanders such as Wesley Clark. And, despite tales of a deep mutual antipathy between Mr Lake and Mr Holbrooke, it would be foolish to rule the pugnacious Mr Holbrooke out of contention for a big job.
But policymaking is harder than writing theories. First, one must get elected. Afterwards, one must win battles with Congress and the public. For both, Mr Obama will look to his political team. Foremost here is David Axelrod (fifth), the man who made ""change"" into a campaign theme. His consultancy helped elect two mayors in rough-and-tumble Chicago, and he can deliver a punch: he was once accused of producing an ad that made an opponent resemble Hitler. Even so, he seems a true believer in Mr Obama's hopeful rhetoric. ""I find myself getting very emotional about it,"" he told the Los Angeles Times. All assume he will be Mr Obama's Karl Rove. 
Also surrounding Mr Obama are well-connected Chicagoans who supported his Senate run in 2004, when he was an unknown state legislator. Valerie Jarrett, a former head of the Chicago Stock Exchange, is the person who can tell the couple uncomfortable truths. Penny Pritzker, the campaign's finance chair and a property billionaire, supposedly joined the campaign after her husband banged their kitchen door, proclaiming, ""this is destiny knocking on the door of our nation,"" (though the couple seem normal in other respects).
A big part of Mr Obama's success, though, is due to the Democratic operators he lured from elsewhere. His campaign manager, David Plouffe (sixth), a former aide to Dick Gephardt, is disciplined and parsimonious, overseeing the amassing of the biggest political piggybank ever seen and orchestrating Obama victories in small, organisation-intensive caucus states. 
Mr Plouffe's chief organisers are Steve Hildebrand and Paul Tewes, who ran Al Gore's successful Iowa caucus bid in 2000. Mr Tewes will soon move to the Democratic National Committee to head its presidential campaign effort--and consolidate Mr Obama's control of the party. Tom Daschle, a former Senate majority leader, could help Mr Obama's team put pressure on Congress without alienating its members, a problem that can dog first-term presidents. 
The ambition of Mr Obama's team is exciting, but in office it could be dangerous. In 1993 the clever Clintons tripped up very quickly. What if Congress doesn't care for the finely-tuned policies of Mr Obama's top-notch economists? Or if Mr Obama finds he can't pull out of Iraq as planned? Or if Americans tire of his charisma and he stops being able to attract adoring crowds tens of thousands strong? The lynchpin of his campaign has been a faith, almost messianic, in his personal excellence. If that fades, then the whole operation could collapse in frustration and disillusionment.","A guide to the main players in Barack Obama's aspiring administration
NOT everyone believes in Barack Obama's promise to change Washington. But at least the faces will change. Should he win the White House, Mr Obama will bring in a new team to run the federal government, the Oval Office and the Democratic Party. Sitting Republicans, of course, will be out. But so too will be many members of the old Democratic establishment, long exiled to the Brookings Institution and similar perches to await the return of their powers under Hillary Clinton. So who will run the country if the voters decide that Yes, He Can? 
On domestic matters, Mr Obama has assembled a team of sharp academic economists who premise their work on his supposed ability to sell sophisticated policy. Most prominent up until now has been Austan Goolsbee (pictured first left above), a University of Chicago professor whom many expect to head a President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers. Mr Goolsbee's record suggests neither the hostility towards globalised capitalism nor the desire for large-scale redistribution that conservatives, spooked by tales of Mr Obama's left-wing voting record, might fear: Mr Goolsbee is a problem-solver who favours such unsexy proposals as altering American tax forms. He got into trouble earlier this year for telling the Canadians not to worry too much about the anti-NAFTA rhetoric the candidate was emitting on the campaign trail.
From Harvard Mr Obama plucked Jeffrey Liebman, who has produced good research on the earned-income tax credit and its role in moving people from welfare to work, and David Cutler, a health economist who wants doctors' pay tied to medical outcomes. As of this week, though, Mr Obama's newly appointed economics director is Jason Furman (second left, above), an economist in the Clinton administration and a top aide to John Kerry in 2004. His presence rebuts criticism that Mr Obama's team has too little policymaking experience.

WITH an election due by mid-November, and her Labour Party trailing the centre-right National Party in the polls, the last thing Helen Clark, New Zealand's prime minister, needed was a scandal. But on August 29th she had to accept the temporary resignation of Winston Peters, the foreign minister, and leader of her coalition partner, New Zealand First (NZF), while accusations against him are investigated. 
The scandal hinges on donations to NZF that allegedly were not properly declared or were used for other purposes, including Mr Peters's legal bills. Most attention focuses on an anonymous donation in 2006 of NZ$100,000 ($70,000) made by Owen Glenn, an expatriate businessman. Mr Peters, famous for railing against big-business influence on politics, long angrily denied wrongdoing or receiving money from Mr Glenn. Miss Clark has consistently accepted his word. But in July Mr Peters had to admit that the money, unbeknown to him, had indeed come from Mr Glenn. Then, on August 28th, Miss Clark admitted that she had spoken to Mr Glenn about the money in February.
The affair highlights the trickiness of New Zealand's mixed-member-proportional (MMP) political system. After the 2005 election, centre-left Labour was forced to seek NZF support to form a government. The two are not natural partners. NZF takes a tough stance on crime, and opposes immigration and any ""special"" treatment for indigenous Maoris. Mr Peters, a Maori himself, and once a minister in a National Party government, is credited with having done a decent job as foreign minister. But Miss Clark has been unable to keep him in line, as she typically has errant Labour ministers. Yet she has been tainted by association.
Mr Peters, a cunning maverick, has managed comebacks before. But the affair has hurt Labour. Miss Clark looks weak for not having sacked Mr Peters sooner. The National Party has the high ground: John Key, its leader since 2006, has declared that it will not form a government with Mr Peters. Mr Key, a 47-year-old former banker, had suffered from a lack of political experience and an image as a city slicker. Now he has managed to look principled. 
But ruling out potential coalition partners is risky. No party has won an absolute majority since MMP was adopted in 1996. Despite National's lead in the polls, smaller parties--such as the Maori Party, the Greens and NZF--may well still have a role, and Miss Clark, who has led three governments since 1999, has proved an adept coalition builder.
National is also gaffe-prone. Before the Peters row took the limelight, it had been embarrassed by covert recordings of loose-talking party bigwigs suggesting that they did not feel bound by promises not to sell state assets if elected. And this week Mr Key was ridiculed for grandly comparing himself to Barack Obama. The election is National's to lose, but it might just manage it.

""QUALITY and safety are the foundations of social harmony,"" proclaim posters at the headquarters of the Sanlu Group in Shijiazhuang, capital of China's northern province of Hebei. Sanlu was until recently one of China's biggest producers of milk powder. Now, dozens of people, many clutching infants, queue in the hot sun outside to return powder that could be contaminated with a potentially lethal chemical. The harmony of China's consumers has rarely been so tested. 
The safety scandal engulfing not only Sanlu, fingered as the main culprit, but much of China's dairy industry, is an embarrassment to China's leaders. In July last year, after widespread complaints at home and abroad about tainted Chinese-made food and medicine, the authorities executed a former head of the country's food-and-drug safety agency for taking bribes. This year, to improve monitoring, the agency was put under the Ministry of Health. The sale of tainted milk powder, which has so far made more than 6,000 infants ill and killed four, shows controls remain dangerously slack.
The government blames middlemen who collect milk from dairy farmers. They allegedly added water to increase its volume and, to disguise this, mixed in melamine, a chemical used to make plastics, which can deceive inspectors about the milk's protein content. Melamine gained notoriety last year when several pets in America died after eating food contaminated with it by Chinese-made additives. 
The central government has boasted it was quick to react to the latest problem. But the chronology revealed so far suggests otherwise. It has fuelled speculation of a delay to make sure the Olympic games in August were not marred by a food scare. 
The government of Gansu province in China's west says it told the Ministry of Health on July 16th about an unusual upsurge of kidney stones among infants who had all drunk the same brand of milk. It was not until September 1st that the ministry says its experts tentatively concluded that the powder had caused the sickness. Still, nothing appeared to happen. 
Prodding from the government of New Zealand may have been what eventually goaded the Chinese authorities into action. On September 8th it told them what it had learnt from Fonterra, a New Zealand dairy company that owns 43% of Sanlu. Fonterra says it was told by Sanlu of a problem with the powder on August 2nd, six days before the games.
Helen Clark, New Zealand's prime minister, said Fonterra had tried ""for weeks"" to persuade local officials to allow a public recall. Instead, in an unpublicised recall, powder was withdrawn from shops. Fonterra has defended its decision to keep its information under wraps for so long. ""If you don't follow the rules of an individual market place then I think you are getting irresponsible"", says the company's chief executive, Andrew Ferrier. 
Eventually, on September 11th, Sanlu announced a nationwide recall of 700 tonnes of powder. Two days later the Ministry of Health gave its first news conference on the crisis and the cabinet declared a national food-safety emergency. A government investigation found smaller traces of melamine in milk powder from 21 other companies, including leading brands such as Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group (an Olympic sponsor, though the government says no melamine got into the dairy supply for the Olympics or the Paralympics, which ended this week).
Heads are now rolling. Several milk dealers have been arrested. The mayor of Shijiazhuang has been dismissed. Sanlu's boss, Tian Wenhua, has been fired and arrested. Around the country, milk powder is being withdrawn from shelves, leaving, as one Western expert on China's dairy industry puts it, ""not much but Nestle"", a Swiss group whose milk powder is not implicated in the scandal. Sanlu's production has been halted. Some other companies are recalling their milk powder too. The government has extended its investigations to a variety of dairy products.
But officials still appear nervous about public reaction to the news. Chinese journalists say the Communist Party's Propaganda Department has ordered all but the party's most trusted media to refrain from investigating the story. At Sanlu's headquarters people lining up to return their powder complain that the local press has barely covered the issue. 
Extra police have been deployed around Sanlu's headquarters and the city's main children's hospital. Across China, anxious parents are flocking to have their infants tested for kidney stones. One grandparent blames the scandal on corrupt collusion between dairy businesses and local officials. ""It would not have happened in the days of Mao Zedong"", he says. Harmony has yielded to discord.","The politics of an unconscionable delay

NOT quite Obama v McCain. But New Zealand's general election on November 8th also ushered in political change. Voters resoundingly rejected the Labour-led centre-left coalition led by Helen Clark, prime minister since 1999, and turned to the centre-right National Party. Under New Zealand's mixed member-proportional system, National won 59 of 122 parliamentary seats, but it can also count on the six seats of two small right-wing parties.
John Key, the new prime minister, is Barack Obama's age, 47, and relatively new to politics. A millionaire former investment banker of humble origins, his amiable personality went down well in a lacklustre campaign. Yet up to the end, Miss Clark, who has since stepped down as Labour leader, enjoyed high personal ratings and international praise. Labour has presided over huge reductions in government debt and unemployment, steady GDP growth, the creation of savings schemes and bilateral trade deals. Earlier this year, New Zealand became the first developed country to sign a free-trade agreement with China.
But since the previous election in 2005, it has governed with the support of the populist New Zealand First party. When its leader was implicated in a party-finance scandal this year, Labour was tainted by association. Clumsy legislation to make political-party funding more transparent appeared cynically self-serving. A law banning parents from hitting their children caused bitter division. Labour's campaign theme of ""trust"" looked tired. Its attempt to link Mr Key with a 20-year-old shady foreign-exchange deal at a firm where he once worked looked desperate, and failed. 
Under Mr Key since 2006, National has presented itself as more business-friendly and less bureaucratic than Labour, promising to cut taxes and to stem the tide of emigration to Australia. But, as the Reserve Bank, the central bank, predicted on November 12th, a tough year lies ahead. New Zealand has slipped into recession, unemployment is rising and house prices are falling. A small, isolated country, it has one of the world's most unregulated economies and is highly dependent on foreign investment, the export of agricultural commodities and long-haul tourism. So it is very vulnerable to the slowdown in the global economy.
National has given few clues about how it will deal with this. It has mentioned investing in infrastructure, notably roads, using public-private partnerships. Bryan Gould, once a member of Britain's Parliament, now a political commentator, reckons it will play safe at first, continuing Labour's caution in economic management. 
However, it may come under pressure from its ally, the Association of Consumers and Taxpayers (ACT), whose MPs include Sir Roger Douglas, architect of the free-market ""Rogernomics"" of the 1980s. The ACT wants state-asset sales, tax cuts and the scrapping of Labour's carbon-emissions trading scheme. Perhaps to insure against the ACT's demands, National was this week also discussing a deal with the Maori Party. Mr Key seems a determined centrist.

LEANING against the fence of a stock pen, Danielle LeDoux of Poker City Ranch waits to see if her three 1,100lb (500kg) Gelbvieh bulls can win first prize. But the results are disappointing: judged on size, uniformity and muscle mass, her beasts do not even make the top three places. Although discouraged, Ms LeDoux still hopes she can sell them, or some of them, at auction a few hours later: ""We knew it would be tough this year. If I can sell a couple before going home, then I'm happy."" 
A sale or two would make the long trip worth it. Ms LeDoux has brought the bulls from her north-eastern Kansas ranch to the annual National Western Stock Show in Denver, a three-week livestock fair in January at which 15,000 farm animals are shown, ranging from cattle and sheep to chickens and llamas. All are clipped, brushed and blow-dried to look their best. 
Handsome as the beasts (and fowl) may look, buyers are more concerned with their powers of reproduction. Animals are bought and sold on the basis of their genetics and breeding history. Bovine perfection comes at a price: a prized nine-month-old heifer can fetch up to $80,000. Livestock sales at last year's fair added up to roughly $8m. Those who cannot afford to buy an animal outright can purchase the genes without their owner: semen from the 2008 grand champion Angus is available for $25 per half-cubic-centimetre. 
Roughly 3,000 agricultural fairs take place in America, varying in size and seriousness. Denver boasts one of the largest and oldest, held in its current form since 1906. Earlier variations were less organised: in 1898, enticed by free beer, 20,000 drunken Denverites ravaged the Bison Barbeque. Planners wondered about holding the event elsewhere. But, in the event, the show remained in Denver and nowadays draws 700,000 well-behaved visitors a year. 
Tourists come for the fun. For townspeople the show offers a chance to connect with Denver's pastoral origins. There is a ""Dress Western"" barbecue. Six-year-olds can compete in the Mutton Bustin' contest, where the object is to cling to the back of a confused sheep for as long as possible. Fiddling contests are held and a mariachi band enlivens the popular Mexican Rodeo Extravaganza. 
Apart from a pungent smell every January, the fair generates $80m for the local economy. ""It is an important economic boost, and makes us feel uniquely Western,"" says Tom Clark of the chamber of commerce. And as the animals head for home at the end of the month, they leave a parting gift for Denver's gardeners: 14,000 cubic yards of fresh manure.","All the fun of the fair at Denver's annual stock show

IT IS not hard to see how the Conservative Party's largely anonymous shadow cabinet could be improved by a recruit as famous and popular as Ken Clarke, the former chancellor of the exchequer and thrice-vanquished candidate for the Tory leadership, who returned to the front bench on January 19th. He has run some of the most unwieldy government departments, including health and the Home Office; of his new colleagues, only William Hague has run any. And his facility with economic jargon and concepts--the product of four successful years at the Treasury--is rare in a party that has often struggled to sound authoritative on the issue of the day. 
But the fillip generated by the new business spokesman's appointment could be short-lived, some activists grumble. Mr Clarke promises to accept the party's Eurosceptic line, which is at odds with his own enthusiasm for the European Union, but that has yet to be tested. Even some who welcome Mr Clarke's return worry that the bluffness and jazz-filled hinterland that distinguish him from duller politicians also betray a personality unsuited to the dogged and thankless work of opposition. And if he proves a success, George Osborne, the shadow chancellor, who has been hurt by a recent brush with scandal and a perceived lack of heft, may be further cast in the shade. Gordon Brown, the prime minister, has already taken mischievously to calling Mr Clarke ""the shadow shadow chancellor"". 
Neither does it seem an obvious time for a gamble by David Cameron, the Tory leader, who is usually at his boldest when he has little to lose. Three opinion polls this month have given the Conservatives a double-digit lead over Labour, whose resurgence peaked in December. And it is in any event hard to imagine Mr Clarke being as indispensable to Mr Cameron as Lord Mandelson, the business secretary and (it is said) ""effectively the deputy prime minister"", is to Mr Brown. 
But even if the potential gains from Mr Clarke's return are perhaps exaggerated, so are the risks attached to it. Europe may not be a big issue again before the next election, after which Mr Clarke, now 68, may retire. Mr Osborne himself reputedly pushed for Mr Clarke's appointment. And if the Tories were unconvincing on the economy until lately, it was not for want of hard work; Mr Clarke's casual authority may be more effective than the slew of pronouncements attempted by Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne last year.
More plausible concerns surround the rest of Mr Cameron's shuffle, in which many Conservatives detect a softening of his reformist zeal. James Purnell, the work and pensions secretary, outflanked the Tories on welfare reform even when an ardent reformer, Chris Grayling, shadowed him. He will not find that task any tougher with Theresa May, a party stalwart but hardly a restless innovator on policy, as his new rival. Two of the Tories' best young thinkers, Greg Clark and Nick Herbert, are now in charge of a clutch of green issues; many want to see at least one of them carrying a bigger portfolio. And the new local-government spokesman, Caroline Spelman, who has swapped her old job of party chairman with the grassroots' beloved, Eric Pickles, is cooler on localism than some Tories would like. 
With the Conservatives cautious on health policy for fear of seeming hostile to the adored National Health Service, and with scope for tax cuts curtailed by dismal public finances, Tory true-believers have only some market-based ideas for schools reform to get excited about. As Mr Clarke knows better than most, however, it is not necessary to be radical to be popular.","Helen Clark lights up a cautious Tory reshuffle

THE best public higher education in the world is to be found at the University of California (UC). This claim is backed up by Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China, which provides an authoritative ranking of research universities. The UC's campus at Berkeley ranks third behind two private universities, Harvard and Stanford. Several of the other ten UC sites, such as Los Angeles and San Diego, are not far behind. Californians are justifiably proud.
It is therefore no small matter that this glory may be about to end. ""We are in irreversible decline,"" says Sandra Faber, a professor of astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz who has inadvertently become a mouthpiece for a fed-up faculty. University excellence, she says, ""took decades to build. It takes a year to destroy it."" 
California has been suffering serial budget crises, the latest of which was resolved last month in a rather desperate deal between the governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and the legislature. It contained huge cuts, including $2 billion lopped from higher education. The UC alone has lost a cumulative $813m of state funding in the last fiscal year and the current one, a cut of 20%. The second-tier California State University (Cal State), with 23 campuses the largest in the country, and the third-tier community colleges have also been clobbered.
The cuts threaten the legacy of two visionaries, Edmund ""Pat"" Brown, governor from 1959 to 1967, and Clark Kerr, who was in charge of the UC during those years. Kerr envisioned the state's public universities as ""bait to be dangled in front of industry, with drawing power greater than low taxes or cheap labour."" In a 1960 master- plan he created the three-tiered system.
His ambition was simple. First, to educate as many young Californians as affordably as possible. The best students would go to the UC, the next lot to Cal State and the rest to community colleges with the possibility of trading up. Second, to attract academic superstars. Kerr went about this like a talent scout, and his successors have continued the practice. The UC campuses have collectively produced more Nobel laureates than any other university.
But the master-plan has been under strain for years. State spending per student in the UC system, adjusted for inflation, has fallen by 40% since 1990, says Mark Yudof, the current UC president. The Public Policy Institute of California, a non-partisan think-tank, projects that California's economy will face a shortfall of 1m college graduates by 2025, depressing the prosperity of the entire state. Public universities, which award 75% of all the state's bachelor degrees, will be largely responsible. 
Academic excellence is likely to be the first victim. Both the UC and Cal State are planning to send professors and staff on leave, cram more students into classrooms and offer fewer courses. Attracting and keeping academic stars, and the research dollars that usually follow them, will become much harder. 
It is already happening, says Ms Faber. She recently hired three world-class assistant professors whose salaries are now at risk. Other universities have begun to get in touch with them, she says, and they will probably leave. Their best students may go with them. ""We are eating our seed corn,"" the professor laments.

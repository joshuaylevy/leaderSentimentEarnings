THEY claim to be inspired by the Arab spring, or the student uprising of May 1968 in Paris. But if you want a parallel for the anti-political protests that have swept across Spain, maybe it is to be found in Argentina in 2001-02, when years of recession ended in debt default and rowdy mobs shouted ""que se vayan todos"" (loosely, ""kick all the bums out"").
Fortunately, Spain is not Argentina--at least not yet. And the tens of thousands of mainly young Spaniards camped out in city squares have been impeccably well behaved. Even so, the protests may deter politicians from the grim task of saving Spain's economy from stagnation and banishing the fear of default. So may the crushing defeat inflicted on the ruling Socialist party of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero by the conservative People's Party in regional and local elections on May 22nd (see
). Mr Zapatero was slow to face up to the bursting of the housing bubble, but over the past year he has pushed through spending cuts and some structural reforms. So the double rejection of his government has worried financial markets, already jumpy about resistance to austerity in Greece and Portugal. Spain, too big to bail out, matters still more. 
The surprise in the Spanish protests is that they didn't happen sooner. Youth unemployment is over 40%. Many young Spaniards live at home with parents who are themselves jobless and who may well be struggling to pay debts of their own. The protesters convey a mood more than a message. There is a faint echo of Spain's anarchist tradition in their anti-party, anti-union slogans, mixed with familiar anti-globalisation rhetoric. But there are two strands to their discontent that the politicians should listen to. 
First, the protesters have a point when they say that the political and media establishment has become aloof and self-serving. The politicians who crafted Spain's democratic institutions in the 1970s had good reasons for favouring strong parties and governability over perfect representation. The instability, fragmentation and polarisation that marked the last democratic experiment in the 1930s led to civil war and decades of dictatorship under General Franco. But the unintended result has been over-mighty and unaccountable party bosses. Corruption, though the exception, has often gone unpunished. So there is a case for looking at electoral reform, and especially at introducing an open-list system that would allow voters to pick and choose among individual candidates. Time for Rajoy to come off the fence
The second and bigger reason for the protests is that Spain's rigid two-tier labour market, bolstered by the unions, cossets the insiders who have permanent jobs at the expense of the young and unemployed, who are left out in the plazas. To his credit, Mr Zapatero has begun to cut the cost of hiring. He also wants to make collective bargaining more flexible. But more boldness is needed. Spain's best hope of growing its way out of its mess is through exports; given that membership of the euro means it can no longer devalue, that requires falls in the real value of wages.
Mr Zapatero wisely said this week that he would stick to his guns. But he is on the way out. His party quickly needs to choose a new leader, preferably Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, the shrewd interior minister. As for the People's Party, it is savouring a return to power in elections due by March next year, even though its leader, Mariano Rajoy, has often been equivocal about reforms. With the local elections over, the protests will probably fizzle for a while. But Mr Rajoy should have no illusions. Unless he unveils radical plans to improve the lot of younger Spaniards, they will be back.","How to get the protesters out of the plazas and into jobs

MICHAEL BANKS, a child in the 1964 Disney musical, ""Mary Poppins"", is an unlikely hero for today's angry Spanish youth. But his face features on some of the thousands of posters pinned to the walls of Madrid's central Puerta del Sol square, where protesters have been camped out for almost two weeks. The reason? He demanded his tuppence back from the Dawes Tomes Mousley Grubbs Fidelity Fiduciary Bank, and started a run.
As Spain's ruling Socialists reeled from a ten-percentage-point defeat at the hands of the conservative People's Party (PP) in municipal and regional elections on May 22nd--the party's worst-ever result--some found explanations among the tented demonstrators in Madrid and dozens of other Spanish cities. It is not that the protesters--an ill-assorted mix of anti-capitalists, anarchists and pragmatists bothered about corruption and electoral imbalances--changed voters' minds. It is that they, and people like them, might normally have voted for left-wing parties. On May 22nd the Socialists lost 1.5m, or one in five, of their votes. Yet the communist-led United Left coalition picked up only 210,000. Likewise, Mariano Rajoy, the PP's leader, focused his party's election campaign on the economy and jobs, Spain's two main concerns, but the PP gathered only 560,000 of the spare votes. Its victory was due chiefly to disillusion with the left, not great advances on the right. 
Still, this was an historic drubbing. It is best measured by the record number of regional governments and city halls won by the PP. The party will now run between nine and 11 of Spain's 17 regional governments, and have an important say in several more. The Socialists are left in control of just Extremadura and two regions that did not vote--Andalusia and the Basque country. But all of Andalusia's provincial capitals, including traditionally Socialist Seville, are now in PP hands. 
A general election must be held by the end of next March. Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, the Socialist prime minister, announced in April that he would not stand again, hoping, probably vainly, to save his party by acting as a lightning-rod for voter fury. Few now doubt that Mr Rajoy, on his third try, will move into the prime minister's Moncloa Palace. The question is whether he will land the holy grail of Spanish politics: a parliamentary majority. If repeated, the PP's ten-point lead over the Socialists on May 22nd should do--just. Anything less threatens to leave Mr Rajoy without a mandate for the reforms Spain badly needs. 
Mr Zapatero's popularity has proved inversely proportional to the wisdom of his decision-making. For two years he denied that Spain was in serious financial trouble. His support fell only slightly, despite recession and galloping unemployment. But last May, as contagion spread across the euro zone's periphery, he executed a U-turn, embracing austerity and, to a lesser degree, reform. His ratings plunged. 
Now the Socialists must choose a replacement for him. A bitter fratricidal battle is looming, with calls for an emergency party conference to remove him as secretary-general. If he loses control of his party, Mr Zapatero might be dumped as prime minister, or even have to call an early election, as the PP has urged. A party meeting on May 28th was due to set the course. Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, the deputy prime minister, is the front-runner to replace Mr Zapatero after Carme Chacon declared on May 26th that she would not stand. He would not represent a big change in policy.
As his party grows more uneasy, Mr Zapatero is sticking to an austerity path that aims to reduce Spain's budget deficit from 11.1% of GDP in 2009 to 4.4% by the end of next year. The OECD, a think-tank, says he is on target. The political cost is becoming apparent. But if the Socialists think left-leaning voters abandoned them only because of spending cuts, reduced civil-service pay and pension reform, they should study the demographics of the Puerta del Sol's unhappy campers.
The protesters are mostly students. ""Most live with their parents. Their problem is the lack of a future,"" says Ignacio Sanchez-Cuenca of Madrid's Juan March Foundation, a research body. Spain's already-startling 21% unemployment rate rises to 45% among the young. Growth, at just 0.8% over the past year, remains sluggish. A decade-long bonanza of private borrowing, followed by a spurt in public borrowing when the crisis struck, has left a heavy debt burden. Discharging it may depress growth for years. The Economist's May poll of forecasters predicts growth this year of just 0.6%, followed by 1.1% in 2012. That will create few jobs.
Provisional economic figures released earlier in May contain some worrying details. A surprise upturn in public-sector spending--which increased by 1.1% in the first quarter of 2011 after four quarterly declines--raises questions about decentralised Spain's ability to cut its way to fiscal health. Angel Laborda of Funcas, a savings-banks body, says regional governments and town halls may have been using this year's budget to pay costs from 2010. That implies a hidden extra deficit. 
Many of these administrations are now in the PP's hands. Thorough scrutiny should reveal the true state of the books. The PP now has a good chance to show voters how it would run public finances. So far, its record is mixed. The Madrid region, long a PP bastion, has the lowest deficit of Spain's 17 regions. But PP-governed Murcia is one of the worst performers. 
Markets did not celebrate the PP's win. Bond yields rose and stocks fell, stoking fears that Spain's attempt to ""decouple"" itself from the problems of other peripheral euro-zone countries may be in trouble. Mr Rajoy has criticised Mr Zapatero's pension reform without offering an alternative. If he wants to take control of a country that is not in crisis he must become clearer about his plans for government.","Spain 's young want jobs , the markets want reform and voters want a new government

SPAIN will soon be a country for old men. Most new prime ministers are in their early 40s. But the next one will be a grey-bearded veteran. The choice will be between Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, the Socialist deputy prime minister, who must lead his party into a tough general election due by next March, and Mariano Rajoy of the conservative People's Party (PP). The voters are set to choose Mr Rajoy. An image consultant's nightmare, the bespectacled Mr Rajoy is a dull candidate. He looks like a provincial land registrar--which, indeed, he was before embarking on a political career. He has twice lost elections: his party is bad at ejecting losing leaders. Yet he may win next time with an absolute majority.
Spaniards still complain they know too little about what the enigmatic 56-year-old will bring. Victory will go to him because the election will be lost, not won. The voters savaged the Socialists in municipal elections on May 22nd, giving the PP a record ten-point lead. They had reason to punish their Socialist prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. A once-booming economy crashed on his watch. Unemployment is over 21%, growth may be low for years, bond yields are high and deficit-cutting is causing real pain.
Mr Rajoy has played watch and wait, being careful not to frighten voters with dramatic, drastic proposals. He has shed the ""nasty party"" baggage that damaged the PP in 2008. He has abandoned overblown claims that Mr Zapatero is tearing Spain apart by giving more autonomy to its regions or destroying the family. PP hints that the region of Castilla-La Mancha is bust or that Spain's health system will not survive the year also look alarmist. Mr Rajoy also rarely mentions terrorism practised by the Basque separatist group ETA. Yet many in the party, especially on the right, wish he were more forthright and dynamic. Others offer the faint praise that he will be a better prime minister than opposition leader. Some blame Britain's David Cameron, a fellow conservative: Mr Cameron scared voters by being too open about austerity, they say, and failed to win an absolute majority. 
All this leads to frustration about the PP's plans. ""I don't think anyone really knows what he will do beyond balancing the budget, and that doesn't help calm markets,"" says Jesus Fernandez-Villaverde, an economist at the University of Pennsylvania. ""The degree of courage will depend on the size of the parliamentary majority,"" says Lorenzo Bernaldo de Quiros, of Freemarket International Consulting. That the PP now runs many regions may not help, as some voters may start to see it as an incumbent rather than an opposition.
Mr Rajoy is famed for a trait of his native Galicia: leaving people guessing about his real intentions. But he is also tenacious. Plots to dethrone him as leader have come to nothing. In a party that covers the spectrum of the Spanish right, somebody will always gripe. He and his economic team deny they are hiding their plans, pointing to numerous parliamentary motions. 
A Rajoy government will try to repeat the trick of the first PP government of Jose Maria Aznar after 1996. It met its deficit targets, cut taxes and enjoyed strong growth. Mr Rajoy will quickly pass an austerity package and cut corporate tax. He will push through more labour reform, with or without union consent. And he will hack at business-suffocating red tape. But this is not 1996. Spain has fewer public companies to privatise and cannot count so much on European Union money. How the Aznar model can apply now will depend largely on Mr Rajoy's first finance minister. And who will that be? Like so much surrounding Mr Rajoy, it remains a mystery.

THERE was no rock-throwing or tear gas, but on July 9th Spain's polite ""indignant"" protesters still chalked up a victory. After being endorsed as the ruling Socialist Party's candidate for prime minister in the election due by next March, Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba used his acceptance speech to propose electoral reform. This might not sound much. But Mr Rubalcaba's call for Spain to adopt Germany's voting model, so as to install proportional representation but still let people choose their local deputies, was a direct sop to the movement that spontaneously occupied city squares in mid-May, claiming that the politicians ""don't represent us"".
Nor is this the only success for los indignados (the indignants). Even as police manned the barricades outside parliament on June 21st, deputies were unanimously calling for a much-delayed bill on freedom of information. A week later the government agreed, and also announced new limits on the amounts banks can reclaim from mortgage defaulters. Both measures came after pressure from Europe's best-behaved protest movement.
Yet there were often more deputies inside parliament than protesters outside. Sometimes tens of thousands have turned up to the demonstrations; at other times, just a few dozen. Nobody can blame Spanish politicians for struggling to understand the movement. The indignants, who claim to have no leaders, are themselves unclear what they stand for. Their assembly-based, consensus-seeking debates are painfully slow. Manuel Chaves, a minister, likens their meetings to those of the bickering Peoples' Front of Judea in the Monty Python film ""Life of Brian"".
But politicians ignore the indignants at their peril. Up to 80% of Spaniards say they support the earnest young protesters. Even the occasional lapse into violence, such as a blockade of the Catalan parliament on June 15th, has done little to dent their popularity. Well-mannered rage is their selling point. This is not Athens.
""It is not really a movement,"" says Josep Lobera, a pollster. ""It is a symptom. It expresses a general feeling of concern and anger."" Conservatives rubbish the indignants as extremists. Some see a leftist group girding itself to battle a right-wing reformist People's Party (PP) government, led by Mariano Rajoy, that is likely to win power in the next election. 
That analysis may be right, to judge by a recent open-air assembly on the economy, with a few dozen participants squatting on the paving stones of Madrid's Plaza del Carmen. The ideas they discussed included striking out an obscure clause in the Lisbon treaty that prevents central banks giving cheap credit to governments, and holding a referendum on labour and pension reforms. The recent ""pact for the euro"" was another target. Some contemplated a general strike. So far, so left. 
But if this is extremism, why does support for the indignants hold up when the communist-led United Left party wins just 4% of the vote? One answer is that it is not only left-wingers who are indignant. ""It is true there are many people from the far left, but there are also some economic liberals and centrists,"" says Francisco Canero, a former small businessman and now an activist. The movement is bound by complaints, not solutions.
Political parties are one concern. Spaniards rate politicians their third-biggest problem, behind the economy and unemployment. Polls show broad support for removing the statute of limitations on the corruption cases that poison regional and municipal politics. But analysts also point to a wider change of mood. Court investigations into the tax affairs of Emilio Botin, head of Banco Santander, and suspected fraud at the Spanish Society of Authors, which campaigns against internet piracy, help to fire up the indignants. Bankinter, a retail bank, has responded to fury over home repossessions by introducing the first Spanish mortgage that can be walked away from, American-style, simply by handing over the keys.
Mr Rubalcaba has begun to bash bankers. He accuses them of lending to people who they knew could not repay, and threatens extra taxes. A polite nod, perhaps, to mannerly indignation--but one that carries hints of populism.

But politicians ignore the indignants at their peril. Up to 80% of Spaniards say they support the earnest young protesters. Even the occasional lapse into violence, such as a blockade of the Catalan parliament on June 15th, has done little to dent their popularity. Well-mannered rage is their selling point. This is not Athens.
""It is not really a movement,"" says Josep Lobera, a pollster. ""It is a symptom. It expresses a general feeling of concern and anger."" Conservatives rubbish the indignants as extremists. Some see a leftist group girding itself to battle a right-wing reformist People's Party (PP) government, led by Mariano Rajoy, that is likely to win power in the next election. 
That analysis may be right, to judge by a recent open-air assembly on the economy, with a few dozen participants squatting on the paving stones of Madrid's Plaza del Carmen. The ideas they discussed included striking out an obscure clause in the Lisbon treaty that prevents central banks giving cheap credit to governments, and holding a referendum on labour and pension reforms. The recent ""pact for the euro"" was another target. Some contemplated a general strike. So far, so left. 
But if this is extremism, why does support for the indignants hold up when the communist-led United Left party wins just 4% of the vote? One answer is that it is not only left-wingers who are indignant. ""It is true there are many people from the far left, but there are also some economic liberals and centrists,"" says Francisco Canero, a former small businessman and now an activist. The movement is bound by complaints, not solutions.
Political parties are one concern. Spaniards rate politicians their third-biggest problem, behind the economy and unemployment. Polls show broad support for removing the statute of limitations on the corruption cases that poison regional and municipal politics. But analysts also point to a wider change of mood. Court investigations into the tax affairs of Emilio Botin, head of Banco Santander, and suspected fraud at the Spanish Society of Authors, which campaigns against internet piracy, help to fire up the indignants. Bankinter, a retail bank, has responded to fury over home repossessions by introducing the first Spanish mortgage that can be walked away from, American-style, simply by handing over the keys.
Mr Rubalcaba has begun to bash bankers. He accuses them of lending to people who they knew could not repay, and threatens extra taxes. A polite nod, perhaps, to mannerly indignation--but one that carries hints of populism.

THE game was up. Last week Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, Spain's prime minister, announced that the country would hold a general election on November 20th, four months earlier than planned. In doing so, he was bringing forward a new era in Spanish politics. The unpopular Mr Zapatero, who has responded only belatedly to Spain's economic difficulties, announced several months ago that he would not seek another term in office. But he knows that his successor as Socialist candidate for prime minister, Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, stands virtually no chance of winning the vote. Polls suggest that Mariano Rajoy, leader of the opposition conservative People's Party (PP), looks certain to triumph.
Mr Rajoy pledges reform, and Spain certainly needs it. The economy is stagnant. At 21%, the unemployment rate is by some way the worst in the European Union. With borrowing costs once again spiralling this week, Mr Zapatero was forced to postpone his summer holiday to cope with the crisis. Mr Rajoy called for the vote to be held sooner, in October .
Mr Rajoy realises that what Spaniards most want are jobs and a sound economy. But he also offers something that stretches credibility: austerity without pain. ""I do not intend to make social cuts,"" he says. 
Since May, when the PP soared to victory over the Socialists in local and regional elections, voters have had a sneak preview of the party in office. The PP now runs 11 of Spain's 17 autonomous governments; this matters in a decentralised country where regional administrations accounted for almost a third of the overall budget deficit last year.
The signs are not encouraging. Elena Salgado, the finance minister, wants regional governments to do their bit by limiting their budget deficits to 1.3% of GDP this year. At a meeting last week she urged them to return money advanced by central government in previous years on the basis of growth estimates that turned out to be overly optimistic. 
Not possible, squealed the PP regions (backed by Socialist Andalusia). Some claimed that sending the money back would squeeze their ability to finance health and education properly. Tiny Murcia--historically a big over-spender--even threatened to hand back administration of those services to Madrid. ""The government asphyxiates us,"" moaned Salvador Marin, the region's finance boss. In the end Ms Salgado blinked, offering soft loans to cover half the money the regions must return, and so in effect bumping up the national debt.
Some PP-run regional governments have eked out efficiencies, cut investment and merged departments. Madrid, for example, has been even more austere than the central government wished. But elsewhere, problems are mounting. In Catalonia, whose economy is as big as Portugal's, the minority nationalist government plans to run a deficit of 2.7% of GDP this year, more than twice Ms Salgado's limit. The PP, which props up Artur Mas's administration in Barcelona, has identified EUR 1.2 billion ($1.7 billion) of further savings. But rather than reduce the deficit further it wants this money ploughed back into health services. 
Mr Rajoy faces a dilemma over the coming months. To win votes he must seem moderate, but to gain respect from the markets and Brussels he must seem severe. For the moment, votes are what counts. One recent poll showed that the Socialists had cut the PP's lead to seven percentage points. If that transpires on election day, Mr Rajoy would find himself at the head of a minority government, with less clout over the economy.
Either way, cutting the deficit is likely to be one of his hardest tasks. He is against raising taxes so, if growth does not pick up, he must cut spending instead. This year Spain is aiming to bring the deficit down from 9.2% of GDP to 6%. Next year's target is 4.4%. In private, some in the PP acknowledge that Ms Salgado has made a good start. It is now time for their leader to show how he means to follow her.

WHO'S in charge here? As the jittery Socialist government of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, Spain's outgoing prime minister, pushes through a constitutional change to cap budget deficits, it looks increasingly as if Mariano Rajoy, the leader of the conservative opposition, is already in the driving seat.
Demands for a German-style ""golden rule"" deficit cap have long been a mantra for Mr Rajoy's People's Party (PP). Hitherto, they have met with Socialist scorn. Now the two parties plan to write a cap into the constitution before parliament is dissolved on September 27th. It is the first big change since the document was drafted in 1978, three years after Franco died.
Soraya Saenz de Santamaria of the PP solemnly announced the new cross-party agreement on what she called ""one of the main structural reforms needed by the Spanish economy"". From tone and content, a first-time visitor might have divined that the PP was already in power--which, according to opinion polls, it will be after a general election due in November.
Mr Zapatero's latest U-turn, like previous pirouettes on pensions, labour reform and spending cuts, was a response to the markets and to Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy. The German chancellor and French president jointly demanded golden rules across the euro zone in August. Spain will now get there before France. Only Germany currently has a constitutional ""debt brake"" in its Basic Law. If Spain needs EU help to keep sovereign-debt yields down, it can at least tell suspicious Germans that it is an eager, obedient pupil. 
In private, Mr Zapatero reportedly told Socialist critics this was the ""least harsh"" option left as sovereign-debt yields soared and the European Central Bank bought Spanish bonds in large quantities. But what will voters make of it? Some want a referendum. Opponents say the cap, which would limit the structural budget deficit to 0.4% of GDP from 2020, would tie the hands of future governments too tightly. Unions have called demonstrations.
But there are get-out clauses for recessions or national crises. And with the actual figure to be established by a separate--and more easily alterable--law, wriggle-room is guaranteed. 
Socialists fear that Mr Zapatero has handed the PP an early electoral gift. But Spaniards remain Eurofanatics, and the socialists hope they will get credit for this step towards euro-zone economic integration. ""If Europe is to adopt measures, we should be in the lead group,"" says Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, the Socialist candidate for prime minister.
What the measure will not do is plug Spain's current deficit hole, likely to be 6% this year. Moreover, 2020 is light-years away in political terms, and with 21% unemployment Spain's more urgent need is for growth. Though Mr Rajoy has scored a victory, the economy needs much more than his golden rule.","The parties agree on a German - style constitutional deficit cap

ON SEPTEMBER 26th Spain's parliament was dissolved, ahead of a general election on November 20th. The next day King Juan Carlos signed only the second change to the constitution in its 33 years--to fix a budget-deficit cap by 2020. 
Two momentous days for Spain. But there was little excitement, perhaps because the election result already seems clear. Mariano Rajoy of the opposition conservative People's Party (PP) is set to become presidente del gobierno, as Spaniards call their prime minister, ending nearly eight years of Socialist rule under Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. Polls give Mr Rajoy a lead of up to 15%, enough to give him an absolute majority in parliament, something Mr Zapatero never secured.
The scale of the task that Mr Rajoy will face is growing by the day. Spain's unemployment rate of 21% is by some way the highest in the European Union. The problem is getting worse: in September the number of registered unemployed took its biggest monthly leap for 15 years. Many of the new jobless are civil servants, including health workers and teachers, laid off by regional governments. Goldman Sachs predicts that the next prime minister will spend his first year in office presiding over a shrinking economy. 
Mr Zapatero's government, meanwhile, cancelled an attempt to ease the debt burden by selling part of the state lottery company, which runs the famous El Gordo (Fat One) payout at Christmas, saying that in the current climate it would not get a reasonable price. And the central bank has nationalised three more of Spain's troubled cajas (savings banks), at near-zero valuations. 
Mr Rajoy's instincts are reformist, and an absolute majority would no doubt make his life easier. But Spain's economic predicament creates its own restrictions. Mr Rajoy has pledged to meet Spain's EU-agreed targets, which will force him to cut the budget deficit from 6% of GDP this year to 4.4% next year and 3% in 2013. He has reportedly held back from unveiling details of his policy programme until he knows whether Spain can afford them. 
The plans that the PP has already proposed, including tax cuts for small and medium-sized businesses and a EUR 3,000 ($4,000) subsidy to those hiring their first employee, are intended to create jobs. But whether a PP government will make the radical labour-market reforms needed depends in part on who becomes finance minister. Mr Rajoy is keeping this a secret, saying only that he will reach outside the party if need be. 
The Socialists, who will be led into the election by Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, a former deputy prime minister, say that Mr Rajoy is running a ""Valium campaign"", full of benign statements of intent but short on detail. He will avoid taking on Mr Rubalcaba in television debates, they believe, to stop the campaign turning into a contest over the future of the welfare state.
But voters have had a chance to see PP politicians in action since the party's victory in local and regional elections in May. PP-run regional governments are pushing through tough austerity programmes, with Castilla-La Mancha pledging to cut spending by 20% next year. The government in the Madrid region is fighting a fierce battle against secondary-school teachers, whose numbers are being reduced. Parents have received angry letters penned in staffrooms and handed to children. Teachers have gone on strike on five days of a school year that has barely begun. Health workers in Catalonia, where the PP props up a nationalist government, are also in revolt. 
This tendency to provoke conflict, think some Socialists, may be a chink in the PP's armour. It will not be enough to win them re-election in November. But some in the party are thinking of the next election, in 2015 or 2016. If Mr Rajoy cannot turn things around by then, they may be back.","Mariano Rajoy's will have a tough job on Mariano Rajoy's hands

WHEN ETA broke off a ceasefire in 2007, Jesus Eguiguren, a Basque negotiating on behalf of the Spanish government, warned his separatist counterpart, Francisco Javier Lopez Pena, that his destiny was to spend years in jail. ""And you should buy black ties,"" Mr Lopez Pena retorted, for the funerals of future victims of the Basque terror organisation. 
Both men were right. ETA killed ten times over the next three years. Mr Eguiguren was pall-bearer at the funeral of Isaias Carrasco, his friend and fellow Basque Socialist. But in 2008 Mr Lopez Pena, then ETA's leader, was captured in France.
On October 20th, one of Mr Lopez Pena's successors--believed to be a former lawyer called David Pla--donned a beret and a white face-mask and filmed a statement in which he announced a definitive end to ETA's 40 years of terrorism. For Spain, it was an historic moment. A bloody campaign that began under Franco's military dictatorship and claimed 829 lives was finished. ""The nightmare is over,"" declared Inigo Urkullu, head of the Basque country's biggest party, the moderate Basque Nationalist Party (PNV).
One reason ETA has downed arms is that hardliners like Mr Lopez Pena are behind bars. Another is that the campaign of terror he had planned failed to happen. Several of his successors were detained in a series of joint Spanish-French police operations. ETA became virtually inoperative. Ten killings in three years was paltry by its standards. ""Spanish democracy has defeated ETA,"" declared Antonio Camacho, the interior minister.
Yet it is too early to write ETA's obituary. It has neither disarmed nor disbanded. A violent breakaway group, similar to the Real IRA in Northern Ireland, could emerge. ETA has asked for talks with Spain and France. This, it says, is how ""armed confrontation"" can be finally overcome.
Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, Spain's Socialist prime minister, deserves credit for dragging ETA this far. But the job of negotiating with the group will fall to his successor, after a general election on November 20th. That will almost certainly be Mariano Rajoy, whose conservative People's Party (PP) looks set to win a landslide.
Talking to ETA is ""a betrayal of the dead,"" Mr Rajoy once said. But so far he has displayed moderation. ""This is a great piece of news,"" he said, before calling for ETA's dissolution. When Spaniards start to enjoy a peace dividend in the form of lower security costs and higher tourism receipts in the Basque country, pressure will build to sort out the remaining issues.
Concessions to ETA's demand for a separate Basque state are out. But the government could take other steps, such as moving some of the 700 ETA prisoners in Spanish and French prisons closer to the Basque country, or exercising leniency on day- and early-release programmes. Still, ETA is not in a strong bargaining position. Mass prisoner-release programmes, if they ever come, must wait. The problem of ETA members in hiding, like Mr Pla, is trickier. Most Spaniards want to see them in court. They may prefer to be exiled to a beach somewhere in the Caribbean.
ETA's arms, hidden in France and the Basque country, must inevitably be given up, says Brian Currin, a South African lawyer. The PP has denounced his fellow ""mediators"", including Kofi Annan, a former UN secretary-general, as unwelcome meddlers. Mr Rajoy may, however, need them to oversee a discreet disarmament process.
A separate demand comes from the politicians who led ETA away from violence. Banned front parties, like Batasuna, want to be allowed back into mainstream politics. A coalition they linked up with, Bildu, won 26% of Basque votes in municipal elections in May, suggesting that it has much to gain from Spanish democracy. Mr Rajoy will come under pressure to respond. All this will take years but, happily for the long-suffering Basques, there is no taste for turning back.

Unemployment has hit 22.6%, and over 5m Spaniards are jobless (see chart on next page). One in nine households has nobody in formal paid employment. Growth is at a halt; a second recession looms.
In Castile-La Mancha, officials admit they will overshoot their deficit target by a factor of seven. The outgoing Socialist finance minister, Elena Salgado, insists Spain will meet its target of 6% of GDP this year, but overspending regions (Castile-La Mancha is the worst offender) threaten this, as do flattening tax revenues. Spain's banks must raise some EUR 26 billion ($36 billion) in new capital by June, a quarter of the total demanded for the euro zone by the European Banking Authority. And they have yet to digest their toxic assets, mostly loans to developers to build on land that is almost worthless or occupied by some of the country's 700,000 empty homes. The central bank says these problem loans could total EUR 176 billion ($243 billion).
With polls giving the PP a 15-point lead over Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero's outgoing Socialists, Mr Rajoy is heading for an absolute parliamentary majority. From this position of strength he could drive through serious reform. So why did the PP's full manifesto this week fail to make many newspaper front pages?
Greece's referendum on the euro bail-out, which sent Spain's debt yields soaring too, was partly to blame. But another reason was what Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, who has replaced Mr Zapatero as the Socialists' candidate, calls the ""calculated ambiguity"" of a manifesto that is long on intentions but short on specifics. PP officials argue that, given the euro crisis, promises now may look foolish or impossible tomorrow. But the manifesto is ambitious in tone: a slimmer state, with lower business taxes, looser employment laws and less red tape would, it claims, spur growth and get employers hiring again. 
Privatisation of television stations and other public companies comes with a taste for public-private partnerships and outsourcing public services to private contractors. Reforms could make it cheaper for employers to hire and fire. Collective-bargaining changes should allow companies to make more competitive wage deals. An Austrian-style fund built up by individual workers to cover spells of unemployment is promised. Banks will be encouraged to shed or write down their toxic assets.
Public austerity and transparency are the watchwords in the manifesto. Few doubt the PP's commitment to a 3% deficit by 2013. But that will mean increasing the tax take, says Pablo Vazquez of FEDEA, an economic think-tank. So how can Mr Rajoy lower business taxes? And if he cannot, how can he spur the economy? Curing Spain will not be easy--or quick.","The centre - right heads towards a big win but a poisonous inheritance

TIPOS INFAMES IS a fine bookshop in central Madrid, run by three young friends and stocked with the sort of books you were always meaning to read, until work and children got in the way. Well aware that the intellect needs gentle encouragement, the owners lure you in with strong coffee and generous glasses of Spanish wine. Running a bookshop is difficult, says ""Curro"" Llorca; these days he doesn't get so much reading done either. But business is passable.
Curro and his friends needed three years to set up shop. They had to obtain a full house of separate permits, one to sell books, a second to sell coffee and a third to sell wine. The town hall said not to worry and advised Curro to open his doors while he was still waiting for the paperwork. But the budding entrepreneurs wondered what they would do if the police turned up.
Tormented by unemployment, Spain needs new firms like Tipos Infames. Yet in the World Bank's ranking of how easy it is to start a business the country comes only 133rd, after Kenya. 
Next to quelling the crisis, the single most important task facing Europe's economies is to grow, because only then will they eventually be able to pay off their debts. In order to do that, they need to improve their competitiveness. And the best route to improved competitiveness is to streamline the public sector and overhaul the markets for labour and services. 
Yet Europe has failed for many years to accomplish just such structural reforms. Looking at Curro, the economic logic for change is unanswerable. But the politics is grim. Across Europe, business is held back by bureaucracy. Powerful interest groups are protected at the expense of everyone else.
The crisis only strengthens the case for reform (see box). But it also means that reform must take place against the background of austerity, as societies struggle to determine who will shoulder the burden of debt. The darkening clouds of civil disobedience and anarchy confronting Greece's new government show where this struggle can lead. Europe's future depends not just on governments putting forward the right policies but on the capacity of democracies to bring about peaceful change. How to gain in Spain
How might reform work? Again, consider Spain. Reform there should stand a good chance. The country has done well out of EU membership. After it joined in 1986, incomes caught up with the rest of the union. Its large exporters have remained an island of efficiency, as competitive as any in Europe. Spain recently signalled its commitment to the euro zone by writing a cap on future deficits into the constitution. 
Moreover, the Spanish may be about to vote for change. An election later this month is likely to bring in a new conservative government under Mariano Rajoy of the People's Party (PP). If the opinion polls are to be believed, he stands to win a sweeping victory and to be able to govern with an absolute majority. Given that the PP also controls many of Spain's regions, Mr Rajoy will have an unprecedented mandate to remake Spain. ""People know the PP is going to be severe,"" says Jose Ignacio Torreblanca of the European Council on Foreign Relations.
But what a task he faces. A prime target will be Spain's notoriously dysfunctional labour market. This provides a group of ageing, virtually unsackable ""insiders"" with gold-plated contracts, whereas the rest have to make do with highly insecure temporary contracts. Among other things, insiders benefit from wage-escalation clauses, so that in 2009 real pay rose by 3.2% even though the economy shrank by 3.7%. And Spain gives young people a terrible deal: in a downturn they are the first to be sacked. Not only are roughly half of under-30s out of work, but those who do have jobs are mainly on temporary contracts that leave them without a career structure and give firms no incentive to train them. 
Mr Rajoy is elusive about his plans. The outgoing government has undertaken some labour-market reform, but most people expect the PP to go much further and doubt that the weakened Spanish unions will be able to put up much of a fight. But that is the easy bit. To transform the Spanish economy, Mr Rajoy also needs to take on two far more elusive foes.
First is the country's dense jungle of regulation and bureaucracy. This dates back to Franco, who from the 1950s sought to give Spaniards more freedom by trying to establish the rule of law even as he denied them democracy. The profusion of administrative law created a dense and unaccountable bureaucracy. Ignacio Sanchez-Cuenca, director of the Juan March Institute in Madrid, encountered so many obstacles to hiring academics from outside the EU for the institute that it took up a quarter of his time. So he hired a firm of lawyers to do the job and now spends 5-10% of his budget that way.
What makes Spain's bureaucracy especially poisonous is Mr Rajoy's second foe: the country's fiercely independent regions. Each tends to interpret regulations in its own way, so over time the Spanish market has fragmented. Juan Jose Guemes, a PP politician and a professor at the IE Business School in Madrid, explains how the star-rating system for hotels differs slightly across Spain, which limits competition among national and international chains and reduces economies of scale. Last year the Catalan government decreed that hotels must serve pa amb tomaquet, bread with tomato, a local speciality, if they are to count as ""luxury"". Miguel Cardoso, an economist at BBVA, a Spanish bank, estimates that, thanks to a lack of competition, half of the inflation in Spain over and above the average for the euro zone in the past 15-20 years came from firms increasing their margins.
Mr Guemes's colleague at IE, Fernando Fernandez, adds that each of the regions sponsors its own development policy and its own businesses, often financed by local savings banks. This is inefficient, but the regions are popular because they spend taxes collected by the central government. Moreover, regional autonomy is an antidote to the centralising, anti-union bias of Franco's Spain. Even if the centre can control the regions' spending--a big if--""we have a free market at the national level and are protectionist at the regional level,"" says Mr Fernandez.
Each reforming government in Europe faces different obstacles, but Spain is typical of them all in the sense that radical structural reform entails rewriting the social contract. Just now the generous wages of many of those in Spain's protected jobs are supporting entire households of unemployed spouses and grown-up children. Scrapping thousands of bureaucratic rules will not just make the economy more efficient but also recast the relations between government and citizen. However unambiguous the economics of reform, the politics is almost always hard.
Too hard for some. Rome alone is said to have half as many lawyers as the whole of France. The legal system there moves so slowly, Italians joke, that they put you in jail when you are accused and release you when they find you guilty. Yet faced with the liberalisation of their profession in a recent budget, Italy's lawyers somehow managed to hang on to their perks--was it because so many politicians are lawyers?
Instead of imposing reforms, the fag-end of a government under Silvio Berlusconi has relied excessively on tax rises. After he was shamed by euro-zone leaders during recent summits Mr Berlusconi at last came up with a more ambitious programme--but even then he was obliged to accept the supervision of the IMF. The mix of hopelessness and humiliation has left his government close to collapse.
Others have shown more courage. Ireland's government has cut wages and slashed benefits and services. Unit labour costs have fallen by 8% and the economy grew by 1.6% in the second quarter. The cuts have been even harsher in Estonia, where the economy shrank by 15% in 2009. Growth has soared since then and unemployment tumbled. Still, both economies face a hard slog. Because they are counting on foreign demand as a source of growth, they are vulnerable to a global recession.
The nightmare is Greece. Government there has never been about the rational design and administration of policy, but about dishing out patronage. When George Papaconstantinou, the country's finance minister at the time, was asked why tax receipts collapsed in 2009, the year his government came to office, he explained that ""the first thing the government does in an election year is pull the tax collectors off the streets."" 
Even so, the government of George Papandreou (in which Mr Papaconstantinou served) undertook reform with a savagery that would once have been unthinkable. He had a gun to his head, because the troika of the EU, the IMF and the ECB release aid each quarter only if the Greek government meets its targets. 
Yet, beset by protests, a shrinking economy, the dishonour of being bossed around by foreigners and the prospect of a decade of further austerity, Mr Papandreou could not carry the country with him. His reluctantly resigned, following a botched proposal to hold a referendum on the euro zone's plans for Greece. The installation of a new government of national unity smacks of Argentina, where a succession of short-lived administrations fought to avoid default--before eventually succumbing.
Mr Papandreou's ejection contains a warning. At root, the solvency of a country is determined by the government's capacity to raise revenues and cut spending. Politicians run up against the popular will long before they run out of things to tax.
The crisis has also brought down governments in Ireland, Portugal and Slovakia. Spain, and others, are likely to follow. Where will voters turn when they have had their fill of austerity and reform? The lesson of the 1930s and of emerging-market crises down the years is that people can take only so much austerity. If the burden gets too heavy, the political system collapses.
This fear lies behind the warnings of Milton Friedman and Martin Feldstein, two American economists, who said that the euro is inherently unstable. Until recently euro zone leaders scoffed at such talk. But in the past couple of weeks they have suddenly begun to contemplate Greece's departure from the single currency. And contemplation is one step short of action. Their change of heart is not just because of mayhem in Athens, but also because of the difficult politics of the euro at home.""

FOR a taste of the real Spain, try Castile-La Mancha. This is the land of Manchego cheese and saffron. The vast plains are dotted with the windmills at which Don Quixote once tilted. Squatting incongruously among them is a EUR 1.1 billion ($1.5 billion) white elephant: Ciudad Real's airport. Other than the chirping of autumn crickets, the silence is absolute. The last commercial flights ceased at the end of October (the airport remains open to private planes). The only signs of life at the visitor centre are bats in the ventilation shafts. 
This airport tells a tale about Spain. In the past decade, during el boom, money poured in, inflating a huge construction bubble. Grand infrastructure projects like Ciudad Real airport sprouted. Many of Spain's 17 regional governments channelled cash into trophy schemes--universities, art galleries, high-speed rail--with no concern for whether they would pay their way. They were abetted by the cajas, small unlisted savings banks, often with opaque ownership structures, that lent recklessly on the assumption that property prices could move only in one direction. 
All these sins are evident in Ciudad Real's airport. Although private, it was backed by Castile La-Mancha's Socialist government. It was part-funded by a caja that went bust. After a couple of years of misery, in which passenger numbers came nowhere near estimates, the airport's managers filed for bankruptcy. It is tempting to call the project quixotic, but the owners got there first: the airport was opened under the name ""Don Quijote"" in 2008.
The story also explains why, in a general election on November 20th, Spain will eject its prime minister--the last of the five most troubled euro-zone countries to do so since the crisis broke. At least the exit of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, Spain's Socialist prime minister since April 2004, looks graceful next to the chaotic departures of George Papandreou of Greece and Silvio Berlusconi in Italy. Mr Zapatero's days have been numbered since April, when he said he would not seek a third term. Instead, he made Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba his party's candidate.
Mr Zapatero's legacy will be unhappy. When the crisis hit in 2008 the construction boom was already over. Yet Mr Zapatero would not accept that Spain was vulnerable. Its well-regulated banks had avoided dodgy subprime ventures, he insisted. But over the years the economy had grown unproductive, uncompetitive and unbalanced. By 2008 construction accounted for 10% of output, twice the euro-zone average. Wages had outpaced productivity. Although public debt remained low, private-sector indebtedness had soared. By the time Mr Zapatero saw the light in May 2010, it was too late. His reform efforts since have been halting at best.
The results are ugly. Unemployment in Spain, at 22.6%, is the highest in the European Union and the OECD. Among 18- to 24-year-olds it is an eye-watering 46%. The economy is heading into another recession. Spain is going to miss its budget-deficit target of 6% of GDP for 2011. The markets will ask some hard questions next year. And the man charged with answering them will be Mariano Rajoy, leader of the centre-right People's Party (PP).
Mr Rajoy is no stranger to Spaniards, having led the PP to defeat in general elections in 2004 and 2008. This time, thanks to disillusionment with the Socialists, his party has a double-digit poll lead and looks set to win an absolute majority, a feat that eluded Mr Zapatero. The stars have aligned neatly for Mr Rajoy. Unlike the new technocratic prime ministers in Greece and Italy, he will have a strong mandate for reform. He will be constrained neither by pre-election promises (he has made few) nor, probably, by the need to placate smaller parties. After sweeping local and regional elections in May, the PP runs most of Spain's regions, which account for one-third of public spending; this should make fiscal consolidation easier.
Yet the euro crisis will not wait. Mr Zapatero's belated reforms have eased some of the pressure. At a euro summit in Brussels on October 26th, the Financial Times reported that an early draft of the communique included a long section applauding Spain for its reforms above a section on ""Italy"" that was left blank. Bond investors agree. Since the European Central Bank first intervened to buy debt from the two countries in August, Spain has partly ""decoupled"" from Italy (see chart, next page).
For how long? Italy's difficulties only make Spain more vulnerable. The size of the PP's poll lead and investors' faith in Mr Rajoy have won time. But the new government, which will take office in mid-December, will still have to move fast. Luis de Guindos, an economist at IE, a business school, widely tipped to be Mr Rajoy's finance minister, says it must have a ""comprehensive plan"" by the end of February. Spain's destiny may lie beyond its control; this week it paid almost 7% in a ten-year bond auction, its highest since 1999. ""Our short-term fate is in the hands of the ECB,"" says Jorge Galindo, a public-policy analyst. Do not underestimate the quiet man
What can Spaniards expect from their next prime minister? Mr Rajoy's enigmatic personality fits the Spanish archetype of the gallego, a native of his home region of Galicia. ""People who work with him often don't understand what he wants,"" says Carlos Cue, a correspondent for El Pais. ""This is entirely intentional."" Lacking in public charisma, Mr Rajoy is said to be charming and witty in private. Although he lacks the belligerent streak of Jose Maria Aznar, his predecessor as PP leader and a previous prime minister, his persistence at the top of the party suggests a certain steeliness. ""He's not an active leader,"" says Mr Cue. ""He waits for others to make mistakes. Over 30 years this has proved a very successful strategy."" Mr Rajoy is not keen on international travel (to the despair of advisers) and, typically for Spaniards of his generation, not fluent in English. He has been taking intensive lessons this year, helped by his two young bilingual sons.
Some observers fear that Mr Rajoy is more likely to give Spain a gentle prod than the smack of firm government. But others say his conciliatory style is just what is needed: the more he can drag his country with him through the painful reforms, the more likely he is to succeed. ""He is a man of dialogue,"" says Jorge Moragas, Mr Rajoy's chief of staff and a possible foreign minister. There may even be an attempt to work with the Socialists in parliament. 
Either way, a degree of public disquiet seems certain. A general strike may come next year. But the unions are weak: a previous strike in September 2010 fell humiliatingly flat. Josep Lobera of Metroscopia, a pollster, says that no more than 20% of Spaniards will be implacably opposed to Mr Rajoy. ""Spanish society is prepared to accept reform,"" says Mr Moragas.
In the run-up to the election the PP has talked tough on the need for reform but been short on specifics. Mr Rajoy says unemployment will be his first priority, and he is likely to take up Mr Zapatero's unfinished work on labour-market reform. Antiquated rules, some dating from Franco, have left a deeply distorted system. Collective arrangements for wage bargaining create inflexibility. Spain's array of job contracts sets up rigid distinctions between protected insiders and vulnerable outsiders, especially the young, who toil on temporary contracts without job security, if they find work at all. No wonder thousands have become indignado protesters. 
Another issue is the banks. Earlier this year Spain's central bank took on the cajas, nationalising some and forcing others to merge. But their asset books are clogged with bad debts and repossessed property. Shrinking credit is a big threat to the economy. ""Banks need to be helped to do their job,"" says Ignacio Munoz Alonso, CEO of Addax Capital, a fund manager. ""That is to lend money, not to be large real-estate managers."" Worse may be to come: property prices are only 22% off their 2008 peak. Guesses at the recapitalisation needs of the cajas run as high as EUR 100 billion.
Then there is the question of where Spain can turn for growth, now that its construction adventure has juddered to a halt. Spain lacks Italy's broad industrial base, but as Rafael Domenech of BBVA, a bank, points out, it has a number of strong, diversified international companies. Exports are doing well, shrinking the gaping current-account deficit. There is a well-educated cadre of scientists and engineers, though links between academia and business are weak. With public spending shrinking the private sector has a lot of slack to take up. Cristina Garmendia, Spain's outgoing science minister, warns that slashing R&D in a fit of deficit mania will harm Spain's prospects. 
One piece of good news is that Spain is so riddled with inefficiencies that there are relatively obvious reforms to be made. Powers in such areas as health and education are distributed across central, regional and local levels, with inevitable duplication. Mr Rajoy has indicated that he plans to tackle this issue. ""There is an opportunity to introduce some rationality into the regional accounts,"" says Mr de Guindos. 
A potential trouble-spot is Catalonia, which accounts for a fifth of Spain's economy. The Catalan government, run by the nationalist, pro-business Convergence and Union (CiU) since an election last November, is at one with the PP on the need to control spending. ""On issues like labour reform we should coincide,"" says Andreu Mas-Colell, the Catalan economy minister. But, as several speakers at the party's glitzy election launch in Barcelona made clear, CiU is spoiling for a scrap with Madrid over the distribution of powers and revenues. Its first aim is to secure for the Catalans the right to raise more of their own taxes. The Basques enjoy this privilege, they say; why should they not as well?
Another priority is to keep more of their own money. Transfers to Madrid from Catalonia, one of Spain's richest regions, amount to 8-9% of the Catalan economy. Interviewed at his 14th-century palace in Barcelona, Artur Mas, the Catalan president, likens himself to Margaret Thatcher demanding a budget rebate from Britain's European partners. This ""Catalan agenda"", says Mr Mas, will be the price of his support for a Rajoy government in Madrid should the PP fail to secure a majority. 
Mr Rajoy will be hoping that the outcome for his party on November 20th will be as happy as the polls predict. He looks likely to get his wish. But for his sake and Spain's, he must hope that his reserves of luck extend far beyond election night.

The ""supercommittee"" on America's budget deficit admitted defeat in Congress. The panel was set up in August to thrash out a bipartisan agreement to reduce the deficit. Its failure to do so triggers automatic spending cuts of $1.2 trillion, to start in 2013. But arguments have already begun about how ""automatic"" the cuts should be, with some Republicans pressing for the Pentagon to be spared. 
The latest Republican presidential candidates' debate focused on national security.

A special UN-backed court in Cambodia began to try the three most senior living leaders of the Khmer Rouge on genocide charges. The three men, who include Nuon Chea, ""Brother Number Two"", are the only members of the regime deemed fit to stand as defendants. At the trial's opening they justified their reign of terror in the context of the historical threat posed by Vietnam, and denied the charges outright.
South Korea's national assembly ratified a free-trade agreement with the United States, four years after the two countries first signed the deal and a month after it was approved by Congress. Despite a projected boost to the Korean economy and, the prospect of closer ties with America at a time of worsening relations with North Korea, the agreement was strongly resisted by the opposition. One assembly member disrupted the vote by letting off a tear-gas canister.

Spain's general election was won by the opposition centre-right People's Party, led by Mariano Rajoy. The ruling Socialists suffered their worst rout at the polls since the return of democracy to Spain in 1975. Mr Rajoy has an absolute majority, but will not take office for a month. Although he promises austerity and reform, nervous markets sent Spanish bond yields higher. 
In its latest efforts to solve the euro crisis the European Commission set out options for Eurobonds and for more intrusive control of national governments' budgets. But Angela Merkel yet again rejected the idea of Eurobonds.
Hungary turned to the IMF for a precautionary credit line. The government of Viktor Orban had previously ruled out any such course.

The three men , who include Nuon Chea , "" Brother Number Two "" , are the only members of the regime deemed fit to stand as defendants . At the trial 's opening they justified their reign of terror in the context of the historical threat posed by Vietnam , and denied the charges outright . 
 South Korea 's national assembly ratified a free - trade agreement with the United States , four years after the two countries first signed the deal and a month after it was approved by Congress . Despite a projected boost to the Korean economy and , the prospect of closer ties with America at a time of worsening relations with North Korea , the agreement was strongly resisted by the opposition . One assembly member disrupted the vote by letting off a tear - gas canister . 
 Pakistan 's ambassador to the United States was forced to resign , amid allegations that he was behind a memo pledging to eject senior soldiers close to the Taliban in Pakistan , in exchange for American help in preventing any potential coup . 
 Aung San Suu Kyi 's National League for Democracy party said it would participate in Myanmar 's forthcoming by - elections . Last year the party boycotted Myanmar 's first general election in two decades . 
 Julia Gillard , the prime minister of Australia , scored a political victory when the lower house of parliament passed the controversial Minerals Resource Rent Tax , which will subject mining companies to a higher levy on annual profits . Australia 's upper house is expected to pass the law early next year and the tax should then come into force on July 1st . Hard work ahead 
 Spain 's general election was won by the opposition centre - right People 's Party , led by Mariano Rajoy . The ruling Socialists suffered their worst rout at the polls since the return of democracy to Spain in 1975 . Mariano Rajoy has an absolute majority , but will not take office for a month . Although Mariano Rajoy promises austerity and reform , nervous markets sent Spanish bond yields higher . 
 In its latest efforts to solve the euro crisis the European Commission set out options for Eurobonds and for more intrusive control of national governments ' budgets . But Angela Merkel yet again rejected the idea of Eurobonds . 
 Hungary turned to the IMF for a precautionary credit line . The government of Viktor Orban had previously ruled out any such course . 
 Elio di Rupo , the politician charged with forming a Belgian government , submitted his resignation after failing to strike a deal on next year 's budget . Belgium has been without a new government since an election in June 2010 . 
 Vladimir Putin , who plans to return as Russia 's president next year , got a surprise when a crowd booed as he entered a mixed martial arts ring to congratulate the winner of a fight . Officials , who tightly control Mr Putin 's crafted public appearances , at first suggested that the boos were aimed at the fighters .",230,Spain,A30-57,PRE TERM,True,Mariano Rajoy,3,True

NO WONDER that, even in his moment of triumph, Mariano Rajoy seemed impatient with the jubilant celebrations by supporters of his conservative People's Party. On November 20th Mr Rajoy led the PP to an absolute majority in the Spanish parliament with the biggest margin of victory since 1982 (see
). He did so despite (or perhaps because of) his promise to be more rigorous than the outgoing Socialist government of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero in imposing austerity to keep Spain in the euro zone. Yet Mr Rajoy knows that, with the markets in a eurofunk and bond yields at eye-watering highs, mere promises count for little. 
His victory was in part a tribute to the dogged persistence and quiet moderation of a man who has led his party for eight years. But it owed more to Spaniards' rejection of his predecessor. Mr Zapatero will be remembered for liberalising measures, such as on gay marriage and abortion, that helped to make Spain a more modern, tolerant place. But he was slow to see that a housing bubble masked a loss of competitiveness, and slower still to react to the crash. His political frivolity was summed up by his decision in July to call an early election on a drawn-out timetable that keeps him in office until next month.
Mr Rajoy looks to be made of sterner stuff. His first task will be to make bigger spending cuts to meet fiscal targets agreed on with the European Commission. But austerity alone will not cut Spain's horrendous unemployment rolls (close to 5m-strong, with more than 45% of youngsters out of work). The test facing the new government is how to get back to growth. One answer is to complete the clean-up of the banks to get credit flowing again.
Another is to cut unhelpful regulation. Mr Zapatero merely tinkered with a dysfunctional labour market, in which the difficulty of firing incumbents deters hiring and binding national agreements decree unaffordable wage rises. Mr Rajoy has rightly promised comprehensive reform. Growth is also held back by red tape. Much of this stems from Spain's exaggerated decentralisation. The democratic constitution's creation of 17 autonomous regions tried to reverse Franco's heavy-handed centralisation, while keeping enough national control to satisfy the right, long nervous about self-government of Basques, Catalans and Galicians. In fact it has led to waste in public spending and to 17 sets of business regulations, fragmenting the national market and increasing costs. And it has failed to settle Spain's historic quarrels: Basque and Catalan nationalists have exploited their status as coalition partners of the two main parties to demand ever more powers. One country--or 17?
Mr Rajoy's absolute majority in parliament plus his party's control over many of Spain's regions could allow him to start rolling back this trend. He should be cheered that a new centrist group which split from the Socialists in protest over Mr Zapatero's toadying to the regions took almost 5% of the vote. Although Basque separatists, boosted by the end of ETA's terrorism, and Catalan nationalists also did well, one lesson of the euro crisis applies also at home: too much splintering makes governing an economic union harder.
For all Mr Zapatero's dilatoriness, Spain has taken more decisive action than Italy to tackle the budget deficit. Unlike Italy and Greece, it now has a new government with the fresh energy provided by a thumping democratic mandate. Mr Rajoy knows that the euro's survival depends on Germany summoning up the political will: it was no coincidence that he was soon on the phone to Angela Merkel. But the more decisive he is at home, the stronger will be his case for foreign backing.","The new government in Madrid needs to claw back some powers from the regions

IT IS an historic opportunity. Not since Felipe Gonzalez's Socialists swept to victory in 1982 has a Spanish leader been handed as big a mandate for change. On November 20th Mariano Rajoy's People's Party (PP) took 186 out of the 350 seats in the parliament, meaning that he has no need to barter with smaller parties. The PP's control of two-thirds of regions and 40% of town halls should allow him to push reform throughout the system. A March poll in Andalusia, in the south, where the PP may end decades of Socialist hegemony, is the only election looming. Mr Rajoy enjoys both freedom and huge power.
On the other hand, Spain's problems are huge too: zero growth at best, bond yields near bail-out levels and unemployment at 23% (and 46% for youths). Reminders of the grim outlook have come daily since Mr Rajoy's victory. The small Bank of Valencia has had to be rescued. Funcas, a think-tank, predicts a 0.5% drop in GDP next year. And bond yields keep breaking unwelcome records. Only urgent action can ease the pressure. But it cannot come before late December, when the handover of power is complete. Until then, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, whose Socialists lost a third of their seats, stays in charge.
How will Mr Rajoy use his strength? The sphinx-like leader is staying mostly mum for now. But two post-election speeches and his deliberately detail-light manifesto offer some clues. He promised to regain respect in Brussels and Frankfurt. A day later he professed a deep-seated love of the European Union. Spain, in other words, is determined to stay in the euro. Whatever the pain, it will try to hit deficit targets of 4.4% of GDP in 2012 and 3% in 2013. With this year's deficit over 6% and recession looming, that will take big spending cuts and tax rises. The regions offer to help: Catalonia plans to cut pay, and Madrid has set aside a contingency fund in case income runs short in 2012. 
But if Spain is to be the good pupil of southern Europe, it also wants to be teacher's pet. More specifically, it wants gold stars from Germany's Angela Merkel. ""Those who comply cannot be treated in the same way as those who don't,"" said Mr Rajoy's deputy, Maria Dolores de Cospedal. The implication is that the European Central Bank should stand behind Spanish government bonds in order to prevent a bail-out, and that Mrs Merkel should publicly back Spain. Reform takes time to spark growth; Mr Rajoy cannot hold the markets at bay alone.
He starts with some advantages. In a nod to Mr Zapatero's efforts, Fitch, a ratings agency, has talked of ""a strong recent record of taking additional measures to meet its fiscal targets"". Unlike his predecessor, Mr Rajoy needs to make no political U-turn. He is already preaching austerity and reform. Nor will he behave like Italy's backsliding Silvio Berlusconi. Indeed, he is rather more in tune with Mrs Merkel than with France's Nicolas Sarkozy.
So will the ECB and Germany answer the call? Mrs Merkel demands instant action. ""You have received a clear mandate from your people to decide on and quickly apply the necessary reform measures,"" she told Mr Rajoy after the election. Reforms matter as much as deficit targets. Mr Rajoy wants to cut taxes to boost growth, but there is little room. He has also vowed to maintain the spending power of pensions, which Mr Zapatero froze.
Who will mastermind reform? A former economic secretary, Luis de Guindos, leads the betting for finance minister. Soraya Saenz de Santamaria, a long-term party aide, and Alberto Ruiz-Gallardon, Madrid's mayor, look set to be cabinet stars. PP governments also often favour party members from the upper echelons of the civil service: political technocrats. 
The key to reform is to make the state more efficient and boost growth, all at minimal cost. Labour-market reform is high on the list. Setting a long-term deficit cap, as permitted by a recent constitutional amendment, will be another big task. The centrist Union for Progress and Democracy, Spain's fourth party, which did well in the election, says 2.6% of GDP could be saved by spreading best practices across regions and cities. Another 1.6% might come from town-hall mergers. Some of the 5,000 bodies owned by regions or town halls, from broadcasters to garbage collectors, could be closed or sold. Many PP regions would jump at privatising local broadcasters. And there is talk of recentralising some powers. Madrid's PP regional boss, Esperanza Aguirre, would happily hand back control of the courts. But independent-minded Catalans and Basques will resist. The savings may be elusive.
In the end Spain must have support from Mrs Merkel and the ECB. They want to see reforms first. But if they hold back for too long, the markets will strike first.","Mariano Rajoy has to act fast -- and urgently needs outside support

AFTER nearly eight years in opposition Spain's conservative People's Party (PP) is back in power. But the ministers appointed by Mariano Rajoy, the new prime minister, are unlikely to be in the mood to celebrate. A shocking year for Spain, 2011 saw unemployment climb close to 23% and yields on sovereign debt break euro-era records. Yet the PP's first year in office could be worse. Joblessness is still rising and growth will be anaemic; Luis de Guindos, the new economic-affairs minister, says that Spain is returning to recession. 
Speaking two months before Spain's general election on November 20th, Mr de Guindos provided a handy list of the country's woes. ""Spain has a big debt problem, a big real-estate problem, a big solvency problem in some financial entities,"" he said. That was not all. ""It has a competitiveness problem and deteriorating public finances. Above all what makes Spain vulnerable is its unemployment."" 
By splitting the finance ministry, Mr Rajoy has separated the two main economic tasks facing Spain. Mr de Guindos must chase growth. Meeting deficit targets falls to Cristobal Montoro, the new minister of the treasury and public administration. 
Mr Rajoy dislikes tax rises. So Mr Montoro will have to squeeze the regional governments, which are responsible for health and education, and where overspending has almost certainly prevented Spain from meeting 2011's budget-deficit target of 6% of GDP, which was agreed on with the European Union. Moody's, a credit-rating agency, believes that the target will be missed by more than one percentage point. Angel Laborda of Funcas, a think-tank, thinks it could be closer to two. 
Every extra percentage point on the deficit means an extra EUR 10 billion ($13 billion) of tightening to meet 2012's deficit target of 4.4%. Even if the 2011 target were met, that would still leave EUR 16.5 billion to be found to stay on track. Reducing the deficit by, say, EUR 30 billion in one year without tax rises looks extremely difficult. By comparison the ""Save Italy"" plan announced by Mario Monti, Italy's new prime minister, amounts to EUR 30 billion spread over three years (although the country has other austerity plans running in parallel). 
Mr Rajoy's first cabinet meeting, on December 23rd, did little more than appoint junior officials. Stronger stuff was expected from the next gathering, on December 30th. Mr Rajoy has already signalled where some savings will be made. The number of publicly owned companies and state foundations will be slashed. Overlapping areas of government administration will be brought into line. There will be a civil-service recruitment freeze. 
But the plan has holes. Much of the public sector, including the police and ""basic services"" (presumably health and education), will be exempt from the freeze. And Mr Rajoy is committed to letting pension payments rise with inflation. 
Happily for him the Socialist opposition is in disarray, squabbling about who will take over the party leadership from Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, the outgoing prime minister. The initial opposition to Mr Rajoy's government will probably come from the streets, in the form of trade-union and indignado protesters. 
A decade ago a previous PP government, led by Jose Maria Aznar, backtracked on a proposed labour reform after unions organised a general strike. But with a big majority and his party in control of most of the Spanish regions, Mr Rajoy is in a strong position. He knows that the markets and Spain's European partners are watching. He also knows that Spain needs reform, not just austerity. 
Labour reform is the first test. Mr Rajoy has given the unions until mid-January to strike a deal with employers. That is unlikely to happen, so he will use his parliamentary clout to act alone by the end of March. The law needs to become clearer and simpler, especially for small businesses. ""It is still easier to fire people than change their working conditions,"" says Salvador del Rey of the Cuatrecasas International Institute, a labour-law think-tank. ""We need deep change, and then stability."" 
Financial services are another priority. The Spanish banks rescued so far have turned up larger losses than they had previously reported. Mr Rajoy admits that some banks' balance-sheets contain ""latent or hidden losses"". Under new plans soured property assets will have to be sold or priced to market. That will usher in a fresh wave of consolidation. 
Mr de Guindos, formerly of PwC and Lehman Brothers, knows this territory. The problem is not as bad as some believe, he has said, but only transparency will prove him right. The government wants to act fast. Banking reform, Mr Rajoy has pledged, will be done by the summer. 
None of this will count for much if the euro zone goes into meltdown. Soraya Saenz de Santamaria, the new deputy prime minister and a powerhouse in Mr Rajoy's administration, says that her boss will personally oversee economic policy. Much of that work will be done at increasingly frequent summits of euro-zone leaders. Mr Rajoy has already said that Spain's structural budget deficits will be limited to 0.4% of GDP by 2020. That puts Spain ahead of the field in readying itself for the euro zone's coming fiscal treaty. 
To help him negotiate this new terrain, Mr Rajoy will be squired by two young lieutenants: Jorge Moragas, his chief of staff and a former diplomat, and Alvaro Nadal, head of his economic office. Unlike Mr Rajoy both men speak English, and Mr Nadal knows Angela Merkel's Germany well. In his embrace of austerity and reform Mr Rajoy is talking Mrs Merkel's language. But will she listen if Spain needs her help?","Mariano Rajoy takes office at a dismal time for Spain 
 AFTER nearly eight years in opposition Spain 's conservative People 's Party ( PP ) is back in power . But the ministers appointed by Mariano Rajoy are unlikely to be in the mood to celebrate . A shocking year for Spain , 2011 saw unemployment climb close to 23 % and yields on sovereign debt break euro - era records . Yet the PP 's first year in office could be worse . Joblessness is still rising and growth will be anaemic ; Luis de Guindos , the new economic - affairs minister , says that Spain is returning to recession . 
 Speaking two months before Spain 's general election on November 20th , Mr de Guindos provided a handy list of the country 's woes . "" Spain has a big debt problem , a big real - estate problem , a big solvency problem in some financial entities , "" he said . That was not all . "" It has a competitiveness problem and deteriorating public finances . Above all what makes Spain vulnerable is its unemployment . "" 
 By splitting the finance ministry , Mariano Rajoy has separated the two main economic tasks facing Spain . Mr de Guindos must chase growth . Meeting deficit targets falls to Cristobal Montoro , the new minister of the treasury and public administration . 
 Mariano Rajoy dislikes tax rises . So Mr Montoro will have to squeeze the regional governments , which are responsible for health and education , and where overspending has almost certainly prevented Spain from meeting 2011 's budget - deficit target of 6 % of GDP , which was agreed on with the European Union . Moody 's , a credit - rating agency , believes that the target will be missed by more than one percentage point . Angel Laborda of Funcas , a think - tank , thinks it could be closer to two . 
 Every extra percentage point on the deficit means an extra EUR 10 billion ( $ 13 billion ) of tightening to meet 2012 's deficit target of 4.4 % . Even if the 2011 target were met , that would still leave EUR 16.5 billion to be found to stay on track . Reducing the deficit by , say , EUR 30 billion in one year without tax rises looks extremely difficult . By comparison the "" Save Italy "" plan announced by Mario Monti , Mariano Rajoy's , amounts to EUR 30 billion spread over three years ( although the country has other austerity plans running in parallel ) . 
 Mariano Rajoy's first cabinet meeting , on December 23rd , did little more than appoint junior officials . Stronger stuff was expected from the next gathering , on December 30th . Mariano Rajoy has already signalled where some savings will be made . The number of publicly owned companies and state foundations will be slashed . Overlapping areas of government administration will be brought into line . There will be a civil - service recruitment freeze . 
 But the plan has holes . Much of the public sector , including the police and "" basic services "" ( presumably health and education ) , will be exempt from the freeze . And Mariano Rajoy is committed to letting pension payments rise with inflation . 
 Happily for Mariano Rajoy the Socialist opposition is in disarray , squabbling about who will take over the party leadership from Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero , the outgoing prime minister . The initial opposition to Mariano Rajoy's government will probably come from the streets , in the form of trade - union and indignado protesters .

IN HIS first appearance before parliament last month Mariano Rajoy, Spain's new prime minister, said he had no intention of raising taxes. Only eleven days later, on December 30th, he brought in thumping tax rises on income, savings and property. 
It was the sort of ploy Mr Rajoy's Socialist predecessor, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero (who preferred indirect taxes), never dared to make, not least because Mr Rajoy's right-wing People's Party (PP) would have accused him of bleeding middle-class wage-earners dry. But in the back-to-front world of budget deficits, principle is often the first casualty. In 2010 Mr Zapatero himself executed a famous U-turn, freezing pensions, raising the retirement age, cutting civil-service pay and imposing austerity on regional governments. 
Mr Rajoy's switch will turn Spain into one of Europe's highest-tax countries. The top income-tax rate will jump by seven points to 52%, although few Spaniards declare an income above the EUR 300,000 ($390,000) threshold. Then there are regional top-ups. Catalonia, for example, will now tax high earners at 56%. In Europe only Sweden has a higher rate. Even those at the bottom of the income scale will see tax rises. Taxes on savings will also go up. And property taxes, paid to town halls, will rise for richer owners. 
When the left cuts benefits and the right raises taxes, something has gone wrong. In this case it is Spain's budget deficit, which missed its 2011 target of 6% of GDP by a mile. Nobody yet knows how bad the overshoot is, but the government says the outcome could be 8% or more (see chart). That would mean Mr Zapatero's government managed barely one-third of the task of cutting it from the 2010 figure of 9.3%. 
Mr Rajoy's government wants to avoid being prodded by bond markets or nagged by Angela Merkel, the German chancellor. But its task is getting harder by the day. The deficit target for 2012, agreed with the European Union, is 4.4% of GDP. Given 2011's missed target that leaves a gap of close to EUR 40 billion to be filled. The new taxes will cover only EUR 6.3 billion of that. Another EUR 8.9 billion will come from spending cuts. But all that accounts for only half the hole. Spain's sales tax--at 18%, low by European standards--may come in for scrutiny. 
Expect more announcements in the coming days, says Cristobal Montoro, the treasury minister. These will include structural reforms to encourage growth. ""The government has an aggressive reform programme,"" says Luis de Guindos, the new finance minister. But the gaping sore of unemployment, at 23% by far the highest in the EU, is likely to worsen before it improves. December saw yet another rise. 
The bad news continues to pour in. The social-security system is in the red for the first time since 1999. Something must be done about the banks ( 
). Andrew Benito of Goldman Sachs thinks the economy will shrink by 1.5% this year. Spain risks a downward spiral in which fiscal tightening harms growth, putting further pressure on public finances. 
Reining in the deficit depends largely on regional governments. The central government says they accounted for most of 2011's overshoot. Catalonia will be less of a burden this year, but other big regions like Andalusia and Valencia may be tougher to tame. Both are immersed in corruption scandals, and concerns about probity will spook financial markets. Happily most regions are now in PP hands (Socialist-run Andalusia holds an election in March).

IT IS perhaps no coincidence that Luis de Guindos, Spain's new finance minister, is a former banker. He has been charged by Mariano Rajoy, the new prime minister, with the task of whipping Spain's bloated financial system into shape. Mr de Guindos reckons the country's banks need to set aside another EUR 50 billion ($65 billion) in provisions for bad property loans. This would help tidy up their balance-sheets, but it's not yet clear how it will happen or who will foot the bill. 
The Bank of Spain says there are EUR 176 billion of non-performing real-estate loans and foreclosed assets (52% of the banking system's total property book). Banks have already set aside provisions covering a third of these bad assets. Add in an extra EUR 50 billion, which is about 5% of Spain's GDP, and provisions would cover eventual losses of 60%, in line with the average haircuts that were applied to Irish property loans when they were transferred to that country's bad bank. 
The difference with Ireland is that Spain is not now planning on setting up a large bad bank of its own to warehouse impaired property assets. Spain's largest banks--Santander, BBVA and CaixaBank--were all dead against it. And in an Irish-style scenario, where the government swallows discounted loans on land and buildings as well as foreclosed assets, the state would need over EUR 100 billion to purchase the assets and recapitalise the banks, according to Morgan Stanley's estimates, or more than 10% of GDP. This would have compromised Spain's relatively low debt-to-GDP ratio. 
In any case, the state already owns quite a few bad assets. It nationalised four weak lenders last year and auctioned off a fifth, Banco CAM, with a generous asset-protection scheme. Banks are part-financing these rescues: the industry-backed deposit-guarantee fund (FGD) provided CAM's guarantees. But the FGD has limited resources. Ultimately, the state is still on the hook. Barclays Capital estimates that the government is already exposed to EUR 40 billion of potential losses. 
Mr de Guindos says that the majority of banks can pay for the new provisions out of their profits and it could be done over several years. This sounds too optimistic. The European Central Bank's move in December to give Europe's banks cheap three-year loans has given Spanish banks some breathing room. But Spanish lenders will make just less than EUR 20 billion in pre-provision profits this year, according to estimates by Cheuvreux, a broker, with large variations among individual institutions. Dragging the provisioning process out over several years would just be kicking the can down the road, and risks exacerbating a credit crunch. And although the new cushion looks about right for now, the total amount of dud loans could well rise as Spain dips back into recession. 
The government doubtless hopes that the new provisioning requirements act as a wake-up call for weak banks to start looking for partners. Mergers could theoretically help to sort out banks that face large losses. And Spain is overbanked. ""The big banks could play a useful role in a rapid restructuring and Spain should take advantage of that,"" says Francisco Uria of KPMG, an accounting firm. The caveat is that the big banks--the natural buyers of the large, weak savings banks, or cajas--are already short of capital. They have been ordered to raise a whopping EUR 26.1 billion by the European Banking Authority (EBA) by June; only Greek banks had a bigger shortfall in the EBA's latest stress tests. 
There is another source of capital: bondholders of dud banks could be forced to take losses. But the snag is that most of these bonds are held by retail investors. Mr de Guindos may yet have to dip into government coffers to find the cash.","New government, old problem

NICOLAS and Mario. Angela and Nicolas. Mario and Angela. The year is starting with a burst of speed-dating among the leaders of the euro zone's three biggest economies. Their talk is of the single currency, which is threatened by economic failings in Mario Monti's Italy, Nicolas Sarkozy's France and in even weaker Mediterranean countries--but also by dogmatism in Angela Merkel's Germany. The three leaders accept that they have not averted all the dangers, but claim to be making progress. ""We have laid the groundwork for the medium term but have not yet won back trust,"" said Mrs Merkel after her meeting with Mr Sarkozy on January 9th. 
All are minding their manners, and yet tensions are apparent. Mr Monti, a technocrat (and former European commissioner) who took over from the populist Silvio Berlusconi in November, marked his visit to Berlin by warning Die Welt, a newspaper, that Italians could turn against the painful reforms he is trying to enact, and that Europe and Germany would be blamed. Mr Sarkozy, who faces a tough re-election fight this spring, carefully hides his differences with Mrs Merkel but sympathises with Mr Monti. The trio, an expanded version of the familiar Merkozy ensemble, will all convene in Rome on January 20th. 
Mrs Merkel's hope is that trust will build up gradually from the groundwork already laid. A German-inspired ""fiscal compact"", enshrined in a new treaty and enforced by sanctions, could be signed either at the next European Union summit, on January 30th, or the one after, in early March. This austerity agenda will be supplemented by a friendlier growth- and jobs-producing ""leg"", also largely of German design. The idea is to spread best (usually northern European) practices in areas like labour-market regulation and to spend European funds more effectively. Even with its own economy weakening, Germany plans no new stimulus package to boost demand at home or in faltering peripheral countries like Italy and Greece. 
Mr Monti and Spain's recently elected prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, are among the new leaders who largely accept Mrs Merkel's view that deficit-cutting and structural reforms are what matter most. Mr Sarkozy is a recent convert. But, as Mr Monti's warning suggests, they do not think these will be enough. The fiscal pact must not ""strangle"" weak economies, Mr Monti said. At the post-summit press conference he called for lower interest rates, code for Eurobonds guaranteed by all euro countries and for more market support by the European Central Bank (ECB). 
The Germans think enough billions have already been pledged to wobbly euro members. These mechanisms should be given a chance to work (the ECB will advise the European Financial Stability Facility, the EU's temporary bail-out fund). The ECB is independent, but is more likely to help if governments do the right things. Markets are already starting to reward reformers, especially Spain, with lower interest rates. Despite German resistance, discussion of topping up the bail-out fund will resume at the March summit. 
Mrs Merkel's hoped-for crescendo of trust could be interrupted in two ways. One is a deep European recession, brought about partly by the euro crisis and partly by the fiscal tightening urged by Germany as a way of resolving it. The other is Greece, which is not part of Mrs Merkel's virtuous group. A Greek exit from the euro is seen in Germany as impractical, if not unthinkable. A ""disorderly default"" is more possible, but that is largely in the hands of the Greeks. Greece is an ""exceptional case"", Mrs Merkel insists. She and her friends must pray she is right.","Euro - zone leaders meet and talk , but have not resolved their crisis

IT IS a huge, gleaming spaceship moored imperiously in an old riverbed. But Valencia's iconic City of the Arts and Sciences complex floats on a tempestuous sea of regional debt. 
The dazzling masterpiece, by Santiago Calatrava, a local architect, is a reminder of the buoyant optimism that swept through this eastern region during Spain's boom years. But as Mariano Rajoy, the new prime minister, gets to grips with the country's fiscal problems, all eyes are on the regional governments that funded glittering projects like this. 
Mr Rajoy's centre-right People's Party (PP), which took power in December, largely blames the regions, which provide key services and account for a third of the country's public spending, for Spain's failure to meet last year's budget-deficit target agreed with the EU. Definitive data is absent, but the government says it missed the goal of 6% of GDP by at least two percentage points. The regions had been told to limit their deficits to 1.3%. FEDEA, a think-tank, reckons Valencia was one of the worst offenders, with an estimated deficit of 4.2%. Moody's, a ratings agency, has reduced the region's creditworthiness to junk status. 
Valencia's budget boss, Jose Manuel Vela, puts the 2011 deficit lower, at 3-4%. He blames the previous Socialist government in Madrid for starving the regions of funds. But he admits to having been surprised by the depth of the downturn that set in after Spain's housing bubble burst. ""We all thought it would carry on. That was a mistake."" Not one of Spain's 17 regions met the 1.3% target last year, according to FEDEA. 
As Spain battles to convince its European partners and the markets that it can rein in the overspend, Valencia will be watched, not least because Mr Rajoy's party has run it for 17 years. If the PP cannot clean up its own backyard, what hope elsewhere? Mr Vela insists his government will meet its 1.3% target this year. He has slashed spending and, against the PP's principles, raised taxes. Angry protests show that the cuts have bitten. But Spain's economy has nosedived in recent months. The IMF reckons it will shrink by 1.7% this year. Mr Vela says Valencia can cope with that, but more protests seem inevitable. He pledges a balanced budget by 2014. 
A new draft budget law hands the government some big sticks. Failing regions face fines, inspectors and intervention. But Mr Vela wants help, too. Loosening obligations on the regions would be a start. A shorter list of part-funded prescription drugs, for example, would save money. 
In the meantime Mr Rajoy's government wants greater realism about Spain's growth prospects and, implicitly, its ability to crunch its budgets. This year's national deficit target of 4.4% assumes growth of 2.3%. Cristobal Montoro, the budget minister, says such a figure does not help the government to be ""realistic"". Mr Rajoy, wary of accusations of backsliding, carefully pledges to meet whatever target he is set. 
Catalonia, Spain's wealthiest region, is a cheerleader for slow consolidation rather than shock therapy. It rebelled against last year's target, vowing to spread its adjustment over two years. This was glaring proof of Madrid's inability to impose its will. FEDEA estimates that Catalonia beat its own 2.6% target this year. That is overgenerous, but makes the region's pledge to hit 1.3% this year more credible. ""To establish unreachable goals is to destroy confidence, which is what we most need,"" says Artur Mas, the Catalan president. 
Jose Ignacio Conde-Ruiz of Madrid's Complutense University thinks the 4.4% target can be met. There are reasons to believe him. The absence of regional elections (except in Andalusia, which votes in March) removes from politicians a temptation to splurge. Thirteen regions are run by the PP, which should allow Mr Rajoy to impose his will. Juan Rubio-Ramirez of Duke University in North Carolina thinks the government may be exaggerating last year's deficit to give itself wriggle room. 
A mystery remains. Spain's regions went an estimated EUR 14 billion ($18 billion) over budget in 2011. Who is financing the shortfall? Short-term bank loans and unpaid suppliers are the best guess. That is unsustainable. Mr Montoro is now offering help via the state's credit institute. Valencia, which failed to cover the redemption of a EUR 1.8 billion bond in December, already needs it. Before long others probably will too.","Mariano Rajoy seeks to rein in regional spending 
 Mariano Rajoy IS a huge , gleaming spaceship moored imperiously in an old riverbed . But Mariano Rajoy's floats on a tempestuous sea of regional debt . 
 Mariano Rajoy is a reminder of the buoyant optimism that swept through this eastern region during Spain 's boom years . But as Mariano Rajoy , the new prime minister , gets to grips with the country 's fiscal problems , all eyes are on the regional governments that funded glittering projects like Mariano Rajoy . 
 Mr Rajoy 's centre - right People 's Party ( PP ) , which took power in December , largely blames the regions , which provide key services and account for a third of the country 's public spending , for Spain 's failure to meet last year 's budget - deficit target agreed with the EU . Definitive data is absent , but Mariano Rajoy says Mariano Rajoy missed the goal of 6 % of GDP by at least two percentage points . The regions had been told to limit their deficits to 1.3 % . FEDEA , a think - tank , reckons Valencia was one of the worst offenders , with an estimated deficit of 4.2 % . Moody 's , a ratings agency , has reduced the region 's creditworthiness to junk status . 
 Valencia 's budget boss , Jose Manuel Vela , puts the 2011 deficit lower , at 3 - 4 % . He blames the previous Socialist government in Madrid for starving the regions of funds . But he admits to having been surprised by the depth of the downturn that set in after Spain 's housing bubble burst . "" We all thought it would carry on . That was a mistake . "" Not one of Spain 's 17 regions met the 1.3 % target last year , according to FEDEA . 
 As Spain battles to convince its European partners and the markets that it can rein in the overspend , Valencia will be watched , not least because Mr Rajoy 's party has run it for 17 years . If the PP can not clean up its own backyard , what hope elsewhere ? Mr Vela insists Mariano Rajoy's will meet Mariano Rajoy's 1.3 % target this year . He has slashed spending and , against the PP 's principles , raised taxes . Angry protests show that the cuts have bitten . But Spain 's economy has nosedived in recent months . The IMF reckons it will shrink by 1.7 % this year . Mr Vela says Valencia can cope with that , but more protests seem inevitable . He pledges a balanced budget by 2014 .

SPAIN'S Socialist Party specialises in nail-biting leadership contests. Its new head, Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, followed this tradition on February 4th, scraping to victory by just 22 of the 955 votes cast at a convention in Seville. His opponent, Carme Chacon, a 40-year-old female former defence minister, would have made a more striking choice, but it was not to be. 
Mr Rubalcaba is a party veteran who became deputy to Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero just as the prime minister's popularity plummeted in 2010. An aura of defeat already surrounds the 60-year-old. He was the party's candidate for prime minister at November's general election, when Mr Zapatero decided not to run again. The Socialists lost a third of their deputies, their worst result in 35 years, as the People's Party (PP) led by Mariano Rajoy swept to an absolute majority. Mr Rajoy may now stay in power for at least eight years. 
The Socialists' ills extend beyond parliament. They preside over just two of Spain's 17 regional governments and could lose their stronghold of Andalusia to the PP in March. That would be a big blow to Mr Rubalcaba's standing. Today the biggest Socialist-run city is Zaragoza, fifth in size behind the PP-run Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia and Seville. 
How can a man so closely linked to Mr Zapatero's failures expect to win back voters? Mr Rubalcaba's answer is to veer left. He supports bank taxes, looser budgets and less power for the Roman Catholic church. But Spaniards recall him as a member of the government that increased the retirement age, froze pensions, cut civil-service pay and raised sales tax in 2010. He offered not a squeak of complaint then. 
Moreover, Mr Rajoy has stolen some of the Socialists' clothes. He has raised pensions and taxes on high earners, and also capped salaries for bankers who receive state funds. He wants the EU to relax Spain's tough deficit targets. At the behest of France's Nicolas Sarkozy, Mr Rajoy even backs a Tobin tax on financial transactions. Yet unemployment in recession-hit Spain, already running at 23%, could stay high for at least four more years--long enough for voters to start blaming Mr Rajoy. And the PP's determination to reverse some popular Socialist measures, including abortion on demand, may open fresh fronts. 
Mr Rubalcaba is said by some to be preparing for a bruising battle as opposition leader before handing over to a fresh face, who would then take on Mr Rajoy. Potential candidates include the Basque regional premier, Patxi Lopez, and another parliamentary deputy, Eduardo Madina. Ms Chacon is also still an option. Yet Mr Rubalcaba promised to step down after November's election, only to run again. Who is to say he will not want another go? 
That would mean an even longer wait for Spain's first woman leader of a party and potential prime minister. But remember that she might not be a Socialist at all. Look out for Soraya Saenz de Santamaria, Mr Rajoy's impressive deputy, who is the same age as Ms Chacon.","The new Socialist leader is a chip off the old block -- but he may not last

SPAIN'S new government is learning to be wary of microphones. Mariano Rajoy, the prime minister, was caught by one claiming his labour reform would provoke strikes. Luis de Guindos, the economy minister, was overheard calling it extremely aggressive. When the reform was unveiled in a decree of February 10th, expectations were of a radical simplification of Spain's rigid labour laws, which help keep unemployment at 23% (and youth unemployment at 47%). 
This third reform in two years is a ragbag of measures. Among them are changes that hand recession-hit Spain a tool for survival inside the euro: internal devaluation. ""The average salary will go down. That will improve competitiveness and the chances of exporting, eventually creating more jobs,"" says Jose Ramon Pin of the IESE business school. 
By cutting red tape, the new law makes it easier and cheaper to lay off workers. For most firms, maximum lay-off payments will be reduced from 42 months' pay to 12 months, says Mr de Guindos. That may not immediately affect growth, he adds, but it will hugely boost business confidence. ""The reform changes the idea companies have that labour rules are an obstacle,"" says Salvador del Rey, of the Cuatrecasas International Institute, a think-tank. Another measure tackles Spain's top-heavy collective-bargaining system. Whereas unions and employers previously imposed terms from above, companies can now break free of them. This means employers can negotiate shorter working hours or lower wages. 
Spain has lost 2.9m jobs in four years, with almost 300,000 shed in the latest quarter. It takes an average of 15 months to find work. Some reckon 400,000 more jobs may go this year, pushing unemployment to 25%. Sacking workers has long been a favoured way to reduce costs. With rules that stop people from switching jobs also being relaxed, the labour market will gain new flexibility. 
Spain's labour laws, which date back to the Franco era, have condemned half the workforce to unemployment or to temporary jobs while the rest enjoy ironclad contracts and huge redundancy pay-offs. The new law blurs this insider/outsider divide and may thus get more people into stable employment. The decree comes on top of a January agreement by unions and employers to limit pay rises over the next three years. Mr de Guindos thinks most Spaniards see the need for labour reform. But its success in terms of growth may depend on unions' choice between protecting jobs and keeping up their members' pay.","A change that may be more radical than it seems at first

BP reached a deal with some of the parties bringing a civil suit against it over the oil spill caused by an explosion at a rig in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. The energy giant is to pay out around $7.8 billion to fishermen and other businesses from a fund earmarked for those affected by the disaster. A trial that was set to start on February 27th, but was delayed when negotiators said they were close to a settlement, will now be put off indefinitely. BP still has to settle with the federal government, and unless it does so the trial will go ahead. Either way it faces a big payout.

India imposed an immediate ban on cotton exports for the second time in two years. Although it is the world's second-biggest producer of the fibre (after America), the Indian government wants to increase its domestic supply of the stuff to help textile companies battling high cotton prices. But its decision to halt exports did little for its reputation in international markets. 
A jury in Texas found Allen Stanford guilty of operating a $7 billion Ponzi scheme, one of the biggest frauds in history. Mr Stanford, a former banker who based part of his business in Antigua and used his riches to sponsor his own cricket tournament in the West Indies, was arrested in 2009. He will be sentenced later this year and faces decades in prison.

Peugeot-Citroen launched its EUR 1 billion ($1.3 billion) share issue, through which General Motors is taking a 7% stake in the company as part of their recently announced alliance. The price of the shares in the offer were discounted by a hefty 42%. The debt-laden French carmaker said it might like to buy a reciprocal stake in GM in the future, but not now. 
General Motors suspended production of its Chevrolet Volt hybrid electric car for five weeks because sales of the vehicle are below target. The Volt has won some big awards, including ""European Car of the Year"" recently and ""Green Car of the Year"" in 2011. But only around 7,700 were sold in America last year and stock has been building up. GM has set itself an ambitious goal to sell 45,000 Volts in 2012.

Tim Cook, Apple's boss, said the device would become the ""poster child of the post-PC world"".","China-watchers pored over the government's pronouncement that it will aim for an economic growth rate of 7.5% this year, the first time in eight years that the official target has been under 8%. Some wonder if Beijing's resignation to slower growth will hurt the region and commodity-rich countries, such as Australia, that feed China's mighty appetite for raw materials. But the government's new focus on domestic demand as a driver of the economy was welcomed by those who think it should do more to reduce global trade imbalances. 
Still too high 
Spain's long-term borrowing costs rose above those of Italy for the first time in eight months, after Mariano Rajoy, the Spanish prime minister, admitted that Spain's deficit this year would be above that agreed with the EU. Meanwhile, Greece hastened efforts to convince more private creditors to sign up to a restructuring of the Greek sovereign debt they hold, which is a condition of Greece's recent bail-out package. 
Oil prices remained high, despite news of a push by the West to open fresh talks with Iran over its nuclear programme. Brent crude fetched more than $125 a barrel; the price has risen by around 15% since the start of the year. 
BP reached a deal with some of the parties bringing a civil suit against it over the oil spill caused by an explosion at a rig in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. The energy giant is to pay out around $7.8 billion to fishermen and other businesses from a fund earmarked for those affected by the disaster. A trial that was set to start on February 27th, but was delayed when negotiators said they were close to a settlement, will now be put off indefinitely. BP still has to settle with the federal government, and unless it does so the trial will go ahead. Either way it faces a big payout.

India imposed an immediate ban on cotton exports for the second time in two years. Although it is the world's second-biggest producer of the fibre (after America), the Indian government wants to increase its domestic supply of the stuff to help textile companies battling high cotton prices. But its decision to halt exports did little for its reputation in international markets. 
A jury in Texas found Allen Stanford guilty of operating a $7 billion Ponzi scheme, one of the biggest frauds in history. Mr Stanford, a former banker who based part of his business in Antigua and used his riches to sponsor his own cricket tournament in the West Indies, was arrested in 2009. He will be sentenced later this year and faces decades in prison.

MARIANO RAJOY is an unlikely revolutionary. Spain's new centre-right prime minister has always talked like a typical European austerity hawk. On March 2nd, however, he rebelled. 
Mr Rajoy told Brussels and the rest of the world to forget the budget-deficit target that Spain had agreed to hit this year. Rather than 4.4% of GDP it would aim for a significantly looser 5.8%. The EU could like it or lump it. (Mr Rajoy promised that the 2013 target of 3.0% would still be met.) 
A few weeks ago such an act of defiance might have sparked market turmoil and severe reprimands from Brussels. It could still push the euro zone back to the brink, and the European Commission has threatened reprisals. But for the moment Mr Rajoy has got away with it. Spain's ten-year bond yield remains lower than it was for most of the past year (although it has now overtaken Italy's again). Despite muttering in Brussels and elsewhere, there has been no arm-twisting from the Germans. 
More importantly, Mr Rajoy is sailing in a calmer sea than his Socialist predecessor, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, or other prime ministers ousted last year by external pressure, like Italy's Silvio Berlusconi. The euro zone has been flooded with cheap three-year money from the European Central Bank. It has doled out EUR 1 trillion ($1.3 trillion) to banks in two months. Some has gone into Spanish sovereign debt, helping keep yields down. Indeed, there were worries that this liquidity splurge could encourage profligate governments to relax. Mr Rajoy's decision seems to be evidence of this. In fact, the easing of bond-market pressure gives him space to look beyond the short term and tackle Spain's chronic problems of low growth and soaring unemployment. 
To excuse its slippage the government points to Spain's shoddy fiscal performance last year (mostly under Socialist rule). The budget deficit for 2011 was 8.5% of GDP, some way over the EU-agreed target of 6% (see chart). Cutting that to 4.4% this year, amid a recession, would require a ferocious EUR 45 billion adjustment. ""It just wasn't realistic,"" says Jesus Fernandez-Villaverde of the Penn Institute for Economic Research. The Spanish economy could shrink by 1.7% this year, squeezing tax revenues and forcing up benefit costs as unemployment hits 24%. 
Some in Brussels and Berlin suspect the government has exaggerated last year's figures to make its job this year look more difficult. But even the reduced EUR 29 billion adjustment the government will have to make to meet its own target looks tough. Details of how it will be done remain scant: Mr Rajoy is waiting until after regional elections in Andalusia and Asturias later this month to announce a budget. 
Just as Mr Rajoy is set targets, he also sets them. Spain's regional governments are supposed to cut their budget deficits to 1.5% of GDP this year. But their track record is awful. Last year they failed, dismally, to meet a 1.3% limit. Mr Rajoy's People's Party (PP) rules 11 of Spain's 17 regions and may win the two that are up for grabs this month. His word should carry weight. But the regions' past behaviour makes their promises to obey hard to believe. 
Catalonia, run by a Catalan nationalist party, has set a worrying precedent. Last year, in a move that resembles Mr Rajoy's announcement in Brussels, it rebelled against Madrid's targets, declaring that it would aim at a deficit of 2.6% before hitting 1.3% this year. But it turns out that its deficit was 3.7% in 2011. 
Mr Rajoy sees himself as a pragmatist rather than a rebel. But Spain's 18% sales tax is low by EU standards. How soon before others start shouting that this is unfair? And if he misses his own deficit target, his reputation will be in tatters.","It 's Mariano Rajoy's country , and Mariano Rajoy 'll spend if Mariano Rajoy wants to

VISIT the euro zone and you will be invigorated by gusts of reform. The ""Save Italy"" plan has done enough for Mario Monti, the prime minister, to declare, however prematurely, that the euro crisis is nearly over. In Spain Mariano Rajoy's government has tackled the job market and is about to unveil a tight budget. For all their troubles, Greeks know that the free-spending and tax-dodging are over. But one country has yet to face up to its changed circumstances. 
France is entering the final three weeks of its presidential campaign. The ranking of the first round, on April 22nd, remains highly uncertain, but the polls back Francois Hollande, the Socialist challenger, to win a second-round victory. Indeed, in elections since the euro crisis broke, almost all governments in the euro zone have been tossed out by voters. But Nicolas Sarkozy, the Gaullist president, has been clawing back ground. The recent terrorist atrocity in Toulouse has put new emphasis on security and Islamism, issues that tend to favour the right--or, in the shape of Marine Le Pen, the far right. 
Yet what is most striking about the French election is how little anybody is saying about the country's dire economic straits. The candidates dish out at least as many promises to spend more as to spend less. Nobody has a serious agenda for reducing France's eye-watering taxes. Mr Sarkozy, who in 2007 promised reform with talk of a rupture, now offers voters protectionism, attacks on French tax exiles, threats to quit Europe's passport-free Schengen zone and (at least before Toulouse) talk of the evils of immigration and halal meat. Mr Hollande promises to expand the state, creating 60,000 teaching posts, partially roll back Mr Sarkozy's rise in the pension age from 60 to 62, and squeeze the rich (whom he once cheerfully said he did not like), with a 75% top income-tax rate. 
A plethora of problems 
France's defenders point out that the country is hardly one of the euro zone's Mediterranean basket cases. Unlike those economies, it should avoid recession this year. Although one ratings agency has stripped France of its AAA status, its borrowing costs remain far below Italy's and Spain's (though the spread above Germany's has risen). France has enviable economic strengths: an educated and productive workforce, more big firms in the global Fortune 500 than any other European country, and strength in services and high-end manufacturing. 
However, the fundamentals are much grimmer. France has not balanced its books since 1974. Public debt stands at 90% of GDP and rising. Public spending, at 56% of GDP, gobbles up a bigger chunk of output than in any other euro-zone country--more even than in Sweden. The banks are undercapitalised. Unemployment is higher than at any time since the late 1990s and has not fallen below 7% in nearly 30 years, creating chronic joblessness in the crime-ridden banlieues that ring France's big cities. Exports are stagnating while they roar ahead in Germany. France now has the euro zone's largest current-account deficit in nominal terms. Perhaps France could live on credit before the financial crisis, when borrowing was easy. Not any more. Indeed, a sluggish and unreformed France might even find itself at the centre of the next euro crisis. 
It is not unusual for politicians to avoid some ugly truths during elections; but it is unusual, in recent times in Europe, to ignore them as completely as French politicians are doing. In Britain, Ireland, Portugal and Spain voters have plumped for parties that promised painful realism. Part of the problem is that French voters are notorious for their belief in the state's benevolence and the market's heartless cruelty. Almost uniquely among developed countries, French voters tend to see globalisation as a blind threat rather than a source of prosperity. With the far left and the far right preaching protectionism, any candidate will feel he must shore up his base. 
Many business leaders cling to the hope that a certain worldly realism will emerge. The debate will tack back to the centre when Mr Sarkozy and Mr Hollande square off in the second round; and once elected, the new president will ditch his extravagant promises and pursue a sensible agenda of reform, like other European governments. But is that really possible? It would be hard for Mr Sarkozy suddenly to propose deep public-spending cuts, given all the things he has said. It would be harder still for Mr Hollande to drop his 75% tax rate. 
1981 and all that 
Besides, there is a more worrying possibility than insincerity. The candidates may actually mean what they say. And with Mr Hollande, who after all is still the most likely victor, that could have dramatic consequences. 
The last time an untried Socialist candidate became president was in 1981. As a protege of Francois Mitterrand, Mr Hollande will remember how things turned out for his mentor. Having nationalised swathes of industry and subjected the country to two devaluations and months of punishment by the markets, Mitterrand was forced into reverse. 
Mr Hollande's defenders say he is a pragmatist with a more moderate programme than Mitterrand's. His pension-age rollback applies only to a small set of workers; his 75% tax rate affects a tiny minority. Yet such policies indicate hostility to entrepreneurship and wealth creation and reflect the French Socialist Party's failure to recognise that the world has changed since 1981, when capital controls were in place, the European single market was incomplete, young workers were less mobile and there was no single currency. Nor were France's European rivals pursuing big reforms with today's vigour. 
If Mr Hollande wins in May (and his party wins again at legislative elections in June), he may find he has weeks, not years, before investors start to flee France's bond market. The numbers of well-off and young French people who hop across to Britain (and its 45% top income tax) could quickly increase. 
Even if Mr Sarkozy is re-elected, the risks will not disappear. He may not propose anything as daft as a 75% tax, but neither is he offering the radical reforms or the structural downsizing of spending that France needs. France's picnickers are about to be swamped by harsh reality, no matter who is president.","By ignoring their country's economic problems, France's politicians are making it far harder to tackle them

AFTER 100 days in office, the honeymoon is over for Mariano Rajoy. Spain's prime minister has lost an important regional election. Bond yields are creeping up again. On March 29th disgruntled Spanish workers were due to hold a general strike to protest against the government's reforms and austerity. Spain, the euro zone's fourth-biggest economy, is once more becoming its biggest headache. 
On March 25th Mr Rajoy's centre-right People's Party (PP) confounded the opinion polls by failing to wrest control of Andalusia, Spain's biggest region, from the Socialists. The result is bruising to the PP not only because of the loss of a big prize. It also suggests that angry and anxious voters are losing faith in a government that took office less than four months ago. At November's general election 46% of Andalusians voted PP. At the regional election that fell to 41%, allowing the Socialists to keep control (albeit only with help from the communist-led United Left, which performed strongly). In a separate election in the small northern region of Asturias, the PP was placed a poor third. Euphoric leftists have already hailed the start of a backlash against Mr Rajoy. 
They will have plenty more to get worked up about. A day after the general strike Mr Rajoy will publish what is likely to be one of the harshest budgets seen in Europe since the eruption of the euro crisis. It will be ""very, very austere,"" he pledged. (So austere, in fact, that he delayed it until after the Andalusia election, hoping in vain to win a region held by the Socialists for three decades.) 
Mr Rajoy has little choice but to get nasty. The European Union wants him to find EUR 20 billion ($27 billion) in new savings this year. Yet if Spain is to meet its deficit target, the true figure could be even worse. As the country enters a downward spiral of spending cuts, recession, unemployment and falling tax revenues, some economists say fully EUR 55 billion will have to be found. That is EUR 1,166 per Spaniard. 
If Mr Rajoy follows that projection, Spain's governments, central and regional, will have to find savings worth EUR 40 billion this year, on top of EUR 15 billion already announced in December. His decision to delay his budget until after the Andalusian vote means this must be accomplished in eight months. The economy is expected to shrink by 1.7% this year, and unemployment is 23% of the workforce--and still climbing. Spanish economists talk of an ""epic"" struggle or, simply, of ""mission impossible"". Savage cuts lie ahead. Mr Rajoy says ministries, for example, must reduce spending by an average of nearly 15%. 
Mr Rajoy vows to press on, aware that Spain's credibility is at skate. But some fellow leaders are losing faith in him. Olli Rehn, the EU's economics commissioner, and Mario Monti, Italy's prime minister, have publicly voiced concern. At the core of their worries is Spain's budget deficit. In early March Mr Rajoy unilaterally announced that the target for 2012 would be 5.8% of GDP, looser by some way than the figure of 4.4% previously agreed on with the EU. At a meeting of euro-zone finance ministers on March 12th the group's president, Jean-Claude Juncker, was photographed pretending to throttle Spain's Luis de Guindos. It may have been a joke, but the underlying message was of irritation. At that meeting the Spanish government compromised on a target of 5.3%. 
That was less severe than the old figure of 4.4%, but the government is still supposed to bring the deficit down to 3% by the end of 2013, a two-year adjustment harsher than in any other euro-zone country (see chart). Moreover, Mr Rajoy had previously insisted that his 5.8% target was ""realistic"". Does that imply the new one is not? ""Getting there in eight months seems an impossibility,"" write Luis Garicano and Jesus Fernandez-Villaverde, two academics, in a blog post. Mr Rajoy's problem is not so much the target as the starting-point. Last year Spain overshot its 6% deficit target by 2.5 percentage points, thanks largely to free-spending regional governments. 
The worry now is that Mr Juncker and friends are throttling not just Mr de Guindos but also Spain's attempts at recovery. Angel Laborda of FUNCAS, a think-tank, believes this year's austerity will take at least 2% of growth out of the economy. 
There are brighter spots for Mr Rajoy. The PP still runs 11 of Spain's 17 regions and has a strong majority in parliament. That should give Spain up to four more years of stable government. And with the Andalusia and Asturias votes out of the way Mr Rajoy can dispense with short-term electoral calculation. 
On the economic front the first-quarter contraction should be softer than previously predicted, says Mr Laborda. Exports in January were 3.9% higher than a year earlier. A weaker-than-expected recession in the rest of Europe should help maintain the export surge. The public debt, although growing, is small by euro-zone standards. 
Mr Rajoy has already proved himself to be an energetic prime minister. Reforms, combined with the Spanish share of EUR 1 trillion of cheap cash loaned to European banks by the European Central Bank, are helping drive consolidation of the troubled banking industry. This week a merger of CaixaBank and Banca Civica created Spain's biggest high-street bank. The new labour reform will, the government hopes, persuade troubled companies to reduce wages rather than sack workers, braking the growth in unemployment and benefit payments. 
But however you cut it, Spaniards face a terrible year. That is another reason for Mr Rajoy to push his programme forward as fast as he can.","Once again , Spain is on the front - line of the euro crisis

On March 29th disgruntled Spanish workers were due to hold a general strike to protest against the government 's reforms and austerity . Spain , the euro zone 's fourth - biggest economy , is once more becoming its biggest headache . 
 On March 25th Mariano Rajoy's centre - right People 's Party ( PP ) confounded the opinion polls by failing to wrest control of Andalusia , Spain 's biggest region , from the Socialists . The result is bruising to the PP not only because of the loss of a big prize . It also suggests that angry and anxious voters are losing faith in a government that took office less than four months ago . At November 's general election 46 % of Andalusians voted PP . At the regional election that fell to 41 % , allowing the Socialists to keep control ( albeit only with help from the communist - led United Left , which performed strongly ) . In a separate election in the small northern region of Asturias , the PP was placed a poor third . Euphoric leftists have already hailed the start of a backlash against Mariano Rajoy . 
 They will have plenty more to get worked up about . A day after the general strike Mariano Rajoy will publish what is likely to be one of the harshest budgets seen in Europe since the eruption of the euro crisis . It will be "" very , very austere , "" Mariano Rajoy pledged . ( So austere , in fact , that Mariano Rajoy delayed it until after the Andalusia election , hoping in vain to win a region held by the Socialists for three decades . ) 
 Mariano Rajoy has little choice but to get nasty . The European Union wants Mariano Rajoy to find EUR 20 billion ( $ 27 billion ) in new savings this year . Yet if Spain is to meet its deficit target , the true figure could be even worse . As the country enters a downward spiral of spending cuts , recession , unemployment and falling tax revenues , some economists say fully EUR 55 billion will have to be found . That is EUR 1,166 per Spaniard . 
 If Mariano Rajoy follows that projection , Spain 's governments , central and regional , will have to find savings worth EUR 40 billion this year , on top of EUR 15 billion already announced in December . Mariano Rajoy's decision to delay Mariano Rajoy's budget until after the Andalusian vote means this must be accomplished in eight months . The economy is expected to shrink by 1.7 % this year , and unemployment is 23 % of the workforce -- and still climbing . Spanish economists talk of an "" epic "" struggle or , simply , of "" mission impossible "" . Savage cuts lie ahead . Mariano Rajoy says ministries , for example , must reduce spending by an average of nearly 15 % . 
 Mariano Rajoy vows to press on , aware that Spain 's credibility is at skate . But some fellow leaders are losing faith in Mariano Rajoy . Olli Rehn , the EU 's economics commissioner , and Mario Monti , Italy 's prime minister , have publicly voiced concern . At the core of their worries is Spain 's budget deficit . In early March Mariano Rajoy unilaterally announced that the target for 2012 would be 5.8 % of GDP , looser by some way than the figure of 4.4 % previously agreed on with the EU . At a meeting of euro - zone finance ministers on March 12th the group 's president , Jean - Claude Juncker , was photographed pretending to throttle Spain 's Luis de Guindos . It may have been a joke , but the underlying message was of irritation . At that meeting the Spanish government compromised on a target of 5.3 % . 
 That was less severe than the old figure of 4.4 % , but the government is still supposed to bring the deficit down to 3 % by the end of 2013 , a two - year adjustment harsher than in any other euro - zone country ( see chart ) . Moreover , Mariano Rajoy had previously insisted that Mariano Rajoy's 5.8 % target was "" realistic "" . Does that imply the new one is not ? "" Getting there in eight months seems an impossibility , "" write Luis Garicano and Jesus Fernandez - Villaverde , two academics , in a blog post . Mariano Rajoy's problem is not so much the target as the starting - point . Last year Spain overshot its 6 % deficit target by 2.5 percentage points , thanks largely to free - spending regional governments . 
 The worry now is that Mr Juncker and friends are throttling not just Mr de Guindos but also Spain 's attempts at recovery . Angel Laborda of FUNCAS , a think - tank , believes this year 's austerity will take at least 2 % of growth out of the economy . 
 There are brighter spots for Mariano Rajoy . The PP still runs 11 of Spain 's 17 regions and has a strong majority in parliament . That should give Spain up to four more years of stable government . And with the Andalusia and Asturias votes out of the way Mariano Rajoy can dispense with short - term electoral calculation . 
 On the economic front the first - quarter contraction should be softer than previously predicted , says Mr Laborda . Exports in January were 3.9 % higher than a year earlier . A weaker - than - expected recession in the rest of Europe should help maintain the export surge . The public debt , although growing , is small by euro - zone standards . 
 Mariano Rajoy has already proved Mariano Rajoy to be an energetic prime minister . Reforms , combined with the Spanish share of EUR 1 trillion of cheap cash loaned to European banks by the European Central Bank , are helping drive consolidation of the troubled banking industry . This week a merger of CaixaBank and Banca Civica created Spain 's biggest high - street bank . The new labour reform will , the government hopes , persuade troubled companies to reduce wages rather than sack workers , braking the growth in unemployment and benefit payments . 
 But however you cut it , Spaniards face a terrible year . That is another reason for Mariano Rajoy to push Mariano Rajoy's programme forward as fast as Mariano Rajoy can .",230,Spain,A30-57,IN TERM,True,Mariano Rajoy,26,True

THEY are licking their wounds in Madrid. With Spain now at the centre of the euro crisis, Nicolas Sarkozy holds it up as an example French voters must avoid. A leading think-tanker is widely quoted saying that Spain is good for flamenco, red wine and nothing else. Even Argentina has joined in, ignoring threats of reprisals to nationalise a Spanish-owned oil company, YPF. As Spain's ten-year bond yields crept over 6% this week, talk of a bail-out for the euro zone's fourth economy is getting louder. 
The deluge of criticism has caught Mariano Rajoy's government by surprise. Some officials admit to a slip-up over this year's budget target, which Mr Rajoy wanted to be 5.8% of GDP whereas Brussels insisted on 5.3%. But the government does not believe this justifies all the Spain-bashing. Reforms to banks, the labour market and the budget have all been rushed through in Mr Rajoy's first four months in power. An austerity budget aims at a huge EUR 27 billion cut in the deficit. Regional governments have been told to find EUR 16 billion more: education cuts are to be announced this weekend, health cuts soon afterwards. And the government is threatening to take direct control of some regions' finances. 
""Some people do not seem to realise there has been a change of government,"" complains one official, blaming Spain's tarnished reputation on Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, whose Socialist government was ousted last November. ""Our political stability is now the envy of Europe."" Other countries, he implies, would love to have four years with an absolute parliamentary majority ahead of them. 
Spanish banks have drawn heavily on the European Central Bank's cheap credit this year. That has helped Spain to raise almost half this year's EUR 86 billion of financing, though the cost has risen. But is this enough? There is growing talk of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) being used to rescue banks loaded with toxic real-estate assets. Cinzia Alcidi and Daniel Gros of the Centre for European Policy Studies see a massive EUR 380 billion property and construction overhang, equivalent to 35% of GDP. Many see a looming bail-out from the ECB, the EU and the IMF. ""Spain is likely to be pushed into a troika programme of some kind during 2012,"" conclude Ebrahim Rahbari and Guillaume Menuet of Citigroup in a recent report. 
Unemployment is 24% and climbing. The budget deficit barely shrank last year, falling from 9.3% to 8.5%, because of overspending regional governments. The target was 6%. And growth is an even bigger concern. This year's adjustment may cut GDP by more than 2%. The IMF has improved its 2012 growth forecasts for most economies, but not for Spain, where GDP is expected to shrink by 1.8% (see chart). And there will be little growth next year. More deficit-cutting will be needed, and the EUR 2.5 billion being raised from a tax amnesty this year will have to be made up for in 2013. 
There are serious doubts, too, about the deficit's future path. Citigroup predicts a 6.6% deficit next year, well above the target. The Bank of Spain's governor, Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez, has warned that taxes will have to go up if revenues do not match the forecasts by Cristobal Montoro, the budget minister. 
The budget sees social-security contributions rising and unemployment benefits falling, despite growing unemployment. Mr Montoro left sales tax untouched, let pensions rise and kept civil-service pay static to limit damage to consumer spending. But he may still be forced into a sales-tax increase. And doubts abound about regional governments. Juan Rubio-Ramirez of Duke University doubts if Mr Rajoy has the political will to take on the regions when their budgets are approved in May. Senior officials insist the first intervention by Madrid will come then. That would send a signal that Mr Rajoy means business.

THE sea of troubles just keeps on coming. GDP shrank in the first quarter of 2012, pushing Spain formally into recession for the second time in two years. Another 366,000 people have lost their jobs, bringing the total unemployed to 5.6m, the highest on record. Standard & Poor's, a credit-rating agency, has downgraded Spain and 11 of its banks. The Madrid stock exchange is back down to 2003 levels as investors pull out. And Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo, the foreign minister, has said that the European Union risks becoming like the Titanic, with most classes of passengers drowning. 
To meet its deficit targets, Spain has already raised income and company taxes. Lower public spending is pushing down consumption. Tax rises worth at least EUR 8 billion ($10.5 billion) are planned next year, hitting consumers further. The recession could then stretch into 2013, with unemployment, already a staggering 24%, getting worse still. Some 3m jobs have gone in four years. The only bright spot is a revival of exports. 
Nobody could accuse Mariano Rajoy, who has been the centre-right prime minister since only late December, of inaction. He pledges at least one new reform at every Friday cabinet meeting. But even this frenetic activity may not be enough. Banks, property and the regional governments are the three biggest worries. Banks face more damage from the risky lending that primed a burst property bubble. A ""bad bank"" for the most toxic property assets may still be needed. 
Some government messages have been incoherent. There is confusion about whether a sales-tax rise is in prospect. As for the regions, officials waver between severity (threatening to grab financial control from the worst offenders) and claims that they can meet their deficit targets without coercion. Given their past performance, many doubt this. Can Castile La Mancha really cut its deficit from 7.3% to 1.5% of regional GDP in a single year? If Catalonia or Andalusia, which accounted for much of last year's regional overspending, are not on target, will there be the time (and political will) to force them into line? 
Two possible paths now appear in analysts' predictions. Some, including the IMF, think that Spain will miss its tight deficit targets this year and next, but they also expect only modest growth and job creation in 2013. The public debt might then rise to 90% of GDP in five years' time. (Still, Spain went into the euro crisis with low debt, so this would be little worse than in, say, France.) Others, like the FUNCAS think-tank, see Mr Rajoy applying Germanic discipline to hit his deficit targets. That would mean less debt, but at a price: two years of negative growth, with unemployment rising above 26% in 2013. 
The first signs of Euroscepticism are emerging, especially on the left. If Germany refuses to back Eurobonds it is time to start debating a euro departure, says a popular young blogger, Ignacio Escolar. Criticising European integration should no longer be seen as resisting progress, says Ignacio Sanchez-Cuenca of the Juan March Institute, a non-profit social-research body. 
Such attitudes, unusual in a country of Euro-enthusiasts, may matter. Mr Rajoy's government has an absolute majority and almost four years left, but if unemployment is not significantly dented by 2015 its prospects are poor. Many on the Spanish left have been cheering the prospect of a victory for Francois Hollande, the French Socialist presidential candidate--not because they think that will open up space for Spain to shirk its fiscal targets, but to help balance the austerity being imposed on Europe by Germany with measures to promote growth.

THE huge crowd gathered in Place de la Bastille had to wait until late into the night before it actually glimpsed in the flesh the man it had come to celebrate. Francois Hollande gave his first victory speech in Tulle, his sleepy constituency in deeply rural France, in the early evening of May 6th, soon after it was announced that he had beaten Nicolas Sarkozy by 51.6% to 48.4%. It was the first defeat of an incumbent French president since Francois Mitterrand, the only previous Socialist president of France's Fifth Republic, beat Valery Giscard d'Estaing in 1981. 
Only after this low-key provincial start did Mr Hollande hop onto a specially chartered jet and head for the capital, where his supporters were being entertained by an assortment of French rock stars. When, a little after midnight, Mr Hollande at last appeared on the stage at the Bastille a huge cheer went up. Hoarse of voice, he urged the crowds to ""remember all your lives"" this night. It heralded for all of Europe, he cried, that ""change is coming"" and that there would be ""an end to austerity"". 
It is a remarkable achievement for a politician who, before Dominique Strauss-Kahn was ruled out by a sex scandal a year ago, was not taken seriously as a presidential hopeful. Since then, the longtime party hack, who has never held ministerial office, has overcome both a divided party and a bland public image to secure the top job. Having promised ""change"", Mr Hollande will now step into office on the back of huge expectations. But quite what that change means, both in France and in Europe, is rather less clear. 
A red letter day 
Mr Hollande has promised to ""renegotiate"" Europe's fiscal compact, which Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor, regards as the centrepiece of euro-zone stability plans, and to block the treaty's ratification if he does not get his way. Germany should not, he told supporters on the campaign trail, ""decide for all of Europe"". Mr Hollande intends to press this demand at his first meeting with Mrs Merkel, which will take place immediately after his inauguration on May 15th. 
Yet, in reality, the French vote was not simply a rejection of austerity. Voters were fed up with job losses and the recession, certainly. But they were even more fed up with Mr Sarkozy. Mr Hollande promised them both a ""normal"" presidency, free of Mr Sarkozy, and a fairer society: he plans a 75% top tax rate, a boost to the minimum wage, higher taxation of companies and wealth, the creation of 60,000 new teaching jobs and a lowering of the retirement age, for some people, back down to 60, where it had been until Mr Sarkozy raised it in 2010. 
At the same time, however, Mr Hollande has promised to keep to the outgoing government's commitment to bring France's budget deficit down to 3% of GDP next year. He has not wavered over this--a first for a Socialist candidate. Although he says that he will postpone balancing the budget until 2017, a year later than Mr Sarkozy had planned, not once has he advocated a deficit-financed stimulus for the French economy. 
Where he has been--perhaps deliberately--vague is over how he will achieve this. France's public-accounts office, the Cour des Comptes, says that France will need to find an extra EUR 20 billion ($26 billion) in savings each year just to stick to deficit targets. That is before adding on the spending pledges Mr Hollande made on the campaign trail--which, at EUR 20 billion over five years, were not outrageous, but also not negligible. Balancing the books will be even harder if growth disappoints, as seems likely; Mr Hollande reckons on 1.7% growth next year, but the IMF expects just 0.5%. ""He cannot reach his numbers by tax increases alone,"" says Guillaume Menuet, an economist at Citigroup. ""He will have to do more to cut spending."" 
In other words, although this is not quite what Mr Hollande told the voters, it looks likely that he will have to implement a form of austerity. ""The anti-austerity vote was true for Greece but not for France,"" says Fleur Pellerin, a member of Mr Hollande's campaign staff who is now being tipped for a government job. ""He has said clearly that he will stick to the deficit [target], and everybody knows that they will all have to make an effort; but it will be done in a fair way."" 
To soften up the public, Mr Hollande plans to introduce some symbolic measures immediately by decree: a 30% pay cut for the president and all government members, and a 25% increase in a means-tested benefit paid at the start of the school year in September. Tough budget choices will be put off until a public-finances audit by the Cour des Comptes, rather conveniently due a few weeks after the parliamentary elections on June 10th and 17th. If it concludes that the hole in the budget is worse than expected, Mr Hollande will have a pretext for postponing spending pledged in the election, and perhaps making deeper cuts than his campaigning suggested. 
If Mr Hollande wins a working majority in the elections--as seems likely, not least because Mr Sarkozy's decision immediately to quit politics has left the right in disarray--he will have a remarkably powerful domestic position. The Socialists already have control of the Senate, all but one of the country's 22 regions, every big city and most communes. 
An important first step towards that victory is forming a relationship with the German chancellor, Mrs Merkel, that establishes him as a constructive force for change in Europe (see Charlemagne). The spiritual son of Jacques Delors, champion of European integration, Mr Hollande knows full well the need for a strong Franco-German friendship. This is why the front-runner for the job as interim prime minister, which Mr Hollande will announce on May 15th, is Jean-Marc Ayrault, the loyal 62-year-old head of the Socialist parliamentary group, who has good links in Germany. 
On the face of it, Mr Hollande stands little chance of securing change to the treaty itself. Mrs Merkel, who backed Mr Sarkozy's campaign, has said she will welcome Mr Hollande ""with open arms"". But she has been at pains to point out to France and everyone else that a renegotiation of the European Union's fiscal compact ""is not up for discussion"" any more than the terms of the Greek bail-out are. 
Her government has not wavered in its belief that ""sustainable"" growth can come only from fiscal prudence and structural reform. The quick fix of deficit spending just makes things worse. Germans think the financial markets vindicate this view. After Mariano Rajoy, Spain's prime minister, said in March that Spain would miss its fiscal target this year, yields on its bonds jumped. With its credit rating already downgraded, France risks similar punishment if Mr Hollande strays from austerity. 
Nothing in Mr Hollande's programme suggests that he intends the sort of liberalising changes--to loosen the labour market, say, or boost competition--that Mrs Merkel would define as ""structural reform"" (and that France sorely needs). Moreover, Germany would refuse some of Mr Hollande's longer-term ideas: to allow the European Central Bank to lend directly to states, or to create Eurobonds which the euro zone as a whole would stand behind. 
But Mr Hollande's more immediate requests may meet less resistance, as they are less far-reaching. His four ideas are: a greater role for the European Investment Bank (EIB); the issue of European ""project bonds"" to finance investment in infrastructure and energy; a financial-transactions tax; and the more efficient use of structural funds. To strengthen his hand with Germany, Mr Hollande's advisers say that he will promise quickly to pass a balanced-budget rule in France. ""Nothing will be possible unless we also restore German confidence in France,"" says one. 
Home and dry? 
Mrs Merkel's domestic concerns may help Mr Hollande make his case. On May 6th a state election in Schleswig-Holstein strengthened opposition parties whose pro-growth rhetoric echoes that of the new French president. Mr Ayrault's friends in Germany's opposition Social Democratic Party want growth-friendly add-ons as a condition of supporting the fiscal compact. That support is necessary because approving the compact will require a two-thirds majority in the Bundestag when it votes, probably next month. 
Mrs Merkel is open to a ""growth pact"" to complement the fiscal treaty that might contain such plans, with all countries contributing to increase the lending capacity of the EIB and project bonds backed by the European Union (as long as member states do not end up liable). She would support a Europe-wide financial-transactions tax. 
Mr Hollande's aides have suggested that he might consider a treaty ""complemented"" by such a growth compact to have been ""renegotiated"", as long as its contents are not merely cosmetic. This would seem to offer a compromise which would leave the two leaders happy. Both are sober and methodical, and thus a better match for each other than Mr Sarkozy was for Mrs Merkel. But there is a large Greek fly in the ointment. 
A ""renegotiation"" of the sort being contemplated does nothing to sort out the mess in Greece. Mrs Merkel is adamant that there is no option for Greece but to follow the strictures of the previously agreed bail-out package, or go under. Mr Hollande's position is still unclear. If he agrees with her, what price his position as a new European counterweight, let alone his credibility at home as a man opposed to doctrinaire austerity? But if he disagrees, a rift opens up at the heart of Europe.

Yet, in reality, the French vote was not simply a rejection of austerity. Voters were fed up with job losses and the recession, certainly. But they were even more fed up with Mr Sarkozy. Mr Hollande promised them both a ""normal"" presidency, free of Mr Sarkozy, and a fairer society: he plans a 75% top tax rate, a boost to the minimum wage, higher taxation of companies and wealth, the creation of 60,000 new teaching jobs and a lowering of the retirement age, for some people, back down to 60, where it had been until Mr Sarkozy raised it in 2010. 
At the same time, however, Mr Hollande has promised to keep to the outgoing government's commitment to bring France's budget deficit down to 3% of GDP next year. He has not wavered over this--a first for a Socialist candidate. Although he says that he will postpone balancing the budget until 2017, a year later than Mr Sarkozy had planned, not once has he advocated a deficit-financed stimulus for the French economy. 
Where he has been--perhaps deliberately--vague is over how he will achieve this. France's public-accounts office, the Cour des Comptes, says that France will need to find an extra EUR 20 billion ($26 billion) in savings each year just to stick to deficit targets. That is before adding on the spending pledges Mr Hollande made on the campaign trail--which, at EUR 20 billion over five years, were not outrageous, but also not negligible. Balancing the books will be even harder if growth disappoints, as seems likely; Mr Hollande reckons on 1.7% growth next year, but the IMF expects just 0.5%. ""He cannot reach his numbers by tax increases alone,"" says Guillaume Menuet, an economist at Citigroup. ""He will have to do more to cut spending."" 
In other words, although this is not quite what Mr Hollande told the voters, it looks likely that he will have to implement a form of austerity. ""The anti-austerity vote was true for Greece but not for France,"" says Fleur Pellerin, a member of Mr Hollande's campaign staff who is now being tipped for a government job. ""He has said clearly that he will stick to the deficit [target], and everybody knows that they will all have to make an effort; but it will be done in a fair way."" 
To soften up the public, Mr Hollande plans to introduce some symbolic measures immediately by decree: a 30% pay cut for the president and all government members, and a 25% increase in a means-tested benefit paid at the start of the school year in September. Tough budget choices will be put off until a public-finances audit by the Cour des Comptes, rather conveniently due a few weeks after the parliamentary elections on June 10th and 17th. If it concludes that the hole in the budget is worse than expected, Mr Hollande will have a pretext for postponing spending pledged in the election, and perhaps making deeper cuts than his campaigning suggested. 
If Mr Hollande wins a working majority in the elections--as seems likely, not least because Mr Sarkozy's decision immediately to quit politics has left the right in disarray--he will have a remarkably powerful domestic position. The Socialists already have control of the Senate, all but one of the country's 22 regions, every big city and most communes. 
An important first step towards that victory is forming a relationship with the German chancellor, Mrs Merkel, that establishes him as a constructive force for change in Europe (see Charlemagne). The spiritual son of Jacques Delors, champion of European integration, Mr Hollande knows full well the need for a strong Franco-German friendship. This is why the front-runner for the job as interim prime minister, which Mr Hollande will announce on May 15th, is Jean-Marc Ayrault, the loyal 62-year-old head of the Socialist parliamentary group, who has good links in Germany. 
On the face of it, Mr Hollande stands little chance of securing change to the treaty itself. Mrs Merkel, who backed Mr Sarkozy's campaign, has said she will welcome Mr Hollande ""with open arms"". But she has been at pains to point out to France and everyone else that a renegotiation of the European Union's fiscal compact ""is not up for discussion"" any more than the terms of the Greek bail-out are. 
Her government has not wavered in its belief that ""sustainable"" growth can come only from fiscal prudence and structural reform. The quick fix of deficit spending just makes things worse. Germans think the financial markets vindicate this view. After Mariano Rajoy, Spain's prime minister, said in March that Spain would miss its fiscal target this year, yields on its bonds jumped. With its credit rating already downgraded, France risks similar punishment if Mr Hollande strays from austerity. 
Nothing in Mr Hollande's programme suggests that he intends the sort of liberalising changes--to loosen the labour market, say, or boost competition--that Mrs Merkel would define as ""structural reform"" (and that France sorely needs). Moreover, Germany would refuse some of Mr Hollande's longer-term ideas: to allow the European Central Bank to lend directly to states, or to create Eurobonds which the euro zone as a whole would stand behind. 
But Mr Hollande's more immediate requests may meet less resistance, as they are less far-reaching. His four ideas are: a greater role for the European Investment Bank (EIB); the issue of European ""project bonds"" to finance investment in infrastructure and energy; a financial-transactions tax; and the more efficient use of structural funds. To strengthen his hand with Germany, Mr Hollande's advisers say that he will promise quickly to pass a balanced-budget rule in France. ""Nothing will be possible unless we also restore German confidence in France,"" says one. 
Home and dry? 
Mrs Merkel's domestic concerns may help Mr Hollande make his case. On May 6th a state election in Schleswig-Holstein strengthened opposition parties whose pro-growth rhetoric echoes that of the new French president. Mr Ayrault's friends in Germany's opposition Social Democratic Party want growth-friendly add-ons as a condition of supporting the fiscal compact. That support is necessary because approving the compact will require a two-thirds majority in the Bundestag when it votes, probably next month. 
Mrs Merkel is open to a ""growth pact"" to complement the fiscal treaty that might contain such plans, with all countries contributing to increase the lending capacity of the EIB and project bonds backed by the European Union (as long as member states do not end up liable). She would support a Europe-wide financial-transactions tax. 
Mr Hollande's aides have suggested that he might consider a treaty ""complemented"" by such a growth compact to have been ""renegotiated"", as long as its contents are not merely cosmetic. This would seem to offer a compromise which would leave the two leaders happy. Both are sober and methodical, and thus a better match for each other than Mr Sarkozy was for Mrs Merkel. But there is a large Greek fly in the ointment. 
A ""renegotiation"" of the sort being contemplated does nothing to sort out the mess in Greece. Mrs Merkel is adamant that there is no option for Greece but to follow the strictures of the previously agreed bail-out package, or go under. Mr Hollande's position is still unclear. If he agrees with her, what price his position as a new European counterweight, let alone his credibility at home as a man opposed to doctrinaire austerity? But if he disagrees, a rift opens up at the heart of Europe.

HAVE Spain's policymakers at last woken up? The news that Rodrigo Rato was leaving Bankia came at the start of Madrid's siesta on May 7th. The abrupt departure of one of Spain's most prominent bankers came hours after Mariano Rajoy, the prime minister, admitted that he might need to use public funds to shore up the banking system. Two days later, the government nationalised Bankia's parent. 
Bankia, a merger of seven savings banks and the largest property lender in Spain, is not Mr Rajoy's only banking problem, but it is a good place to start. In a report last month the IMF singled the lender out, urging it to strengthen its balance-sheet as well as to ""improve management and governance practices"". Its auditor did not sign the 2011 accounts of Bankia and its parent company, Banco Financiero y de Ahorros (BFA). 
The bail-out heaps more pain on shareholders: the bank made its debut on Madrid's stockmarket only last July and its shares have since lost 45% of their value. It is also an embarrassment for regulators. Most of the bad land assets of the seven original savings banks reside in BFA, a 45.5% shareholder in Bankia that had already received EUR 4.5 billion in preference shares from the state. The idea was to detach Bankia's banking business from the contaminated parent, but the fall in Bankia's value made the whole structure vulnerable. The preference shares will convert to equity, nationalising BFA. The government is expected to pump EUR 10 billion ($13 billion) into Bankia itself--more than double its market value. The capital may come in the form of contingent convertibles, bonds that convert into shares in times of stress. Straight equity would be better. 
Mr Rato, a former finance minister and an ex-head of the International Monetary Fund, left the sinking ship after talks with Luis de Guindos, the current finance minister. The hot seat will be filled by Jose Ignacio Goirigolzarri, a respected former chief executive of BBVA, one of Spain's two big banks. Pressure from BBVA and Banco Santander may have played a part in getting the government to face reality. Doubts about Spain's financial system and the government itself have infected both lenders, despite robust capital buffers and big businesses abroad. 
Bankia, however, is only part of the problem. Lender forbearance is widespread, disguising the extent of bad loans. Despite the mother of all housing busts, few banks have posted losses. Investors worry that rules announced earlier this year on provisions for dud property loans and foreclosures will not be enough. Shares in Spanish banks have slumped (see chart). 
So the government is set to demand that banks put aside around EUR 35 billion in more funds as part of a package of reforms to be announced on May 11th. It is also expected to set up asset-management companies to look after dud loans. A third party may be brought in to value these assets independently before they are transferred. Such measures will leave the weakest banks in need of more capital. 
One source is the industry-backed Deposit Guarantee Fund (FGD), which is estimated to have provided EUR 29.3 billion in asset-protection schemes and capital for nationalised lenders. The FGD is funded by contributions from the banks, but the pot is almost empty. Banks could potentially lend the FGD money upfront, but it all feels very circular. 
Bondholders are unlikely to get whacked so more money may have to come from the state. Barclays estimates that lenders may need another EUR 46 billion in public capital, on top of the EUR 16 billion already injected by the state. It largely depends on how far Mr Rajoy's government is willing to go. The risk, given the drip-feed of rescue plans in the past, is that Spain falls well short of what is needed.","Sorting out Bankia is just a start

Another stockmarket rally peters out 
THE pattern is eerily familiar. Investors start the year in a blaze of optimism, hoping that the euro zone has been stabilised and that the American economy is growing strongly. By the late spring, the latest example of euro-zone ""make and mend"" policies shows signs of fraying and the American recovery is proving less robust than hoped. The same description of events applies to both 2011 and 2012, even if last year's market correction was also triggered by special factors--the terrible damage resulting from the Japanese earthquake and tsunami, along with the Libyan civil war. 
This year's rally really began in late November, and got much of its impetus from the EUR 1 trillion ($1.3 trillion) in three-year loans made by the European Central Bank to the region's banking system. But the effect of the ECB's liquidity package has quickly worn off. The MSCI World stockmarket index had gained 12.6% at one stage this year but has seen that advance cut to 2.7%. In Europe, the Euro Stoxx 50 has fallen by 6% in dollar terms; Spanish shares are off by 21%. 
Investors have retreated to the safety of selected government bonds. Since the start of 2012, the yields on British and German ten-year government bonds have fallen to levels that are pretty much unprecedented; French yields are a third of a point lower. American yields have fallen, too, but not by as much. The yields on ten-year Bunds are now almost 40 basis points lower than those on Treasuries. 
In the periphery the government of Mario Monti in Italy has been more successful in calming the markets than that of Mariano Rajoy in Spain. At the start of the year Italian ten-year yields were almost 150 basis points higher than those of Spain; now they are around 45 basis points lower (see chart). But both are again moving in the wrong direction. 
In many ways, the debt crisis confronts euro-zone leaders with a dilemma similar to that facing governments when the banking sector crumbled in 2007 and 2008. Back then, policymakers were forced to distinguish between those banks that were illiquid and just needed emergency loans, and those that were insolvent and needed injections of capital. For a time the authorities appeared to be clueless about this distinction, causing investor alarm. But the American authorities in particular managed to draw a line under their financial crisis by injecting new capital into the (sometimes unwilling) banks and by showing that those banks could pass fairly rigorous stress tests in May 2009. A vigorous equity rally duly occurred. 
In contrast, Europe's leaders have spent much of the past two years treating Greece as a liquidity problem when it is really insolvent. Some of the country's debts have been forgiven, but not enough. Of course, Europe's problems are more deep-seated than America's, thanks to the principal flaw in the euro's design: that it is a single currency operating in a continent without fiscal union. Politically, it is very hard to reach quick decisions when 17 governments are involved. 
But even those countries that are not in the zone have failed to generate the kind of rapid economic growth that has marked previous recoveries. Corporate profits have held up pretty well in the circumstances, which is one reason why the markets are still well ahead of their 2009 levels. But the corollary of those high profits has been depressed real wages, which have weighed on consumer demand. And companies have so far tended to sit on their cash (see Free Exchange), rather than invest in new plant and equipment or hire new workers. 
All this has left the markets desperately waiting for a new ""hit"" from their central banks, in the form of quantitative easing or additional liquidity support. Each central-bank statement is closely analysed for signs of change, rather as Kremlinologists used to study Politburo photographs for hints of leadership reshuffles. 
Like the adrenalin injected into an overdosing Uma Thurman's heart in ""Pulp Fiction"", these central-bank boosts usually provoke an immediate market reaction. But a repeated regime of heroin and adrenalin injections hardly makes for a healthy lifestyle. While it lasts central-bank action means that equity markets are unlikely to crash, since the yields on cash and bonds are so low. At a conference this week organised by Morningstar, a research firm, one fund manager pointed out that Royal Dutch Shell shares yield 4.8%, whereas its bonds pay just 1.5%. But the prospect of markets standing on their own two feet--of surviving without the crutch of massive monetary easing--looks as far away as ever.","Economist.com/blogs/buttonwood

HOW quickly Francois Hollande is changing the terms of European politics. When he spoke about the need for more growth, others quickly echoed him. And now that the new French president is talking about the need for Eurobonds, even the IMF and the OECD have joined the chorus of those demanding joint euro-zone debt issuance. At his first European Union summit, over an informal dinner in Brussels on May 23rd, Mr Hollande found more allies. Predictably, though, he ran into firm opposition from Germany. 
That did not seem to bother him. Finding agreement can wait for the next summit, in late June, if not later. For now Mr Hollande was demonstrating that he was different from his predecessor, who stood on the same podium in Brussels in March. Before every summit Nicolas Sarkozy would seek a common position with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. By contrast Mr Hollande chose to meet the Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, before the pair took the train (not the presidential jet) to Brussels. 
Mr Hollande was all too happy to highlight his differences with the chancellor. ""For Mrs Merkel Eurobonds are the end point of a process of integration. For me they are the starting point,"" he declared. This is a striking change of tone from the election campaign, when Mr Hollande, though critical of Mrs Merkel's brand of austerity, seemed keen to find an accommodation. He flew to Berlin within hours of his inauguration. Most of his calls for growth-inducing European investment seemed modest, based on existing proposals by the European Commission. When he spoke of ""Eurobonds"", he had once suggested that he merely meant ""project bonds"", a scheme to sweeten debt issued by private firms to finance EU-backed infrastructure projects. 
That pretence is over. Mr Hollande now wants countries to pool new public debt. Is it acceptable, he asks, that Spain must borrow at 6% while Germany can raise money almost for free? This week Germany sold two-year bonds with a 0% coupon. 
For Germans, Eurobonds are the wrong prescription at the wrong time. Mrs Merkel says they are illegal under EU treaties and do not contribute to growth. Financial Times Deutschland, a German daily, calls the dispute ""The German-French Ice Age."" 
Yet it is too soon to conclude that Franco-German relations have gone into the deep freeze. Any new French president is bound to cause some realignment in Europe. Perhaps Mr Hollande, boosted by a successful trip to America, is setting out a tough opening position ahead of the June summit. Perhaps he is playing up his differences with Germany for the sake of domestic politics, as he seeks to secure a clear majority for his Socialist Party in elections to the National Assembly next month. 
There is certainly a need to reappraise policy as the euro zone's debt crisis enters a perilous new phase. Investors are fleeing both the banks and the sovereign bonds of Mediterranean countries. Without a restoration of confidence in the ability of the euro zone to survive, it is hard to see how growth can return. Spain, sucked into a worsening recession, is pleading for the European Central Bank (ECB) to inject more liquidity into its banks and buy its government bonds. 
More ominously, the exhausted Greeks may soon vote themselves out of the euro zone. Although the politicians said they wanted Greece to stay in, the Bundesbank seemed ready to boot it out. It declared that the turmoil caused by a Greek exit would be ""considerable, but manageable given prudent crisis management."" A bigger danger, it suggested, is that agreeing to a substantial renegotiation of Greece's bail-out conditions ""would damage confidence in all euro-area agreements and treaties"". 
Others are not so sanguine. Few have any real confidence in the firewalls erected so far. Thus the call for the ECB to do more with its vast arsenal. Two sets of longer-term reforms make sense. 
One is to create a form of ""banking union"", with a Europe-wide system of deposit guarantees, recapitalisation and regulation. This would help break the link between weak banks and weak sovereigns. The other is to move towards greater ""fiscal union"", including the creation of Eurobonds. This would reduce borrowing costs for troubled countries and create a safe asset for banks to hold. 
The euro's future 
So Mr Hollande is right to reopen the debate on the euro's future. He is also right in thinking that an exclusive Franco-German duopoly cannot pretend to run the euro zone. But there are limits to how far he should push the confrontation with Mrs Merkel. The chancellor is hardly without friends in Europe. She is backed by, among others, the remaining AAA-rated countries, such as Finland and the Netherlands. And everybody knows that the crisis has, for the moment, shifted financial power to creditor states. 
A prolonged Franco-German dispute will lead to a debilitating stalemate that will help nobody, least of all France. The harsh truth is that France is more vulnerable than Germany. It is forecast to miss its budget-deficit target next year, and French banks are dangerously exposed to troubled Mediterranean countries. 
So Mr Hollande will need to practise the art of persuasion. Above all Germany must be reassured that greater risk-sharing will not amount to handing its credit card to profligate governments. Mr Hollande might tell Mrs Merkel that creating a more solid euro zone, far from creating moral hazard, will make it easier to threaten Greece or others with expulsion. And setting out clear conditions for the introduction of Eurobonds could create incentives for countries to keep to the path of reform. Mr Hollande wants all issues to be put on the table. He, too, should be asked what France is offering by way of domestic reforms and concessions to Germany's wish for deeper political union.","Mr Hollande and Mrs Merkel are clashing over Eurobonds, and more 
HOW quickly Francois Hollande is changing the terms of European politics. When he spoke about the need for more growth, others quickly echoed him. And now that the new French president is talking about the need for Eurobonds, even the IMF and the OECD have joined the chorus of those demanding joint euro-zone debt issuance. At his first European Union summit, over an informal dinner in Brussels on May 23rd, Mr Hollande found more allies. Predictably, though, he ran into firm opposition from Germany. 
That did not seem to bother him. Finding agreement can wait for the next summit, in late June, if not later. For now Mr Hollande was demonstrating that he was different from his predecessor, who stood on the same podium in Brussels in March. Before every summit Nicolas Sarkozy would seek a common position with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. By contrast Mr Hollande chose to meet the Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, before the pair took the train (not the presidential jet) to Brussels. 
Mr Hollande was all too happy to highlight his differences with the chancellor. ""For Mrs Merkel Eurobonds are the end point of a process of integration. For me they are the starting point,"" he declared. This is a striking change of tone from the election campaign, when Mr Hollande, though critical of Mrs Merkel's brand of austerity, seemed keen to find an accommodation. He flew to Berlin within hours of his inauguration. Most of his calls for growth-inducing European investment seemed modest, based on existing proposals by the European Commission. When he spoke of ""Eurobonds"", he had once suggested that he merely meant ""project bonds"", a scheme to sweeten debt issued by private firms to finance EU-backed infrastructure projects. 
That pretence is over. Mr Hollande now wants countries to pool new public debt. Is it acceptable, he asks, that Spain must borrow at 6% while Germany can raise money almost for free? This week Germany sold two-year bonds with a 0% coupon. 
For Germans, Eurobonds are the wrong prescription at the wrong time. Mrs Merkel says they are illegal under EU treaties and do not contribute to growth. Financial Times Deutschland, a German daily, calls the dispute ""The German-French Ice Age."" 
Yet it is too soon to conclude that Franco-German relations have gone into the deep freeze. Any new French president is bound to cause some realignment in Europe. Perhaps Mr Hollande, boosted by a successful trip to America, is setting out a tough opening position ahead of the June summit. Perhaps he is playing up his differences with Germany for the sake of domestic politics, as he seeks to secure a clear majority for his Socialist Party in elections to the National Assembly next month.

GREEK politics may determine the euro's short-term future, but it is Spain that poses the single currency's most difficult problem. The euro zone's fourth-biggest economy is caught in an increasingly desperate spiral of deepening recession, drowning banks and soaring borrowing costs. 
Spanish firms and banks are all but cut off from foreign funds. On May 30th yields on ten-year sovereign bonds rose above 6.6%, close to the level at which Greece, Ireland and Portugal had to seek a bail-out. After the government's botched nationalisation of Bankia, a troubled savings bank, Spanish depositors are jittery . A bank run is all too plausible--especially if Greece, which is bracing itself for a fresh election on June 17th, is forced out of the euro soon. Even if that calamity is avoided, Spain's slump will drag the country inexorably towards insolvency. 
Time to solve Spain's debt crisis is running out. Doing so requires a radical rethink in Madrid, but above all in Brussels and Berlin. Spain's government should be free to focus less on fiscal austerity and more on cleaning up the banks. Its European partners should also help by allowing joint rescue funds to be injected directly into banks. 
The problem in Spain is not that its politicians lack the resolve to reform. In recent months Mariano Rajoy's new conservative government has pushed through a labour-market overhaul. Over the past year or so Spain has pared pensions and written debt limits into the constitution. 
Spain's problem is one of misdiagnosis. Its government and European officials reckon the main challenge is fiscal. They argue that the budget deficit, which reached 8.9% of GDP last year, must be brought down as fast as possible to boost confidence and cut borrowing costs. Spanish politicians have dithered about cleaning up the country's banks, for fear that doing so would demand an injection of public funds which, in turn, would worsen the government's finances. 
Private debt, public pain 
This fiscal focus gets things exactly backwards. Spain's poor public finances, unlike those of Greece, are a symptom rather than the cause of the country's economic woes. Before the crisis Spain was well within the euro zone's fiscal rules. Even now its government debt, at around 70% of GDP, is lower than Germany's. As in Ireland, the origins of Spain's debt problems are private, not public. A debt binge by Spanish households and firms fuelled a property bubble and left the country enormously in hock to foreigners. After adjusting for all the foreign assets they own, Spain's households, firms and government collectively owe foreigners almost EUR 1 trillion ($1.25 trillion), or more than 90% of GDP. That is on a par with crisis-hit Greece, Ireland and Portugal, and far higher than in any other big rich economy. Spain's banks were the conduit for this private borrowing binge, and are being hit hardest by the bust. 
Fortunately, the long history of bank crises shows what needs to be done. Rather than doing too little too late, as it has so far, Spain's government should quickly admit the scale of the problem, clean up the banks, preferably by removing bad assets, and shut down, or recapitalise, what is left. All this inevitably costs public money: an average of 10% of GDP in previous episodes, though much more in some countries, notably Ireland. In rich countries governments typically borrow the money from the markets. In emerging economies that cash has usually come from international rescue funds. 
Spain's government might be able to cover the costs itself. It could inject as much as EUR 100 billion, or 10% of GDP, into its banks and still keep sovereign debt below 100% of GDP. But if the problem turned out to be Irish in scale, it would need help; and anyway, putting money from European funds into Spain's banks would boost confidence more convincingly. If euro-zone countries collectively injected funds directly into Spain's banks, the rescue would do less harm to Spain's public finances, and the vicious link between the country's weakening banks and its worsening sovereign debt would be broken. 
The idea of European-funded rescues for struggling banks has support from the IMF and the European Commission. But there are political hurdles. Allowing the European rescue funds to put money into banks requires approval from national parliaments. Germany objects, on the ground that putting money directly into banks leaves less room for extracting policy reforms in return. That need not be the case. European rescuers could demand reforms as a condition of putting cash into banks, much as if they were lending to the Spanish government. The difference is that a jointly funded plan to deal with the banks might actually work.","The focus should be on fixing the banks, not on cutting the deficit

THE deluge of bad news from Spain continues. Borrowing costs hit new highs, shares sink--and Mariano Rajoy's reformist government is dumbfounded. Why are the markets so cruel? One reason is that Spain's problems always turn out bigger than they seem. The cost of rescuing the country's fourth-biggest lender, Bankia, has spiralled over the past three weeks to some EUR 23.5 billion ($29 billion, see 
). A whopping hole has also appeared in Spain's 2011 accounts, pushing the budget deficit up from 8.5% of GDP to 8.9%. This is raising new doubts about Spain's finances. 
The main fiscal worry is the regional governments. Set the task of cutting their combined deficit last year, they did the opposite, increasing it by some 14% instead. Now the regions are struggling to raise money. Some are frozen out of the markets. Catalonia's president, Artur Mas, has set off jitters by saying that either the government borrows money on the regions' behalf, or bills will go unpaid. ""And that hurts the real economy,"" he notes. The Catalan government has hoovered up a quarter of local savings by issuing patriotic bonds. Madrid is expected to raise special bonds to fund the regions. But that will just add to Spain's overall debt. 
Mr Rajoy's government, in power since December, seems to think it can perform feats that its Socialist predecessor could not. It has set the regions new targets. They must reduce their deficit this year by 1.5% of GDP. If they do not, Spain will miss its overall 5.3% deficit target. This week's recommendation from the European Commission to give Spain three years, rather than two, to hit the 3% limit in Europe's new fiscal compact may help. The regions may seek similar respite. But in a deepening recession deficit-cutting remains testing--and Brussels wants a credible plan. That may mean a sales-tax rise and cuts to pensions and unemployment benefits. 
Mr Rajoy's government has given itself new powers. It can now seize financial control of regional governments that do not stick to their 2012 budgets. These show, on paper, a EUR 18.3-billion deficit reduction. But are the figures realistic? The budgets were approved only on May 17th, with regions helped by looser rules on the services they must provide. Yet signs of austerity are everywhere. Hospital beds are being cut, school classes are growing, civil-service salaries lowered and working hours increased, research programmes halted and infrastructure-spending shrunk. Spain's GDP figures also tell a story. The economy shrank by 0.3% in the first quarter. The government sees a 1.7% fall this year. Unemployment is at 24% (and over 50% for the young). Retail sales fell by a shocking 9.8% in the year to April. 
Some regional officials privately admit to doubts about meeting deficit targets. Andalusia, Catalonia and Valencia, which jointly account for much of the adjustment, hold the key. ""It will be difficult, if not impossible, for Catalonia to make it,"" says Edward Hugh, a Catalan-based independent economist. Others will have similar problems, he says. On May 17th Moody's, a ratings agency, downgraded Catalonia and Murcia to junk. It thinks neither will meet its target. Neither managed to make all the health and education cuts that both budgeted for last year. 
Stepping in to take over regional governments requires political will. So far the government has limited itself to threats. The budget minister, Cristobal Montoro, may find it politically easier to intervene in Socialist-run regions like Andalusia or Asturias than those run by his own People's Party (PP). But Castile La Mancha, Spain's worst performer last year, is in PP hands, as is Valencia. And Mr Mas threatens to call an election in Catalonia if Madrid sends the inspectors in. He presumably believes that angry Catalans will vote for his nationalist coalition, Convergence and Union, or for separatist parties. Either way, Mr Montoro may not be able to intervene in the worst performers until the final quarter of the year--by when it may well be too late.

IN THE weeks before its listing last summer, Bankia inundated airwaves, bus stops and newspapers with an advertising campaign that invited viewers to buy shares and become a bankero. If the campaign was jarring back then, it now seems almost grotesque. On May 26th Spain's fourth-largest bank requested a EUR 19 billion ($24 billion) bail-out from the state. Like it or not, every Spanish taxpayer is now a bankero. What's more, the scale of the cleanup at Bankia raises fears that other lenders will require more cash at a time when there is no obvious way of raising it. 
The good news is that the larger-than-expected rescue means the government is at last serious about cleaning up Bankia. Its new chairman, Jose Ignacio Goirigolzarri, certainly has every incentive to flush out all the bank's problems so that the balance-sheet is purged of nasties. Bankia's recently nationalised parent, Banco Financiero y de Ahorros (BFA), will get EUR 19 billion on top of the EUR 4.5 billion it had already received from Spain's bail-out fund, the FROB. The new provisions go beyond recent state requirements and will cover nearly half of the group's real-estate exposure, and 13.1% of its entire loan book. 
Existing shareholders will see their 55% stake in Bankia heavily diluted. Although they will have the right to participate in Bankia's EUR 12 billion capital increase in October, which will be underwritten by BFA, it is pretty unlikely that anyone will take up those rights (Bankia's shares have fallen by more than 70% since it listed). The government might have reduced its bill by going after the holders of preference shares. Yet these complex and illiquid instruments were in some cases marketed as quasi-deposits to retail clients, many of whom also bought shares in Bankia. The risk of imposing pain on these retail investors is that it provokes a deposit flight. So the government will have to fill the gap. 
The burning question is whether the scale of Bankia's hole provides clues about the state of other weak lenders. True, Bankia had the biggest property exposure in Spain, not least in Valencia on the Mediterranean coast. That region is home to CAM, a failed savings bank dubbed ""the worst of the worst"" by Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez, who this week brought forward his exit from the post of Spain's central-bank governor. Bankia also made risky loans to low-income immigrants. And at least EUR 6.6 billion of the cleanup relates to industrial stakes and tax assets. 
But Bankia's assumptions on the rate of non-performing loans in areas such as residential mortgages and corporate loans set a disturbing new benchmark for other lenders. It seems highly likely that an external review of Spanish banks by two consultancies, whose initial findings are due later this month, will find more holes. 
Based on Bankia's assumptions on loan losses, the rest of the sector could need another EUR 45 billion in provisions on top of what the government has already demanded, according to UBS estimates. Analysts at Nomura believe that all the Spanish banks, with the exceptions of BBVA, Banco Santander and Sabadell, would need to raise capital. (Most believe that BBVA and Santander in particular are strong enough to be able to handle provisions via earnings.) 
The question is where all this money will come from. Private capital is a no-go. ""Every single door is closed,"" says a senior banker. BFA is expected to receive the EUR 19 billion rescue funds--equivalent to less than 2% of Spanish GDP--in early July. The obvious way to raise the money is for the FROB to issue bonds, but the government is clearly nervous about testing the markets when its borrowing costs are so high. Spreads between its ten-year bonds and German Bunds hit another euro-era high this week (see chart on previous page). 
Hence talk this week of giving Bankia Spanish sovereign bonds in return for equity, which it could then swap for cash from the European Central Bank. Such a scheme would avoid tapping the markets but is unlikely to go down well at the ECB. Besides, manoeuvring to avoid the markets is not a great signal of Spain's ability to fund other borrowing requirements. 
The government may be holding out for a change in the rules that would allow a direct recapitalisation of the banks by the euro zone's bail-out funds (see next story). Mariano Rajoy, the prime minister, has promised that he will not allow any bank to fail. To honour that pledge, it looks increasingly likely that Spain will have to dip into other countries' pockets.","Spain has avoided facing up to its banking problems . Now it has no choice

 Based on Bankia 's assumptions on loan losses , the rest of the sector could need another EUR 45 billion in provisions on top of what the government has already demanded , according to UBS estimates . Analysts at Nomura believe that all the Spanish banks , with the exceptions of BBVA , Banco Santander and Sabadell , would need to raise capital . ( Most believe that BBVA and Santander in particular are strong enough to be able to handle provisions via earnings . ) 
 The question is where all this money will come from . Private capital is a no - go . "" Every single door is closed , "" says a senior banker . BFA is expected to receive the EUR 19 billion rescue funds -- equivalent to less than 2 % of Spanish GDP -- in early July . The obvious way to raise the money is for the FROB to issue bonds , but the government is clearly nervous about testing the markets when its borrowing costs are so high . Spreads between its ten - year bonds and German Bunds hit another euro - era high this week ( see chart on previous page ) . 
 Hence talk this week of giving Bankia Spanish sovereign bonds in return for equity , which it could then swap for cash from the European Central Bank . Such a scheme would avoid tapping the markets but is unlikely to go down well at the ECB . Besides , manoeuvring to avoid the markets is not a great signal of Spain 's ability to fund other borrowing requirements . 
 The government may be holding out for a change in the rules that would allow a direct recapitalisation of the banks by the euro zone 's bail - out funds ( see next story ) . Mariano Rajoy has promised that Mariano Rajoy will not allow any bank to fail . To honour that pledge , it looks increasingly likely that Spain will have to dip into other countries ' pockets .",230,Spain,A30-57,IN TERM,True,"Mariano Rajoy , the prime minister ,",2,True

2012-06-16,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/1020872711/fulltext/3E7149AD2EAD4C43PQ/16?accountid=14657,"The EUR 100 billion pledged to help Spain was meant to rescue the banks and calm the euro zone. Instead it has added to the drama 
IT WAS a victory for the euro. It was a credit line. It was ""the thing that happened yesterday"". The one way Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy refused to describe the pledge of EUR 100 billion ($125 billion) from other euro-zone countries to recapitalise Spain's banks was as a ""bail-out"". Nor was it a rescue, the economy minister, Luis de Guindos, insisted; just ""a loan with very favourable conditions"". 
Regardless of the conditions, the outcome was less than favourable. The package had been put together during a series of rushed videoconferences of euro-zone finance ministers on June 9th. The European Commission president, Jose Manuel Barroso, says he pushed Mr Rajoy, who had previously denied the need for any deal, into accepting one. Mr Rajoy has claimed it was he who did the forcing, insisting on a deal focused only on the banks. What is certain is that a need to calm markets before the Greek election on June 17th piled on the pressure. 
The markets were not calmed. By June 12th bond yields were higher than they have been since the country adopted the euro in 1999; if they stay that high for long the kingdom of Spain itself would need a bail-out (see chart 1). Even without government circumlocution, enough was fuzzy about the deal to have investors worried. Yet some things were clear: while Spain now has a plausible plan to recapitalise its banks, the new money does little to resolve the Spanish economy's other fundamental problems. 
Not like the others 
Mr Rajoy's unwillingness to talk of bail-outs stems from a desire not to have Spain spoken of in the same breath as Greece, Ireland and Portugal (see chart 2 on next page). To reassure Spaniards that things were different he insisted that the money came with no strings in terms of new, more austere government policies, just some conditions for the banks. The euro zone's ""men in black"", as the budget minister, Cristobal Montoro, calls them, would not be visiting. 
But on June 11th Germany's finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, insisted that the troika of lenders--the European Commission, the IMF and the European Central Bank--which administers the bail-outs of Greece, Ireland and Portugal would be heavily involved in Spain too. Euro-zone ministers said Spanish policy, which they endorse, would be scrutinised and ""regularly reviewed"". 
One basis for Spanish exceptionalism is that Spain can be seen as too big to fail. ""There is not enough money to rescue both Spain and Italy,"" says one government official. That allows it to dig in its feet. According to El Mundo, a newspaper, Mr Rajoy reminded Mr de Guindos of this by text during the negotiations: ""Spain is not Uganda. We are the fourth-largest economy in the euro zone."" Officials refused to comment on this claim; wags on Twitter were quick to point out that Uganda's GDP growth and unemployment rate are both far better than Spain's, which is set to see GDP decline by 1.7% this year and suffers 24% unemployment. 
The other basis for exceptionalism is that Spain's crisis is not like those of Greece and Portugal; to begin with, at least, it really was all about the banks. When the global financial crisis hit in 2008, Madrid was relatively calm. Spain's banks were hit, but they had not invested in the toxic off-balance-sheet products that sank banks elsewhere. The then prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, boasted that Spain had ""perhaps the most solid financial system in the world."" 
But though Spain's banks had, as regulators required, made thrifty counter-cyclical provisions, they were also parties to an ungodly property bubble (see chart 3). Property prices tripled between 1995 and 2007. Construction and real-estate loans grew from 10% of GDP in 1992 to 43% in 2009, according to a new IMF report. 
A great deal of the lending was by Spain's unlisted regional savings banks, or cajas. Their share of the financial system, measured in terms of assets, rose from about 10% in the 1960s to nearly half by 2010, increasingly lending outside their region of origin. Fierce competition led to ever more bank branches opening; Spain ended up with one for every 1,000 people, making it one of the most overbanked countries in the world. 
The world's most solid financial system 
After the property bubble popped in 2008, banks began acquiring properties from developers before the loans that supported them went sour. As the economy entered recession, foreclosures mounted. Spain's banks may now own a fifth of the total stock of empty homes, according to some analysts' estimates. 
The reluctance to cut losses has delayed the adjustment in house prices, which have fallen by 25% from the 2007-08 peak, according to various indices. Irish prices, in comparison, have dropped by roughly half. Even though Irish prices rose more in the boom, Morgan Stanley, a bank, reckons that 50% could be on the cards for Spain, too, with the bulk of the remaining correction this year and the next. Supply and demand cannot be matched because the banks own so much property, says Jesus Encinar, founder of Idealista.com, a real-estate portal (see box on next page). ""Banks are only giving mortgages on their own apartments. They will give you a 100% mortgage [but only] if you buy one of their flats."" 
Mr Zapatero had several opportunities to clean up the banking system when government financing costs were lower, but dragged his feet. Spain created its bank bail-out fund, the FROB, in 2009, with a potential capacity of EUR 99 billion; by 2012 it had dispensed only EUR 14 billion. An industry-backed deposit-guarantee fund has provided another EUR 13 billion. 
A key obstacle was that the cajas didn't have shareholders; they were controlled by a mixture of politicians and depositors. Many cajas were operated by regional barons as development banks that could further their political purposes, says Luis Garicano of the London School of Economics. The cajas boasted that they had survived 200 years. Some, such as those in the Basque country, did indeed look healthier than commercial rivals. But the failure of governance at others was of epic proportions. Isabel Cambronero, a professional dancer appointed to the control committee of Caja de Ahorros del Mediterraneo, bailed out and later auctioned, said nobody ever told her there was a crisis. Other ex-board-members tell of meetings in New Delhi and Chicago. Huge pay packages and golden handshakes were the norm. 
The cajas of old are now more or less gone. The advent of FROB and a rise in capital requirements forced the country's 45 savings banks into a frenzy of consolidation. There are now just 11, all set up on modern lines. But these mergers were often fudges that simply compounded the problem. The caja ownership model made it hard to raise capital, and the reordered system reflected that lack. Last summer Bankia, a merger of seven savings banks, and Banca Civica undertook tortured stockmarket listings. A larger rival gobbled up Banca Civica at a discount; Bankia was bailed out on May 26th, its troubles calling into question assumptions about non-performing loans elsewhere in the system and spooking the markets even more. 
The EUR 100 billion loan from the euro zone should head off the sort of panic that might lead to bank runs while enabling the banks to purge their balance sheets of dud loans. But it is doing so by piling even more debt on Spain's weary shoulders. Channelled through the FROB, the loan will count as sovereign debt, potentially adding nearly 10% of GDP to Spain's debt burden this year. At 90% of GDP that burden would still be less than in other highly indebted countries in the euro zone. But markets were also rattled by the possibility that the new loans might take priority over private creditors. The money seems likely to come from the new European Stability Mechanism (ESM), which will be a preferred creditor; that would make Spanish bonds a bit more risky for other creditors. 
The loop of doom 
What is more, the bail-out does not break the feedback loop through which Spain and its banks are making things ever worse for each other. With foreign investors heading for the hills, Spanish banks have stepped in to buy even more government bonds, with the help of the ECB's cheap three-year loan programme. The more foreign investors leave the market--as they seem to have done this week--the less sustainable this becomes. 
The men in black might help with this. Spanish lenders taking bail-out money will be subject to European Union (EU) state-aid rules. Many will be forced to clean up boards and sell stakes in large industrial companies (a welcome development). Mindful of this, some banks were quick to say they did not need the cash. But the IMF report says that only the three largest Spanish banks--BBVA, CaixaBank and Santander, which account for 47% of assets--appear able to cope on their own if things get bad. 
Part of the troika's brief will be what the euro-zone governments call, opaquely, ""horizontal structural reforms"". Judging by the IMF report these might include disentangling the Bank of Spain's regulatory powers from the economy ministry's and strengthening them. The IMF also called for the introduction of a bank-resolution scheme that would impose losses on both shareholders and bondholders. And Joaquin Almunia, the EU's competition commissioner, has said that Spain may need to liquidate one of its bailed-out banks. 
Unlike the governments which oversaw bail-outs in Greece, Ireland and Portugal, all of which were booted out soon thereafter, Mr Rajoy is not in serious political danger. He has an absolute majority in the Cortes, and is only six months into a four-year term. Most of the country still blames Mr Zapatero for the mess. But Mr Rajoy risks increasing Spaniards' alienation. His People's Party has blocked an investigation of Bankia, which was run by managers the party appointed. He looks unlikely to appear in parliament to explain the bail-out until mid-July. And he seems allergic to journalists and their pesky questions. On a recent Senate visit he sneaked out of the back door to avoid them. 
There is a growing feeling, says Josep Lobera of Metroscopia, a polling company, that Mr Rajoy has no real plan for Spain's economy and merely reacts to events by improvising. Spinning ""the thing that happened yesterday"" as a famous victory will only increase that. And the public's faith in Europe is slipping too. Three years ago, 80% thought that the EU could best solve their problems. Three months ago that was down to 65%. Now it is barely over half. 
In Greece, Portugal and Ireland, Spain's ""sweet bail-out"" raised some hackles and some hopes. Portugal's prime minister, Pedro Passos Coelho, warned that he would scrutinise the final deal carefully.

) said Spain had shown the way. So did the centre-right: ""Just think, at a time when a country like Spain negotiates, some""--a dig at Syriza--""argue that we have to clash with Europe,"" said Antonis Samaras, the leader of New Democracy. 
Meanwhile the markets swiftly moved on to other vulnerable euro-zone members. Cyprus is reported to be about to ask for a bail-out for its banks, which are heavily exposed to Greece. But the biggest worries are about Italy. Its budget deficit is small and its banks are not troubled by a burst property bubble, but it is in deep recession after a decade of almost no growth and investors are losing faith in the technocratic government of Mario Monti. His reform programme is seen to have stalled and he has less than nine months to go before the next election, the result of which is highly unpredictable. 
Italy's public debt of almost EUR 2 trillion makes it too big for any bail-out; after the latest EUR 100 billion to Spain, the sum left for new lending commitments will be just EUR 400 billion. And the response by the bond markets to that bail-out raises the worry that Spain might need to go back for more. Many of its regions can barely refinance their debts; they are largely to blame for Spain's deficit last year coming in at 8.9% of GDP not the targeted 6%. And while the banks may now be in slightly better shape, they are too risk-averse to lend to companies that, with credit, could grow. ""The tragedy is that these EUR 100 billion won't reach the real economy,"" says Mr Encinar of Idealista.com. ""The banks are petrified,"" agrees MartinVarsavsky, who runs Fon, a Wi-Fi hotspot company. ""They just want to save themselves."" 
That said, Mr Varsavsky sees Spain as highly unlikely to end up in as much trouble as his native Argentina when it defaulted a decade ago. ""Spain is much more mature and understanding of the role others can play in helping,"" he says. ""It is not a defiant, difficult country run by people who are abusive."" But it is still a country in a lot of trouble, likely only to be made worse when the Greek election result at least prolongs, and possibly intensifies, the euro zone's agony. Mr Rajoy may prove wise to have avoided the term ""bail-out"": Spain could be shipping water for some time yet.","The EUR 100 billion pledged to help Spain was meant to rescue the banks and calm the euro zone . Instead it has added to the drama 
 IT WAS a victory for the euro . It was a credit line . It was "" the thing that happened yesterday "" . The one way Mariano Rajoy refused to describe the pledge of EUR 100 billion ( $ 125 billion ) from other euro - zone countries to recapitalise Spain 's banks was as a "" bail - out "" . Nor was it a rescue , the economy minister , Luis de Guindos , insisted ; just "" a loan with very favourable conditions "" . 
 Regardless of the conditions , the outcome was less than favourable . The package had been put together during a series of rushed videoconferences of euro - zone finance ministers on June 9th . The European Commission president , Jose Manuel Barroso , says he pushed Mariano Rajoy , into accepting one . Mariano Rajoy has claimed it was Mariano Rajoy who did the forcing , insisting on a deal focused only on the banks . What is certain is that a need to calm markets before the Greek election on June 17th piled on the pressure . 
 The markets were not calmed . By June 12th bond yields were higher than they have been since the country adopted the euro in 1999 ; if they stay that high for long the kingdom of Spain itself would need a bail - out ( see chart 1 ) . Even without government circumlocution , enough was fuzzy about the deal to have investors worried . Yet some things were clear : while Spain now has a plausible plan to recapitalise its banks , the new money does little to resolve the Spanish economy 's other fundamental problems . 
 Not like the others 
 Mariano Rajoy's unwillingness to talk of bail - outs stems from a desire not to have Spain spoken of in the same breath as Greece , Ireland and Portugal ( see chart 2 on next page ) . To reassure Spaniards that things were different Mariano Rajoy insisted that the money came with no strings in terms of new , more austere government policies , just some conditions for the banks . The euro zone 's "" men in black "" , as the budget minister , Cristobal Montoro , calls them , would not be visiting . 
 But on June 11th Germany 's finance minister , Wolfgang Schauble , insisted that the troika of lenders -- the European Commission , the IMF and the European Central Bank -- which administers the bail - outs of Greece , Ireland and Portugal would be heavily involved in Spain too . Euro - zone ministers said Spanish policy , which they endorse , would be scrutinised and "" regularly reviewed "" . 
 One basis for Spanish exceptionalism is that Spain can be seen as too big to fail . "" There is not enough money to rescue both Spain and Italy , "" says one government official . That allows it to dig in its feet . According to El Mundo , a newspaper , Mariano Rajoy reminded Mr de Guindos of this by text during the negotiations : "" Spain is not Uganda . We are the fourth - largest economy in the euro zone . "" Officials refused to comment on this claim ; wags on Twitter were quick to point out that Uganda 's GDP growth and unemployment rate are both far better than Spain 's , which is set to see GDP decline by 1.7 % this year and suffers 24 % unemployment . 
 The other basis for exceptionalism is that Spain 's crisis is not like those of Greece and Portugal ; to begin with , at least , it really was all about the banks . When the global financial crisis hit in 2008 , Madrid was relatively calm . Spain 's banks were hit , but they had not invested in the toxic off - balance - sheet products that sank banks elsewhere . The then prime minister , Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero , boasted that Spain had "" perhaps the most solid financial system in the world . "" 
 But though Spain 's banks had , as regulators required , made thrifty counter - cyclical provisions , they were also parties to an ungodly property bubble ( see chart 3 ) . Property prices tripled between 1995 and 2007 . Construction and real - estate loans grew from 10 % of GDP in 1992 to 43 % in 2009 , according to a new IMF report . 
 A great deal of the lending was by Spain 's unlisted regional savings banks , or cajas . Their share of the financial system , measured in terms of assets , rose from about 10 % in the 1960s to nearly half by 2010 , increasingly lending outside their region of origin . Fierce competition led to ever more bank branches opening ; Spain ended up with one for every 1,000 people , making it one of the most overbanked countries in the world . 
 The world 's most solid financial system 
 After the property bubble popped in 2008 , banks began acquiring properties from developers before the loans that supported them went sour . As the economy entered recession , foreclosures mounted . Spain 's banks may now own a fifth of the total stock of empty homes , according to some analysts ' estimates . 
 The reluctance to cut losses has delayed the adjustment in house prices , which have fallen by 25 % from the 2007 - 08 peak , according to various indices . Irish prices , in comparison , have dropped by roughly half . Even though Irish prices rose more in the boom , Morgan Stanley , a bank , reckons that 50 % could be on the cards for Spain , too , with the bulk of the remaining correction this year and the next . Supply and demand can not be matched because the banks own so much property , says Jesus Encinar , founder of Idealista.com , a real - estate portal ( see box on next page ) . "" Banks are only giving mortgages on their own apartments . They will give you a 100 % mortgage [ but only ] if you buy one of their flats . "" 
 Mr Zapatero had several opportunities to clean up the banking system when government financing costs were lower , but dragged his feet . Spain created its bank bail - out fund , the FROB , in 2009 , with a potential capacity of EUR 99 billion ; by 2012 it had dispensed only EUR 14 billion . An industry - backed deposit - guarantee fund has provided another EUR 13 billion . 
 A key obstacle was that the cajas did n't have shareholders ; they were controlled by a mixture of politicians and depositors . Many cajas were operated by regional barons as development banks that could further their political purposes , says Luis Garicano of the London School of Economics . The cajas boasted that they had survived 200 years . Some , such as those in the Basque country , did indeed look healthier than commercial rivals . But the failure of governance at others was of epic proportions . Isabel Cambronero , a professional dancer appointed to the control committee of Caja de Ahorros del Mediterraneo , bailed out and later auctioned , said nobody ever told her there was a crisis . Other ex - board - members tell of meetings in New Delhi and Chicago . Huge pay packages and golden handshakes were the norm . 
 The cajas of old are now more or less gone . The advent of FROB and a rise in capital requirements forced the country 's 45 savings banks into a frenzy of consolidation . There are now just 11 , all set up on modern lines . But these mergers were often fudges that simply compounded the problem . The caja ownership model made it hard to raise capital , and the reordered system reflected that lack . Last summer Bankia , a merger of seven savings banks , and Banca Civica undertook tortured stockmarket listings . A larger rival gobbled up Banca Civica at a discount ; Bankia was bailed out on May 26th , its troubles calling into question assumptions about non - performing loans elsewhere in the system and spooking the markets even more . 
 The EUR 100 billion loan from the euro zone should head off the sort of panic that might lead to bank runs while enabling the banks to purge their balance sheets of dud loans . But it is doing so by piling even more debt on Spain 's weary shoulders . Channelled through the FROB , the loan will count as sovereign debt , potentially adding nearly 10 % of GDP to Spain 's debt burden this year . At 90 % of GDP that burden would still be less than in other highly indebted countries in the euro zone . But markets were also rattled by the possibility that the new loans might take priority over private creditors . The money seems likely to come from the new European Stability Mechanism ( ESM ) , which will be a preferred creditor ; that would make Spanish bonds a bit more risky for other creditors . 
 The loop of doom 
 What is more , the bail - out does not break the feedback loop through which Spain and its banks are making things ever worse for each other . With foreign investors heading for the hills , Spanish banks have stepped in to buy even more government bonds , with the help of the ECB 's cheap three - year loan programme . The more foreign investors leave the market -- as they seem to have done this week -- the less sustainable this becomes . 
 The men in black might help with this . Spanish lenders taking bail - out money will be subject to European Union ( EU ) state - aid rules . Many will be forced to clean up boards and sell stakes in large industrial companies ( a welcome development ) . Mindful of this , some banks were quick to say they did not need the cash . But the IMF report says that only the three largest Spanish banks -- BBVA , CaixaBank and Santander , which account for 47 % of assets -- appear able to cope on their own if things get bad . 
 Part of the troika 's brief will be what the euro - zone governments call , opaquely , "" horizontal structural reforms "" . Judging by the IMF report these might include disentangling the Bank of Spain 's regulatory powers from the economy ministry 's and strengthening them . The IMF also called for the introduction of a bank - resolution scheme that would impose losses on both shareholders and bondholders . And Joaquin Almunia , the EU 's competition commissioner , has said that Spain may need to liquidate one of its bailed - out banks . 
 Unlike the governments which oversaw bail - outs in Greece , Ireland and Portugal , all of which were booted out soon thereafter , Mariano Rajoy is not in serious political danger . Mariano Rajoy has an absolute majority in the Cortes , and is only six months into a four - year term . Most of the country still blames Mr Zapatero for the mess . But Mariano Rajoy risks increasing Spaniards ' alienation . Mariano Rajoy's People 's Party has blocked an investigation of Bankia , which was run by managers the party appointed . Mariano Rajoy looks unlikely to appear in parliament to explain the bail - out until mid - July . And Mariano Rajoy seems allergic to journalists and their pesky questions . On a recent Senate visit Mariano Rajoy sneaked out of the back door to avoid them . 
 There is a growing feeling , says Josep Lobera of Metroscopia , a polling company , that Mariano Rajoy has no real plan for Spain 's economy and merely reacts to events by improvising . Spinning "" the thing that happened yesterday "" as a famous victory will only increase that . And the public 's faith in Europe is slipping too . Three years ago , 80 % thought that the EU could best solve their problems . Three months ago that was down to 65 % . Now it is barely over half . 
 In Greece , Portugal and Ireland , Spain 's "" sweet bail - out "" raised some hackles and some hopes . Portugal 's prime minister , Pedro Passos Coelho , warned that he would scrutinise the final deal carefully . Syriza , a left - wing Greek party which wants to tear up the country 's current bail - out agreement ( 
 ) said Spain had shown the way . So did the centre - right : "" Just think , at a time when a country like Spain negotiates , some""--a dig at Syriza--""argue that we have to clash with Europe , "" said Antonis Samaras , the leader of New Democracy .

NONE of the leaders who gathered in Brussels at the European Union (EU) summit--not even Angela Merkel or Mariano Rajoy--stood to lose as much from the outcome (and the markets' reaction to it) as Italy's Mario Monti. Even in the case of a fiasco, neither the German chancellor nor the Spanish prime minister stood to lose their jobs. Mr Monti did. 
When he was appointed last November, it was to restore Italy's credibility on international financial markets, whose mirror image is the spread between Italy's benchmark government bonds and their German equivalents. As Mr Monti's non-party, technocratic government rammed through stiff tax increases and a bold pension reform, the spread almost halved. But it has been climbing back since March, and by the start of the summit was around 460 basis points (see chart). The very number that brought Mr Monti into office was threatening to drive him out. 
Small wonder Italian officials have been pressing since before the Los Cabos G20 summit earlier this month for a scheme to allow the EU's state bail-out fund, the EFSF, to intervene on the primary--and preferably secondary--government-bond markets. To make intervention credible, the Italian government has also been seeking to get the bond purchases leveraged by the European Central Bank. 
""We cannot let the markets open on Monday without something substantial,"" Mr Monti said shortly before leaving for Brussels. He took with him two arguments to deploy against Germany's predictably wary chancellor. One was moral and explicit. ""The Italian people have made a lot of sacrifices,"" the prime minister said. ""They knew the reward in terms of higher growth would take a long time. But they hoped the pay-off, in the form of lower interest rates, would be faster."" 
The other argument was practical and maybe implicit. A rising spread allows Mr Monti's critics to argue the change of government seven months ago was futile. And it seems to be tempting Silvio Berlusconi, Mr Monti's predecessor, into thinking it could be reversed. Without the support of the People of Freedom movement, founded by Mr Berlusconi, the present government cannot survive. 
On June 22nd the former prime minister mused in public for the first time about a comeback. The idea that Mr Berlusconi, who is on trial for paying an underage girl for sex and who bears a heavy responsibility for Italy's economic plight, could return to office may seem unimaginable outside Italy. But with his almost bottomless reserves of cash and patronage, he has made the unthinkable happen more than once. 
Assuming, no doubt correctly, that Mrs Merkel would be appalled by the prospect of Mr Monti's departure, several Italian commentators concluded he would threaten her with it to get what he needed. Yet blackmail is not part of the armoury of this courteous economics professor. 
Even some of Mr Monti's ministers accept privately that one explanation for the widening bond spread is a gradual loss of the government's reforming momentum. The government has liberalised and simplified with great zeal. On June 27th, minutes before leaving for Brussels, Mr Monti signed a hard-fought reform of the employment laws. 
Even so, the employment-law reform, along with several others, has been watered down by the parties that give Mr Monti's technocrats their parliamentary majority. And, to the frustration of the premier's admirers, he has shrunk from using what was once the most powerful weapon at his disposal: threatening resignation and leaving the politicians to take the blame for a bond spread that would have spiralled out of control. 
Now the moment has passed. Not only has the spread risen again, but the government's popularity has fallen. A recent poll indicated that less than a third of Italians thought it was doing a good job.","Why Italy's prime minister looks vulnerable

WAS Europe's 19th crisis summit, held in Brussels on June 28th and 29th, a game-changer? Judging by the euphoria in financial markets and among many commentators, the answer seems to be yes. Yields on Italian and Spanish bonds fell sharply as investors decided that Europe's political leaders had committed themselves to the creation of a banking union and to allowing troubled countries easier access to euro-zone rescue funds. The prime ministers of Italy and Spain, Mario Monti and Mariano Rajoy, and the French president, Francois Hollande, were widely hailed for scoring a victory over Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel. She, in turn, was excoriated by many at home for giving in to blackmail. 
As so often, the summit had been billed as a make-or-break affair, in which Europe's political leaders had to lay out their vision for economic and political integration to save their single currency. Is the euphoria about to fizzle, as in the past? 
The summit gave reasons for guarded optimism. Europe's politicians have said they will create a Europe-wide bank supervisor (involving the European Central Bank) before the end of the year. This is only a pledge, but if the history of European policymaking is a guide, the euro zone will quarrel over the details of a banking supervisor only to agree to one eventually. Second, by accepting that bail-out funds can go straight to banks, Mrs Merkel has made a big shift from her insistence that help could go only to governments, with tough conditions attached. The underlying German logic that shared financial liability must imply shared oversight remains the same. But by countenancing jointly financed bank recapitalisation, Mrs Merkel has accepted a broader notion of risk-sharing. This is still a long way from the partial debt mutualisation that the euro zone needs, but it marks a step forward from Germany's exclusive obsession with fiscal austerity. 
However, there are caveats. Europe's politicians did not commit themselves to a banking union. There was no agreement to euro-wide deposit insurance or to a common bank-resolution scheme. And although the summit agreed that euro-zone rescue funds could be injected directly into banks, this depends on the single supervisor being in place first. 
The supposed loosening of the strings attached to help for peripheral economies was also limited. The much-ballyhooed agreement that rescue funds could buy embattled countries' bonds without onerous extra conditions was just a political promise to do something already allowed. The only concrete new commitments were that the promised aid of up to EUR 100 billion ($125 billion) for Spain to recapitalise its banks would no longer be senior to other debt, and that Ireland could expect the burden of its bank bail-outs to be eased. 
A set of limited and contingent promises is much better than nothing, but it hardly adds up to a sturdy new foundation for the euro's future. A lot could still go wrong. In a system that requires unanimity, grumbling from Finland and the Netherlands is a reminder that even if the limited deal at the summit holds, further steps will be hard. Legal challenges have already been laid before Germany's constitutional court. Mrs Merkel's coalition partners and even some in her own party are threatening to be obstructive. And existing problems have not gone away: most obviously, hard decisions still have to be made about whether to give more help to Greece, which barely featured in the summit's discussions. 
The summer-holiday-saving summit? 
It is therefore a brave soul who would call this summit a turning-point for the euro. Given that agreeing on a banking authority will take several months, think how remote are the more fundamental constitutional changes needed to back a banking union and Eurobonds. The outlook for the European and world economy is darkening. Recession will undermine normal politics and create conditions for markets to take fright .

FOR Spain's prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, rises in sales tax are an ""absurdity"". They hit consumer spending, punish the poor and reduce growth. So why is he raising value-added tax by three points, to 21%? A budget deficit of 8.9% of GDP in 2011 is one reason. But another is that, as Mr Rajoy turns to his European Union partners to bail out Spain's banks, his freedom to pursue his own policies is dwindling. The tax rise is a direct imposition by Spain's new masters in Brussels. 
It is the core of EUR 65 billion ($80 billion) of new budget measures spread over two-and-a-half years. Income tax went up early in Mr Rajoy's first seven months in power. ""These measures are not pleasant, but they are necessary,"" he said, recognising that he had once pledged to reduce taxes. The latest jump in yields on ten-year bonds to above 7%, widely seen as unsustainable, meant that drastic measures were necessary. 
A draft bail-out memorandum was leaked on July 10th, when EU finance ministers eased Spain's 2012 deficit target from 5.3% to 6.3% of GDP. The draft claims that conditions apply only to banks but it also tells Spain to implement macroeconomic reforms demanded by the European Commission. The July 11th measures read like a catalogue of commission recommendations. They included reduced unemployment benefits, civil-service pay cuts, making Spaniards retire later and the privatisation of railways, ports and airports. The only stimulus measure for a country with 24% unemployment was a cut in social-security contributions. 
Will the new budget damage Mr Rajoy? He has an absolute majority in parliament and leads the opposition Socialists in the polls. But his claim that the bail-out has no conditions now looks hollow. Striking miners marched in Madrid as he was presenting his measures. Details of the bail-out money, channelled via Frob, a restructuring fund, will be finalised on July 20th. Luis de Guindos, the economy minister, said the interest rate could be below 4%. Some EUR 30 billion will be made available soon, but the rest will come more slowly. Stress tests of banks will be completed in September to show how much of the EUR 100 billion on offer is needed. Loans will be available for 18 months. 
The draft memorandum requires the Bank of Spain to provide regular updates on ailing banks to the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF. It must also review its supervisory system, which failed to spot the impending havoc from toxic property assets held by banks that had lent crazily to developers.

The memorandum requires Mr de Guindos to pass his sanctioning and licensing powers to the Bank of Spain, and Mr Rajoy to set up an independent fiscal body to monitor policy.

 FOR Mariano Rajoy's , rises in sales tax are an "" absurdity "" . They hit consumer spending , punish the poor and reduce growth . So why is Mariano Rajoy raising value - added tax by three points , to 21 % ? A budget deficit of 8.9 % of GDP in 2011 is one reason . But another is that , as Mariano Rajoy turns to Mariano Rajoy's European Union partners to bail out Spain 's banks , Mariano Rajoy's freedom to pursue Mariano Rajoy's own policies is dwindling . The tax rise is a direct imposition by Spain 's new masters in Brussels . 
 It is the core of EUR 65 billion ( $ 80 billion ) of new budget measures spread over two - and - a - half years . Income tax went up early in Mariano Rajoy's first seven months in power . "" These measures are not pleasant , but they are necessary , "" Mariano Rajoy said , recognising that Mariano Rajoy had once pledged to reduce taxes . The latest jump in yields on ten - year bonds to above 7 % , widely seen as unsustainable , meant that drastic measures were necessary . 
 A draft bail - out memorandum was leaked on July 10th , when EU finance ministers eased Spain 's 2012 deficit target from 5.3 % to 6.3 % of GDP . The draft claims that conditions apply only to banks but it also tells Spain to implement macroeconomic reforms demanded by the European Commission . The July 11th measures read like a catalogue of commission recommendations . They included reduced unemployment benefits , civil - service pay cuts , making Spaniards retire later and the privatisation of railways , ports and airports . The only stimulus measure for a country with 24 % unemployment was a cut in social - security contributions . 
 Will the new budget damage Mariano Rajoy ? Mariano Rajoy has an absolute majority in parliament and leads the opposition Socialists in the polls . But Mariano Rajoy's claim that the bail - out has no conditions now looks hollow . Striking miners marched in Madrid as Mariano Rajoy was presenting Mariano Rajoy's measures . Details of the bail - out money , channelled via Frob , a restructuring fund , will be finalised on July 20th . Luis de Guindos , the economy minister , said the interest rate could be below 4 % . Some EUR 30 billion will be made available soon , but the rest will come more slowly . Stress tests of banks will be completed in September to show how much of the EUR 100 billion on offer is needed . Loans will be available for 18 months .

THE worst nightmares are the ones you cannot wake up from. Just ask Spain. A year ago the cost of Spanish government borrowing soared as euro contagion spread from Greece, Ireland and Portugal. Panic seemed to subside with central-bank intervention and the promise of a new reforming government in Madrid. Since then Spain has, broadly, been as good as its word and Mariano Rajoy's government has cut budgets, freed its labour market, played its part in countless ""make-or-break"" summits in Brussels and secured up to EUR 100 billion ($121 billion) to prop up its banks. Yet despite all its efforts and pain, Spain cannot shake off that sense of doom. On July 25th the yield on ten-year bonds touched a euro-era record of 7.75%. Two-year bonds have climbed above 7%: investors fear that Spain must soon ask for a bail-out--or default. 
Spain's nightmare is a symptom of what is wrong with the entire euro zone. As the months drag on, the crisis is deepening. Europe's leaders have asked the world to trust that they will do what it takes to save the euro. They have also pleaded for more time to sort out the mess. Their task is indeed immense, but as they disappear to their chateaux and beach villas, trust is draining away and time is not their friend. 
The bull and the horns 
Spain's situation today is all the more shocking because only this month it had announced EUR 65 billion of tax rises and spending cuts and won the funds for its bank rescue. This was meant to persuade investors that the whole euro zone is serious about keeping Spain. Yet the message was obliterated by news that the government now expects the recession to last into 2013 and, worse, that it will have to find the money to bail out regions which have suddenly confessed to being broke. 
The prognosis for Spain is bleak ( 
). The economy is in recession, the public sector is cutting spending and the private sector is reluctant to invest. This lack of domestic demand almost guarantees that Mr Rajoy will fail to meet the target to reduce the deficit. If that happens, Spain will be asked to impose yet more austerity. That will undermine his popularity, which has already fallen steeply since he was elected. Spain's resolve will be further damaged by rows over budget cuts between Madrid and regional politicians, who control 40% of public spending--and who, even if they are from Mr Rajoy's party, jealously guard their autonomy. Political uncertainty will feed back into the economy, which will only deteriorate more. And the vicious circle continues. 
Spain cannot escape from this trap by itself. The government has admitted it does not have money to spare, and lenders are starting to doubt its solvency. A rescue of sorts can be cobbled together, with bond yields held down by some combination of the European Central Bank (ECB) and various rescue funds (even if the main one is still subject to a German constitutional court, whose judges are scandalously slow). 
But that would only buy time. Perhaps not very much. Bail out Spain and immediately investors will rightly worry about Italy and whether the rescue funds are big enough. There are technical complications: new money from the rescue funds might count as senior debt, potentially leaving other creditors worse off. And political ones: the ECB cannot sustain huge intervention if Germany, its main shareholder, objects. Saving Spain will remain a short-term fix unless the euro zone genuinely unites around a plan that is economically sufficient and politically feasible. 
Unite or die 
Ultimately, as we have argued, a solution requires the currency's members to draw on their combined strength by mutualising some debt and standing behind their big banks. But alongside greater federalism, Europe also needs to do something about growth. Moderating austerity programmes is a priority (Spain shows how self-defeating they can be), but so is pursuing the structural reforms to set entrepreneurs free. Since 1975 the countries now in the euro zone have given birth to just one company currently among the world's 500 biggest (ironically it is from Spain: Inditex); by contrast California alone has created 26. Get rid of the mad rules that keep European business puny, and it could yet surprise everyone. 
That blueprint--greater federalism, a bail-out and pro-growth policies--would work, but it would take time. Even if the governments could today agree on what to do, haggling over the details, holding referendums and amending constitutions could easily take three years. The delay in even starting that process is only making a difficult task harder. 
The trouble is that the 17 members of the euro zone, let alone their 333m citizens, cannot agree on who must sacrifice what to allow this new Europe to emerge. Germany, which this week was warned of a possible debt downgrade, is fearful that it is already being asked to pay too much. The Dutch and the Finns are also getting cross. France differs from Germany on what changes are needed in the way the EU is run (see Charlemagne). As for the debtors, in Greece voters are drifting from the centre to the political extremes. In Italy Mario Monti is the best prime minister in decades, but he is unelected, increasingly unpopular, and ever less able to see through the reforms his country needs. Instead, Silvio Berlusconi is contemplating a comeback--and he is outshone by an (intentional) comedian, who commands a fifth of the vote in polls. 
The euro zone is stagnating (and dragging Britain down with it-- 
). The crisis is engendering a combination of public-sector austerity and private-sector uncertainty. Investors hold back because they perceive some risk of a huge loss. Consumers save for the next rainy day. For as long as the catastrophic collapse of the euro zone remains a real possibility, it is hard to see that changing. 
Perhaps the politicians will be shocked into action, by a euro-zone bank run, a chaotic Greek exit, or flight from Italian government debt. But Europe's leaders will find it increasingly hard to drag their people along with them. This is the deeper lesson of Spain's nightmare: delay is worsening the odds of the euro surviving.","Mariano Rajoy can be shored up for a while ; but Mariano Rajoy's woes contain an alarming lesson for the entire euro zone

THE loan package was meant to fix Spain's woes. But on July 20th, as the euro zone agreed a bail-out of up to EUR 100 billion ($121 billion) for its troubled banks, the country's borrowing costs rose dizzily. Five days later the yield on ten-year bonds hit an unsustainable 7.75%, while Madrid's stock exchange plunged to the levels of March 2003. Talk of a bail-out for the euro zone's fourth-biggest economy grew louder . It would cost a frightening EUR 385 billion to the end of 2014. 
What went wrong? On the day the bank bail-out was agreed, Valencia became the first of Spain's 17 semi-autonomous regions to admit that it needs government help. The region has long been run by the centre-right People's Party of Mariano Rajoy, the premier, but ministers were caught on the hop. With markets still open, petrol had been thrown onto the blaze of doubt about Spain's finances. 
A mix of recession, sinking property prices, bank failures and public profligacy--made worse by cronyism and corruption--is at the roots of Valencia's fall. But Comunitat Valenciana is by no means alone. It was soon followed by neighbouring Murcia, which will also apply for help from a special EUR 18 billion liquidity fund set up by the government. More worryingly, Ramon Luis Valcarcel, Murcia's president, admitted that this year it will probably once more miss its deficit target. 
Catalonia, the wealthy eastern region that accounts for one fifth of output, also suggested it needs the liquidity fund. Unable to roll over debt or finance deficit spending at sustainable levels on the markets, it is asking for help just when the central government is itself struggling to raise money at sustainable rates. More than a third of Spain's regions, which jointly spend some 40% of public money, may ultimately follow. 
Controlling regional-government deficits is one of Spain's biggest headaches. The regions' failure to control budgets defeated Spain's attempt to meet a 6% deficit target last year, leaving it at 8.9%. Regions, told to cut their combined deficit to 1.3% of GDP, instead increased it to 3.4%. Valencia was among the worst offenders. Its deficit climbed from 3.87% of regional GDP to 4.5%. Its debt is estimated to be 20% of regional GDP (see chart). 
Some regions are taking drastic steps. Valencia has announced plans to sack three-quarters of the staff (some 1,300 people) at its bloated regional broadcaster. Catalonia is on its fifth adjustment plan. But Juan Rubio-Ramirez, of the FEDEA think-tank's regional observatory, predicts that this year's overshoot will nevertheless produce a joint 2% deficit. 
Regional governments have every reason to behave. All had to present austerity budgets for the government's approval. Up to eight, reportedly, have already been warned that they are not sticking to them. Those who drift too far face being invaded by the so-called ""men in black""--budget ministry officials who will take direct control of their finances. 
The immediate outlook for Spain is deeply depressing. The government now sees recession stretching into 2013, with the economy shrinking by 0.5% next year. Unemployment, at 25% of the workforce, is unlikely to come down. A recent EUR 65 billion austerity package, which triggered widespread public protest, has failed to convince markets that Spain is getting its finances under control. 
Falling revenues and soaring bond yields are a toxic mixture. Mr Rajoy's reformist government is desperate, begging for more aid everywhere in Europe as it is applying painful austerity measures. Several ministers have been pleading for help from the European Central Bank (ECB). After the ECB declined to buy Spanish bonds, Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo, the foreign minister, branded the ECB a ""clandestine"" bank that is doing nothing to stop ""the fire of public debt"". 
As so often in this crisis, Italy seems to be following in Spain's footsteps. It, too, has problems with local as well as regional administrations. Two main dangers came into focus this week as mayors demonstrated outside parliament in Rome and the central government imposed radical measures on the government of indebted Sicily. The first worry is that provincial and municipal administrations might soon be knocking at the door of central government, demanding funds to meet their statutory obligations. A spokesman for Italy's local councils said ten municipalities were now facing bankruptcy. And a representative of the provinces warned there were schools that might be unable to reopen in the autumn for lack of funds--a claim dismissed by the education minister in Mario Monti's non-party government. 
The other, potentially greater, risk emanates from Sicily's precarious finances. On July 24th, after a meeting with Raffaele Lombardo, the governor of Sicily, Mr Monti acted to curb it. It was confirmed Mr Lombardo would resign at the end of the month and that Rome would enforce a plan to clean up the Sicilian government's accounts and sort out its administration. 
Sicily is one of five Italian regions (out of 20) with special statutes that give them ample autonomy. It has estimated debts of EUR 5.3 billion (though Mr Lombardo says the island is owed money, including by Rome). And Sicily is notorious for its extravagant administration. A report by the audit court last month found it had almost 18,000 employee--five times as many as the regional government of Lombardy, which has twice the population. The governor had a bigger staff than the British prime minister. 
How much cash Rome will need to put into Sicily remains to be seen. Mr Lombardo said he expected soon to receive transfers running to hundreds of millions of euros. But it is not clear how much had already been earmarked for the island. 
Are there other Sicilies waiting to be bailed out? Matteo Caroli of the LUISS university in Rome notes the central government has introduced draconian sanctions to force the regional administrations to balance their books. But, he adds, ""These are processes that require time"". And in southern Europe this week time appeared in alarmingly short supply.","The beleaguered governments in Madrid and Rome are battling with their highly indebted regions

IF SPAIN were a patient, the mood in the hospital ward would be tense. Every attempt by local specialists advised by renowned European consultants to treat the sickness brings no more than temporary relief. Even more worrying, the relapses after each dose are happening sooner and sooner. Spain's chances of avoiding intensive care--a full bail-out--are receding to near vanishing-point. 
The symptoms of Spanish sickness are manifest in ten-year government bond yields touching 7.75% on July 25th; previous bail-outs of Greece, Ireland and Portugal occurred not long after rates had surpassed 7%. Even more perturbing, two-year yields also briefly went above 7%, in effect foreclosing the government's ability to borrow at anything but short maturities. 
No isolation ward is possible in the financially integrated euro area and Spain's sickness quickly infected other countries. The Italian ten-year bond yield went above 6.5%, its highest since January. European stockmarkets retreated and Italy's fell to a euro-era low. Sentiment was further soured by a report from Moody's, a ratings agency, saying that Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands might lose their cherished triple-A status. The prognosis was based in part on fears about the public-debt burden that northern countries might have to assume if bail-outs spread. 
The market funk was the more troubling since a Spanish government with a lot going for it had appeared to be getting a grip. Public debt is rising fast, but at 69% of GDP last year was far lower than Italy's 120%--and less even than Germany's 81%. The budget deficit is high (8.9% of GDP in 2011), but only a week before the market panic Mariano Rajoy, the prime minister, announced more tough austerity measures. And on July 20th European finance ministers sanctioned the first tranche of a partial bail-out worth up to EUR 100 billion ($121 billion) for Spanish banks. 
So why are investors in such a cold sweat about Spain? One reason is that Mr Rajoy flunked hard choices at the outset, notably the cleansing of the banks. Despite a low starting-point for public debt, deficit overshoots have revealed insufficient central control over the 17 regions that are responsible for a big chunk of spending. Investors fret that more regions may follow Valencia, which applied for aid on July 20th. They are in any case sceptical that Spain can meet its targets for cutting the deficit in the teeth of a recession that is harsher than expected. 
The biggest worry is Spain's external debt. Spain ran hefty current-account deficits in the first decade of the euro. As a result, its liabilities to foreign investors exceeded the assets that its residents own abroad by 92% of GDP last year, among the highest in the euro area. The problem for Spain is that foreign capital has been fleeing over the past year. That has weakened the banks and the economy and left the Spanish government shunned by foreign investors for its own financing needs. 
The European summit in late June offered a flicker of hope but it is guttering. Euro-area leaders agreed that the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), their new permanent rescue fund, would be able to inject funds directly into banks rather than via loans to the government. That perked markets up since it promised to sever the link between weak banks and weak sovereigns. But before long the deal looked less solid: the ESM cannot come into force until September, when Germany's constitutional court will rule on its legality. Assuming it passes that test, the ESM cannot be used for direct bank recapitalisation until a European supervisor is put in charge. 
Spain may yet be able to fend off a bail-out for some time. It has some cash reserves and can still borrow at short maturities. The euro area also has its temporary rescue fund, which will lend the Spanish government the initial sum of money for the banks. But even if Spain survives a hot summer, the markets are signalling that it will need a full bail-out later this year. 
That would be a nightmare, and not just for Spain. The Spanish government must borrow EUR 385 billion until the end of 2014 to cover its budget deficit and other needs such as bond redemptions, according to economists at Credit Suisse. Even if the IMF chips in a third as in previous bail-outs, European lenders would have to find EUR 250 billion or so. They have already committed EUR 100 billion to rescuing Spanish banks, so for other emergencies they would have only EUR 150 billion of the EUR 500 billion now in their rescue kitties. 
The course of events is eerily similar to what happened a year ago. Then European leaders appeared to have secured their summer holidays with a ""breakthrough"" summit. But things soon fell apart. Nerves about Italy and Spain were calmed only when the European Central Bank (ECB) started buying their bonds. The central bank was never keen on this and it has not been buying bonds for several months. Even if the ECB were to resume purchases they might be less effective than before, because its refusal to share in the pain of the Greek debt restructuring in March frightened bondholders elsewhere. 
The awkward truth is that the Spanish government is not alone in flunking hard choices. The plight of Spain and the danger of its sickness spreading to Italy call for a decisive countermove by Germany and the ECB. One being discussed would be to give the ESM a banking licence, which would magnify its resources by allowing it to borrow from the central bank. The graver the euro crisis gets, the bigger the response has to be--and the harder it is to sell to sceptical northern electorates.","A full bail - out of the euro area 's fourth - largest economy is looming 
 IF SPAIN were a patient , the mood in the hospital ward would be tense . Every attempt by local specialists advised by renowned European consultants to treat the sickness brings no more than temporary relief . Even more worrying , the relapses after each dose are happening sooner and sooner . Spain 's chances of avoiding intensive care -- a full bail - out -- are receding to near vanishing - point . 
 The symptoms of Spanish sickness are manifest in ten - year government bond yields touching 7.75 % on July 25th ; previous bail - outs of Greece , Ireland and Portugal occurred not long after rates had surpassed 7 % . Even more perturbing , two - year yields also briefly went above 7 % , in effect foreclosing the government 's ability to borrow at anything but short maturities . 
 No isolation ward is possible in the financially integrated euro area and Spain 's sickness quickly infected other countries . The Italian ten - year bond yield went above 6.5 % , its highest since January . European stockmarkets retreated and Italy 's fell to a euro - era low . Sentiment was further soured by a report from Moody 's , a ratings agency , saying that Germany , Luxembourg and the Netherlands might lose their cherished triple - A status . The prognosis was based in part on fears about the public - debt burden that northern countries might have to assume if bail - outs spread . 
 The market funk was the more troubling since a Spanish government with a lot going for it had appeared to be getting a grip . Public debt is rising fast , but at 69 % of GDP last year was far lower than Italy 's 120%--and less even than Germany 's 81 % . The budget deficit is high ( 8.9 % of GDP in 2011 ) , but only a week before the market panic Mariano Rajoy announced more tough austerity measures . And on July 20th European finance ministers sanctioned the first tranche of a partial bail - out worth up to EUR 100 billion ( $ 121 billion ) for Spanish banks . 
 So why are investors in such a cold sweat about Spain ? One reason is that Mariano Rajoy flunked hard choices at the outset , notably the cleansing of the banks . Despite a low starting - point for public debt , deficit overshoots have revealed insufficient central control over the 17 regions that are responsible for a big chunk of spending . Investors fret that more regions may follow Valencia , which applied for aid on July 20th . They are in any case sceptical that Spain can meet its targets for cutting the deficit in the teeth of a recession that is harsher than expected . 
 The biggest worry is Spain 's external debt . Spain ran hefty current - account deficits in the first decade of the euro . As a result , its liabilities to foreign investors exceeded the assets that its residents own abroad by 92 % of GDP last year , among the highest in the euro area . The problem for Spain is that foreign capital has been fleeing over the past year . That has weakened the banks and the economy and left the Spanish government shunned by foreign investors for its own financing needs . 
 The European summit in late June offered a flicker of hope but it is guttering . Euro - area leaders agreed that the European Stability Mechanism ( ESM ) , their new permanent rescue fund , would be able to inject funds directly into banks rather than via loans to the government . That perked markets up since it promised to sever the link between weak banks and weak sovereigns . But before long the deal looked less solid : the ESM can not come into force until September , when Germany 's constitutional court will rule on its legality . Assuming it passes that test , the ESM can not be used for direct bank recapitalisation until a European supervisor is put in charge .

IT IS holiday time, but Madrid's streets are unusually busy for August. As fear grips Spanish consumers, one half of madrile nos are hoarding euros and plan to stay at home to brave the cauldron of heat. Confidence has hit rock bottom, reflecting 25% unemployment and a double-dip recession that will drag on to 2013. Talk of an autumn bail-out and worries that this might spark a wider euro-zone meltdown make Spaniards glummer. 
Spain's painful deleveraging process may last for years. Among mature economies, it has the third-highest total debt as a share of GDP--behind only Japan and Britain. Many Spaniards wish they had saved more and borrowed less before a property bubble burst four years ago. 
But some who carefully shepherded their euros into savings instruments recommended by local bank managers are now wishing they had joined the big spenders. Many of these savers now look set to be hammered for lending to their banks in the form of risky hybrid ""preference"" shares. This subordinated debt is now in the sights of euro bail-out enforcers as Spanish banks take up to EUR 100 billion ($123 billion) from rescue funds. 
Spain may have to impose losses on retail clients lured by high interest rates into buying products they now claim not to have understood. Struggling to find funds as they sank into a sea of toxic property loans, Spain's ailing savings banks sold preference shares aggressively. Branch managers cold-called lifelong clients. This complex and risky hybrid of debt and equity was sometimes sold as a safe investment. Tales abound of contracts signed by frail pensioners with poor eyesight. 
Courts and arbitrators have told some banks to hand the money back. The bailed-out Novacaixagalicia has offered a public apology, but losses may see furious customers abandon already fragile banks. Around 60% of subordinated Spanish bank debt, excluding the healthy Santander and BBVA, is held by retail investors. The number of small savers involved makes it different to bailed-out Ireland, where subordinated debt holders took losses of up to 80%. The economy minister says preference shares should never have been sold to retail savers but agrees that bank investors must bear some losses. The opposition Socialists want a distinction between savers (who should be saved) and investors (who should not). Not everyone is sympathetic, pointing to interest rates on the bonds of 7%. 
Any hit taken by small savers will be a further blow to the People's Party (PP) government of Mariano Rajoy, the prime minister, as it imposes more austerity to reduce the budget deficit. Support for the PP has slumped by eight points, to 37%, since the party won an absolute parliamentary majority in last November's election. That helps explain why Mr Rajoy's government is negotiating hard to soften the blow on preference-share holders--and why it has prolonged a temporary EUR 400 a month payment to the long-term unemployed. 
Trouble is also building in the regions. Mr Rajoy threatens to take direct financial control of some of the country's 17 regional governments, which spend 40% of public money, if they fail to meet strict deficit targets. One region, Murcia, has already publicly admitted that may be impossible this year. Leaders of at least one other big region say the same in private. 
A decades-long process of regional devolution may thus go into reverse, changing the tide of Spain's democratic history. The Catalan leader, Artur Mas, a nationalist, has already threatened a snap election if the men in black arrive from Madrid to take control of his government's finances. Bond markets are asking when and how Spain will grow again. It may be holiday time, but Mr Rajoy cannot relax.","A proposed hit to savers increases the government 's unpopularity

WILL Spain be next? The Spanish government is trying to put off a full bail-out, but it was dealt a blow on August 28th when the regional government of Catalonia said it needed a EUR 5 billion ($6.3 billion) rescue by the Madrid government. 
First it was the banks that needed help, now Spain's second-most populous region. Bailing out Catalonia may well cost more than the requested EUR 5 billion: it may need several billion just to cover the budget deficit until the end of 2014. A government liquidity fund has EUR 18 billion in it, but Valencia, Murcia and other regions that are excluded from the markets are also queuing up for money. Spain can top up the fund by borrowing more--but only at punishing rates. The yield on ten-year bonds has stayed above 6% for more than three months. 
Not surprisingly, many think Spain will eventually need a sovereign bail-out. In public, officials claim this is not being negotiated. European leaders instead praise the reforms and austerity of Mariano Rajoy, the prime minister. Yet Spain is plunging into a double-dip recession. The economy shrank at an annual rate of 1.3% in the second quarter. Bank deposits dropped by 4.7% in July. Consumption is falling at an annual rate of 3.9%. Unemployment remains stuck at around 25% of the workforce (and 50% for youths). 
Meanwhile in bailed-out Greece the government was relieved when the first trip abroad of Antonis Samaras as prime minister went better than expected. It helped that in Berlin Mr Samaras swallowed a sizeable chunk of humble pie before Chancellor Angela Merkel. Things were easier in Paris where Francois Hollande, the French president, made reassuring noises about Greece's chances of remaining in the euro zone. 
Even so, in both capitals, Mr Samaras's talk of needing ""a breathing space"" of two more years until 2016 to turn round the economy while completing reforms agreed with the European Union and IMF, was quickly dismissed. The message from Mrs Merkel and Mr Hollande was that Athens must deliver on fiscal austerity, privatisation and tax collection before asking its international creditors for more favours. 
The task ahead looks daunting. Greece had planned to put together the new EUR 11.5 billion package of spending cuts by the end of July. Yet the finance ministry team was still battling to finish the final draft at the end of August, even as officials from the EU and IMF were flying in to make their assessment. The choices are tough. On August 27th, Yannis Stournaras, the finance minister, failed to win agreement from the Greek military's top brass and police chiefs for a 5-6% cut in officers' salaries. Until now the guardians of the Greek state have kept almost all their perks. If his opponents refuse to back down, Mr Stournaras will be forced to make deeper cuts in pensions, which have already been pared back by more than 20% in the past two years. 
More hurdles lie ahead before Greece can draw the next EUR 32 billion of its second bail-out loan to finance the budget and to recapitalise its troubled banks. The loan tranche was due to be paid in June but will now not be transferred before late October. A favourable report from the ""troika"" of officials from the EU, IMF and European Central Bank is needed; Greece's parliament must approve the new package; and finance ministers of euro-zone countries must give the go-ahead, before the loan is endorsed by EU leaders at their summit in October. With barely enough cash in its coffers to pay pensions and public-sector salaries at the end of August, the finance ministry may raise short-term funds by selling extra treasury bills to the banks, squeezing cash-strapped local companies even harder. Greece is still searching for a way out of its labyrinth.","As Greece fights to stay in the euro, Spain moves closer to a bail-out

WHEN history books trace the evolution of the euro crisis, September 2012 will mark the beginning of a new chapter. Recent days have seen decisive moves from Europe's notoriously incremental policymaking machinery. On September 12th Germany's constitutional court backed the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), the euro zone's permanent rescue fund, removing the last big hurdle to its launch. The same day, the European Commission laid out a blueprint for joint European banking supervision, the first step to a banking union. Days earlier the European Central Bank (ECB) announced that, under certain conditions, it would buy unlimited amounts of the bonds of troubled euro-zone countries. 
Taken together, these actions mark a big change. At best, they constitute the foundations of a more sustainable monetary union. The euro zone now has a plan for bank supervision. It will be haggled over and watered-down, but the record of European diplomacy suggests that once proposals exist, something, eventually, tends to be agreed on . Most important, the euro zone now has a central bank committed to being a lender of last resort. Yes, the commitment is conditional on countries securing help from, and adhering to, a rescue plan.

The hope is that this marks the beginning of the end of the euro crisis. In the best possible outcome, the ECB's pledge, by itself, will push euro-zone debt markets into a positive cycle--one where yields on sovereign debt in peripheral economies fall as investors lower the probability of the euro's collapse, and as yields fall those countries' debt dynamics and economic prospects improve.

Given the state of Spain's banks, and the weakness of its economy and public finances, that seems implausible.

The ESM would help fund any new government borrowing, while the ECB would buy bonds in the secondary market. Both routes would keep a cap on bond yields. And both vehicles would be a backdoor route to a limited form of debt mutualisation--another necessary condition for the euro zone's future. Euro-zone countries are jointly liable both for the rescue funds and the central bank's balance-sheet. It may be less elegant than Alexander Hamilton's plan for assuming the states' debts in America in 1789, but some think the ingredients of a solution to the euro-zone debt crisis are now in place. 
This newspaper would be delighted if that turned out to be the case. We have long argued that the single currency needs a lender of last resort, a banking union and limited debt mutualisation.

Sadly, a lot could still go wrong. When a euro-zone country falls short on reform, will the central bank stop buying its bonds?

The ECB, fearing a political backlash or growing internal divisions on its own board, may shrink from the necessary boldness. Yet if it holds back from loosening monetary policy, the region's economic prospects will darken further. 
These tensions are inevitable as long as the actions of the central bank are a substitute for more explicit political progress on integration. That's why Europe's politicians--led by Germany and France--must catch up with their central bank. They should quickly agree on rules for common financial supervision, and make credible plans for common deposit insurance and bank resolution. They must hash out other ways of fiscal risk-sharing. And they will need to explain the grand strategy to voters, who ought to be consulted on such a big change.

Where to, is not yet clear 
WHEN history books trace the evolution of the euro crisis, September 2012 will mark the beginning of a new chapter. Recent days have seen decisive moves from Europe's notoriously incremental policymaking machinery. On September 12th Germany's constitutional court backed the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), the euro zone's permanent rescue fund, removing the last big hurdle to its launch. The same day, the European Commission laid out a blueprint for joint European banking supervision, the first step to a banking union. Days earlier the European Central Bank (ECB) announced that, under certain conditions, it would buy unlimited amounts of the bonds of troubled euro-zone countries. 
Taken together, these actions mark a big change. At best, they constitute the foundations of a more sustainable monetary union. The euro zone now has a plan for bank supervision. It will be haggled over and watered-down, but the record of European diplomacy suggests that once proposals exist, something, eventually, tends to be agreed on . Most important, the euro zone now has a central bank committed to being a lender of last resort. Yes, the commitment is conditional on countries securing help from, and adhering to, a rescue plan. But the ECB has made clear, for the first time, that it is willing to intervene without limit if need be. 
The hope is that this marks the beginning of the end of the euro crisis. In the best possible outcome, the ECB's pledge, by itself, will push euro-zone debt markets into a positive cycle--one where yields on sovereign debt in peripheral economies fall as investors lower the probability of the euro's collapse, and as yields fall those countries' debt dynamics and economic prospects improve.

IT WAS designed to rescue Spain and, as a result, the euro. So why has the government in Madrid not immediately jumped into the life raft built by Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, with his bond-buying plan? The answer has a name: Mariano Rajoy, the country's studiously enigmatic prime minister. 
First, Mr Rajoy continues to pretend that Spain might not need a bail-out. ""Before taking a decision we must see whether it is really necessary,"" he said recently. Few Spaniards are fooled. Mr Draghi's announcement has pushed bond yields to levels lower than when Mr Rajoy's centre-right People's Party won power in November. But that will not hold for ever. Spain's economic mess--a combination of ailing banks, double-dip recession and 25% unemployment--is getting worse. Mr Rajoy's labour and other reforms may eventually help, but in the meantime, the patient needs an emergency infusion. 
Second, Mr Rajoy knows that Spaniards will find the tutelage humiliating. Polls show his government losing a third of its support in just six months. In Greece, Ireland and Portugal bailed-out governments were quickly ejected. This explains why Mr Rajoy's government--despite a solid parliamentary majority and four more years in power--does not dare to use the B-word. 
Third, Mr Rajoy claims that Spain does not need to be told what to do. He insists his government will manage to cut a budget deficit that hit 8.9% of GDP last year. And this, he tells Spaniards who have already seen EUR 90 billion ($116 billion) of belt-tightening spread over several years, is because he himself believes in it--and not because heavyweights in Brussels or Frankfurt demand it. He will have a chance to prove this commitment on September 27th, when the budget for 2013 will be unveiled. To meet a 4.5% deficit target set by the EU, his government will have to find further savings or additional revenue of at least EUR 20 billion. A further difficulty is that Catalonia's demand for a revenue rebate has become harder to ignore: this week hundreds of thousands rallied in Barcelona to demand independence. 
Mr Rajoy has already cut spending to the bone and increased taxes. So what is left? He has promised not to cut pensions, although they might have to be frozen, making pensioners lose in real terms as inflation and taxes eat into purchasing power. Hikes in green and capital-gains taxes are also in the offing. Portugal, which on September 7th decided to raise individuals' contributions towards social security, has shown another avenue for increasing revenues. 
Nothing changes the fact that Spain is bound for a bail-out. What will its rescuers demand? Not much more than Spain has already signed up to, according to Olli Rehn, the European commissioner for economic affairs. But the sequence of events matters. Whereas Mr Rajoy insists on being told the conditions first, Mr Rehn says a country must ask for help before these are worked out. 
The biggest question concerns timing. Opponents accuse the prime minister of trying to delay the bail-out until after elections in Galicia on October 21st. It may, however, come far sooner. Much depends on what euro-zone finance ministers say at their meeting on September 14th. The inscrutable Mr Rajoy will keep everyone guessing until the end.","Spain is going to have a bail - out .

MARIO DRAGHI seems more sorcerer than central banker. Since the boss of the European Central Bank (ECB) said in late July that he would do ""whatever it takes"" to save the euro, Spanish two-year bond yields have fallen from 7% to 3%. Equity markets have rallied; credit-default-swap spreads have tightened (see chart); and the euro has climbed. 
On September 6th Mr Draghi delivered another boost to confidence when he spelt out the details of his plan to buy bonds of struggling countries. There was more good news on September 12th when the German constitutional court sanctioned Germany's participation in the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), the euro area's permanent rescue fund, without imposing onerous reservations. For the time being, the euro crisis is in remission. 
The hope is that the ECB's pledge to act will be enough in itself to keep yields low and buy time for peripheral euro-zone economies. Such hopes have been dashed before. The ECB has been buying sovereign bonds since May 2010 through its Securities Markets Programme (SMP), supposedly for monetary purposes but in reality to bring down yields in places like Italy and Spain. Mr Draghi said that the SMP, which has been in abeyance most of this year, was being closed, although that leaves it with a stock of debt worth EUR 209 billion ($270 billion). In its place comes another catchily named programme: Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT). 
In one way, the OMT initiative is more restricted than the SMP, which did not specify maturities. The new purchases will be confined to debt with a residual maturity of up to three years. But there is one crucial difference. The purchases will be unlimited; in bank-speak, there will be no prior ""quantitative limits"". The ECB has not specified yield caps but it is determined to bring yields down from levels that reflect fears of a euro-zone break-up. It is this commitment to intervene without limit that has cowed speculators hoping to profit from bond-market distress. Who would bet against a central bank that can conjure money from thin air? 
In another difference from the SMP approach, the new bond-buying will happen only for states--which will almost certainly end up including Spain and quite probably Italy--that have secured assistance from the ESM. But in return for such help, which could see the rescue fund buying newly issued debt, governments would have to accept strict conditions on economic and fiscal policy. Only then will the ECB be prepared to act. 
Mr Draghi's plan has raised hopes that it may mark the start of the end of the euro crisis. But these hopes may be short-lived. Charles Wyplosz of the Graduate Institute in Geneva applauds the fact that the ECB under Mr Draghi's leadership has accepted its responsibility to act as a lender of last resort to governments, but says that without other measures, such as writing down excessive debt in some countries and ending austerity, the crisis will flare up again. 
And the plan could trip up on a number of ""implementation risks"", points out Moritz Kraemer of Standard & Poor's, a ratings agency. A first hurdle is Spanish politics. If the strategy is to work, Mariano Rajoy, Spain's prime minister, will have to swallow his pride and accept the need for a sovereign as well as a banking bail-out. Next, there is an inherent inconsistency in the ECB's stance. Would it really pull the rug out from under a country that fails to comply with conditions, given that this would exacerbate its plight and revive fears of euro-zone fragmentation? The fact that Jens Weidmann, head of the German Bundesbank, opposes bond purchases casts a long shadow over the ECB's plan. And Greece retains its capacity for trouble. Mr Draghi's magic is powerful, but it won't work without help from the politicians.

THE banner in Barcelona's central Placa de Catalunya square reads: ""Catalonia, next independent state in Europe"". After a huge, peaceful march with flags and banners through the city on September 11th brought together an estimated 8% of the region's 7.5m population, a once-exotic idea has suddenly come to life. 
Artur Mas, the Catalan nationalist leader of the regional government, publicly backed the marchers. ""This cannot be ignored,"" he said. ""Catalonia needs a state."" In one recent opinion poll, 51% of Catalans say they would vote yes to independence. Even some non-separatists now believe a referendum is needed. Yet Spain's constitution does not allow splits and that is setting the country and its wealthiest region on a collision course. 
Mr Mas has been overtaken by events. Nobody expected the marchers to be so numerous (Barcelona's La Vanguardia, a daily, sells ""I was there"" photo CD-ROMs). He was already due to meet Mariano Rajoy, the Spanish prime minister, on September 20th to demand a long-term tax rebate. Mr Rajoy, more worried by a recession that has left a quarter of Spaniards out of work, had been expected to hoof the idea into the long grass. Independence gets even shorter shrift. ""The reply is in the constitution and our laws,"" said Mr Rajoy. These could be changed, but only with difficulty and a bitter debate. Yet a no to his tax demands now would boost separatist sentiment further, Mr Mas warns. If snubbed, he may call elections, which would become a vote on independence. 
Separatists are excited, though the polls are misleading. Whereas one-third of Catalans are convinced separatists, many others are simply enraged by their tax money propping up poorer regions. Eight percent of Catalan GDP, or EUR 16 billion ($21 billion) a year, is siphoned off, they claim. As regional health and education cuts in Catalonia bite, they feel mugged. 
No one now doubts that Mr Mas's once-ambiguous Democratic Catalan Convergence party seeks independence in the long term, but it tends to negotiate incremental advances. Its middle-class voters instinctively hate confrontation. ""It is like wanting to leave home without making Daddy angry,"" says Pilar Rahola, a former separatist deputy. And they hate instability. Memories of a civil war in the 1930s, in which separatism loomed large, are too painful. That is why Mr Mas recoils from the independentista or secessionist tags. ""I am a sovereigntist,"" he explains, adding that nobody is independent within the European Union. 
A smooth transition to separate EU membership would require rule changes in Brussels and Madrid. They may never come. In the short-term Mr Mas demands a radical, but initially financially neutral, change to the tax system--allowing his government to collect taxes and send them to Madrid, rather than the other way around. Catalonia could later cut its contribution. For nationalists, this would be another step towards independence. 
A third way, proposed by local socialists, is a new federation in which Catalans would negotiate a special bilateral relationship with other Spaniards. Some 28% of Catalans prefer that. A ""no"" vote at referendum would take much, but not all, of the sting out of Catalan complaints. 
Francesc de Carreras at the Barcelona Autonomous University, an anti-secessionist, says a vote would allow a proper debate and add democratic weight to decision-making. Canada's 2000 Clarity Act, allowing Quebec to vote first and negotiate after, provides a model. 
Regional governments, which spend almost 40% of public money, blithely ignored deficit targets last year. This year they will still push Spain some 0.7 points above its 6.3% GDP target, set in Brussels, predicts FEDEA, a think-tank. Mr Rajoy passed a law allowing the centre to intervene in the finances of poorly performing regions. The prime minister may now be too scared to use it. 
The direct causes of Catalonia's economic woes are recession and ruinous administration by previous regional governments. Independence does not change that. It's not yet clear whether separatists are, as Spain's king claims, merely ""chimera chasers"".","A row about money and sovereignty

THE indignados who took to the streets of Spain in 2011 belied their name by being rather meek and just a little nerdy. One of their most passionate demands was for Spanish elections to involve more proportional representation. But today, after a year of austerity, Spaniards have cast off their restraint. Rowdy protests in Madrid and growing pressure for independence in Catalonia leave Spain at the mercy of dangerous forces, just when trouble is flaring up elsewhere in the euro zone . Investors have taken flight. Unless the Spanish prime minister and his counterparts around Europe act, the single currency itself will once again soon be at risk. 
On September 25th police used rubber bullets and truncheons on protesters who had formed a human chain around the Cortes, the parliament in Madrid. Unusually for Spain, the demonstration led to injuries and arrests. That same day Catalonia's president said that his region would hold early elections, on November 25th. Because the vote comes after the rejection by Mariano Rajoy, Spain's prime minister, of Catalonia's demand for more control over taxation, it will be seen as a gauge of the region's appetite for secession. 
All this hits Spain at a bad time. Its recession has no end in sight. Judging by the fiscal balance at the end of August, the government will far exceed its deficit target of 6.3% of GDP in 2012. As The Economist went to press, the government was due to announce further austerity and structural reforms, as well as details of the latest scheme to recapitalise the country's ailing banks. Mass protests will only make Mr Rajoy's plans harder to implement. Catalonia accounts for a fifth of the Spanish economy; the region is the biggest contributor to the central government's budget. Secession risks plunging what is left of Spain into bankruptcy. 
Damage to Catalonia 
Full-blown Catalonian independence won't happen soon, if it happens at all. But even a tussle over autonomy would create prolonged uncertainty just when Spain needs to reassure the bond markets and fellow euro-zone governments that its problems are in hand. Catalans have genuine grievances--over a constitutional reform that was watered down by the courts as well as the fairness of its contributions--but their region is bankrupt, too, and its economy depends on trade with the rest of Spain. By choosing to take on Mr Rajoy right now, Catalans are playing with fire. 
That, though, does not let the prime minister off the hook. Regionalism in Spain is an expression of discontent, much as support for populists is elsewhere in Europe. Despite having a commanding majority and unprecedented control over the regions, Mr Rajoy has been a disappointment. He has wasted precious time, lacked ambition and failed to convince his people that he holds the solutions to their problems. 
Mr Rajoy's best weapon against regional fission is to make central government work. He should accept that Spain will need the support of the European Central Bank--which means submitting the country to an official rescue programme. Mr Rajoy fears the loss of face, but the alternative is greater humiliation for less benefit later, when Spain is in deeper trouble and his own authority is further diminished. Until this week, European policymakers thought that the euro crisis was under control at last (see Charlemagne). Spain's new indignados have shattered that illusion.","With protests and a secessionist threat , Spain 's problems are growing . Better a bail - out now than later

THE sugar-rush brought on by the European Central Bank's pledge to intervene in bond markets to help troubled euro-zone countries--some diplomats call it ""Mario Draghi's ice cream""--was bound to fade at some point. But nobody expected it to fade quite so suddenly this week. 
Anti-austerity protests in Spain and Greece, uncertainty over their bail-out terms, the resurgence of Catalan secessionism, the likely departure of Mario Monti as Italy's prime minister next year, obstacles to creating a credible banking union (see Charlemagne) and a darkening economic outlook all combined to dispel hope that the euro zone was out of the woods. Spanish and Italian bond yields shot back up and European stockmarkets fell. 
The summer's panic about the euro zone had been assuaged by the ECB's announcement of plans to buy unlimited amounts of short-dated debt of vulnerable countries such as Spain and Italy. This backstop would depend on their governments first seeking assistance from the euro-zone rescue funds, and then submitting to a formal, externally monitored reform programme. 
Both out of national pride, and because Germany does not want Spain to ask for more money, the Spanish government has hesitated about taking the ECB's outstretched hand. Behind European officials' public praise for the deficit-cutting measures taken by Mariano Rajoy, the Spanish prime minister, there is dismay over his ineptness in handling the crisis, not least the ever-changing estimates of the money needed to recapitalise Spain's banks. 
As The Economist went to press, Mr Rajoy was due to unveil a budget for next year and a new set of structural reforms, as well as the results of a detailed assessment of Spain's bank-recapitalisation needs. These have been co-ordinated with European officials, perhaps to allow Mr Rajoy to claim that Spain will face no fresh conditions beyond the ones he has announced himself. But the gains from any such choreography have been offset by clashes on the streets of Madrid during anti-austerity protests and by the resurgence of Catalan nationalism. Mr Rajoy's attempt to rein in spending in Spain's autonomous regions has prompted Artur Mas, the president of Catalonia, to call an election on November 25th, after his demand for more tax autonomy was rebuffed. Mr Mas is talking of holding a referendum on independence, which could throw Spain into a constitutional crisis on top of its economic one. 
If Mr Rajoy's stock in European capitals has fallen, that of Antonis Samaras, the Greek prime minister, has risen. Once reviled for resisting austerity while in opposition, the conservative leader has, since his election in June, impressed fellow leaders with a new-found zeal for fiscal discipline and reform. Yet it will be hard to reconcile Mr Samaras's call for an extra two years to bring down the deficit with creditors' refusal to lend him more money, in effect a third bail-out. 
Mr Samaras is caught between the rescuers' demands for more spending cuts and boiling anger on the streets. Police fired tear gas at hooded protesters hurling petrol bombs on September 26th, the day of a general strike, while tens of thousands of demonstrators outside the Greek parliament shouted ""EU, IMF Out!"". European officials say much now depends on whether, after some massaging of Greece's figures, the IMF can be cajoled into declaring its gargantuan debt to be ""sustainable"". The fund, for its part, is privately urging euro-zone countries to write off some of their loans to Greece, but that is unlikely until after Germany's election next year. 
In Italy there is nervousness about the course of still-fragile reforms after the technocratic prime minister, Mario Monti, declared that he would not seek to stay in office beyond general elections due next spring. Mr Monti told CNN: ""I think it's important that the whole political game resumes in Italy, hopefully with a higher degree of responsibility and maturity."" Given Italy's politics, and the reforms that Italy still has to undertake, that is asking a lot. 
Confidence in the future of the euro is hardly being helped by signs that Germany and other creditor countries are backtracking on last June's summit deal to create a new euro-zone bank supervisor and, thereafter, to recapitalise troubled banks directly, in countries such as Spain and Italy, with money from a euro-zone rescue fund. Along with the Netherlands and Finland, Germany now wants direct recapitalisation to exclude ""legacy"" assets. Karl Whelan, a prominent Irish economist, summed it up with a blog post headlined: ""Germany to Spain and Ireland: drop dead"".","After a few sunny weeks , a political and economic storm is battering the euro zone once again

A GALICIAN, the Spanish like to quip, is the sort of person you meet on the stairs and you don't know whether he is going up or coming down. Such ambiguity, or retranca, can make for entertaining and ironic speech, and an attitude of caution, even suspicion. For Mariano Rajoy, the Galician-born Spanish prime minister, playing to this archetype is a way to survive and manage conflicting demands. Whether it is the character trait Spain needs to overcome its agony is open to doubt. 
Mr Rajoy frustrates many with his prevarication over a fresh euro-zone bail-out, which now comes with a conditional promise from the European Central Bank (ECB) to help bring down Spain's stifling borrowing costs. France wants him to take the money; Germany tells him not to. Before walking through the door Mr Rajoy wants to know that Germany won't shut it on his fingers, and to be sure about what lies beyond. What will the ECB do, and what conditions will be imposed on Spain? Asked this week about a leaked report that a bail-out request could be imminent, Mr Rajoy responded with Galician retranca. There are two options, he said: either the news agency is right, and it has better sources than the prime minister, or it is wrong. ""I will tell you 'No'. But you can still think what you deem best, because you may guess right."" So did he really say no, or was it a yes? 
Many wonder whether Mr Rajoy has any strategy to restore confidence in markets and among Spaniards. With a deficit of about 9% of GDP last year, an unemployment rate surpassing 25% and a protest movement that is showing flashes of violence, some worry that Spain is being sucked into a Greek-style death spiral. Others are convinced that the Spanish public sector still has much fat, that unemployment statistics are inflated and that the shock-absorber of Spanish society, the family, remains strong. Still, Mr Rajoy's problems are getting worse, not better. 
On top of the economic crisis, he must now confront an unexpected constitutional one. Mr Rajoy's attempt to rein in spending in Spain's highly autonomous regions, which provide big-ticket services like health and education, has rekindled nationalism in Catalonia, one of Spain's most indebted regions, and one of the biggest net contributors. A surprisingly large pro-independence rally in Barcelona last month saw banners proclaiming Catalonia as the next member of the EU. The region's president, Artur Mas, thwarted in his demand for a better fiscal deal, raised the stakes by calling early elections on November 25th and threatening a ballot on the right to self-determination. This weekend's ""El Clasico"", the football derby between the old rivals FC Barcelona and Real Madrid, will be more emotionally charged than ever. Nobody quite knows where the nationalist surge will lead; Mr Mas himself is vague about his ultimate objective. 
So the mysterious Mr Rajoy must seek to avert twin tail-risks: the break-up of the euro zone on the rocks of Spain, and the break-up of Spain itself. A former land registrar and ex-minister, Mr Rajoy was defeated in 2004 and 2008 by the Socialist leader, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, but came to power with a thumping majority for his conservative People's Party in last November's election. Mr Zapatero had long lived in denial about the bursting of Spain's vast property bubble. But Mr Rajoy hardly hurried to repair the damage. He waited for the end of the month-long transition to name a cabinet, with a messy two-headed economic team. He irritated leaders at his first European summit in March by unexpectedly announcing he would miss his deficit targets (though these were later relaxed). And he dragged his feet until April before producing his first budget. 
One reason for the poor start is that Mr Rajoy delayed bad news in the hope of delivering the estocada, the matador's final sword thrust, to the Socialists in regional elections in their heartland of Andalusia. In the event they kept Andalusia, while Mr Rajoy skewered his own credibility. Last month was, at last, supposed to be his moment of clarity: with the help of external consultants Spain announced its banks needed about EUR 40 billion ($51 billion) of public money (well below the EUR 100 billion already offered by the euro zone), produced a plan to clean up the sector, drew up a budget to bring the deficit down to 4.5% of GDP next year and launched a new round of structural reforms. Yet some analysts still question whether the banks' stress-tests were stressful enough. And there was disbelief about the government's budget based on a contraction of just 0.5% next year; most independent analysts forecast a drop two or three times larger. 
Is Mr Rajoy again playing local politics ahead of this month's elections in his native Galicia, or of the inevitable bail-out? Perish the thought, say senior Spanish officials: there are no more secrets in the banks, and the optimistic outlook rests on the predicted success of recent reforms (eg, to make the labour market more flexible) and scores of new ones to be adopted in the coming year. 
The chain of fiscal command 
Fetters of budgetary control now run from Brussels to Madrid and on to Barcelona, but they have not so far unleashed resentment of the European idea. For Spain, European integration has been an intrinsic part of democratic transition after the dictatorship of General Francisco Franco. For Catalan nationalists, Europe offers the hope of a painless separation from Spain. Mr Mas has told followers to vote without fear. No one could ""use weapons"" to stop them. 
Lore has it that Spain's most notorious Galician, the Generalisimo Franco, saw only two kinds of problems: those that time would fix and those that not even time could solve. Mr Rajoy should shun this mindset. His quiet manner will help Spain if it cools passions, but not if it serves to put off choices that are only becoming harder.","Mariano Rajoy's battles against the break - up of the euro and Mariano Rajoy's country

Mr Zapatero had long lived in denial about the bursting of Spain 's vast property bubble . But Mariano Rajoy hardly hurried to repair the damage . Mariano Rajoy waited for the end of the month - long transition to name a cabinet , with a messy two - headed economic team . Mariano Rajoy irritated leaders at Mariano Rajoy's first European summit in March by unexpectedly announcing Mariano Rajoy would miss Mariano Rajoy's deficit targets ( though these were later relaxed ) . And Mariano Rajoy dragged Mariano Rajoy's feet until April before producing Mariano Rajoy's first budget . 
 One reason for the poor start is that Mariano Rajoy delayed bad news in the hope of delivering the estocada , the matador 's final sword thrust , to the Socialists in regional elections in their heartland of Andalusia . In the event they kept Andalusia , while Mariano Rajoy skewered Mariano Rajoy's own credibility . Last month was , at last , supposed to be Mariano Rajoy's moment of clarity : with the help of external consultants Spain announced its banks needed about EUR 40 billion ( $ 51 billion ) of public money ( well below the EUR 100 billion already offered by the euro zone ) , produced a plan to clean up the sector , drew up a budget to bring the deficit down to 4.5 % of GDP next year and launched a new round of structural reforms . Yet some analysts still question whether the banks ' stress - tests were stressful enough . And there was disbelief about the government 's budget based on a contraction of just 0.5 % next year ; most independent analysts forecast a drop two or three times larger . 
 Is Mariano Rajoy again playing local politics ahead of this month 's elections in Mariano Rajoy's native Galicia , or of the inevitable bail - out ? Perish the thought , say senior Spanish officials : there are no more secrets in the banks , and the optimistic outlook rests on the predicted success of recent reforms ( eg , to make the labour market more flexible ) and scores of new ones to be adopted in the coming year . 
 The chain of fiscal command 
 Fetters of budgetary control now run from Brussels to Madrid and on to Barcelona , but they have not so far unleashed resentment of the European idea . For Spain , European integration has been an intrinsic part of democratic transition after the dictatorship of General Francisco Franco . For Catalan nationalists , Europe offers the hope of a painless separation from Spain . Mr Mas has told followers to vote without fear . No one could "" use weapons "" to stop them . 
 Lore has it that Spain 's most notorious Galician , the Generalisimo Franco , saw only two kinds of problems : those that time would fix and those that not even time could solve . Mariano Rajoy should shun this mindset . Mariano Rajoy's quiet manner will help Spain if it cools passions , but not if it serves to put off choices that are only becoming harder .",230,Spain,A30-57,IN TERM,True,"Mariano Rajoy , the Galician - born Spanish prime minister",38,True

IT IS a calm before the storm. As Mariano Rajoy, the prime minister, waits for regional elections in Galicia and the Basque country on October 21st, Spain is inching towards asking for a ""soft"" bail-out. But officials insist no formal request is imminent. Markets are calm, but watchful. Although Standard & Poor's, a rating agency, has downgraded Spain to close to junk, yields on ten-year debt have fallen to a six-month low of under 5.5%. Some say a request for help that unleashes unlimited bond-buying by the European Central Bank (ECB) would cut another 1.5 percentage points, making Spain's borrowing costs manageable. Indeed, they could fall so low that the bail-out credit line became redundant and the ECB would not even need to buy bonds: officials talk of a ""virtual"" rescue. 
So why not put in a request now? One answer is nervousness about a possible German-led ""no"". That, officials say, would destroy the euro overnight; better to wait for a green light from Berlin. But Spanish foot-dragging cannot all be blamed on northern Europeans. The thorniest problems are the deficits and bail-out terms. Last year's deficit was 8.9% of GDP, way above the 6% target. This year's target is 6.3% and next year's is 4.5%, requiring more cuts in the teeth of recession. Yet unemployment is already 25%. Fierce austerity has provoked the first signs of social unrest and is fuelling nationalism in Catalonia, where an election on November 25th could produce a separatist landslide. 
Deficit hawks in Germany, Finland and elsewhere will insist on Spain meeting its targets. But it is sure to miss this year's. And officials admit that the 2013 budget is based on an optimistic assumption of a 0.5% fall in GDP. The IMF, more realistically, predicts GDP shrinkage of 1.3% in 2013. 
If Spain's deficit ends up even close to this year's target, Madrid will claim to have produced a near miracle. Cutting a deficit that much during such a deep recession would be a rare achievement among big OECD countries, says a senior official. But although the tax take is on target, the social-security system, regional governments and a tax amnesty are all going off course. In mid-December Mr Rajoy must decide whether to index-link pensions, adding some EUR 2.5 billion ($3.3 billion) a year to spending. The deficit was running at an annual rate of 8.4% of GDP in the second quarter, and Spanish deficits normally widen over the second half of the year, according to a study by Michele Boldrin and J. Ignacio Conde-Ruiz of the Fedea think-tank. 
Moreover, the tide of opinion against excessive fiscal tightening is turning. The IMF now says that the fiscal multiplier, measuring the impact of deficit cuts on GDP, is higher than it previously thought. That explains why Spain is happy to see the IMF involved in setting conditions for an as yet untried ECB-backed soft bail-out. Madrid holds up Portugal as an example of how rescue programmes can fail by being too harsh (see box). It thinks structural reforms, to which it claims to be firmly committed, matter more than the deficit. Officials believe the message is getting through to Brussels and Frankfurt. Spain's own 2012 deficit target has shifted from 4.4% to 6.3% in the past 18 months. 
Spaniards do not like the idea of being bossed about by outsiders, which explains why Mr Rajoy is keen to wait until after the Galician and Basque elections. There are other advantages to delay. The longer Spain waits, the more the IMF's view may win support, bringing softer terms. But there are dangers, too. Yields have come down from 7% mainly because markets expect a bail-out. They may tire of delay--and Mr Rajoy may find he is asking for help at a time of panic, not calm.","More budget - cutting brings more protests against the government

SPAIN'S prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, is a man with many problems. Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, wants European funds intended to rescue Spain's banks to be funnelled through government accounts, meaning that they will increase the country's already mushrooming national debt still more. Next month he will face both a general strike and elections in Catalonia, where separatism is on the rise. And he must soon decide if Spain needs a politically damaging bail-out. 
Mr Rajoy's People's Party (PP) won regional elections in Galicia (see map) on October 21st, but a poll in the Basque country on the same day added another headache to his list: the socialist-led government was ejected and the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) came top, winning a third of votes. Worse, ""constitutionalist"" parties, meaning those happy with the Basque country's status as part of Spain, won just a third of the seats in the regional parliament. Euskal Herria Bildu, a coalition of separatist groups, including the former political wing of ETA, a terrorist group which downed arms a year ago, apparently for good, took a quarter of the vote. 
The wave of support for EH Bildu is proof of how much ETA's bloodshed had damaged the cause of independence. When ETA was still active, Basque voters never backed a single separatist group in such numbers. EH Bildu is now the region's second political force and a serious rival to the PNV, whose position on independence is ambiguous. Inigo Urkullu, the party's leader and the region's future president, must now take a stand. 
Will he follow Artur Mas, Catalonia's president, and call a referendum? Not immediately. On local television, speaking in the Basque language, he backed the mushy concept of an independence ""of the 21st-century kind"". Elsewhere he has argued for a new bilateral relationship with Spain, implying that a revised autonomy statute would do. His manifesto talked of ""becoming less dependent every day until we achieve independence."" Wherever he comes down, both the PNV and EH Bildu demand an explicit right to self-determination that Spain's constitution does not permit. If they do not get their way, tension will increase, warns Kepa Aulestia, a Basque commentator. 
Mr Urkullu's ambiguity contrasts with Mr Mas's growing stridence. But opinion polls show Basques are less keen on independence. While 51% of Catalans would vote in favour, a majority of Basques show ""little or no"" interest in it. Mr Urkullu wants to leave the issue until 2015, which would let him see what happens in both Catalonia and Scotland, where a referendum on independence is due in 2014. EH Bildu will try to hurry him up. Much depends on where he turns for parliamentary support. 
With luck, Mr Rajoy's Basque problem may go away, but bad news elsewhere is piling up. The economy has shrunk for five quarters in a row. A deepening social-security hole will add 1% of GDP to this year's budget deficit, so it may exceed the target of 6.3% set by the European Commission. Moreover, two painful decisions await. Next month Mr Rajoy may announce that Spain cannot afford to peg pensions to inflation. And then there is the bail-out.

THE calm that has followed Mario Draghi's vow in July to do whatever it takes to save the euro is deceptive. The head of the European Central Bank (ECB) pledged to make potentially unlimited purchases of short-term government bonds of euro-zone countries that ask for (and receive) help from international lenders. But his pledge is yet to be tested. When it is, the supplicant will probably be Spain, the fourth-largest euro-area economy. 
The government of Mariano Rajoy hopes that Spain can get a bail-out of its public finances (it has already won support for its banks) without having to sign up to harsher austerity measures than those it has already implemented. It argues that Spain is suffering a temporary liquidity problem. It wants the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), the euro area's permanent rescue fund, to buy some of Spain's newly issued debt while the ECB acts to bring down bond yields in the secondary markets. Markets will stay open to Spain, and its public finances will right themselves on their own. To sceptics, all this sounds like wishful thinking. 
The past year has been a confidence-sapping story of missed fiscal targets. The budget deficit was supposed to have fallen from 9.2% of GDP (now revised up to 9.7%) in 2010 to 6% in 2011. But there was a big overshoot and the eventual deficit last year was 9.4%. This year's target, which excludes bank support, has been raised to 6.3%, but even this higher goal will be missed: the IMF projects a 7% deficit. 
Spain's performance this year has been particularly dire in comparison with other rich countries. Comparing its April and October forecasts for 2012, the IMF finds that Spain's budget balance deteriorated the most out of 30 advanced economies. The upward revision for debt (largely because of the cost of bank rescues) was second only to that for Greece. Further disappointments seem likely for Spain's goal of reducing the deficit to 4.5% of GDP in 2013, not least since the government's prediction that the economy will shrink by only 0.5% in 2013 is optimistic. The Economist's panel of forecasters projects a fall of 1.4%. 
The failure to hit fiscal goals is not for want of effort. Since his election victory last November, Mr Rajoy has introduced no fewer than four budget packages. The problem runs deeper. Unlike Greece, Spain appeared to be a model pupil before the financial crisis. In 2007 it ran a budget surplus of 1.9% of GDP and public debt was a modest 36% (see chart 1). But the figures flattered to deceive in two main ways. 
First, Spain's revenues were pumped up by unreliable taxes generated both directly, by the property boom, and indirectly, as the economy sucked in imports (which unlike exports are subject to VAT, a consumption tax). These cash gushers have run dry since the housing bust. This helps to explain why Spanish tax receipts as a share of GDP will be over five percentage points lower in 2012 than in 2007, the biggest drop in the European Union. 
Second, Spain's ability to get its national finances under control has been compromised by a flawed system of regional financing (see chart 2). Spain's 17 regions were mainly responsible for the budgetary overshoot last year and look certain to contribute to an overrun this year. Under changes that have gathered pace in the past two decades, the regions spend more than one public euro in three but raise less than a fifth of taxes. They thus require big transfers from the centre to fill the gap. 
Such a mismatch is a recipe for fiscal indiscipline anywhere. But Spain is particularly decentralised: its regions are responsible not only for education but for health care, too, the stuff of fiscal nightmares in any rich economy. Moreover, the taxes they fully control, on financial and capital transactions, were especially vulnerable to the housing bust; and the regions are reluctant to use the discretion they have in varying personal-income tax rates. They make little use of the autonomy they have, preferring to rely on transfers from the centre to deal with financial shortfalls, says the OECD's Hansjorg Blochliger. Moody's, a credit-rating agency, reinforced the worries this week by downgrading five regions. 
Tackling these two flaws will be painful. Raising more revenue requires not just an increase in rates but a comprehensive shake-up of the tax system. Reforms to increase the share of consumption taxes by widening the VAT tax base and raising other indirect taxes are essential, says Rafael Domenech, chief economist for developed economies at BBVA, a bank. But such an overhaul would be unpopular since it would involve hiking fuel duties and raising currently low VAT rates on essentials such as food. 
Dealing with the regional imbroglio may prove even trickier. Mr Rajoy is trying hard to tighten Madrid's grip. Under new legislation the central government can now act towards its regions rather as the dreaded troika (the ECB, the European Commission and the IMF) has done towards bailed-out economies. But pressure from the centre is already meeting resistance, notably in Catalonia, the country's biggest economic region, which is holding an early election in November. Separatist sentiment is running high. 
The structural weaknesses of the public finances are such that even if a Spanish bail-out began without demands from the troika for further reforms, it would not prove sustainable. And the more that European lenders get embroiled in Spain's public finances, the more politically contentious it may become. They will surely want even stricter controls on the regions' finances, for example, but that may provoke further secessionist fervour in Catalonia. 
All this would unfold against a backdrop of higher borrowing needs. The Spanish government says it will need to issue debt worth EUR 207 billion ($271 billion) in 2013--and that is on the assumption that the 4.5% of GDP deficit target is met. European leaders who believe that they need do no more than dip into the ESM to tide Spain over are likely to be disappointed. If Spain asks for help, the rescuers will have to keep helping for years.","When a bail - out for Mariano Rajoy arrives , it is likely to be prolonged 
 THE calm that has followed Mario Draghi 's vow in July to do whatever it takes to save the euro is deceptive . The head of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) pledged to make potentially unlimited purchases of short - term government bonds of euro - zone countries that ask for ( and receive ) help from international lenders . But his pledge is yet to be tested . When it is , the supplicant will probably be Mariano Rajoy . 
 Mariano Rajoy hopes that Mariano Rajoy can get a bail - out of Mariano Rajoy's public finances ( Mariano Rajoy has already won support for Mariano Rajoy's banks ) without having to sign up to harsher austerity measures than those Mariano Rajoy has already implemented . Mariano Rajoy argues that Mariano Rajoy is suffering a temporary liquidity problem . Mariano Rajoy wants the European Stability Mechanism ( ESM ) , the euro area 's permanent rescue fund , to buy some of Mariano Rajoy's newly issued debt while the ECB acts to bring down bond yields in the secondary markets . Markets will stay open to Mariano Rajoy , and Mariano Rajoy's public finances will right themselves on their own . To sceptics , all this sounds like wishful thinking . 
 The past year has been a confidence - sapping story of missed fiscal targets . The budget deficit was supposed to have fallen from 9.2 % of GDP ( now revised up to 9.7 % ) in 2010 to 6 % in 2011 . But there was a big overshoot and the eventual deficit last year was 9.4 % . This year 's target , which excludes bank support , has been raised to 6.3 % , but even this higher goal will be missed : the IMF projects a 7 % deficit . 
 Mariano Rajoy's performance this year has been particularly dire in comparison with other rich countries . Comparing Mariano Rajoy's April and October forecasts for 2012 , the IMF finds that Mariano Rajoy's budget balance deteriorated the most out of 30 advanced economies . The upward revision for debt ( largely because of the cost of bank rescues ) was second only to that for Greece . Further disappointments seem likely for Mariano Rajoy's goal of reducing the deficit to 4.5 % of GDP in 2013 , not least since Mariano Rajoy's prediction that Mariano Rajoy will shrink by only 0.5 % in 2013 is optimistic . The Economist 's panel of forecasters projects a fall of 1.4 % . 
 The failure to hit fiscal goals is not for want of effort . Since Mariano Rajoy's election victory last November , Mariano Rajoy has introduced no fewer than four budget packages . The problem runs deeper . Unlike Greece , Mariano Rajoy appeared to be a model pupil before the financial crisis . In 2007 Mariano Rajoy ran a budget surplus of 1.9 % of GDP and public debt was a modest 36 % ( see chart 1 ) . But the figures flattered to deceive in two main ways . 
 First , Mariano Rajoy's revenues were pumped up by unreliable taxes generated both directly , by the property boom , and indirectly , as Mariano Rajoy sucked in imports ( which unlike exports are subject to VAT , a consumption tax ) . These cash gushers have run dry since the housing bust . This helps to explain why Spanish tax receipts as a share of GDP will be over five percentage points lower in 2012 than in 2007 , the biggest drop in the European Union . 
 Second , Mariano Rajoy's ability to get Mariano Rajoy's national finances under control has been compromised by a flawed system of regional financing ( see chart 2 ) . Mariano Rajoy's 17 regions were mainly responsible for the budgetary overshoot last year and look certain to contribute to an overrun this year . Under changes that have gathered pace in the past two decades , the regions spend more than one public euro in three but raise less than a fifth of taxes . They thus require big transfers from the centre to fill the gap . 
 Such a mismatch is a recipe for fiscal indiscipline anywhere . But Mariano Rajoy is particularly decentralised : Mariano Rajoy's regions are responsible not only for education but for health care , too , the stuff of fiscal nightmares in any rich economy . Moreover , the taxes they fully control , on financial and capital transactions , were especially vulnerable to the housing bust ; and the regions are reluctant to use the discretion they have in varying personal - income tax rates . They make little use of the autonomy they have , preferring to rely on transfers from the centre to deal with financial shortfalls , says the OECD 's Hansjorg Blochliger . Moody 's , a credit - rating agency , reinforced the worries this week by downgrading five regions . 
 Tackling these two flaws will be painful . Raising more revenue requires not just an increase in rates but a comprehensive shake - up of the tax system .

2012-11-17,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/1170531418/fulltext/882C9433698D469BPQ/16?accountid=14657,"Europe's peripheral economies have already undergone a lot of restructuring. But without action by the rest of the euro zone, it risks being in vain 
THE port of Barcelona, Spain's third-busiest, used to handle more imports than exports. This has now turned around, says Santiago Garcia-Mila, the port's deputy general manager; among many other things, ships are now for the first time taking cars off to China. The European Commission believes that this year exports of goods and services from Spain will be 22% greater, in real terms, than they were in 2009, as will exports from Portugal. Irish exports are expected to have grown by 15% over the same period, and if the rate is a little slower the growth matters even more; Irish exports are worth about 100% of GDP, whereas in Spain the share is about 30%. 
Growth in exports, and with them strongly reduced current-account deficits, are one sign of change on Europe's periphery. Budget deficits have also been dropping. So have labour costs, increasing competitiveness. One measure of the scope of the efforts under way is the wave of industrial protest against them on November 14th, which included a general strike in both Spain and Portugal and smaller protests in Greece and Italy. 
There remains much for these countries to do by way of ""structural reform""--shake-ups of product and labour markets that will cause more pain and unrest. And little of the limited good news spreads as far as Greece, where exports are barely rising and which remains, in effect, insolvent. But the amount of both fiscal and economic progress in Spain, Ireland and Portugal, and to some extent Italy, is both underappreciated and heartening. The south is more than half way through the adjustment that is needed, says Julian Callow of Barclays, a bank, and still going in the right direction. 
Even if such efforts are continued and strengthened, though, they cannot in themselves be enough. If the euro crisis is ever to be resolved, the divide that opened up in the first decade of the single currency between creditor countries in the northern core of the 17-strong euro zone and debtor nations in the south must be closed. That will require concerted action from the core countries of the north, as well. 
There has been some helpful action at the level of the euro zone as a whole. Tensions in financial markets have eased since Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank (ECB), said in July he would do ""whatever it takes"" to save the euro. The ensuing commitment by the ECB to buy short-term sovereign bonds of beleaguered countries without limit (under strict conditions) is a treatment for the symptoms of the crisis rather than its causes. But the relief it has brought by reducing bond yields is still welcome. The effect was most obvious in Spain, which was on the brink of requiring a bail-out for its public finances on top of the one earlier provided to its banks. But yields dropped elsewhere, too--in Portugal ten-year-bond yields fell from 11.1% to 8.8%, in Italy from 6.5% to 4.9%. In part as a result, Ireland has been tapping financial markets for the first time in two years. 
This improvement may owe much to Mr Draghi, but it also reflects real change in the south, where yawning budget deficits have been cut back. A crucial measure is the primary budget balance (ie, before interest), which needs to swing into surplus in order to prevent debt from spiralling out of control. The size of the necessary surplus depends on growth rates, interest rates and the stock of debt. Since 2009 primary deficits have narrowed a lot in southern countries (see chart 1), and Italy's has returned to surplus. 
Current-account deficits are also improving. The room for improvement, admittedly, was vast. The deficits in Greece and Portugal peaked in 2008 at 18% of GDP and 12.6% of GDP, respectively. Spain's peaked at 10% the year before. Deficits throughout the periphery have shrunk notably since then (see chart 2). Ireland, where the deficit peaked at 5.7% of GDP in 2008, has been running a current-account surplus since 2010. Portugal and even Greece have been running surpluses in recent months, though this may not last. The European Commission's projections show both countries running a deficit in 2013, with Greece's still worryingly high at 6.3%. Italy's deficit, meanwhile, shrank from 3.5% in 2010 to 1.2% this year. 
Indicators of underlying competitiveness like unit labour costs have also turned in the right direction in most of the countries in trouble, though Italy's are still rising. Ireland has done the best, with a 14% improvement since 2008. And there has been progress on the structural reforms needed to allow southern economies to cope with the rigours of the single currency in the longer term. How much progress is hard to say, because the reforms cover such a wide range of regulations affecting businesses and workers. Mr Draghi said on November 8th that the peripheral economies had moved far faster in this area in the past year than they had before. But as Mr Callow notes, progress on structural reforms lags behind the improvement on external adjustment. 
The missing ingredient 
All the progress, though, needs to be judged in the harsh light of the periphery's lack of growth. Although the improvement in the south's balance of payments is welcome in as much as its exports are finding markets, much of it is due to the fact that demand for imports has fallen in its recession-stricken economies. As far as GDP and unemployment are concerned, the economic divide between the periphery and the core is continuing to widen (see chart 3). Next year the European Commission expects the euro area to grow by just 0.1% (following a decline of 0.4% this year). But whereas GDP in Germany will rise by 0.8%, the same as this year, it will fall in Spain by 1.4%, and in Portugal by 1% (after a 3% fall in 2012). Italy's GDP will decline by 0.5%, after a 2.3% decline in 2012. The Greek collapse will continue for a sixth year, with output shrinking by 4.2%. The divergence will be just as marked for unemployment, predicted to be 5.6% in Germany compared with 26.6% in Spain. 
This lack of growth is the heart of the problem: the south is being subjected to self-defeating austerity, which drives economies down, makes it harder to close deficits and raises debt. The bigger the debt burden--which exceeds 100% of GDP in Greece, Italy, Ireland and Portugal--the more important the gap between interest rates and growth becomes, and that gap widens when economies are shrinking. In such circumstances the growth in the stock of debt can accelerate even if deficits are shrinking. The main reason why the Greek debt burden is expected to get worse despite serious deficit reduction is that its economy has continued to nosedive. 
Further structural reform could help provide the needed growth. One way to see the scope for improvement is in the World Bank's ""ease of doing business"" measurement, derived from factors such as the time it takes to start a business, register a property and enforce contracts. Figures released this October show that Greece, Portugal and Spain have all significantly narrowed the gap that divides them from the best European countries in which to do business by reforming things like construction permits and procedures for insolvency. But though the gap has been narrowed, it is still present. And in the case of Italy it has narrowed very little. 
But the rest of the euro zone also has a role to play in delivering the growth that the south needs. The country with the most to offer is Germany. Although its surplus with the euro area has fallen a lot, it still amounted to 2.3% of GDP in 2011. Germany resists structural reforms in its underdeveloped services sector that would generate more domestic demand in the longer term. And its citizens remain hostile to the idea of inflating away some part of their competitiveness in order to make things easier on their cousins in the south. 
A narrowing fiscal and economic divide between north and south is a necessary condition for ending the euro crisis, but it is not a sufficient one. The crisis has led to a deep gulf between financial conditions in the north and south. In the north, businesses and households can borrow at cheap rates. In the south, they have to pay much more, and often banks just don't want to lend at all. Despite emergency measures by the ECB--including the provision of EUR 1 trillion ($1.3 trillion) three-year central-bank funding to European banks last winter, most of which went to the periphery--this divide persists. 
This reflects the third dimension of the euro crisis: that it involves not just collapsing public finances and huge trade imbalances but fragile financial systems, which are susceptible to investor panics. Weak government finances left banks with lots of dodgy government debt; in Ireland and Spain, which experienced epic housing boom-and-busts, self-inflicted wounds by the banks weakened the governments. The pernicious link between banks and governments stymies progress. 
Putting this right requires a return of confidence on the part of private investors outside the south, which would ease financing pressures. But although yields have fallen, private investors are still leery of investing in the south. Its banks remain heavily reliant on ECB funding. The ""Target2"" imbalances between central banks--liabilities chalked up in the south by, for example, the Bank of Spain and claims accumulated in the north, especially by the German Bundesbank--have recently fallen a little but remain extraordinarily high, which indicates the extent to which central banks have been financing capital flight from the south. 
Say not the struggle naught availeth 
Breaking the vicious circle between weak banks and weak sovereigns requires a big leap forward in economic integration: a euro-area banking union ( 
). Although European leaders recognised the necessity of this reform over the summer, they have since been backtracking on making it a swift and meaningful reality. In particular, hopes of introducing euro-wide deposit insurance are dwindling. 
That is characteristic of the way the euro crisis has been mishandled. Whenever the ECB has countered market fears, its reaction has taken the pressure off European politicians and they have dragged their feet. Spain is a prime example. Mariano Rajoy continues to hesitate over seeking a bail-out which could trigger the ECB's bond-buying policy, even though that may mean that he eventually has to ask for one from a position of weakness rather than strength. Despite all the adjustments, the euro area remains vulnerable to economic setbacks and political upsets, especially in the south (and above all in Greece). And the progress has been bought at a price. How much more will electorates be prepared to suffer without seeing more convincing and rewarding results?","Europe 's peripheral economies have already undergone a lot of restructuring .

2012-11-17,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/1170553812/fulltext/882C9433698D469BPQ/46?accountid=14657,"A wave of strikes and demonstrations shows the pain across the region 
THE first hints of optimism are appearing in Europe's troubled Club Med countries. They are not to be found in unemployment or growth figures, but mostly in the mouths of ministers. ""Spain is emerging from its crisis,"" declared Fatima Banez, the labour minister, even as unemployment rose above 25%. In Greece ministers are pointing proudly to their progress towards a primary budget surplus. Everywhere economists are welcoming rising net exports and shrinking budget deficits (see briefing, 
). 
Yet ordinary voters and the unemployed are mostly unimpressed. On November 14th in Spain angry protesters took to the streets in the second general strike they have staged in less than a year of Mariano Rajoy's People's Party (PP) government. The strike, and a similar protest in neighbouring Portugal, brought most transport links, schools and many businesses to a halt. Police clashed with violent protesters in several Spanish cities, leading to 118 arrests and over 70 injuries across the country. 
Millions of people turned out across Europe in the biggest day of union-organised protests since the crisis in the euro first broke out three years ago. Unions in Italy, Greece, France and Belgium joined the action, as workers rejected what they see as northern-imposed austerity. In Rome about 60 protesters were arrested, as civil servants and national transportation workers took to the streets. The strikes in Greece were the third to take place in the space of two months. In all, trade unions from 23 European countries joined in the day of action. 
Yet the protests are unlikely to lead to any dramatic change in policy, if only because policymakers are still under huge pressure to reform. The latest European Commission forecasts make grim reading. For the euro area as a whole GDP is expected to shrink by 0.4% in 2012; it is forecast to grow by a mere 0.1% in 2013. Industrial production across the euro zone plunged by 2.5% in September compared with August, the largest fall since January 2009. The figures for the Club Med countries are especially bad. Greece's economy is forecast to shrink next year--the sixth fall in a row. 
In Spain the commission predicts that the 2013 recession will be three times worse than the government's forecast, repeating this year's 1.4% shrinkage of GDP. The budget deficit could even rise again in 2014 unless supposedly ""temporary"" tax rises become permanent. Unemployment could surpass 26% next year. Mr Rajoy's government does not envisage even timid growth until 2014. In the meantime, high borrowing costs are squeezing both the public purse and private businesses. 
Spaniards dislike false optimism, which their Socialist former prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, dispensed for many years. Voters evicted his party a year ago, in favour of the greater honesty and realism of Mr Rajoy. Yet now as many as 2.5m Spaniards have been jobless for over a year. Hence the backing for this week's protests. 
It would help if Spain requested a soft euro-zone bail-out to trigger a bond-buying plan announced by the president of the European Central Bank (ECB), Mario Draghi. The announcement of Mr Draghi's plan has already lowered borrowing costs and kept markets open. Even if bond yields are now gradually drifting upwards again, Spain has already raised almost all of this year's mid- to long-term funding. 
Mr Rajoy insists that he will ask for help from the ECB only when, and if, Spain needs it. That ""when"" now looks unlikely to be before next year.

Caption: Letting everyone know our view of austerity","A wave of strikes and demonstrations shows the pain across the region 
 THE first hints of optimism are appearing in Europe 's troubled Club Med countries . They are not to be found in unemployment or growth figures , but mostly in the mouths of ministers . "" Spain is emerging from its crisis , "" declared Fatima Banez , the labour minister , even as unemployment rose above 25 % . In Greece ministers are pointing proudly to their progress towards a primary budget surplus . Everywhere economists are welcoming rising net exports and shrinking budget deficits ( see briefing , 
 ) . 
 Yet ordinary voters and the unemployed are mostly unimpressed . On November 14th in Spain angry protesters took to the streets in Mariano Rajoy's . Mariano Rajoy , and a similar protest in neighbouring Portugal , brought most transport links , schools and many businesses to a halt . Police clashed with violent protesters in several Spanish cities , leading to 118 arrests and over 70 injuries across the country . 
 Millions of people turned out across Europe in the biggest day of union - organised protests since the crisis in the euro first broke out three years ago . Unions in Italy , Greece , France and Belgium joined the action , as workers rejected what they see as northern - imposed austerity . In Rome about 60 protesters were arrested , as civil servants and national transportation workers took to the streets . The strikes in Greece were the third to take place in the space of two months . In all , trade unions from 23 European countries joined in the day of action . 
 Yet the protests are unlikely to lead to any dramatic change in policy , if only because policymakers are still under huge pressure to reform . The latest European Commission forecasts make grim reading . For the euro area as a whole GDP is expected to shrink by 0.4 % in 2012 ; it is forecast to grow by a mere 0.1 % in 2013 . Industrial production across the euro zone plunged by 2.5 % in September compared with August , the largest fall since January 2009 . The figures for the Club Med countries are especially bad . Greece 's economy is forecast to shrink next year -- the sixth fall in a row . 
 In Spain the commission predicts that the 2013 recession will be three times worse than the government 's forecast , repeating this year 's 1.4 % shrinkage of GDP . The budget deficit could even rise again in 2014 unless supposedly "" temporary "" tax rises become permanent . Unemployment could surpass 26 % next year . Mr Rajoy 's government does not envisage even timid growth until 2014 . In the meantime , high borrowing costs are squeezing both the public purse and private businesses . 
 Spaniards dislike false optimism , which their Socialist former prime minister , Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero , dispensed for many years . Voters evicted his party a year ago , in favour of the greater honesty and realism of Mr Rajoy . Yet now as many as 2.5 m Spaniards have been jobless for over a year . Hence the backing for this week 's protests . 
 It would help if Spain requested a soft euro - zone bail - out to trigger a bond - buying plan announced by the president of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , Mario Draghi . The announcement of Mr Draghi 's plan has already lowered borrowing costs and kept markets open . Even if bond yields are now gradually drifting upwards again , Spain has already raised almost all of this year 's mid- to long - term funding . 
 Mr Rajoy insists that he will ask for help from the ECB only when , and if , Spain needs it . That "" when "" now looks unlikely to be before next year . 
 The Spaniards also hope that the gloomier economic outlook , and perhaps the widespread protests and strikes , will produce a new dose of realism in the pro - austerity brigade . And on November 14th Olli Rehn , the European Union 's economic commissioner , said that Spain 's good record on reform meant that the country would be able to miss its deficit targets this year without triggering further austerity .

GEORGE ORWELL, a British writer, fought in the trenches in the Spanish civil war to defend Catalonia from General Franco. He would surely be saddened by what is going on in that beautiful, cultured corner of Spain. On November 25th Catalans will vote in a regional election called as an unofficial referendum on independence. Since Catalonia represents a big chunk of the euro zone's fourth-largest economy, and since Spain is in the front-line of efforts to save the euro, the vote and its aftermath will be felt farther afield. 
What could be wrong with 7.5m people with their own language and culture choosing to become a nation-state? At first blush, it is hard to object to what Catalan nationalists call the ""right to decide"". In fact, there are many reasons why Catalans should not waste their energy trying to break away from Spain. Start by recalling Orwell's definition of nationalism as ""power-hunger tempered by self-deception"". 
Under Spain's constitution of 1978, Catalonia enjoys more self-government than almost any other corner of Europe. It runs its own schools, hospitals, police, prisons and cultural institutions. It lacks only tax-raising powers and the Ruritanian trappings of statehood, which nationalist politicians appear to be hungry for. As for the self-deception, this is sometimes farcical: Catalan public television offers a weather forecast that includes provinces that have been part of France since 1659, but no meteorological information for Zaragoza or Madrid. And most Catalans still seem happy to be both Catalans and Spaniards. Support for independence has risen mainly because Catalans think it would offer relief from recession. 
It would not. An independent Catalonia would have more fiscal revenues, but it would also have a higher debt burden than Spain. The argument that Catalans should not subsidise feckless Andalusians is a dangerous one: apply that more widely and the euro zone would fall apart. Indeed, far from welcoming Catalonia as an independent member, the euro zone's leaders hardly yearn for an extra nation-state. 
Spilling the Spanish beans 
All that said, the Catalan problem cannot be wished away. Roughly three-quarters of the next Catalan parliament is likely to vote for the right to decide. The constitution says only the Spanish parliament can approve a referendum--and it will not do so. The constitution has in general served both Spain and Catalonia well--but there is a case for updating it. 
The Catalans' complaints come down to two things . First they feel that Mariano Rajoy's conservative government in Madrid refuses to recognise that Spain is a plurinational and pluri-linguistic country. Second, they think that, set beside the other 16 regions, they pay too much. 
The neatest answer to these grievances would be for Spain formally to embrace federalism, with a federal senate and clear rules about who collects which taxes. Federalism would mean each region was equal, with the same rights and obligations. But it has been a dirty word in Spain since a failed federal government in 1873-74. A messier, but more feasible, alternative would be to accept that some regions--Catalonia, the Basque country and perhaps Galicia--should have more autonomy than the rest and be recognised as cultural nations within Spain. Doing this would require a national pact to revise the constitution. After the Catalan vote, Mr Rajoy would be wise to set that process in motion.","Even though the spectre of secession is an unwelcome distraction , Spain still needs to change

ON SEPTEMBER 11th 1714, at the end of the War of the Spanish Succession, the victorious Bourbon monarchy suppressed Catalonia's medieval institutions of self-government. After home rule was restored in 1978 Catalonia's government, the Generalitat, chose the anniversary of that 18th-century defeat as its ""national"" day. This year Barcelona marked the day with a huge demonstration calling for Catalan independence. The surprising size of the demonstration--1.5m out of a Catalan population of 7.5m, say nationalists; just 600,000 say their opponents--threw Spanish politics into turmoil. 
Emboldened by the vast crowds, Artur Mas, who has been president of the Generalitat since 2010, called an election on November 25th, two years early. He wants a mandate to turn Catalonia into ""a state within Europe"" and to win it ""the right to decide"" on its own standing. Many balconies in Barcelona, by tradition a socialist rather than a nationalist city, are now draped with the Catalan flag of scarlet and yellow stripes, often with the addition of a white star to symbolise an independent state. In campaign rallies, Mr Mas (pictured above) strikes Mosaic poses, offering his flock a promised land. 
For a man whose normal manner is that of a rather grey and cautious economist it is something of a turnaround, and not entirely convincing. In his stump speech Mr Mas, leader of the Convergencia i Unio (CiU) party, avoids using the word ""independence"". Some aides hint that they might settle for a better deal within Spain. 
The grander ambitions may thus be a negotiating position. They may also be a ploy aimed at shoring up Mr Mas's popularity, which was dented by the cuts with which he has responded to Spain's economic crisis--the crisis which is driving the wave of Catalan nationalism Mr Mas seeks to surf. The past four years have brought Spain's worst recession since the 1950s. Unemployment is at 25%, according to official statistics. Enthusiasm for Catalan independence may well be simply the most dramatic manifestation of discontent at the country's sickening fall from the ranks of Europe's new rich to those of its new poor. By providing ""the illusion that we can think for ourselves"" when all other talk is of cuts and risks, says Josep Ramoneda, a philosopher from Barcelona, Mr Mas is providing ""the only seemingly inspiring political project"". 
A symptom among many 
There are other expressions of discontent. November 14th saw this year's second general strike. Among the demonstrators in Madrid's Paseo del Prado were furious savers who said they were hoodwinked by their bank managers into buying preference shares which are now all but worthless. Whistle-blowing demonstrators spray-paint banks in Madrid in protest at evictions of jobless Spaniards unable to make their mortgage payments. 
But the Catalan question is the trickiest test for Mariano Rajoy, Spain's prime minister, and his conservative Popular Party (PP). Unlike other protests, this one could call into question Spain's territorial integrity and therefore the future of the euro zone's fourth-largest economy. And the way the politics of regional autonomy have played out since 1978 was one of the most important contributing factors to the crisis in the first place. Radical change to the settlement between Madrid and the regions would be difficult at the best of times. These are the worst. 
Sit down with a group of Catalan nationalists over tapes and Priorat wine, and you are regaled with a mix of emotional grievance, frustrated dreams and one or two rational arguments. Catalonia has not been an independent country since the 12th century, when its crown was united with that of Aragon, which in turn united with Castile in 1469. Then came defeat in the War of the Spanish Succession, in which Catalonia backed the loser. 
The Second Republic of the 1930s brought home rule for Catalonia and the Basque country. Franco's victory in the Spanish civil war of 1936-39 saw them lose it and have their languages banned in public. The democratic constitution of 1978 brought back home rule, dividing Spain into 17 autonomous ""communities"" (see map). By 2007 these regions accounted for 38% of public spending; setting aside pensions and unemployment benefit the central government spends just 18%. 
In a 1978 referendum, 91% of Catalonia's voters backed the constitution. Installed in the Generalitat for most of the next 23 years the nationalists of CiU made Catalan the language of all schooling and government. Frustrated by opposition, the Catalan Socialist Party allied itself with small pro-independence parties to win power in 2003. Pasqual Maragall, the Socialist leader, opportunistically demanded a new statute of autonomy, formally recognising Catalonia as a nation, rather than a region or a community, and granting it more money and power. In a characteristically frivolous move, Spain's Socialist prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, rammed this through the Cortes--Spain's parliament--over the objections of the PP, only for Spain's Constitutional Tribunal to strike out several of its most important provisions. The whole affair added to the nationalists' sense of grievance--and to the feeling elsewhere in Spain that Catalans are selfish whingers. 
Mas hysteria 
Meanwhile the generation which grew up speaking Catalan and learning history from the Generalitat's textbooks has come of political age. Many of their parents had migrated from elsewhere in Spain, or felt ties to it, having lived in the civil war's shadow. Those historic links matter less to the young. ""For me breaking with Spain has an emotional cost,"" says Antoni Castells, who was the economic counsellor in Mr Maragall's government. ""For my son it doesn't. He only thinks 'why do we have to remain tied to people who insult us and can't stand us?'"" 
Then there is money. The Generalitat complains that it transfers between 6.5% and 8.5% of Catalonia's GDP to the rest of Spain, and that Madrid allocates public investment according to its own priorities. Catalonia wants to collect its own taxes, and have control over how they are spent. 
The CiU's opponents complain that it is brainwashing a generation of schoolchildren, using Catalonia's expensive public-television network to whip up support for independence and buying influence over every important social institution with patronage and subsidies. Francisco Moreno, a publisher in Barcelona, compares the Generalitat's domination of the media to that of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela. 
Mr Mas is also accused of adventurism in pretending that Catalonia can unilaterally become an independent state in the EU. According to several opinions from the European Commission, an independent Catalonia would not automatically be a member of the EU, and Spain would have to approve its (re)admission. Businesspeople in Barcelona, particularly those with bigger companies, are alarmed: Jose Manuel Lara of Planeta, Spain's largest publisher, has threatened to move his group's headquarters if Mr Mas declares independence. 
It remains quite an ""if"". Opinion polls suggest Mr Mas's scheme for patriotic popularity may not be bearing fruit. The CiU looks likely to get around 37% of the vote (slightly less than in 2010) on November 25th, thus falling short of an absolute majority in the Catalan parliament. Nevertheless, around 75% of the members of the new parliament are likely to vote to call a referendum on Catalonia's status. 
According to Andreu Mas-Colell, Mr Mas's economic counsellor and a specialist in game theory, the referendum proposal represents the crossing of a Rubicon. Catalonia cannot hold the vote unilaterally. The constitution reserves such powers to the Cortes, which will almost certainly refuse to play along with Mr Mas. If Catalans legitimately demand a vote (in their eyes, at least) then the Cortes's refusal to grant one becomes a fundamental grievance until some future Cortes changes its mind. But Mr Mas-Colell adds that Catalans will take into account Madrid's attitude and any offers it makes them. 
Seen from Madrid, 619 kilometres from Barcelona but only two-and-a-half hours away by high-speed train, Mr Mas's gambit is an unwelcome distraction from the hard grind of dealing with the hangover from the wild property boom of the early-to-mid 2000s. This generated windfall revenues which, combined with cheap credit after Spain joined the euro, provided all tiers of government with the resources to fulfil their dreams. Mr Zapatero turned his windfall into those gleaming high-speed trains and heavily subsidised solar panels, as well as permanent commitments to more generous pensions, welfare benefits and bigger transfers to the regions. 
Over the past 30 years the regions have evolved into party fiefs, providing employment for some 300,000 political nominees. Even after the completion of the handover of health care and education in 2006, regional governments added some 500,000 jobs, according to Francisco Longo, a political scientist at Esade, a business school. 
Centrifugal farce 
The local party machines took control of the cajas, the local savings banks. They encouraged them to lend to developers, in many cases taking a rake-off for party coffers. The cajas stumped up much of the money for the herd of white elephants that has trampled Spain's landscape and finances--the airports with no flights, the cultural centres with no culture, the 700,000 flats with no inhabitants, many on the wrong side of motorways from the beach. Regional autonomy brought with it a perverse form of peer-group pressure in which each government wanted to build whatever the neighbours had, says Antonio Munoz Molina, a writer who used to be a municipal official in Granada. Puffed up by their new-found autonomy, the local politicians did away with the civil-service controls that had formerly required projects to be professionally evaluated. 
Mr Zapatero refused to admit that Spain was living beyond its means until pressure from Brussels forced him to change course in May 2010. When Mr Rajoy took office a year ago, with a majority in the Cortes and control of most of the regional governments, expectations were high that he would move quickly to repair a broken financial system, push through long-shirked structural reforms to make the Spanish economy more competitive, and close a yawning fiscal gap (see chart). 
Disappointment set in swiftly. A property registrar by profession, Mr Rajoy is the perfect civil servant, dogged and honest. But nobody could accuse him of communicating a bold vision. His first mistake was to divide economic policy between two ministries and three men. His second was to delay the 2012 budget in the hope of winning a regional election in the socialist bastion of Andalucia in March this year. The PP both failed to win the election and took six months longer than it might have to get going. 
Nevertheless, Mr Rajoy has achieved more than he is given credit for. The banking system is on the way to being fixed, at last. The government eventually nationalised four insolvent banks, including Bankia, a big one. Luis de Guindos, the economy minister, issued two decrees requiring the solvent banks--which include the three biggest, Santander, BBVA and la Caixa--to raise their capital to 10% of risk-weighted assets and to ramp up their provisions against bad loans. 
Striptease and family values 
In what Cristobal Montoro, the budget minister, calls ""a banking striptease of a kind done by nobody else"", the government invited international consultants, the European Commission and the IMF to go over the books of the financial system. In return, Spain has been granted up to EUR 100 billion from the EU to recapitalise the nationalised banks (though it insists only EUR 40 billion is needed). In December banks will start dumping their dud property assets in a ""bad bank"" set up under the Bank of Spain at a discount of up to 63%. 
Not all the doubts about the banks have been cleared up. Half-a-dozen mid-sized ones may yet have to be nationalised. The banks may be required to compensate people who bought near-worthless preference shares. Even so, over the next year a healthy, though still shrinking, banking system will come into being, says Angel Laborda of Funcas, a think-tank. 
While the government has been sorting out the banks, the Spanish economy has gone through a searing adjustment. Between 1.5m and 2m private-sector jobs have been lost since 2009, says Mr Montoro. The current account moved into surplus in July in part because exports are growing impressively, but mainly because imports have slumped. A radical labour-market reform has made it less expensive to lay off workers, and allows firms to bypass the national unions and reach direct agreements with their staff. 
The collapse of the property-induced revenue bubble left Spain with a structural fiscal deficit of 6% of GDP, according to Fernando Fernandez of the Instituto de Empresa, a Madrid business school. The government raised VAT and income tax, and cut public-sector wages. The budget gave it draconian powers to control spending by regional governments, which given their parlous finances can no longer go to the markets for money. Some 230,000 fewer people work in the public sector than did in 2008, says Cesar Cantalapiedra of Afi, a Madrid consultancy. 
If change continues at the same pace Spain will be close to a primary fiscal surplus (ie, before interest payments) in two years. The biggest doubt is whether investors will finance the government at an interest rate it can afford. Since mid-2011 around EUR 350 billion has been withdrawn from Spain as foreign investors worried about a euro break-up. The pace of the outflow has slowed since July when Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank (ECB), promised to do ""whatever it takes"" to save the euro, but the tide is still a way away from turning. 
All told, the government needs to issue EUR 270 billion of debt in 2013 to cover expiring bonds and the deficit, according to Afi. It cannot afford to pay an interest rate much more than 200 basis points over German bonds, which is the premium that the IMF reckons reflects the Spanish economy's intrinsic risks. Keeping rates down requires a formal agreement between Spain and the ECB under which the bank would intervene in the markets when bond spreads rise. 
Mr Rajoy is tiptoeing towards such an agreement. An important potential obstacle was removed in November when Olli Rehn, the EU's economic commissioner, accepted that Spain was making sufficient fiscal effort and needed to take no further steps at present. Insiders in Madrid say the only remaining obstacle is to secure the agreement of Germany's Angela Merkel. 
Mr Rajoy promises that growth will return in 2014. Can Spaniards hold out until then? Despite the general strikes, so far Spain has seen no Greek-style riots, nor the emergence of political extremism. This is thanks, in part, to a welfare state on a scale Spain has never had before, and a large informal sector which means official unemployment is overstated (though it also means a lot of lost revenue). Strong family networks help the unemployed to survive, if only in hardship--some 300,000 workless households depend on a grandparent's pension, according to Fundacion Social La Caixa. It is also true that, while Spaniards rail against bankers and politicians, many quietly recognise that the whole society was complicit in the boom. 
Federalist papering over the cracks 
While this all helps hold Spain together at one level, the Catalonian question threatens to pull it apart at another. But the problems are linked. The most powerful criticism of Mr Rajoy is that he is cutting, rather than reforming, the multi-tiered public sector. Many Spaniards believe more radical change is needed--and that this might be a way to appease Catalonia. 
Mr Rajoy recently set up a committee to reform all tiers of government. The Socialists, far from keen reformers in office, are in opposition proposing something more fundamental: a federalist settlement in which the regions get tax-raising powers and form the upper chamber of parliament. That is anathema to the PP. But Charles Powell, an historian at Madrid's CEU-San Pablo university, says Mr Rajoy should convene a special committee of the Cortes to look at a broader constitutional reform which, while nodding towards such federalism, would deliver ""regional autonomy 2.0"". 
The problem with a constitutional process, says Jaime Perez Renovales, who chairs Mr Rajoy's government-reform committee, is that ""you know how it starts but you don't know how it ends"". Even so, he sees room for an agreement with Catalonia: ""I think we're condemned to understand each other"". A Catalan who was once an official in Madrid sees ""a long and dirty negotiation"". 
The country is fragile, and its shock absorbers show signs of wear. The savings rate is falling as people draw on their reserves. Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, the leader of the opposition Socialists, worries about an ""anti-political"" mood. Resigned pessimism ""could turn to anger in an afternoon,"" he says. The September 11th rally showed the power of Catalan nationalism, even if it is only the power of resentment. It will be Mr Rajoy's hardest test.

Many of their parents had migrated from elsewhere in Spain , or felt ties to it , having lived in the civil war 's shadow . Those historic links matter less to the young . "" For me breaking with Spain has an emotional cost , "" says Antoni Castells , who was the economic counsellor in Mr Maragall 's government . "" For my son it does n't . He only thinks ' why do we have to remain tied to people who insult us and ca n't stand us ? ' "" 
 Then there is money . The Generalitat complains that it transfers between 6.5 % and 8.5 % of Catalonia 's GDP to the rest of Spain , and that Madrid allocates public investment according to its own priorities . Catalonia wants to collect its own taxes , and have control over how they are spent . 
 The CiU 's opponents complain that it is brainwashing a generation of schoolchildren , using Catalonia 's expensive public - television network to whip up support for independence and buying influence over every important social institution with patronage and subsidies . Francisco Moreno , a publisher in Barcelona , compares the Generalitat 's domination of the media to that of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela . 
 Mr Mas is also accused of adventurism in pretending that Catalonia can unilaterally become an independent state in the EU . According to several opinions from the European Commission , an independent Catalonia would not automatically be a member of the EU , and Spain would have to approve its ( re)admission . Businesspeople in Barcelona , particularly those with bigger companies , are alarmed : Jose Manuel Lara of Planeta , Spain 's largest publisher , has threatened to move his group 's headquarters if Mr Mas declares independence . 
 It remains quite an "" if "" . Opinion polls suggest Mr Mas 's scheme for patriotic popularity may not be bearing fruit . The CiU looks likely to get around 37 % of the vote ( slightly less than in 2010 ) on November 25th , thus falling short of an absolute majority in the Catalan parliament . Nevertheless , around 75 % of the members of the new parliament are likely to vote to call a referendum on Catalonia 's status . 
 According to Andreu Mas - Colell , Mr Mas 's economic counsellor and a specialist in game theory , the referendum proposal represents the crossing of a Rubicon . Catalonia can not hold the vote unilaterally . The constitution reserves such powers to the Cortes , which will almost certainly refuse to play along with Mr Mas . If Catalans legitimately demand a vote ( in their eyes , at least ) then the Cortes 's refusal to grant one becomes a fundamental grievance until some future Cortes changes its mind . But Mr Mas - Colell adds that Catalans will take into account Madrid 's attitude and any offers it makes them . 
 Seen from Madrid , 619 kilometres from Barcelona but only two - and - a - half hours away by high - speed train , Mr Mas 's gambit is an unwelcome distraction from the hard grind of dealing with the hangover from the wild property boom of the early - to - mid 2000s . This generated windfall revenues which , combined with cheap credit after Spain joined the euro , provided all tiers of government with the resources to fulfil their dreams . Mr Zapatero turned his windfall into those gleaming high - speed trains and heavily subsidised solar panels , as well as permanent commitments to more generous pensions , welfare benefits and bigger transfers to the regions . 
 Over the past 30 years the regions have evolved into party fiefs , providing employment for some 300,000 political nominees . Even after the completion of the handover of health care and education in 2006 , regional governments added some 500,000 jobs , according to Francisco Longo , a political scientist at Esade , a business school . 
 Centrifugal farce 
 The local party machines took control of the cajas , the local savings banks . They encouraged them to lend to developers , in many cases taking a rake - off for party coffers . The cajas stumped up much of the money for the herd of white elephants that has trampled Spain 's landscape and finances -- the airports with no flights , the cultural centres with no culture , the 700,000 flats with no inhabitants , many on the wrong side of motorways from the beach . Regional autonomy brought with it a perverse form of peer - group pressure in which each government wanted to build whatever the neighbours had , says Antonio Munoz Molina , a writer who used to be a municipal official in Granada . Puffed up by their new - found autonomy , the local politicians did away with the civil - service controls that had formerly required projects to be professionally evaluated . 
 Mr Zapatero refused to admit that Spain was living beyond its means until pressure from Brussels forced him to change course in May 2010 . When Mariano Rajoy took office a year ago , with a majority in the Cortes and control of most of the regional governments , expectations were high that Mariano Rajoy would move quickly to repair a broken financial system , push through long - shirked structural reforms to make the Spanish economy more competitive , and close a yawning fiscal gap ( see chart ) . 
 Disappointment set in swiftly . A property registrar by profession , Mariano Rajoy is the perfect civil servant , dogged and honest . But nobody could accuse Mariano Rajoy of communicating a bold vision . Mariano Rajoy's first mistake was to divide economic policy between two ministries and three men . Mariano Rajoy's second was to delay the 2012 budget in the hope of winning a regional election in the socialist bastion of Andalucia in March this year . The PP both failed to win the election and took six months longer than it might have to get going . 
 Nevertheless , Mariano Rajoy has achieved more than Mariano Rajoy is given credit for . The banking system is on the way to being fixed , at last . The government eventually nationalised four insolvent banks , including Bankia , a big one . Luis de Guindos , the economy minister , issued two decrees requiring the solvent banks -- which include the three biggest , Santander , BBVA and la Caixa -- to raise their capital to 10 % of risk - weighted assets and to ramp up their provisions against bad loans . 
 Striptease and family values 
 In what Cristobal Montoro , the budget minister , calls "" a banking striptease of a kind done by nobody else "" , the government invited international consultants , the European Commission and the IMF to go over the books of the financial system . In return , Spain has been granted up to EUR 100 billion from the EU to recapitalise the nationalised banks ( though it insists only EUR 40 billion is needed ) . In December banks will start dumping their dud property assets in a "" bad bank "" set up under the Bank of Spain at a discount of up to 63 % . 
 Not all the doubts about the banks have been cleared up . Half - a - dozen mid - sized ones may yet have to be nationalised . The banks may be required to compensate people who bought near - worthless preference shares . Even so , over the next year a healthy , though still shrinking , banking system will come into being , says Angel Laborda of Funcas , a think - tank . 
 While the government has been sorting out the banks , the Spanish economy has gone through a searing adjustment . Between 1.5 m and 2 m private - sector jobs have been lost since 2009 , says Mr Montoro . The current account moved into surplus in July in part because exports are growing impressively , but mainly because imports have slumped . A radical labour - market reform has made it less expensive to lay off workers , and allows firms to bypass the national unions and reach direct agreements with their staff . 
 The collapse of the property - induced revenue bubble left Spain with a structural fiscal deficit of 6 % of GDP , according to Fernando Fernandez of the Instituto de Empresa , a Madrid business school . The government raised VAT and income tax , and cut public - sector wages . The budget gave it draconian powers to control spending by regional governments , which given their parlous finances can no longer go to the markets for money . Some 230,000 fewer people work in the public sector than did in 2008 , says Cesar Cantalapiedra of Afi , a Madrid consultancy . 
 If change continues at the same pace Spain will be close to a primary fiscal surplus ( ie , before interest payments ) in two years . The biggest doubt is whether investors will finance the government at an interest rate it can afford . Since mid-2011 around EUR 350 billion has been withdrawn from Spain as foreign investors worried about a euro break - up . The pace of the outflow has slowed since July when Mario Draghi , the president of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , promised to do "" whatever it takes "" to save the euro , but the tide is still a way away from turning . 
 All told , the government needs to issue EUR 270 billion of debt in 2013 to cover expiring bonds and the deficit , according to Afi . It can not afford to pay an interest rate much more than 200 basis points over German bonds , which is the premium that the IMF reckons reflects the Spanish economy 's intrinsic risks . Keeping rates down requires a formal agreement between Spain and the ECB under which the bank would intervene in the markets when bond spreads rise . 
 Mariano Rajoy is tiptoeing towards such an agreement . An important potential obstacle was removed in November when Olli Rehn , the EU 's economic commissioner , accepted that Spain was making sufficient fiscal effort and needed to take no further steps at present . Insiders in Madrid say the only remaining obstacle is to secure the agreement of Germany 's Angela Merkel . 
 Mariano Rajoy promises that growth will return in 2014 . Can Spaniards hold out until then ? Despite the general strikes , so far Spain has seen no Greek - style riots , nor the emergence of political extremism . This is thanks , in part , to a welfare state on a scale Spain has never had before , and a large informal sector which means official unemployment is overstated ( though it also means a lot of lost revenue ) . Strong family networks help the unemployed to survive , if only in hardship -- some 300,000 workless households depend on a grandparent 's pension , according to Fundacion Social La Caixa . It is also true that , while Spaniards rail against bankers and politicians , many quietly recognise that the whole society was complicit in the boom . 
 Federalist papering over the cracks 
 While this all helps hold Spain together at one level , the Catalonian question threatens to pull it apart at another . But the problems are linked . The most powerful criticism of Mariano Rajoy is that Mariano Rajoy is cutting , rather than reforming , the multi - tiered public sector . Many Spaniards believe more radical change is needed -- and that this might be a way to appease Catalonia . 
 Mariano Rajoy recently set up a committee to reform all tiers of government . The Socialists , far from keen reformers in office , are in opposition proposing something more fundamental : a federalist settlement in which the regions get tax - raising powers and form the upper chamber of parliament . That is anathema to the PP . But Charles Powell , an historian at Madrid 's CEU - San Pablo university , says Mariano Rajoy should convene a special committee of the Cortes to look at a broader constitutional reform which , while nodding towards such federalism , would deliver "" regional autonomy 2.0 "" . 
 The problem with a constitutional process , says Jaime Perez Renovales , who chairs Mariano Rajoy's government - reform committee , is that "" you know how it starts but you do n't know how it ends "" . Even so , he sees room for an agreement with Catalonia : "" I think we 're condemned to understand each other "" . A Catalan who was once an official in Madrid sees "" a long and dirty negotiation "" . 
 The country is fragile , and its shock absorbers show signs of wear . The savings rate is falling as people draw on their reserves . Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba , the leader of the opposition Socialists , worries about an "" anti - political "" mood . Resigned pessimism "" could turn to anger in an afternoon , "" he says . The September 11th rally showed the power of Catalan nationalism , even if it is only the power of resentment . It will be Mariano Rajoy's hardest test .

AS VICTORIES go, it was a humiliation. Catalonia's premier, Artur Mas, had hoped to ride into history on the back of a surge in support for independence. Yet on November 25th he joined the list of European leaders hammered by austerity-exhausted voters. Although the polls had suggested that his Convergence and Union (CiU) coalition, which is more separatist than ever, would win an absolute majority, it got its worst result since 1980. After winning only 31% of the vote and losing a fifth of his deputies Mr Mas controls just 50 in the 135-seat assembly. He will get a second term, but with diminished authority. 
Yet the glee among Mr Mas's opponents was short-lived. The People's Party of Spain's prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, had also hoped to do well. In fact it came fourth, gaining just one extra seat, and has lost a valuable ally in Mr Mas, whom it had propped up for his previous two-year term. The result is a mess. Mr Mas is a reformist and fiscal conservative. But his new coalition partner is likely to be the Catalan Republican Left (ERC), which pumped up the deficit last time it shared power. Only a desire for greater sovereignty unites the two. But whereas the ERC, which more than doubled its number of deputies to 21, demands full independence, the CiU is split. Its minority component, the Catalan Democratic Union, is more restrained than Mr Mas, seeking at most a confederation. It also heartily dislikes the ERC. 
Things look worse still from Madrid. Instead of helping Mr Rajoy to reform the economy and cut public spending, CiU will now lurch into confrontation. It wants more tax money for Catalonia, but there is none to spare. The ERC will bind it to a promised referendum on independence that Mr Rajoy's government plans to reject. Years of sniping await. 
Catalan voters followed a Spanish trend by abandoning mainstream parties. The CiU, the Socialists and the PP won a combined 58% of the vote, down from 69% two years ago. Instead voters went to the ERC or the vehemently anti-separatist Citizens party. Mr Mas may wait four years before calling a referendum, meaning after the next general election. Yet even if Spain's Socialists then oust Mr Rajoy, their position on Catalonia is woolly at best, helping to create further uncertainty. 
Where did things go wrong for Mr Mas? Separatists claim that dark arts were used against him. They point to a purported police report connecting him and other bigwigs to foreign bank accounts that was leaked to the newspaper El Mundo. Mr Mas is suing. A recent general strike reminded voters of their biggest discontents: recession, austerity and joblessness. The OECD sees unemployment reaching 27% 
. Unusually high voting in working-class suburbs boosted the anti-separatist, left-wing vote. Against this, some complained about Mr Mas's largesse with the local press. Did subsidies buy loyalties, inflating the narrative of Mr Mas as a Moses leading his people to the promised land? 
The Catalan government's own Centre for Opinion Studies gave Mr Mas an absolute majority only two weeks ago. So can its figures on how Catalans would vote in an independence referendum (a 57% ""yes"") be trusted? Jordi Sauret, of Feedback pollsters, believes the number would fall to 45% or less in a real poll. 
Mr Mas cannily kept the word independence out of his manifesto and speeches. Instead he deployed a lexicon of ambiguity--""structures of state"" or ""sovereignty""--that left wiggle-room if things went wrong. They did.

In the worst atrocity of the conflict so far, around 400 people were massacred in the opposition town of Daraya.

Myanmar continued along its reform path, holding elections that returned Aung San Suu Kyi to parliament. She was allowed to travel abroad for the first time in 24 years; Barack Obama became the first American president to visit Burma. The Burmese spring was marred, however, by deadly ethnic rioting between local Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine state.

Shinzo Abe returned to his old job as prime minister; his previous one-year term is widely considered a disaster. 
Apple became the most valuable company ever (in nominal terms), beating the record that Microsoft hit in December 1999. Apple's share price peaked at $705 before entering bear territory and falling by 25%, to $510; at the start of 2012 it had been $410. 
America was much unchanged after November's general election, despite a record $2 billion spent on the presidential race that saw Barack Obama re-elected. The Republicans kept control of the House of Representatives and the Democrats the Senate; for the first time white men will no longer form the majority of the Democrats in the House (they still account for around 85% of the Republicans).

Mitt Romney picked off his challengers in a bruising round of primaries to become the Republican challenger in the election. His campaign was full of mishaps but the political lexicon was enriched by ""Etch-a-Sketch candidate"", ""binders full of women"", ""the 47%"" and ""retroactive retirement"". The highlight of the party convention was Clint Eastwood holding an imaginary conversation with a stool. 
There was significant political change in France when voters dumped Nicolas Sarkozy in favour of the Socialists' Francois Hollande. It was the first time the left had won a presidential election since 1988. Mr Hollande soon had to face up to tough choices on spending cuts that he avoided in the campaign. His approval rating sank to 35% after seven months in office, a record low. 
In other big presidential elections, Vladimir Putin vaulted back into office in Russia for a (non-successive) third term; Enrique Pena Nieto was victorious in Mexico; and Ma Ying-jeou was re-elected in Taiwan. Serbians turfed out Boris Tadic in favour of Tomislav Nikolic. To no one's surprise Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov won again in Turkmenistan. All the other candidates were from his autocratic party; he got 97% of the vote. 
Hugo Chavez was returned to office in Venezuela's presidential ballot, but less than two months later he revealed that his cancer had returned and he anointed his vice-president as his successor. 
O Star of wonder 
Xi Jinping emerged as China's new leader from its inscrutable process of selecting the general secretary of the Communist Party. Mr Xi's mysterious two-week absence from public view two months before his selection was never explained. 
Earlier China's elite was rocked by the biggest political scandal in decades when Bo Xilai was removed from the Politburo because of events stemming from the death of a British businessman. Mr Bo's wife was found guilty of murder at a speedy trial. The world was also enthralled by Chen Guangcheng's escape from house arrest. The blind civil-rights lawyer's arrival at the American embassy in Beijing caused a diplomatic spat, but he was eventually allowed to leave for the United States. 
A territorial dispute over the ownership of some rocky islands in the East China Sea produced a wave of anti-Japanese sentiment in China, and raised fears that sabre-rattling in the region could provoke a war. Business between the countries suffered. 
The once-hot BRIC economies cooled rapidly in 2012. India was criticised, notably by Barack Obama, for its perceived hostility to foreign investment. It proposed a budget laden with taxes aimed at overseas companies, but Parliament did pass a law that will allow foreign supermarkets to open shop. 
South Africans were shocked by scenes reminiscent of the apartheid era when police opened fire on striking miners at a platinum mine, killing 34 of them. The wave of unrest that followed the incident crippled the mining industry for several weeks. 
The most eagerly awaited IPO in years was deemed a flop. Facebook's shares soon sagged from the price of $38 set on its stockmarket debut; three months later they were under $18 (they have since risen). Critics said Facebook had set the price too high; still, the IPO raised $16 billion for the company and its early backers. 
It was a rocky year for some of the other tech titans. Markets lost count of the changes in chief executive at Yahoo!; Hewlett-Packard chalked up an $8.8 billion quarterly loss related to its acquisition of Autonomy; and BlackBerry saw its share of America's smartphone market fall to 1.6%. 
The banking world was rocked by the LIBOR rate-fixing scandal. Barclays admitted that some of its traders had colluded to manipulate the rate and Bob Diamond was forced to resign as chief executive. At the end of the year UBS paid $1.5 billion to regulators. 
Britain's coalition government skidded in the polls, especially after it presented a budget that cut the top rate of income tax while increasing the tax burden on pensioners, which was soon dubbed a ""granny tax"". Those provisions stayed, but George Osborne, the chancellor, reversed some of his budget's other politically unpalatable measures, such as a ""pasty tax"". He kept his job in David Cameron's first cabinet reshuffle. 
Joyful and triumphant 
Britain had its wettest summer in 100 years (which is saying something). Amid the gloom celebrations for the queen's Diamond Jubilee produced some sparkle for austerity-weary Brits, though it rained on the day and Prince Philip got a bladder infection. The queen was given a cameo (in a James Bond spoof) at the spectacular opening ceremony of the London Olympics, which were hailed as a great success. America's Michael Phelps added more medals to his haul and became the most decorated Olympian ever. 
Coalition casualties in Afghanistan were the lowest since 2008, though there was a rise of ""green-on-blue"" attacks by Taliban sympathisers in the Afghan forces against ISAF troops. In March an American soldier was charged with 16 counts of murder, including of nine children, after allegedly going on a shooting rampage in two villages. 
The International Criminal Court handed down its first-ever verdict and sentenced Thomas Lubanga, a Congolese warlord, to 14 years in prison. At a special court in The Hague Charles Taylor, a former president of Liberia, was sentenced to 50 years, the first African head of state to be convicted for war crimes. 
J.K. Rowling released digital versions of the Harry Potter books. It was a big moment for publishing: Ms Rowling bypassed Amazon and other online retailers so that the e-books can only be purchased directly from her own Pottermore website for download. 
A spaceman came travelling 
SpaceX became the first private company successfully to send a capsule to the International Space Station. China's ambitious space programme was boosted when the first Chinese crew docked a vessel, the Shenzhou-9, in space. On the edge of space Felix Baumgartner (above) broke the world free-fall record by jumping out of a capsule to plunge 39km (24 miles) to Earth in ten minutes. 
The top three internet search trends worldwide in 2012 on Google were ""Whitney Houston"", ""Gangnam style"" and ""Hurricane Sandy"". Other contenders included ""Pussy Riot"", ""Trayvon Martin shooting"", ""The Hunger Games"", ""Skyfall"" and ""Kate Middleton pictures released"".","The year saw opposition to the Assad regime in Syria escalate into full civil war. In the worst atrocity of the conflict so far, around 400 people were massacred in the opposition town of Daraya. The fighting reached Damascus, the capital, and the rebels gained control over large parts of the country. Turkey, which is sheltering thousands of refugees, occasionally exchanged artillery fire with Syria. The death toll this year is at least 30,000. 
Egypt, the font of the Arab spring,was plagued by further sporadic violence, including at a football match in February at which 74 people died in riots. Muhammad Morsi won a presidential election to become the first elected Islamist head of state in the Arab world. He proposed a new constitution that critics say is excessively Islamist and endangers minorities. 
The post-revolution National Transitional Council in Libya handed power over to an elected congress, though factional fighting continued. On September 11th the American ambassador was killed in an attack on the US consulate in Benghazi by armed militants. 
An air strike by Israel that killed the head of Hamas's military wing helped spark a week-long war in which 140-plus Palestinians in Gaza and six Israelis died, before Egypt brokered a ceasefire. Two weeks later Khaled Meshal, an exiled leader of Hamas, paid his first visit to Gaza since his movement took over in 2007. 
Myanmar continued along its reform path, holding elections that returned Aung San Suu Kyi to parliament. She was allowed to travel abroad for the first time in 24 years; Barack Obama became the first American president to visit Burma. The Burmese spring was marred, however, by deadly ethnic rioting between local Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine state. 
Always in the bleak midwinter 
South Korea affronted North Korea in the summer by suggesting the Hermit Kingdom would gradually reform and become more open under Kim Jong Un. Pyongyang retorted that this was ""ridiculous"" and ""a foolish and silly dream"". 
A lingering constitutional row in Pakistan came to a head when the Supreme Court sacked Yousaf Raza Gilani as prime minister for not following its order to reopen a corruption case against the president, Asif Ali Zardari. 
European leaders tackled the debt crisis in the euro zone at umpteen summits that proved largely unproductive. It was left to the European Central Bank to calm markets by pledging to do ""whatever it takes"" to save the euro. It announced an ""Outright Monetary Transactions"" programme to buy unlimited short-term government bonds from countries that ask for assistance and agree to a plan to reduce debt. 
The ECB's move was designed with Spain and Italy in mind. Spain had already requested help to shore up its struggling banks. Mariano Rajoy's government also contended with a surging independence movement in Catalonia; an election in the autonomous region proved inconclusive. 
The run-up to June's election in Greece produced a few jitters when left-wing parties threatened to tear up the country's bail-out agreement if elected. Markets breathed a sigh of relief when the centre-right New Democracy formed a coalition government. 
After three weak and divided years in office, the ruling Democratic Party of Japan lost an election.

HE HAD hoped to dig Spain out of its hole without raising taxes, cutting services or hurting pensioners. But 12 months after he became prime minister, Mariano Rajoy has broken all of these pledges. Spain has more unemployed, more debt and a deeper recession. ""For many it has been a year of pain and suffering,"" he has admitted. 
Yet it could have been even worse. Spain's public finances have not collapsed. Nor has the euro. Both seemed possible when Mr Rajoy took power. And during 2012 the budget deficit has shrunk by almost 2% of GDP, says Jose Ignacio Conde-Ruiz of Madrid's Complutense university. ""That is pretty good in a recession""--even if it is not as big a change as Spain's euro-zone partners wanted. 
Mr Rajoy took over an economy entering recession, with 23% out of work, a budget deficit of 8.9% of GDP and a public debt at 69%. After a year of tax increases, spending cuts and bank rescues, only the deficit has improved. Unemployment is now 26%, debt has soared to 91% and GDP is due to shrink by almost 3% in his first two years. Property prices have fallen by 15% in the 12 months to September. 
Mr Rajoy's right-wing People's Party (PP) thought its mere presence in government would be enough to calm the markets. Holding off a first budget until April, after elections in Andalusia, wasted time. In March Mr Rajoy declared Spain's sovereign right to fix its own deficit target. But beggars cannot be choosers. By June Mr Rajoy was forced to ask for up to EUR 100 billion ($125 billion) to rescue the banks. So much for sovereignty. 
At least the bank rescue, at a cost of up to EUR 50 billion, has so far turned out cheaper than was feared. Regional governments, which pushed the deficit off-target, are being tamed. And labour reforms allow wage cuts to make Spain more competitive. Predictions of recovery in 2014 are credible, even if Spaniards face a harsh 2013. 
It was not Mr Rajoy who saved Spain, but Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank (ECB). Early in 2012 he flooded banks with cheap money. And the news that the ECB would back a new ""soft"" bail-out by intervening in bond markets kept Spain from a humiliating rescue like those for Portugal, Greece and Ireland. The announcement sharply reduced Spanish bond yields. 
Yet it was also assumed that Mr Rajoy would ask for a bail-out, which he has not done. Some suggest he may now wait until after the German election, or try to avoid a bail-out altogether. Spain must raise EUR 230 billion in the markets in 2013. 
High interest rates are holding back recovery. Debt service will consume a big chunk of central-government spending in 2013. And the knock-on effects are damaging Spanish companies. Smaller firms cannot export or compete abroad without cheaper credit, warns Joaquin Trigo of the Institute of Economic Studies, a think-tank. Fitch, a credit ratings agency, says the housing-market overhang left over from a burst property bubble is also a big problem. According to Fitch, some 1.2m houses are empty and unsold, of which 200,000 are foreclosed properties; but with banks unwilling or unable to lend, demand is at rock bottom. 
With the outlook so grim, it is no surprise that Catalan politicians talk seriously of secession. But Mr Rajoy has few options. He must hold his course, pray that his reforms pay off--and, almost certainly, ask Mr Draghi to come to the rescue again.","Mariano Rajoy endured a torrid first 12 months--2013 is likely to be grim , too

IN MADRID ministers brag that they have turned a corner. Euro-zone bond yields have been hitting new low levels . Spain's banking and labour reforms are now in place. Growth will revive later this year or in 2014. Jobs, the Spanish El Dorado, will eventually follow. 
But that is surely too rosy a view. Exports are growing and the current account is now in surplus, but even the government sees GDP shrinking by 0.5% in 2013 (and most analysts talk of 1.5%). Spaniards are suffering an aching spell of record unemployment, at 26.6%. Austerity means worsening public services just as real wage and pension cuts make people poorer. The biggest asset for many families, their house, is plunging in value, with a further 20% price fall expected. Higher income, sales and housing taxes will hit spending power further. Business confidence and retail sales are in retreat. And a housing glut will take years to digest. Only 25,655 of what Fitch, a ratings agency, says are 1.2m unsold Spanish houses were bought in November. 
Spain must eventually emerge from all this. But will Spaniards put up with extended pain? Or will they rebel against a political establishment that has failed them? So far they have been quietly dignified. Peaceful demonstrators have made more headlines than violent protesters. Yet days lost to strikes are at a ten-year high. A budget deficit of 7-8% of GDP in 2012 must be cut this year. The European Union has set a 4.5% target, though it may relax this. Investment has already been slashed so future cuts must fall on public health, education, pensions and welfare services. 
Polls show most politicians in the doghouse. Barely half of all Spaniards back the two parties that have governed for three decades: the ruling People's Party (PP) of Mariano Rajoy or the opposition Socialists. The communist-led United Left has surged to almost 16%, while Rosa Diez's centrist Union for Progress and Democracy stands at 10%. Spaniards blame the Socialist government of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero for dropping them in the mess, and Mr Rajoy's PP for failing to get them out of it, says Juan Jose Toharia of Metroscopia, a pollster. Only one in six Spaniards has confidence in Mr Rajoy. 
That may also explain why he is so anxious to dodge the euro-zone bail-outs that led to changes of government in Greece, Ireland and Portugal. With bond yields heading down, thanks to the European Central Bank (ECB), the pressure has eased. As long as this holds, Mr Rajoy can avoid the new soft bail-out under which the ECB promises to buy Spanish bonds on the secondary market. Josep Comajuncosa of the Esade business school now sees only a 50% chance of a formal bail-out. Renewed market nervousness could yet force one; and a bail-out that slashed borrowing costs would speed recovery, even if it damaged Mr Rajoy. But his ministers still see it as a silver bullet that is all the better for being left unused. 
Mr Rajoy has time on his side. He is only a year into a four-year term and enjoys an absolute majority in parliament. Catalonia is rumbling, but any stand-off over independence has been postponed two years or more. In electoral terms, he need fret about the economy only in 2016. He wants Germany to stimulate growth to help Spanish exports. 
But Spaniards are shedding their enthusiasm for an EU that seems to impose austerity and prevents devaluation. Only 4% thought the EU was bad for Spain five years ago, but now 37% do. A century ago the philosopher Jose Ortega y Gasset declared that ""Spain is the problem, Europe is the answer"".

WITH Europe prostrate and much of Latin America rising fast, you might have expected what was once the junior partner in a transatlantic ""strategic association"" to be calling the shots. But no: at a biennial summit with the European Union in Chile's capital, Santiago, on January 26th and 27th and at a get-together of CELAC, the community of Latin American and Caribbean nations, on the following day, the Latins seemed determined to display both internal divisions and their addiction to the gesture politics of the past. 
Perhaps that was why, with the exception of Germany's Angela Merkel and Spain's Mariano Rajoy, Europe's more important leaders did not bother to make the long trip. The main potential item of business was long-stalled trade talks between the EU and Mercosur, the trade block led by Brazil and Argentina. These began in the 1990s. ""But on the core issue of access to each other's markets we have still not gotten down to business,"" lamented Karel De Gucht, the EU's trade commissioner. 
Argentina and Brazil promised the EU that they would restart the talks, but with little apparent enthusiasm. Cristina Fernandez, Argentina's president, tweeted that she wouldn't agree to any deal that exposes Argentine companies to what she regards as unfair competition from Europe. She was reported as telling Brazil's Dilma Rousseff that she wanted to resile from Mercosur's negotiating position. (Ms Fernandez got Latin American support in Santiago, but not in the EU-CELAC communique, for her demand that Britain negotiate on the status of the Falkland Islands.) 
Mercosur's main achievement in the past year has been to suspend Paraguay, because its congress impeached its left-wing president, and admit Venezuela, which complies with few of the group's rules. Meanwhile, it is being outshone by the Pacific Alliance, a newly formed group of faster-growing, free-trading Colombia, Chile, Mexico and Peru. Not by coincidence, these four already have free-trade deals with the EU. It was clear which countries the Europeans wanted to do business with.""We only have to look at the facts,"" Mr De Gucht said. ""The most open economies in the region are the ones that have had the most success."" Others have taken notice: Paraguay and Uruguay, another Mercosur member, have applied for observer status at the Alliance. 
Many Latin American leaders still like to wage past political battles. CELAC was founded in 2010 as a regional body that included Cuba and excluded the United States and Canada. But its message--that Latin America is a region of more self-confident and independent democracies--was undermined when its rotating presidency passed in Santiago to Raul Castro, Cuba's 81-year-old unelected dictator, a living symbol of the cold war. Mrs Merkel's dealings with the new leader of Latin America apparently went no further than a perfunctory handshake.

WITH Europe prostrate and much of Latin America rising fast, you might have expected what was once the junior partner in a transatlantic ""strategic association"" to be calling the shots. But no: at a biennial summit with the European Union in Chile's capital, Santiago, on January 26th and 27th and at a get-together of CELAC, the community of Latin American and Caribbean nations, on the following day, the Latins seemed determined to display both internal divisions and their addiction to the gesture politics of the past.

MARIANO RAJOY, Spain's conservative prime minister, likes to say that he ""owes nothing to nobody"", a reference to his independence from the Catholic church, corporate Spain and the regional barons of his Popular Party (PP). Yet to many Spaniards those words now ring hollow. Handwritten account-books purported to have been kept by Luis Barcenas, the PP's former treasurer, have been leaked to the press. They seem to show that for more than a decade the party's leaders received payments--around EUR 25,000 ($34,000) a year in Mr Rajoy's case--from a slush fund whose donors were mainly construction magnates . Mr Rajoy, who has a reputation for personal honesty, insists the allegation is false, that he has never received cash he did not declare, and that the accounts are ""apocryphal"". He has promised to publish his tax returns and the party is organising an external audit. 
Some of those on the list have confirmed that they received payments. But the list may have been embellished; or, if payments were made, they may have been for expenses, duly declared and receipted. Still, the awkward fact for Mr Rajoy is that until 2011 he worked closely with Mr Barcenas, a man with EUR 22m in a Swiss bank account, according to a judge, and under investigation in a separate corruption scandal involving PP workers. A former PP parliamentarian has also claimed that the party's leaders received ""top-up"" payments in cash. 
Mr Rajoy has brushed off opposition calls that he should resign. Elected only 15 months ago, he has an absolute majority in parliament. A poll this week found that the affair has cost Mr Rajoy's party a fifth of its diminishing public support in a month, but the opposition Socialists are no more popular. Having introduced harsh measures to stabilise the economy, Mr Rajoy is betting on a recovery well before the next election in 2015. By then, he may calculate, the furore will have died down. The amounts involved are not neglible, but Spanish corruption is hardly in the Italian league. His word will be tested by the judiciary--but that will take many years. 
Open up Spain's books 
Regardless of Mr Rajoy's guilt or innocence, that is not good enough. To restore the credibility of his government, the prime minister should set up a swift and independent public inquiry. That is not a Spanish habit, but it should be. 
Around 6m Spaniards are officially unemployed, and others face salary cuts as a result of the country's grinding recession and housing bust. Spaniards--and other Europeans, who have bailed out Spain's banks--have a right to know whether the construction companies which inflated the housing bubble bankrolled the PP and, if so, what they got in return. 
The economic crisis has exposed flaws in many of the institutions put in place during the country's transition to democracy in the 1970s. Lax moral standards have affected the monarchy--King Juan Carlos's son-in-law is being investigated for corruption--and the judiciary, whose head resigned last year for using public funds for private trips. Spain's democracy has given too much unaccountable power to the two main parties. Not only did they colonise the now-broken cajas (savings banks), the judiciary and the civil service, but they also developed a sense of entitlement, never bothering to put in place proper rules for their financing. (The Socialists and Catalan nationalists are unlikely to be much cleaner than the PP.) 
The problem facing Spain is that the only people who can clean up this mess are those who created it. Alongside a proper inquiry, Mr Rajoy should start cross-party talks to reform the party system. Otherwise both he and his traditional opponents may drown in a wave of angry populism.","If democracy is to retain Spaniards ' trust , the country 's political parties must be reformed

A CHORIZO is a spicy Spanish sausage, best accompanied by a glass of Rioja, though often sliced and served in a doughy bocadillo, or sandwich. Chorizo is also slang for a swindler or cheat. At protests against Mariano Rajoy's government demonstrators have taken to waving loaves aloft and shouting: ""There isn't enough bread for so many chorizos!"" 
Now the allegations have touched Mr Rajoy directly. ""Never, ever have I received or handed out black money,"" he insisted on January 21st. But revelations from Spain's two main newspapers, El Pais and El Mundo, claim otherwise. They allege that slush money flowed liberally through the headquarters of Mr Rajoy's Popular Party (PP) for at least two decades. Some of it supposedly went straight into the pockets of the party's leaders. ""Envelopes with cash were handed out as salary top-ups to certain top party officials,"" said Jorge Trias Sagnier, a former PP deputy and the only whistleblower so far to go on the record. 
The allegations, although denied by almost everyone who has been implicated, have turned into a full-blown scandal. The most serious evidence, contained in secret ledgers purportedly kept by the party's chief accountant, show Mr Rajoy receiving EUR 25,000 ($34,000) a year for a decade. On February 3rd, standing by Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor, at a press conference in Berlin, a nervous Mr Rajoy protested that ""except for a few bits"" the ledger entries were false. 
The pivotal character in the scandal is Luis Barcenas, a party administrator for two decades, whom the party made a senator in 2004 and Mr Rajoy himself promoted to treasurer in 2008. Courts began investigating Mr Barcenas four years ago amid allegations that he was among the beneficiaries of a backhander scheme run by local party members in Madrid and Valencia. Mr Rajoy stood by his man and the PP paid for his defence. But Mr Barcenas eventually stood down, as both treasurer and senator. Rumours spread that he had taken away incriminating documents. 
The bombshell came last month when court investigators discovered that Mr Barcenas had a EUR 22m Swiss bank account. He also admitted to using a tax amnesty last year to declare EUR 10m of hidden money. 
The 14-page ledger, published by El Pais, is said by some handwriting experts to be in Mr Barcenas's hand. It appears to show that much of the PP's secret fund came from construction magnates who received public contracts and helped inflate Spain's disastrous real-estate bubble. Regular cash-in-hand payments to the PP's leaders supposedly carried on even while they held public office, continuing until 2009, five years after Mr Rajoy became leader. 
Some recipients of loans and other payments acknowledged having received money, but said that they were entirely legal. They include Pio Garcia-Escudero, the senate president. Press reports are agreed that the slush fund was shut down several years ago. For the rest, the evidence is either confusing, of unknown provenance or both. Certainly, Mr Rajoy and the rest of his party deny it all. The prime minister's denial of self-enrichment deserves credence, as this is the first suggestion that he is anything less than squeaky clean. 
On the other hand, El Mundo has quoted five unnamed sources who spoke of regular cash-in-hand payments to party leaders. And voters are beginning to latch on to the idea that Mr Rajoy ran a party which hid, distributed and lied about dirty money. Four out of five Spaniards believe the PP's leadership should resign en bloc. Just over half want a snap general election. 
Will the scandal bring down Mr Rajoy's government? It has a comfortable parliamentary majority and three years until a general election. Spain's courts proceed slowly. They have only just started hearing the trial related to a ring of world-ranking cyclists and other athletes who allegedly doped themselves at the Madrid clinic of a doctor first arrested in 2006. 
Yet the damage to Spain cannot be measured by the fate of a single party at the next general election. Spaniards have lost respect for their politicians. Other parties, especially the Convergence and Union coalition, which runs Catalonia, are knee-deep in allegations of corruption. The opposition Socialists have cases rumbling, too, especially in places where mayors and real-estate developers seemingly fell into a toxic embrace. Polls show that 96% of Spaniards believe many politicians are on the take. Support for the main parties has tumbled over the past year, as a double-dip recession deepened and unemployment climbed to 26%. The king's son-in-law, Inaki Urdangarin, and his business partner were recently told to post a EUR 8.1m bail after being investigated for corruption charges that also involve regional PP governments. 
A recent poll gave the two big parties, which have run Spain for the past three decades, only 46% of the vote. The political settlement Spaniards agreed on as they emerged from dictatorship in the 1970s gave huge power to the parties to solidify democracy. This may have backfired. ""Having created the monster, we are being devoured by it,"" says Antonio Argandona at IESE, a business school. 
In 2011 the country's legion of indignados took over city squares, shouting: ""They don't represent us"". They have even more reason to be indignant now.","The ruling conservative party is shaken by a damaging corruption scandal

The opposition Socialists have cases rumbling , too , especially in places where mayors and real - estate developers seemingly fell into a toxic embrace . Polls show that 96 % of Spaniards believe many politicians are on the take . Support for the main parties has tumbled over the past year , as a double - dip recession deepened and unemployment climbed to 26 % . The king 's son - in - law , Inaki Urdangarin , and his business partner were recently told to post a EUR 8.1 m bail after being investigated for corruption charges that also involve regional PP governments . 
 A recent poll gave the two big parties , which have run Spain for the past three decades , only 46 % of the vote . The political settlement Spaniards agreed on as they emerged from dictatorship in the 1970s gave huge power to the parties to solidify democracy . This may have backfired . "" Having created the monster , we are being devoured by it , "" says Antonio Argandona at IESE , a business school . 
 In 2011 the country 's legion of indignados took over city squares , shouting : "" They do n't represent us "" . They have even more reason to be indignant now .",230,Spain,A30-57,IN TERM,True,Mariano Rajoy 's,17,True

IS SPAIN the next Germany? It may not feel like that to the 26% of Spaniards who are unemployed. GDP shrank by 0.8% in the fourth quarter of 2012. Yet in some ways, Spain resembles the Germany of a decade ago, when Gerhard Schroder brought in reforms to turn the sick man of Europe into its strongest economy. The efforts by Mariano Rajoy's government to loosen labour laws and cut public spending are aimed at a German-style miracle. 
Mr Rajoy claims that his government will lead the economy out of recession. There are early, if shaky, signs of progress. Unit labour costs are falling, partly because productivity is climbing. The current account has turned positive. And the number of self-employed workers is starting to rise even as unemployment increases. 
Joachim Fels, chief economist at Morgan Stanley, is one of several backers of the Germany theory. ""Spain is doing a lot of the things Germany did ten years ago, but in a much shorter time span and tougher global conditions,"" he says, pointing to falling labour costs, rising exports and booming Spanish car factories. But, he adds, ""Spain becoming Germany is really a two- to four-year story."" 
Yet the differences are huge. Germany's education and training system is more job-friendly than Spain's. The German recovery was spurred by tax cuts, but Mr Rajoy has raised taxes to reduce a budget deficit which was still 6.7% of GDP in 2012. The huge cut in the structural deficit, claims Mr Rajoy, was a first for an advanced economy. But austerity has contributed to a collapse in consumer spending. And exports are stalling as the euro zone, Spain's biggest market, is in recession. 
More austerity awaits, so tax rates are unlikely to fall. Indeed, the pressure from the European Union is for another sales-tax rise. And as Spanish banks, helped by European rescue money, clean up their books, a credit squeeze is strangling growth. The IMF notes that interest rates are far above the euro average, especially for small firms that create most jobs. 
The government says growth will return later this year or in 2014. But the recovery looks fragile even before it starts. More euro shocks could tip the economy back down again. Italy is a particular concern. If bond markets lose faith in Spain's Mediterranean neighbour after its chaotic election, contagion could spread. ""There is still insufficient differentiation between Spain and Italy,"" says Nicholas Spiro, of Spiro Sovereign Strategy, who notes that Spain's fundamentals are worse than Italy's. ""There's always the risk that the woes of one country will drag down the other."" 
And if Spain does grow again, will that be enough to create jobs and restore confidence? Lorenzo Bernaldo de Quiros, an economist, believes that labour reforms mean that, whereas net job creation used to need 2.5% GDP growth, now it takes only 1.5%. Yet most analysts see GDP shrinking by 1.5% this year. Making predictions for 2014 is a mug's game. Like Germany in 2003, Spain still has far to go.

ALFREDO PEREZ RUBALCABA, leader of Spain's beleaguered opposition Socialists, is a man with a noose around his neck. It is slowly tightening. More than a year after his party lost power its poll ratings remain below those of Mariano Rajoy's Popular Party (PP). They are five points down on their November 2011 election result, standing at just 23%. 
This is remarkable. Spain's economy has tumbled deeper into recession under the premiership of Mr Rajoy. A further 700,000 people have joined the dole queues, pushing unemployment to 26.2% of the workforce. And as the value of their homes falls further, frightened Spanish consumers are keeping purses zipped tight. Many must raid savings to get by. 
Wage earners and pensioners are all getting poorer. Of the more needy, 1.9m unemployed do not receive state benefits. And, as Spaniards digest tax rises and spending cuts, protests from health, education and other public workers are a daily occurrence. 
Mr Rajoy's PP, meanwhile, is engulfed in a corruption scandal. The man he appointed party treasurer, Luis Barcenas, hid EUR 22m ($28.5m) in Switzerland. Newspapers allege he ran a secret party slush-fund with senior PP noses in the trough. Promises of green pastures further down the road of austerity have yet to convince voters. The PP's poll ratings have fallen from 45% to 24% since the election. 
So why are the Socialists not storming ahead? Many Spaniards blame them for the current mess. A once buoyant economy crashed on the watch of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, a Socialist prime minister. Mr Rubalcaba, as deputy prime minister, was associated with the debacle. The party, meanwhile, is digging its own grave. Its Catalan wing rebelled in parliament recently, backing Catalonia's ""right to decide"" on its future. That scares Socialist voters in other parts of Spain. But Mr Rubalcaba's opposition to the idea puts off potential supporters in Catalonia, where Mr Zapatero anchored his victories. A messy town-hall coup in northern Ponferrada, which saw local Socialists ally with the convicted protagonist of a nasty sexual harassment case, showed the party in further disarray. 
Mr Rubalcaba himself remains a problem. He has clung to the top job despite leading the party to an historic defeat in 2011. The 61-year-old veteran not only bears the Zapatero stigma, but also that of a minister in Felipe Gonzalez's 1990s governments. He is hardly a bright new broom for jaundiced left-wing voters. Some party leaders say so openly. ""Many others agree with me,"" said Tomas Gomez, a prominent rebel who heads the Madrid party branch. 
Mr Gomez may fancy himself as a candidate for the premiership, as does Patxi Lopez, the popular former Basque regional president. Better bets are a former defence minister, Carme Chacon, aged 42, or one of the party's parliamentary bosses, Eduardo Madina. Ms Chacon was narrowly beaten for the leadership by Mr Rubalcaba at a conference last year. She broke ranks with her Catalan colleagues to abstain in the vote on the ""right to decide"" in a tactical bid to stay in the running. Mr Madina is just 37, yet still experienced. He also wins sympathy for overcoming a terrorist bomb attack that blew off part of his leg. But he might not yet want the job. 
Analysts predict that the economy will shrink by 1.5% this year; recovery in 2014 is uncertain. The European Commission expects unemployment will still be stuck above 26% next year. Elections will probably be held at the end of 2015. Austerity-exhausted Spaniards may demand change.

SPANIARDS used to complain that housing cost too much. Now they fret that, with unemployment at 26% and incomes tumbling, they can no longer afford it at any price. The Spanish are among Europe's keenest owner-occupiers, with 83% living in their own homes. A culture of immobility means that, once a home is bought, it is expected to be for life. For Mariano Rajoy's government, the problem of repossessions is thus a big headache. 
The pre-crash bubble saw Spaniards borrow merrily, owing almost twice as much in mortgages as Italians by 2010. The total debt is falling gradually, but is still around EUR 600 billion ($780 billion). Some 8% of mortgage-holders are now jobless. Last year 80 families a day had mortgages foreclosed, with their properties usually valued far below the purchase price. Many owe money on homes they no longer own or live in. Passions are running high. A vociferous protest movement blocks the doorways of houses due to be repossessed. It obtained 1.4m signatures on a petition demanding a retroactive law to allow American-style mortgages, where the keys (and ownership) can be dumped on the banks. 
This spooked banks already struggling with toxic assets from bust developers. With half a million mortgaged properties in negative equity, many mortgage-holders would be better-off handing their homes over. ""If half of the potential beneficiaries took advantage of the measure, the non-performing loan rate could triple,"" says Maria Romero of Analistas Financieras Internacionales in a paper. 
The government has now passed a watered-down law to stop banks foreclosing until mortgagees are three months in arrears. Poorer families have two years. It also capped interest rates, which can reach 25%, and includes only a very modest version of the key-return idea. Banks breathed a sigh of relief, however. Spain's finance sector is undergoing a huge restructuring with EUR 41 billion of European bail-out money. Nobody wants a return to last year, when Bankia alone declared losses of over EUR 19 billion. With more than 600,000 new homes still unsold, a flood of new properties onto the market would hurt both banks and house prices. Ripples would extend, as Spain has Europe's second-largest mortgage-securitisation market. 
For banks, the situation is not yet drastic. Mortgage delinquency is running at 3.5%, below the overall non-performing loan rate of 10.4%. It is not worse because many mortgages have guarantors (often family members), interest rates are low and the average loan to value is just over 60%, says Fitch, a ratings agency. Yet last year banks resold foreclosed properties at only 40% of the original value. Defaults will rise as long as the economy is stalled. Last year, even before the new law, more than a third of foreclosures were key drops. Foreign owners may flee the country: Spain's foreign population fell by 216,000 last year. Ecuador has already passed a law to stop Spanish banks pursuing returnees. 
The government cannot afford further bail-outs. Its 2012 budget deficit was 10.6% of GDP. Rescuing banks accounted for over a third of that. And Spain must cut the underlying deficit to 4.5%, even as the economy contracts. Fresh budget measures are expected, and there are hopes that Brussels will relax the target. 
Now regional governments are punishing banks for their empty housing stock. Andalusia and the Canary Islands will either expropriate or fine them for empty properties. Catalonia wants to tax them. Joaquin Trigo, of the Institute for Economic Studies think-tank, suggests a different solution: regional governments could rent from the banks and sublet to the needy.","After the house - price crash come the repossessions -- and the angry response

ON MAY 23rd in the Colombian city of Cali the presidents of four Latin American countries--Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru--will sign an agreement removing tariffs on 90% of their merchandise trade. They will also agree on a timetable of no more than seven years for eliminating tariffs on the remaining 10%. They have already removed visa requirements for each other's citizens and will proclaim their aspiration to move swiftly towards setting up a common market. 
The Pacific Alliance, as the group calls itself, is ""the most exciting thing going on in Latin America today"", according to Felipe Larrain, Chile's finance minister. Some outsiders think so, too. Costa Rica and Panama want to join; Canada's prime minister, Stephen Harper, and his Spanish counterpart, Mariano Rajoy, have said they will attend the Cali meeting as observers. 
Behind the excitement is the sense that the Pacific Alliance is a hard-nosed business deal, rather than the usual gassy rhetoric of Latin American summitry. Under the leftist governments that rule in much of South America, there has been plenty of talk of regional integration, but precious little practice of it. Intra-regional trade makes up just 27% of total trade in South and Central America, compared with 63% in the European Union and 52% in Asia. 
The Pacific Alliance aspires to change that. ""It is based on affinity, rather than proximity,"" says Jose Antonio Garcia Belaunde, a former Peruvian foreign minister who was instrumental in launching the group in 2011. ""It's integration with those who are capable of doing it."" 
The four founding members are free-market and mainly fast-growing economies which have embraced globalisation, with a web of regional trade-agreements and expanding commercial ties to Asia. Their combined GDP is around $2 trillion--35% of the Latin American total and not much less than that of Brazil, the region's giant (see table). 
The private sectors in the member countries have played a big role in setting the Alliance's priorities. The stock exchanges of Chile, Colombia and Peru have created a single regional bourse. Negotiators are working to smooth border procedures and standardise rules, such as on labelling. They are making progress in talks to harmonise the rules of origin--how much local content goods must have to be tariff-free--in their existing trade agreements with each other. ""They are trying to resolve the problem of the spaghetti bowl of regional trade-agreements,"" says Antoni Estevadeordal of the Inter-American Development Bank. This ""exercise in regulatory convergence"" could be a model for other parts of the world, he adds. 
Open regionalism 
The Pacific Alliance marks a return to the principles of ""open regionalism""--the idea, prevalent in Latin America in the 1990s, that opening up to world trade would be more advantageous if combined with creating a deeper regional market, to reap economies of scale. This idea lay behind the founding in 1991 of Mercosur, a group originally comprising Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. 
But the left-wing governments in charge of those countries for much of the past decade have turned Mercosur into a different kind of enterprise. ""Today it is almost wholly a political front"" with ""protectionist internal tendencies which frequently collide with Mercosur's original principles,"" according to Luiz Felipe Lampreia, a former foreign minister of Brazil. 
This was underlined last year when the other members suspended Paraguay (because of the impeachment of its left-wing president) and admitted Venezuela, then governed by Hugo Chavez. Under Brazil's aegis, much of Chavez's anti-American ALBA block is being absorbed by Mercosur. On May 9th Brazil's president, Dilma Rousseff welcomed Nicolas Maduro, Chavez's chosen successor who was narrowly elected as president last month, and affirmed their ""strategic partnership"". Brazil is also seeking closer ties with Cuba, which this month offered to send 6,000 doctors to the country. 
Brazil's two main regional partners, Argentina and Venezuela, have slow-growing, state-controlled economies, and their policies flirt with autarchy. That makes them captive markets for Brazilian construction companies and exporters of otherwise uncompetitive capital goods. Brazil had a trade surplus of $4 billion with Venezuela last year. 
In the wider world, Mercosur has signed regional trade agreements only with Israel, Egypt and the Palestinian Authority. Argentina has stalled a proposed trade deal with the European Union, on which talks began in 1999. Brazil's bet has been on the Doha round of world trade talks. It was cheered when Roberto Azevedo, a Brazilian diplomat, was chosen this month to head the World Trade Organisation (WTO). But many trade specialists consider the Doha round all but dead and the WTO increasingly irrelevant. In practice, trade policy is ""not a priority"" for Ms Rousseff's government, which is ""very focused on the domestic market"", says Welber Barral, a former trade official. 
This stance alarms Brazil's opposition and some of its businessmen, who fear that the country has cut itself off from global value chains for manufactured products. ""Either Brazil makes up for lost time and reformulates its trade-negotiation strategy, or it will become ever more isolated in the real world of global trade and investment,"" Rubens Barbosa, a former diplomat and consultant for the Sao Paulo industrialists' federation, wrote recently. 
That is the world in which the Pacific Alliance aspires to a growing role. But the kind of regional supply chains that link China to its neighbours barely exist in Latin America, beyond a few niche businesses, such as some textile products. Mexico has built those links with the United States, but not with its southern neighbours. Creating them involves surmounting vast distances: Tijuana is roughly as far from Punta Arenas as the Shetland Islands are from Cape Town. And transport connections are poor. Mr Estevadeordal sees the Alliance as an incentive to develop the ""physical hardware of integration"", such as ports and other transport systems. 
In its short life, the Pacific Alliance has proved to be a brilliant piece of diplomatic marketing. Now it has to add substance. If it does so, Mercosur may find itself hard put to match the Pacific countries' race to develop. The South American countries in the two camps insist that they are not rivals, but friends. Nevertheless, a contest has begun. With the waning of the great commodity boom, which benefited the whole of South America, future economic growth will have to come from productivity, investment and efficiency. It is these the Pacific Alliance hopes to achieve.","The region is falling in behind two alternative blocks : the market - led Pacific Alliance and the more statist Mercosur

Brazil is also seeking closer ties with Cuba , which this month offered to send 6,000 doctors to the country . 
 Brazil 's two main regional partners , Argentina and Venezuela , have slow - growing , state - controlled economies , and their policies flirt with autarchy . That makes them captive markets for Brazilian construction companies and exporters of otherwise uncompetitive capital goods . Brazil had a trade surplus of $ 4 billion with Venezuela last year . 
 In the wider world , Mercosur has signed regional trade agreements only with Israel , Egypt and the Palestinian Authority . Argentina has stalled a proposed trade deal with the European Union , on which talks began in 1999 . Brazil 's bet has been on the Doha round of world trade talks . It was cheered when Roberto Azevedo , a Brazilian diplomat , was chosen this month to head the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) . But many trade specialists consider the Doha round all but dead and the WTO increasingly irrelevant . In practice , trade policy is "" not a priority "" for Ms Rousseff 's government , which is "" very focused on the domestic market "" , says Welber Barral , a former trade official . 
 This stance alarms Brazil 's opposition and some of its businessmen , who fear that the country has cut itself off from global value chains for manufactured products . "" Either Brazil makes up for lost time and reformulates its trade - negotiation strategy , or it will become ever more isolated in the real world of global trade and investment , "" Rubens Barbosa , a former diplomat and consultant for the Sao Paulo industrialists ' federation , wrote recently . 
 That is the world in which the Pacific Alliance aspires to a growing role . But the kind of regional supply chains that link China to its neighbours barely exist in Latin America , beyond a few niche businesses , such as some textile products . Mexico has built those links with the United States , but not with its southern neighbours . Creating them involves surmounting vast distances : Tijuana is roughly as far from Punta Arenas as the Shetland Islands are from Cape Town . And transport connections are poor . Mr Estevadeordal sees the Alliance as an incentive to develop the "" physical hardware of integration "" , such as ports and other transport systems . 
 In its short life , the Pacific Alliance has proved to be a brilliant piece of diplomatic marketing . Now it has to add substance . If it does so , Mercosur may find itself hard put to match the Pacific countries ' race to develop . The South American countries in the two camps insist that they are not rivals , but friends . Nevertheless , a contest has begun . With the waning of the great commodity boom , which benefited the whole of South America , future economic growth will have to come from productivity , investment and efficiency . It is these the Pacific Alliance hopes to achieve .",230,Spain,A30-57,IN TERM,True,"Canada 's prime minister , Stephen Harper , and his Spanish counterpart , Mariano Rajoy ,",2,True

THE gloom in Spain is almost palpable. Yet two years on from the protests begun in Madrid by young Spaniards known as los indignados, most accept their lot with resignation. The government of Mariano Rajoy is unpopular, but so is the opposition. And whereas many other stricken euro-zone countries blame the Germans for their woes, Spaniards recognise that they are paying for their own excesses, especially the burst property bubble. 
The numbers are grim. The economy is in deep recession. In the first three months of the year GDP shrank for a seventh quarter in a row. The public finances remain stretched, with the budget deficit at 7% of GDP. Bond yields have fallen, but the credit crunch for small firms is worsening. Corporate bankruptcies are running at ten times pre-crisis levels. And unemployment is at a record 27% (see box, next page). 
Spain could be the biggest test for the euro. Four countries--Greece, Ireland, Portugal and most recently Cyprus--have been bailed out and are in programmes agreed on with the ""troika"" of the IMF, the European Union and the European Central Bank. But Spain is the only big euro member that has come close to a bail-out. Instead, it last year took a halfway offer of EUR 100 billion ($129 billion) support from the European bail-out fund for its banks (it drew EUR 41 billion). Unlike France, it has made big structural reforms. Unlike Italy, it has a strong government that expects to last until the next election in late 2015. 
Moreover, a few glimmers of hope can be discerned amid the gloom. Thanks to the ECB, long-term bond yields have fallen back to pre-crisis levels. Sharp fiscal consolidation has trimmed the budget deficit from 11% of GDP in 2009 to 7% this year. Overspending by fractious regions has been painfully brought under control. And Spain has been given an extra two years to hack its deficit below 3%. 
The government's programme of restructuring and reform has also started to produce results. As many as 38 financial institutions have been merged, mainly local cajas brought down by property lending. The remaining banks have been recapitalised and some EUR 50 billion of their worst assets transferred to a bad bank, Sareb. Provisioning against bad debts has risen sharply. Unlike many other euro-crisis countries, the public sector is shrinking: 375,000 civil-service jobs have gone. 
The real economy is also showing signs of improvement. Measured by unit labour costs, Spain has done more than most to regain competitiveness (see chart). The external current account has switched from a deficit of almost 10% of GDP in 2008 to a surplus, and not only because of import compression. In 2012 exports rose faster than in any other EU country. Reforms last year made it easier to fire workers, so industry is readier to hire again. This new labour-market flexibility is one reason why many car makers are moving production from other EU countries to Spain. 
Even so, three big problems could undo this limited progress. One is the credit crunch. Despite lower bond yields, credit for small and medium-sized enterprises remains scarce and expensive compared with northern Europe. And although both capital and provisioning have increased, the banks are still rolling over dodgy debts from many construction firms. Property prices are down by over a third from their peak, and ministers insist the system could absorb a drop of 50%--but if the recession continues, the fall could be larger still. 
The second problem is reform fatigue. Spaniards have accepted changes, including wage cuts, to restore lost competitiveness. But more is needed: welfare reforms, a lower minimum wage in some regions, encouraging mini-jobs and part-time work and reducing the burden of pensions. It is not clear that Mr Rajoy's government has the guts to push such reforms through. Yet without them Spain's scary level of unemployment is likely to persist. Ministers say the jobs market is more flexible than it looks because in the boom years 5m immigrants came in, and the bust is seeing large net emigration: the population is shrinking. But long-term high unemployment will reduce the quality of the workforce. 
Above all is the third problem, insufficient demand and a lack of sources of growth. With public spending, consumption and investment constrained, the government is relying on rising exports. Yet total exports are less than a third of GDP and almost two-thirds go to the recession-hit euro zone. It is hard to see how even strong exports can make up for weak domestic demand. And if GDP growth does not revive, the problems of Spanish banks and the credit crunch will quickly return. 
Luis de Guindos, Spain's finance minister, said last year that Spain was the place where the battle for the euro would be fought. It is also crucial for the future of the EU: the recent Pew report on public opinion found that the favourability rating for the EU had fallen in Spain by fully 34 points, from 80% in 2007 to only 46% now. If this most Europhile, reform-minded country cannot make it, can anybody?","Spain 's pain is likely to continue , despite some promising reforms , unless new sources of growth emerge

JOSE GARCIA used to work as a doorman. But two years ago he lost his job. Since then the 62-year-old has lived off unemployment insurance built up when he was working. This month it runs out. Now he hopes for EUR 426 ($550) a month in long-term state subsidy. With unemployment above 27%, he does not expect to work again. ""I'll keep looking, but the queue will always be long,"" he says. 
The jobless rate is unlikely to drop below 25% before he claims his pension at 65. The prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, hopes to turn the jobs corner before the next election in late 2015, but his record so far is dismal. Over the past 17 months 1.2m jobs have gone, taking the total lost since 2007 to over 6m. Net job growth needs GDP growth above 1%, yet the government does not predict that until 2016. In the European Union only Greece's jobless figures are worse. And in southern provinces such as Cadiz the rate is above 40%. Among under-25s, the figure is a horrific 57%. 
Some analysts say these figures hide a large underground economy. That may be true, although Visa Europe reckons that it is no bigger than the European average and, with the decline of construction, is contracting. But even if the numbers are exaggerated, the rate remains accurate on one count. Over 3m fewer workers now pay taxes or social-security contributions than did five years ago. That knocks the public accounts. 
Unemployment may be peaking in part because the workforce is shrinking as the young study for longer and emigration picks up. Business leaders say labour reforms have preserved jobs, as the unions are now more flexible. But they have not created many new jobs. Javier Diaz-Gimenez of the IESE business school says more is possible. He favours German-style mini-jobs and more part-time work, which accounts for only 15% of Spanish jobs compared with almost 50% in the Netherlands. Merely creating jobs, he suggests, will boost growth. 
Mr Garcia's main worry is his 16-year-old son. Spain's strict school system ejects pupils whom other European countries keep teaching. A quarter leave at 16 without qualifications. They once found jobs on building sites. But precious few of these are left--hence the present hype over plans by an American billionaire for hotels, casinos and conference centres outside Madrid. Mr Garcia just hopes that his son will pass his exams next month, so that he can stay for two more years at school and keep off the unemployment register. But then what?

A REFEREE does not expect to be liked. Earning the players' respect is enough. But in the European political game everybody is now hacking the shins of Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission. The French are furious that he calls those defending subsidies for their film makers ""reactionary"". The Germans accuse him of failing to respond to rising youth unemployment. The British say he has changed from a servant of European governments into a slave of the European Parliament. 
So what's new, ask Eurocrats in Brussels. National leaders always claim glory for Europe's successes, and pour scorn on Brussels for its failures. Francois Hollande in France, David Cameron in Britain and Mariano Rajoy in Spain hardly enjoy high esteem at home. Remote and unloved, the commission is a convenient whipping-boy. If austerity stirs anti-German feeling, blame Brussels for inaction. If France loses export competitiveness, lambast ""ultra-liberal"" Eurocrats. If Britain cannot revive its economy, denounce the misbegotten euro even though Britain is out of it. 
The European Union is losing support, and the commission is at its heart. It acts as a civil service, regulator and enforcer of rules. The commission is also a proto-government, retaining the near-exclusive right to initiate EU legislation, to be approved by the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament. The 2009 Lisbon treaty created a rival to Mr Barroso in the form of a full-time president of the European Council, which represents leaders. He is Herman Van Rompuy, who with Mr Barroso operates as an awkward two-headed creature; both men attended this week's G8 summit in Northern Ireland. 
The commission clings to two convictions. First, that as guardian of the European treaties it stands above the fray of domestic politics; more Europe always means more power for the commission, the only body able to pursue the common interest. Second, even if it seems remote to most citizens, any democratic deficit is made up by a surplus of benefits, from cheap air travel to lower telephone-roaming charges. In the jargon of Brussels, any lack of ""input legitimacy"" is compensated by ""output legitimacy"". 
Yet it is precisely over proficiency, particularly in economic policy, that the commission is suffering the cruellest kicks of all. The latest came from the IMF which, along with the European Central Bank, is the commission's partner in the troika overseeing euro-zone bail-outs. An IMF study on lessons from the first Greek bail-out in 2010 concluded that the commission lacked experience of managing financial crises and fiscal-adjustment programmes; that its obsession with fiscal rules blinded it to the recessionary effect of austerity; and that, although the IMF fretted about the sustainability of Greek debt, the commission and euro-zone governments refused to restructure it. Delaying the inevitable imposed unnecessary pain, and allowed private creditors to dump Greek debt on official lenders. 
The IMF is hardly fault-free. Olli Rehn, the economics commissioner, notes that neither Dominique Strauss-Kahn, then IMF boss, nor his successor Christine Lagarde, then French finance minister, pushed for early restructuring of Greek debt. The commission has since adjusted bail-out conditions and slowed the pace of austerity. Much of the blame should also go to national governments that decide how much money should be lent to crippled debtors and under what conditions. More fundamentally, countries still resist the risk-sharing and pooling of sovereignty needed to fix their flawed currency. 
The Brussels machine is not a government. Rather, it is designed to generate compromise and consensus, usually through a slow-moving legislative process. National leaders tend to appoint pliable and second-rate commissioners. Nobody should be surprised when the institution fails to respond well. Such problems will not be resolved by the latest Franco-German proposal for ""economic governance"" in the euro zone. It seems designed to strip some of the commission's powers, perhaps by strengthening the European Stability Mechanism, the euro-zone rescue fund, which governments run themselves. 
That said, the commission has made mistakes. It misdiagnosed the euro's problem as mainly about fiscal profligacy, and was happy to take on new powers to monitor national budgets and economic policies. It was late to address the weakness of the banks through the beginnings of a banking union. The commission has not used its unique pulpit effectively. Even those like the British who see Mr Barroso as a convinced free-trader think he has been a weak president. The quiet Mr Van Rompuy has often been more effective than the lumbering commission in setting out a coherent, all-encompassing view of what is needed for the euro, even if his ""road map"" has been torn up by leaders. 
Fin de Barroso 
The air in Brussels is now thick with a feeling of fin de regime. The commission is tired. Legislative work, for instance on the next steps to create a banking union, has more or less stopped, pending the German election in September. It may be hard to do much afterwards as the European Parliament prepares for next May's European elections. Then the horse-trading for Brussels jobs will begin in earnest: by the autumn of 2014 the EU must find replacements for Mr Barroso and Mr Van Rompuy, as well as a new foreign-policy supremo (currently Catherine Ashton). Add to the mix the next secretary-general of NATO and, perhaps, a permanent head of euro-zone finance ministers. 
The role of commission president remains crucial. The euro may have been saved for now, but much still has to be done. To judge from the ugly mood among leaders, Mr Barroso cannot expect the third term that he sometimes hints at. A new referee will surely be called in for the game's second half.","Europe's leaders are turning against the European Commission

DRAMATIC political change is sweeping Spain, or so polling suggests. For three decades Mariano Rajoy's conservative Popular Party (PP) and the Socialists have taken turns to run the country. Now their support is crumbling (see chart) and a two-party system that guarantees stable governments is at risk. 
Two recessions in five years and 27% unemployment have shaken faith in the status quo. And as bond markets are getting the jitters again, promises of a return to growth this year have failed to restore shattered confidence. Corruption, cronyism, entitlement and a lack of transparency have helped persuade voters that the system which served their fledging democracy so well has become a liability. 
Backing for the PP has shrivelled from 45% to 24%. Yet under Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba the Socialists have failed dismally to capitalise on the growing discontent. Instead, support has shrunk from 29% in the elections of November 2011 to around 21%. Elections are not due until late 2015, but Spain is on track for its weakest government since democracy was restored in 1977. 
If Spaniards want to throw out the old order, what other choices do they have? Two parties are mopping up the discontent. The centrist Union for Progress and Democracy (UPyD), founded by Rosa Diez, a former Socialist, is settling in as the new third party, making her a potential kingmaker at the next general election. Ms Diez blames the two big parties for wrecking the economy by pumping up a property bubble through their joint control of planning laws, regulators, the central bank and reckless savings banks. She bashes nationalists in Catalonia and her native Basque country. She seeks radical internal reform, re-centralising control over health and education and taking privileges away from Basques, Catalans and Navarrans by putting all regions on an equal footing. And, like Britain's Liberal Democrats, she wants electoral reform to favour her own party. 
Ms Diez refuses to rule out future deals with any party except those with ties to ETA, the Basque terrorist group. But she insists on a constitutional overhaul and wants the next parliament to bring it about. ""A self-confident democracy revises its laws on the basis of their consequences,"" she says. Ms Diez claims UPyD, which has just five deputies, has already pushed political debate towards previously taboo topics such as constitutional reform or reversing devolution. 
The other beneficiary of discontent is United Left (IU), a communist-led coalition that has shown surprising flexibility in regional governments. It helped a minority PP government snatch power from the Socialists in Extremadura. But it backed the Socialists in Asturias and is in a coalition with them in Andalusia, one of the largest regions. Jose Luis Centella, an IU deputy, says these regional deals cannot be extrapolated to national politics. 
With future votes spread so widely, dealmaking will decide elections. The Socialists have the advantage. They can ally with IU, UpyD as well as Catalan or Basque nationalists. They could even bring several parties together. Perhaps, given the number of ingredients it may need, Spain's next government will look like the popular national dish: a paella coalition.","Disillusion is leading to the rise of two alternative parties

And as bond markets are getting the jitters again , promises of a return to growth this year have failed to restore shattered confidence . Corruption , cronyism , entitlement and a lack of transparency have helped persuade voters that the system which served their fledging democracy so well has become a liability . 
 Backing for the PP has shrivelled from 45 % to 24 % . Yet under Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba the Socialists have failed dismally to capitalise on the growing discontent . Instead , support has shrunk from 29 % in the elections of November 2011 to around 21 % . Elections are not due until late 2015 , but Spain is on track for its weakest government since democracy was restored in 1977 . 
 If Spaniards want to throw out the old order , what other choices do they have ? Two parties are mopping up the discontent . The centrist Union for Progress and Democracy ( UPyD ) , founded by Rosa Diez , a former Socialist , is settling in as the new third party , making her a potential kingmaker at the next general election . Ms Diez blames Mariano Rajoy for wrecking the economy by pumping up a property bubble through Mariano Rajoy's joint control of planning laws , regulators , the central bank and reckless savings banks . She bashes nationalists in Catalonia and her native Basque country . She seeks radical internal reform , re - centralising control over health and education and taking privileges away from Basques , Catalans and Navarrans by putting all regions on an equal footing . And , like Britain 's Liberal Democrats , she wants electoral reform to favour her own party . 
 Ms Diez refuses to rule out future deals with any party except those with ties to ETA , the Basque terrorist group . But she insists on a constitutional overhaul and wants the next parliament to bring it about . "" A self - confident democracy revises its laws on the basis of their consequences , "" she says . Ms Diez claims UPyD , which has just five deputies , has already pushed political debate towards previously taboo topics such as constitutional reform or reversing devolution . 
 The other beneficiary of discontent is United Left ( IU ) , a communist - led coalition that has shown surprising flexibility in regional governments . It helped a minority PP government snatch power from the Socialists in Extremadura . But it backed the Socialists in Asturias and is in a coalition with them in Andalusia , one of the largest regions . Jose Luis Centella , an IU deputy , says these regional deals can not be extrapolated to national politics . 
 With future votes spread so widely , dealmaking will decide elections . The Socialists have the advantage . They can ally with IU , UpyD as well as Catalan or Basque nationalists . They could even bring several parties together . Perhaps , given the number of ingredients it may need , Spain 's next government will look like the popular national dish : a paella coalition .",230,Spain,A30-57,IN TERM,True,Mariano Rajoy 's conservative Popular Party ( PP ) and the Socialists,4,True

A leaked Pakistani government report concluded that government incompetence and negligence had allowed Osama bin Laden to live in Pakistan undetected for a decade. The report found nothing to support allegations that the government had colluded with al-Qaeda, though it did not rule out ""the possibility of some degree of connivance"". It also described the killing of bin Laden as a ""murder"" ordered by the American president. 
The man who was in charge of Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant when it was hit by a tsunami in March 2011 died of oesophagal cancer. Masao Yoshida had remained on the site when the tsunami struck, ignoring orders to stop pumping seawater into one of the reactors. A spokesman for TEPCO, the operator of the plant, said his cancer was not linked to his work there. 
A court in China sentenced a former minister of railways to death for corruption (with the possibility of reduction to a life term). Liu Zhijun, who had overseen a rapid modernisation of China's railways, including the building of its high-speed network, was accused of accepting bribes worth 64.6m yuan ($10.5m). 
A study by Chinese and Western researchers found that heavy air pollution in northern China has reduced people's average life expectancy by five years. It said the pollution, mainly from coal, is 55% higher in the north of China than in the south. 
Officials from China and America met in Washington for annual talks on strategic and economic issues. It was the first such dialogue since a new Chinese leadership came to power last year. Disagreements over cyber-security featured prominently, but the two sides agreed to co-operate more on climate change.

THE Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, is known for wearing down opponents by digging in his heels and biding his time. ""Life is about resisting,"" he texted Rosalia Iglesias, wife of his Popular Party's (PP) former treasurer, Luis Barcenas, as a scandal engulfed him two years ago. Now Mr Barcenas's decision to go public in the press and before a magistrate about two decades of illicit PP financing, along with the leaking of text messages, is testing Mr Rajoy's own capacity for resistance. 
Four years after investigators began unravelling a web of PP corruption, Mr Barcenas started to sing on July 15th. In an interview with El Mundo, he had already claimed there were systematic cash payments to Mr Rajoy and other bigwigs. On July 17th the paper published 14 pages of secret accounts, which tally with similar ones in its rival, El Pais. They show donations by construction firms that won big public contracts from PP governments. It is increasingly apparent that Mr Rajoy ran a party in which personal graft and illegal funding were common. 
In February Mr Rajoy denied receiving ""black"" money himself, though his name has appeared in the secret accounts. Had he declared any cash payments to the taxmen, which is not clear, his denial would be correct. But it would still not explain where the money came from. The opposition is demanding answers in parliament, threatening otherwise to propose a no-confidence motion. But the secret to Mr Rajoy's ability to hang on lies precisely in parliament, where he has an absolute majority and exercises iron control over his deputies. The next election is not due until 2015. Grumbles within the party will not shift him. Even the documents Mr Barcenas handed to magistrates this week seem unlikely to bring investigators to his door. 
Yet Mr Rajoy has a dangerous and unpredictable enemy in Mr Barcenas. Having doggedly protected him for years, the PP is now calling its former treasurer a ""liar"" and a ""crook"". The change is dramatic. ""Be strong. I'll call you tomorrow,"" Mr Rajoy texted him soon after allegations about the payments were first published and details of at least EUR 20m ($26m) that Mr Barcenas had hidden in Swiss bank accounts were made public. Perhaps that is why Mr Barcenas felt he could, literally, give a group of waiting journalists the finger. Mr Barcenas claims that the money came from private business deals, but he has still been jailed as a flight risk. And who believes him, or Mr Rajoy? As the PP president since 2004, the prime minister is politically responsible for five years of alleged illicit funding (which stopped several years ago). Jointly, the donating companies received EUR 12.3 billion in public contracts from the PP. 
Spaniards are fed up with all their politicians. On July 16th a magistrate accused the main Catalan party of taking illegal funding from Ferrovial, a builder. And the Socialists have their own graft scandal in their southern fief of Andalucia. Worst of all, Spaniards must cope with double-dip recession, falling wages, spending cuts and 27% unemployment. Politicians and builders, who jointly pumped up the housing bubble, are seen as at the root of their problems.

So it is not surprising that Latin American presidents have taken to tweeting with gusto. Seven of the 25 most-followed world leaders hail from the region, according to Twiplomacy, a website. Among the most active is Argentina's Cristina Fernandez. She seems to view Twitter's 140-character limit as rather like the other checks on her power: an annoyance to be sidestepped rather than a hard rule. She frequently tweets out verbose diatribes split across dozens of messages; she once tweeted 34 times in 32 minutes. Although she has over 2m followers, she herself follows only 54, with not a single non-Latin American leader among them. 
The most ""conversational"" Latin American leader is Ecuador's Rafael Correa: 83% of his tweets are replies to other users. But then Mr Correa is a man whose sensitivity to criticism led him to take a criminal libel case against a newspaper and to place legislative curbs on the media. Mr Correa is popular: he has over 1m followers on Twitter, though Ecuador's population is only 14.5m. 
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto strikes a more cosmopolitan stance, with Barack Obama, David Cameron and Spain's Mariano Rajoy among the 160 users he follows. His aides insist he writes his own tweets. Colombia's Juan Manuel Santos and Chile's Sebastian Pinera, who also purport to manage their own accounts, are more ambitious, following some 6,000 and 21,700 users respectively--many of whom are ordinary Colombians and Chileans. 
Brazil's Dilma Rousseff is followed by almost 1.9m people even though she stopped tweeting in 2010. Hugo Chavez was second only to Mr Obama as the most-followed leader before his death earlier this year. He has been replaced as the Twitteratus maximus of Latin America by the Argentine Pope Francis, who has 4m followers of his Spanish- and Portuguese-language accounts.","How presidents tweet

Could that happen to the separatists of Basque Homeland and Liberty (ETA), Europe's last big domestic terror group? 
A much-weakened ETA has done a lot to wean itself off violence. It has not killed in Spain for four years. In October 2011 it unilaterally declared a permanent ceasefire. Those who called it remain in control. But ETA still has arms and explosives, probably buried in waterproof containers in French forests. A heated debate continues between ETA's leadership, its 700-odd jailed members and its political allies over whether to give up the weapons. 
Many Basques want the Popular Party (PP) government led by Mariano Rajoy to offer ETA a carrot, but it refuses. A highly vocal ""victory or nothing"" PP lobby, backed by influential newspapers, is often blamed. Instead, the government demands that ETA must accept defeat. ""Either they dissolve themselves, hand over their arms, apologise and recognise the harm they have inflicted, or the rule of law will dissolve them, leaving them as an inoperative acronym, like Grapo,"" insists Jorge Fernandez Diaz, the interior minister. 
ETA's leadership was expelled from its sanctuary in Norway earlier this year. David Pla, Iratxe Sorzabal and Josu Ternera, the three ETA heavyweights leading the peace process, are tough negotiators. They would love to get a deal that helps prisoners, either through early release or with a relaxation of rules that keep many in jails far from their families. But government obstinacy means ""peace for prisoners"" is unlikely. Sortu, the non-violent separatist movement that emerged in 2011, may have to drag ETA towards peace yet again. 
That would be welcomed by Madrid, but government stubbornness carries risks. It sidelines the regional prime minister, Inigo Urkullu, and his moderate Basque Nationalist Party (PNV). Mr Urkullu is furious that the PP government has failed to ease ETA's journey to disarmament. And he is worried by Sortu, whose electoral arm, EH Bildu, won a quarter of the vote in the Basque elections last year, coming second to the PNV. If EH Bildu ever unseated the PNV, separatism would dominate local politics, just as it does in Catalonia. Yet Basques already enjoy considerable political autonomy and, though most voters back nationalist or separatist parties, fully half oppose independence. 
By staying out of the negotiations, the government gives ETA more control. If disarmament comes, ETA is likely to choose between handing arms to a group of experts in the Netherlands already involved in the process, or delivering them to the Basque regional police. But Spanish and French police would have to stay away, requiring at least a silent nod from Mr Rajoy. 
EH Bildu's incursion into everyday politics forces it to confront such mundane issues as rubbish collection and planning laws, which affect Basques' everyday lives, rather than dreaming of independence. That engagement can only be good. But with ETA in the wings, politics can never become normal. Everybody should want it to leave the stage completely.

IT IS a monument to defeat. On September 11th, Catalonia's national day, newly uncovered ruins of old Barcelona were exposed three centuries after the Catalans lost a war against Spain's new king. The Diada was celebrated this year by hundreds of thousands of people forming a 400km (250-mile) human chain across Catalonia, imitating the 1989 Baltic Way chain demanding independence from the Soviet Union. 
The organisers were less clear about the Catalan aim, some calling it a direct demand for independence, others saying it was just a demand for a referendum that the Popular Party (PP) government of Mariano Rajoy in Madrid refuses to sanction. Polls show just over half of Catalans back independence, but that a whopping 80% want a referendum. 
An independence march in last year's Diada caught politicians by surprise. The Catalan president, Artur Mas, pledged to call a vote in 2014, exactly 300 years after Philip V's troops squashed the Barcelona revolt and also when Scotland votes on independence from the United Kingdom. But with Mr Rajoy blocking even a non-binding referendum, Mr Mas may now postpone his ""consultation"" until 2016. 
His plan to turn the regional election that year into a ""plebiscitary vote"" is fraught with problems. Catalans can hardly be expected to elect a new government to run health care, education and social services solely on the issue of independence. Mr Mas and Mr Rajoy have held talks to try to break the deadlock. But the Catalan president holds out little hope of success. 
Mr Mas, who backs independence but has coalition partners who do not, may now wait. A general election in 2015 could see Mr Rajoy ousted or weakened, and perhaps needing support from Mr Mas's Convergence and Union in Madrid's parliament. Or the Socialists may return to power. They favour constitutional reform that would create a federal state. But such a change requires PP support. A further complication is that the separatist Catalan Republican Left party, which props up Mr Mas's minority government in Barcelona, could force an earlier regional poll. 
A banner over the ruins of old Barcelona says its defenders promised to ""win or die"". They lost and Philip V took away most of Catalonia's self-government. A recovery in Spain may yet pop the independence bubble. But Madrid's intransigence on the referendum could pump it up again.

THE Prado museum, lined with works by Goya, Velazquez and El Greco, is a sanctuary of peace in busy central Madrid. When the museum advertised for eleven gallery attendants recently, it also seemed the perfect refuge from Spain's job-starved economy: 18,700 people applied. 
As Spain timidly emerges from a blistering double-dip recession that has ripped 7% out of GDP over five years, job-seekers remain desperate. Unemployment is stuck at 26% and emigration is picking up. So will the recovery create jobs and send Spain into a virtuous cycle of increased domestic consumption, a higher tax take, healthy public finances and more jobs? 
Presenting next year's budget on September 30th, Cristobal Montoro, the budget minister, did not offer rapid relief. Projected growth of 0.7% next year falls short of the government's own estimates for job creation. And with a planned deficit of 5.8% of GDP adding to an already worrying debt pile, stimulus spending is impossible. 
Civil-service pay is being frozen for a fourth year in a row and pensions will not keep up with inflation, yet the public debt will still reach almost 100% of GDP. Spanish companies and households are busy trying to pay off their own debts. After taking a EUR 41 billion ($55.6 billion) bail-out last year, Spain's banks find it safer to lend to the government than to business. 
Even so, Spain's story is now one of hope. Mariano Rajoy, the prime minister, says the third quarter will show a return to growth. Deep in the real economy, exciting things are happening. Car plants are humming, taking work from less competitive factories in Europe. Retail sales figures are improving elsewhere. Even consumer credit has crept up in recent months. Recession inflicted a brutal cull on businesses, but those still standing are more efficient and productive than ever. Exports, spurred by Spain's new competitiveness, should grow more than 5% both this year and next, doubling their pre-recession weight in the economy. With exports booming, the current account has swung into surplus. 
Recovery in the European Union, Spain's main export market, will help further. The stockmarket is soaring, with the Ibex-35 indicator gaining 11% in September. After a bruising 21 months in office, Mr Rajoy predicts economic happiness next year. His Popular Party (PP) has even seen a bounce in opinion polls. 
But Javier Diaz-Gimenez, of the IESE business school, warns that the recovery is anaemic, fragile and unlikely to create jobs. Average GDP growth of 1%, he points out, would not see Spain return to pre-recession levels until 2021. The IMF sees 25% unemployment through to 2018. 
The danger, warns Angel Laborda of the Funcas think-tank, is relaxation. Already he worries that this year's 6.5% deficit target will be missed. Overall fiscal pressure is relatively low for a country that wants a sophisticated welfare system. Structural reforms are still needed, he says, but Spain enters a two-year period of elections in 2014, sapping political courage. Overconfidence threatens to slow the fall in house prices, making it even harder to sell the 700,000 new homes left by the housing bubble that pitched Spain into recession. Fitch, a ratings agency, warns that at current rates of selling it will take six years to clear the overhang. Prices have fallen 30% or more from the peak, but Jesus Encinar of idealista.com, a property portal, sees a further 20% drop. 
The next test for Mr Rajoy is pensions. A diet rich in olive oil, wine and fresh vegetables helps make Spaniards among the longest-living people in Europe. The baby-boomers will retire over the coming decade. By 2050, the number of pensioners will have leapt from just over 9m to 15m; and the social-security system already loses the equivalent of 1.4% of GDP. The previous government hiked the retirement age to 67, but that is not enough. ""To claim that the current system is sustainable is like saying smoking does not cause cancer,"" says Mr Diaz-Gimenez. The government has made bold proposals to calculate pensions according to life expectancy and the size of the state pension pot. But Mr Rajoy is under pressure to backtrack. Even the employers' federation has warned of pensioners' lost spending power. 
Labour reforms have helped to boost productivity, allowing employers and unions to opt for wage moderation rather than sackings. More may be needed if jobs are to be created. Lowering, or scrapping, the minimum wage might help. Taxes could also be cut, but only if public spending is cut. Luis de Guindos, the finance minister, says jobs will come when growth reaches 1%. Until then, the Prado museum remains a safe harbour.","Mariano Rajoy predicts economic joy , but Spain still has a long way to go

THE car bomb that Ines del Rio's unit of ETA, a Basque separatist group, planted in Madrid's Republica Dominicana square killed ten people and maimed many more. They were not her unit's only victims. The list includes 13 others, targets or passers-by. One was an American executive, Eugene Brown, visiting Madrid on business. 
Like all Spanish murderers found guilty at trial, Ms Del Rio was sent to jail. There is no life term or death sentence in Spain. Her sentences totalled 3,828 years, but ran concurrently, with the law specifying a maximum sentence of 30 years. Her release, including further reductions for good behaviour, was due after 21 years, in 2008. But a new interpretation of the law, first introduced for ETA members, took away the years for good behaviour, postponing her release until 2017. On October 21st the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg declared this interpretation illegal. Ms Del Rio was freed the following day. 
That is not the end of the matter. Fifty-three other ETA members, responsible for dozens of killings, must be released too. So must other terrorists, including one from a state-backed dirty-war group that attacked ETA targets in the 1980s. A dozen rapists and murderers will also go free. In all, more than 70 of Spain's most violent prisoners should be released as the country's courts uphold their appeals. 
Mariano Rajoy's conservative Popular Party (PP) government has fought the ECHR all the way. It takes an unbendingly tough line on ETA, and has accused previous left-leaning governments of being soft on terrorism. Now Mr Rajoy is in a bind. He has previously marched alongside influential victims' groups that are loudly and angrily backed by the right-wing press. They are calling on him to refuse to obey the ECHR ruling. Since Britain has ignored an ECHR order in 2005 to give voting rights to prisoners, the argument goes, Spain can also ignore the Strasbourg court. 
Mr Rajoy has remained silent, leaving ministers to explain that there is little choice but to allow courts to release the prisoners. But on October 23rd he met victims' groups, who are planning a protest, to reassure them that there would be no sudden mass release. 
In fact ETA's ageing prisoners are less of a danger than the rapists and murderers who will also go free. A weakened ETA declared a unilateral and permanent ceasefire in October 2011. As was not the case with previous ceasefires, it has stuck to this one. The group has yet to hand over its arms. The release of prisoners should smooth the path towards such an event. 
Many in the Basque area, including the regional government of the moderate Basque National Party leader, Inigo Urkullu, believe it is time to finish the peace process. ""The government has a chance to do what it has failed to do in two years--become an active agent for peace,"" says Fernando Barrena of Sortu, an increasingly powerful separatist movement. They would like to see a softer approach to ETA's 600 remaining prisoners, many of whom are kept in prisons hundreds of miles from their families. 
But Mr Rajoy has done nothing beyond promising that the security forces' full might will fall on ETA if it returns to arms. ETA negotiators were ejected from Norway when disarmament failed to happen earlier this year. With victims' groups now stirring, Mr Rajoy is unlikely to budge soon. ETA, once more, must act alone.","A European court orders the release of ETA terrorists from prison

WITH Susana Diaz beaming radiantly from the conference stage after winning control of the Spanish Socialists' mighty Andalusian branch in Granada last month, fans hailed a generational and gender revolution in the party. Her victory confirmed that the energetic 39-year-old, who also runs the region's government, is now Spain's most powerful Socialist. That is a big role in a country where the ruling Popular Party (PP) of Mariano Rajoy and the Socialists tend to alternate in power. But is not so clear that she will lead the party into the next election. 
Ms Diaz's smile hides an iron will. She is at ease with power and is reputedly ruthless against rivals. Spain's fractious Socialists may need such qualities as they wander in the electoral wilderness, failing to turn 27% unemployment and fears about the future into votes. It is smaller parties which are cashing in on voter dismay; the Socialists still lag behind the PP, which ousted them in 2011 and may now reap the rewards of economic recovery. 
Can Ms Diaz change that? A recent poll made her the most popular candidate to lead her party into the 2015 general election. But she is unlikely to stand. She took control of Andalusia's government only three months ago, inheriting the post after her predecessor stood down. Her leadership has never been tested at the polls and she has no record in government. The enthusiasm provoked by her rapid rise is, in part, a reflection of despair at the party's lacklustre performance under Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, its current leader. 
Mr Rubalcaba, a veteran politician aged 62, proclaims Ms Diaz to be the future. So what does her Andalusian government, with its huge EUR 30 billion budget, say about Socialist plans if they return to power in Madrid? Like most parties ejected from office, the Socialists claim to be returning to their roots. Nowhere is this truer than in Andalusia, where a 30-year run as the region's favourite ended in 2012. The party clung to power only by forming a coalition with the communist-led United Left (IU), forcing a leftward policy swing. Measures include a law to expropriate homes temporarily being repossessed by banks from mortgage defaulters and schemes to feed poorer children three times daily at schools while paying their parents' utility bills. But spending is also being cut and Andalusia has Spain's highest regional unemployment, at a mind-boggling 36%. 
Voters know the party usually becomes less left-wing when in power, says Jose Antonio Perez Tapias, a former deputy. Many left-wingers are turning to IU, while disgruntled PP voters jump to the centrist Union for Progress and Democracy. But Socialist leaders say they will be better placed than the PP to negotiate in a more fragmented post-2015 parliament. 
Local newspapers liken Ms Diaz's triumph in Granada to a groundbreaking 1974 conference that handed power over the national party to Felipe Gonzalez, who became prime minister four times. That is hyperbole. Ms Diaz's morale-boosting coronation ceremony was, like her party, largely bereft of fresh ideas. A proposal to solve the Catalan problem by turning Spain into a federation is bold but, in electoral terms, risky. It is not clear if plans for wealth taxes and debt-based stimulus spending are a replacement for the wage restraint that is slowly making Spain more competitive. 
Socialists, meanwhile, fret about who will lead them. A candidate to challenge Mr Rajoy, the prime minister, in 2015 will be chosen next year at a primary election that still has no formal candidates. Mr Rubalcaba declines to rule himself out. Ms Diaz, who is close to Carme Chacon, a former defence minister and probable candidate, will use her new-found muscle to try to sway the result. For the moment, though, Spaniards see only one clear new policy, federalism, and no plausible new national leader. If Ms Diaz is the future, she has work to do.

THE sales hut on an empty building plot in Aravaca is a symbol of hope. Here, in a desirable Madrid suburb, new flats are being sold off-plan in a five-storey condominium that is due to be finished within two years. In a country with half a million new homes lying empty after its spectacular housing bubble, that may seem like madness. Yet developers are returning to a handful of select areas where the building bust is over. Two months after Aravaca's 49 flats went on sale, fewer than half are left. 
After five years of double-dip recession and rampant job destruction, Spain's downward lurch has stopped. Growth has returned; Mariano Rajoy, the prime minister, says it is here to stay. The Madrid stockmarket is euphoric, government-bond yields have tumbled below pre-crisis levels and foreign investors are bargain-hunting. ""Spain is back,"" trumpeted JPMorgan Chase, a bank, in a recent report. 
Yet GDP growth, estimated at 0.3% in the fourth quarter, is neither as vigorous nor as ironclad as Mr Rajoy claims. Analysts predict a measly 1% expansion in 2014 as the economy is held back by heavy private debts. The IMF puts Spain near the bottom of its global growth chart for two years. And, as wages fall and a quarter of workers remain jobless, most Spaniards have yet to notice the uptick. Workers like Milagros Morago, whose income fell by 40% after a new subcontractor took over Madrid's public-hospital laundry last month, feel worse off. ""I certainly haven't recovered anything,"" she says. 
Another period of dramatic decline is unlikely, unless markets get euro-crisis jitters again. Growth in manufacturing and services is creating new jobs, and consumer demand is creeping back. But the brakes on growth and job creation remain many. Banks, businesses and families are still shedding their debts, keeping money out of the economy. And as private debt falls, public debt surges. The government probably missed even its relaxed target for the 2013 budget deficit of 6.5% of GDP. Public debt, which stood at below 40% of GDP when the crisis hit, will rise above 100% next year, leaving Spain more vulnerable to future shocks. 
Worse, says Angel Laborda of the Funcas think-tank, the government has no clear medium-term strategy to reduce its debt and is heading into an electoral period that will dampen enthusiasm for reforms. Salaries are falling and, with unemployment so high, are unlikely to bounce back soon--further dampening demand and growth. Fitch, a ratings agency, predicts that mortgage arrears will grow as house prices keep falling into next year. 
Spaniards routinely blame euro-zone leaders for their woes, but in fact they have helped Spain to recover. They gave it more time to cut its deficit. The biggest aid has come from the European Central Bank's boss, Mario Draghi, whose battle to bring the euro back from the brink of meltdown has eased the pressure on Spanish debt. It has also fired up the financial markets. ""Fear has practically disappeared and institutional investors are redoing their portfolios,"" says Jesus Sanchez-Quinones of Renta 4, a stockbroker. With bond yields low, Spanish banks are ready to start new lending to small businesses. And banks themselves are reviving after their bail-out. Even Bankia, a sickly former savings bank, has raised EUR 1 billion in unsecured debt . 
Employment remains the main worry. With salaries stuck, new job creation is the best way to boost consumer demand. It also has the benefit of reducing spending on unemployment subsidies. A bumper tourist season and good harvest helped create temporary jobs in the summer and autumn; and the public payroll grew in education and health, despite the deficit. Yet unemployment will stay stuck above 20% for several years. Recovery may be here, but joy will be a long time coming.","Suddenly there is a new mood of hope over Spain 's economic prospects

UNEMPLOYMENT is sky-high and growth is at best anaemic. Yet Spain's prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, has at last seen off his country's worst recession in decades, and can now start thinking about how best to recover lost votes before the general election that is due late next year. So why is he kicking things off by proposing a bill sharply to restrict abortion, an idea that is opposed by the vast majority of Spaniards? 
The abortion bill, passed through cabinet during the Christmas period, is a reminder that, although Mr Rajoy's Popular Party (PP) claims to be liberal on economic issues, it is socially conservative. The bill would replace a woman's right to abortion on demand during the first 14 weeks of pregnancy with a system requiring proof of potential damage to a mother's mental or physical health. Four out of five Spaniards dislike the proposal. Even most PP voters think it unnecessary. And it comes with another new piece of legislation, a law-and-order bill giving the police extraordinary powers to fine people who are deemed to have insulted them, Spain or their local town halls. Fines for these last two can reach EUR 30,000. 
Jose Pablo Ferrandiz of Metroscopia, a pollster, says that PP voters see themselves as more moderate than their party. The abortion law may please half a million diehard conservative voters, but it will cost votes in the centre where elections are won--and the upstart Union for Progress and Democracy (UPyD) is growing fast. The abortion bill is a gift to the opposition Socialists, boosting their otherwise lacklustre performance in the polls. It may give the party the lift it needs to win European elections in May. Many PP bigwigs know that, and are angry that Mr Rajoy has dusted off an election pledge to ""reinforce protection of the right to life"" and turned it into a hard-hitting proposed law. 
A party that occupies most of the spectrum to the right of centre is bound to have internal conflicts. Mr Rajoy's most vocal critics are social conservatives and those on the right who see tax rises as a sell-out. Jaime Mayor Oreja, a conservative former interior minister, has declined to lead the PP into the next European elections. Alejo Vidal-Quadras, a former party boss in Catalonia and now vice-president of the European Parliament, has also quit. 
He has joined the newly created Vox, a Spanish-style Tea Party backed by PP malcontents who think Mr Rajoy has gone soft and betrayed the party's liberal economic principles. They accuse him of tinkering rather than unleashing radical reforms to cut the regions' powers, slim the administration and squash separatist sentiment in Catalonia and the Basque country. Jorge San Miguel, an analyst at the Politikon blog, says Vox may have trouble winning parliamentary seats, but can still damage the PP by splitting off some of its voters. 
Prominent among Mr Rajoy's critics is a former PP prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar. He stayed away from a recent PP convention, even though he is honorary president. Esperanza Aguirre, the Madrid party boss, is leading criticism of tax rises as the government struggles with a budget deficit that some say was still stuck at 7% of GDP last year. Ms Aguirre, an on-off rival of Mr Rajoy, says lower rates would boost tax revenue and accuses the budget minister, Cristobal Montoro, of behaving like a social democrat. 
Mr Rajoy has pledged to cut taxes next year. But loopholes and cheating mean that even high nominal rates still do not produce enough income. The top income-tax rate in the cash-strapped north-eastern region of Catalonia is 56%, one of the world's highest, according to KPMG, a consulting firm. Yet Spain's income from tax and social contributions is well below the EU average. Fiscal reform will have to be far-reaching if Mr Rajoy is to balance the books. 
The economy, along with 26% unemployment, remains Spaniards' chief worry. If Mr Rajoy concentrated on that, he could yet beat the Socialists in the European elections. Going backwards on abortion can only damage his party's chances.","By shifting to the right , Mariano Rajoy's risks losing votes to the centre

DAVID CAMERON has won few friends with his demands to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the European Union. But there is one place where he is admired: Catalonia. This is not because he wants a referendum on EU membership, but because he is letting Scotland vote in September on independence from the United Kingdom. The Catalans plan their own ballot two months later, although Spain's prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, has vowed to stop it. Proof, say Catalan nationalists, of Britain's deep democracy and Spain's lingering authoritarianism. 
Romantics see parallels in the fate of Scotland and Catalonia, both small nations merged into larger kingdoms in the early 1700s that now seek to rule themselves. Other governments are nervous. If Scotland or Catalonia become independent, why not the Basque Country, Flanders, Corsica, or even Bavaria? 
Senior leaders in Brussels have taken to issuing increasingly blunt warnings to would-be breakaways. Speaking in Madrid in December, on the day when Catalonia fixed a date for its referendum, Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council, said any secessionist region would be treated as a new country, to which the EU's treaties would no longer apply. Such a ""third country"" would have to submit an application to rejoin. That these comments came from a Flemish-speaking former prime minister of Belgium, who said his own deeply divided country should stay together, added weight to his views. 
On a visit to London last weekend, Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, delivered an even harsher blow. He said it would be ""extremely difficult, if not impossible"" for Scotland to secure the agreement of the 28 other countries to join the EU. One reason, he added, was opposition from Spain, the most intransigent of the five EU members that still refuse to recognise the independence of Kosovo. Mr Barroso claimed he did not want to interfere in the Scottish debate but that is what he did--and he may have gone too far. As the man who runs the commission, he is entitled to set out his views of European law. But he should not judge the likelihood of a successful application, speak on behalf of Spain, or suggest that peaceful referendums in western Europe are equivalent to the violent break-up of a Balkan country. After all, the commission's job is to assess accession applications impartially. 
Perhaps the anglophile Mr Barroso worries that, if Scotland votes itself out of the United Kingdom, the more Eurosceptic remnant of Britain would be more likely to vote itself out of the EU in 2017. Already struggling to deal with the repercussions of the euro crisis and the rise of anti-EU populists, Brussels would rather not have to contend with secessionists as well. Breakaway regions would add more small countries to an already unwieldy organisation. And fragmentation runs counter to the ethos of uniting to create a greater whole. 
Unwittingly, the EU may be part of the problem. It has weakened national governments from above, by shifting powers to the European level (especially in the euro zone). And it has weakened them from below, by making it easier for separatists to seek independence within the cocoon of the EU. Francesc Homs, a senior member of the Catalan government, says the referendum could never happen without the EU, which steadied Spanish democracy after Franco's dictatorship. ""We feel safe and secure. We have lost our fear. Nobody is going to shoot us."" 
The treaties allow countries to leave the EU but are silent on what happens if they break up within the club. A split would be unprecedented, even though several EU members were born of earlier secessions. The three Baltic states broke away from the Soviet Union; the Czech Republic and Slovakia came out of the ""velvet divorce"" of Czechoslovakia; Slovenia and Croatia emerged from the violent implosion of former Yugoslavia. The rest of the western Balkans is also moving closer to the EU. Serbia has begun membership talks, and even Kosovo is negotiating an association agreement, the first step towards membership. 
It is wrong, therefore, to insinuate that newly independent states could never join the EU. Would Montenegro and Macedonia really be admitted faster than Scotland and Catalonia, which already apply the EU's rules? Yet it is still more dishonest to pretend that accession would be quick or easy, even in the best of circumstances. All EU members must agree to open and then conclude membership talks, and to ratify the deal. There are 35 chapters to be negotiated; and these have become harder over the years. Scotland wants to maintain Britain's opt-outs from the euro and from the Schengen free-travel zone, but opt-outs take longer to approve. Catalonia would somehow try to stay in the euro zone without going through the required qualification period. Would the European Central Bank give its banks liquidity? EU officials reckon it would take at least four to five years to negotiate and ratify the accession of Scotland and Catalonia. 
What price freedom? 
An amicable break-up, in which all accept and respect the outcome, would surely make for faster Scottish accession. A rump Britain might then be a strong supporter. Spain, despite its qualms, has not said it would stand in Scotland's way. Its refusal to permit a referendum in Catalonia suggests it realises that, in the end, the EU cannot turn down a breakaway region. But a bitter divorce, with rows over the division of assets and liabilities, would make EU accession harder. Scotland's path to the EU could then be blocked not by Madrid but by London. 
Divorce means breakaways must live as singles, at least for a time. There will be no instant betrothal to the EU, no dowry from Brussels--and no cheques guaranteed by other central banks. Scary or liberating, that is the meaning of independence.","How Scotland's referendum is affecting the politics of Europe

The rest of the western Balkans is also moving closer to the EU. Serbia has begun membership talks, and even Kosovo is negotiating an association agreement, the first step towards membership. 
It is wrong, therefore, to insinuate that newly independent states could never join the EU. Would Montenegro and Macedonia really be admitted faster than Scotland and Catalonia, which already apply the EU's rules? Yet it is still more dishonest to pretend that accession would be quick or easy, even in the best of circumstances. All EU members must agree to open and then conclude membership talks, and to ratify the deal. There are 35 chapters to be negotiated; and these have become harder over the years. Scotland wants to maintain Britain's opt-outs from the euro and from the Schengen free-travel zone, but opt-outs take longer to approve. Catalonia would somehow try to stay in the euro zone without going through the required qualification period. Would the European Central Bank give its banks liquidity? EU officials reckon it would take at least four to five years to negotiate and ratify the accession of Scotland and Catalonia. 
What price freedom? 
An amicable break-up, in which all accept and respect the outcome, would surely make for faster Scottish accession. A rump Britain might then be a strong supporter. Spain, despite its qualms, has not said it would stand in Scotland's way. Its refusal to permit a referendum in Catalonia suggests it realises that, in the end, the EU cannot turn down a breakaway region. But a bitter divorce, with rows over the division of assets and liabilities, would make EU accession harder. Scotland's path to the EU could then be blocked not by Madrid but by London. 
Divorce means breakaways must live as singles, at least for a time. There will be no instant betrothal to the EU, no dowry from Brussels--and no cheques guaranteed by other central banks. Scary or liberating, that is the meaning of independence.",230,Spain,A30-57,,False,,0,True

But ETA has no one to hand arms to. Jorge Fernandez Diaz, the Spanish interior minister, says it can tell police where its arms are stocked. ETA is unlikely to do that, because it would give police clues as they pursue its remaining members. The mediators offer a safe set of neutral hands. The trouble is that they need the government's support. The task of gathering hundreds of weapons is almost impossible unless Mr Rajoy asks the authorities in France (where the arms are mostly hidden) to turn a blind eye. 
Will that happen? Not until after European Parliament elections in May in which the PP faces opposition from vociferous anti-ETA rightists. And not before ETA makes it clear that it really wants nothing in return.

JOURNALISTS are supposed to check their facts, but when editors are sacked rumours will do. Some see dark political forces behind the ousting of editors at Spain's three big dailies, El Pais, El Mundo and La Vanguardia. But the upheaval also reflects a deeper business crisis. 
Until last month, Pedro Ramirez had edited El Mundo from its birth 25 years ago. Famed for investigations, sharp-tongued columnists and conspiracy theories, it ruffled many feathers. Mr Ramirez blames Mariano Rajoy's ruling Popular Party (PP) for his sacking. The new editor, Casimiro Garcia-Abadillo, points to poor sales, which have halved in five years, and says Mr Ramirez alienated readers loyal to Mr Rajoy who found a feud over PP corruption too personal. 
El Pais's editor, Javier Moreno, also pursued corruption. But he has overseen a fall in circulation and last year sacked almost a third of the staff, damaging morale even as he cut operating losses. El Pais aims to be ""the global newspaper"" in Spanish; its next editor, Antonio Cano, ran its Latin American website. Mr Cano denies that El Pais will shed its centre-left identity, though he is clearly more conservative than Mr Moreno. 
El Mundo vies with El Pais for domination of the Hispanic world's online news audience, but turning that into money is an uphill task, admits a senior executive at El Mundo. La Vanguardia's local Catalan subscription base has kept it mostly profitable. There the choice of Marius Carol as the next editor is being interpreted as a shift from the Catalan nationalist flag-waving of his predecessor, Jose Antich. 
If newspapers are not bending to political pressures, might they bow to more commercial ones? Some journalists admit to self-censorship for fear of annoying big advertisers. El Mundo accused Telefonica of cutting advertising after it reported a 2002 insider-trading probe against the firm's chairman, Cesar Alierta, a charge Telefonica denied. Although Telefonica accounts for only a small fraction of advertising--the biggest general advertisers are non-Spanish multinationals like Procter & Gamble and L'Oreal--other channels of influence also exist. Loss-making Prisa, the owner of El Pais, has been repairing its balance-sheet and has won a reprieve from its bankers. But after conversion of a convertible bond, Prisa's banks will own 16% of the shares, more than the founding Polanco family. Telefonica will also have a stake, and hedge funds claim another 17%. 
The biggest challenge is more fundamental. Dailies reach just a third of Spaniards. Print-advertising income has fallen by 56% since 2008; digital advertising has not made up for this. Owners want higher paper sales, more advertising and fancy websites, all done with smaller budgets and fewer staff. Battling political pressure is the least of their worries.

A TOLL road snakes west out of Madrid, offering a fast alternative to the jammed motorway alongside. Hailed a decade ago as a cure for congestion, the road's operator is now likely to be nationalised, as are those running three other loss-making roads into the capital. This is expected to cost taxpayers some EUR 2 billion ($2.7 billion), adding to a soaring national debt and on top of a EUR 50 billion bill for rescuing Spain's banks. 
Toll roads were designed as a response to Madrid's breakneck expansion, but a burst housing bubble stopped that in 2008. Spaniards, struggling with falling household incomes and loans, have become more tight-fisted. Traffic on the four toll roads has almost halved. That alone demonstrates that, even as it recovers, Spain is still suffering from the aftershocks of a double-dip recession that shrank GDP by 6.4% in total. 
In Brussels these days Spain is hailed as a prodigal son of the euro zone's troubled southern periphery. The economy returned to growth in the third quarter of 2013, with rising exports compensating for weak consumer and public spending. The Madrid stockmarket is booming, foreign investors are back, the current account is in surplus, bond yields have hit eight-year lows and new jobs are being created. It adds up to big progress in a country that once threatened to break apart the euro. 
What saved Spain? The pledge in July 2012 by Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, to be a true lender of last resort removed immediate doubts about the euro's survival. But reforms by the centre-right government of Mariano Rajoy have also helped Spain to achieve an ""internal devaluation"" by lowering costs. Because it is in the euro, the alternative of currency devaluation is not available. 
Measuring internal devaluation is tricky, but unit labour costs dropped in Spain for four years until a small uptick in late 2013, helping to boost exports. Labour reforms have let employers offer wage cuts rather than sackings, further driving down pay bills that began falling in 2010. Even so, Akos Valentinyi, of the German-based think-tank CESifo, says that Spain needs deeper labour market reform if it is to regain 3m lost jobs. 
Spain also has some of Europe's highest income-tax rates, but puny overall tax revenue. A report commissioned by Cristobal Montoro, the tax minister, proposes a shift from income tax and social-security contributions to consumer taxes while closing business-tax loopholes. The current system is as hole-ridden as a Gruyere cheese, says the report's co-author, Fernando Fernandez. But the budget deficit of 6.6% of GDP means that any cuts must be matched by tax rises elsewhere. And Mr Montoro refuses to increase sales tax. 
As jobs return, a virtuous cycle of improved confidence, consumer spending and faster growth could begin. Analysts are raising their projections, with some seeing GDP growing by 1.3% this year. Even so, unemployment, now standing at almost 26%, will take a decade to fall substantially. And as it is, the budget deficit barely fell last year, as public spending grew. The public debt has hit 94% of GDP. 
Rafael Domenech of BBVA, a bank, says Spain should aspire to more than being the best of the worst and, instead, measure itself against Europe's most successful economies. On this basis, it does badly. Research, technology and skills all lag. An education system that fails a section of the young will take years to fix. Spain's plethora of small companies may make productivity gains harder to achieve. Younger workers needed for the survival of the welfare state have emigrated or are jobless. 
Moreover, Spanish institutions are weak and often sclerotic in their actions. Spaniards may dream of a corruption-free country with minimal political interference. But short-term ambitions are more modest: a stable job is the most that many can hope for.","The economy is improving, but it still has a long way to go

A CONFERENCE in Barcelona on April 24th drew both Spain's prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, and Catalonia's premier, Artur Mas. But the two avoided each other, another example of how Spain is failing to tackle one of its thorniest problems: the future of this region of 7m people as support for independence grows. 
Talk of an independent Catalonia remains hypothetical. Yet all sides of the political spectrum now talk of an impending ""train crash"". Catalonia is not Scotland, whose referendum on September 18th was sanctioned by the British government. Spain's parliament voted by a huge majority last month to reject a request from the Catalan parliament for an independence vote. Mr Mas plans a non-binding referendum on November 9th. But Mr Rajoy hopes to have it banned by the constitutional court. What then? 
Mr Mas is being pushed by forces beyond his control. His Convergence and Union (CiU) coalition, which has backed Spain's decentralised system of 17 regional governments, trails the explicitly separatist Catalan Republican Left (ERC) in the polls. These also show 55% support for independence, and a far bigger majority wanting a vote. A pressure group called the National Assembly of Catalonia (ANC) plans another massive protest on Catalan national day in September, forming human mosaics of world leaders whose support it wants. Barack Obama and Pope Francis may find their giant portraits adorning the countryside. Pilar Rahola, who advises Mr Mas, predicts that ""two million people will be on the streets."" 
Mr Rajoy could call a referendum himself, but his conservative People's Party (PP) is not interested. He appears to hope that Spain's slow economic recovery will make the problem go away, pushing support for independence back below 50%. But Catalan politicians say this is unlikely. 
The ANC is threatening civil disobedience and a unilateral declaration of independence; ardent centralists mutter about Mr Rajoy suspending Catalonia's government and taking direct control. Either option could provoke bitter confrontation. The violent invasion by Spanish rightist thugs of a Catalan cultural centre in Madrid in September and a punch given to the Catalan socialist leader, Pere Navarro, by an angry woman on April 28th are worrying signs. ""The tension is getting worse,"" says Mr Navarro. 
The more likely outcome is that Mr Mas will call a new election which separatist parties will treat as a plebiscite on independence, in effect making it a referendum. That would shunt confrontation off. But it is unclear when any election might be called. Mr Mas could wait until 2016, after Spain's general election next year. But he will be pressed to move sooner. A new separatist government would then come under pressure from hardliners to make a unilateral declaration of independence. 
Two parties offer a middle way. The junior partner in Mr Mas's CiU coalition, the Catalan Democratic Union, wants a solution based on a confederation. That might keep Spain together while allowing Catalans to claim that they are sovereign. It has also been backed by a Basque leader, Inigo Urkullu, whose Basque Nationalist Party wants more autonomy. Mr Navarro's socialists defend a Catalan right to self-determination if approved by Madrid, and want a federal answer for Spain. But this would need a constitutional change that requires PP support. 
A more immediate idea is that Mr Mas and Mr Rajoy should talk. But that is unlikely to happen until after the European election later this month. The train crash comes ever closer.","Catalonia is set on an independence vote , despite Madrid 's hostility

THE indignados are back. The spontaneous movement of the ""indignant ones"" found a new mouthpiece in Podemos (""We Can""), an internet-savvy leftist party founded four months ago, which stormed past older opposition groups to become Spain's fourth most-voted-for party. In cities like Madrid it came third behind the Socialist Party and the People's Party (PP), beating the traditional, communist-led United Left (IU) and its coalition allies. 
After years of high unemployment and austerity Spanish voters are angry, though more with their own politicians than with Europe. As a result Spain has its own equivalent of Greece's far-left party, Syriza, a future partner in the European Parliament. Podemos is both deeply serious with its anti-EU austerity and anti-globalisation creed and fiercely radical. One of its new MEPs hails from a group called Anticapitalist Left. The party's pony-tailed, telegenic leader, Pablo Iglesias, a 35-year-old university lecturer, promises to return from Brussels to lead Podemos into a general election that is due within 20 months. 
Podemos took 8% of the vote, which set off two political shocks. The duopoly of the two big parties was broken, as the Socialists and PP jointly sank below the 50% mark for the first time in three decades. And Podemos helped to destroy the position of Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, the Socialist leader, who failed to woo voters unhappy with the conservative PP prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, and with 25% unemployment. The Socialists sank to an historic low of 23%, whereas the PP remained the party with the highest score (albeit only a meagre 26%), bringing some relief to Mr Rajoy and his gaffe-ridden leading candidate for the European Parliament, Miguel Arias Canete. But Mr Rajoy cannot be complacent. Left-wing parties together won 43% of the vote, against 31% for the right (and 9% for regional nationalists or separatists) and a messy left-wing coalition may win in the medium term. 
By beating the Socialists, Mr Rajoy is still able to portray the PP's spectacular collapse from a high of 45% in the general election in 2011 as a sort of victory. But Mr Rubalcaba had nowhere to hide. Podemos gloated that many of its voters had defected from the Socialists. ""The responsibility is mine, mine, mine,"" said Mr Rubalcaba. He called a conference in July to choose his replacement. But who will that be? And will he or she have to stand at separate primaries to become the party's candidate for prime minister at the general election? 
The answer to the second question is probably yes. And that makes the answer to the first much trickier. There are three obvious choices. Spain's most powerful Socialist is Susana Diaz, the 39-year-old president of the regional government in Andalusia. She has a real job and presides over the mightiest federation in the party. One in four Socialist voters come from her region. Young and fresh, she can use Andalusia's muscle and her experience of party political dealing to grab the top spot if she wants. But she says she is not interested in being the future candidate for prime minister. She may settle merely for taking the secretary-general position, playing kingmaker from the shadows. 
There are two other possible leaders. The former defence minister, Carme Chacon, is hobbled by not having a parliamentary seat. Eduardo Madina, the young deputy leader of the parliamentary party, may be too green. Whoever wins must rebuild a party that leftists think has abandoned its principles and many still blame for the double-dip recession from which Spain has only just emerged. Ms Diaz might find it safer to stay in Andalusia.","Mariano Rajoy quits after a humiliating election defeat

IT WAS a sorry end to an historic reign. When King Juan Carlos said he was abdicating after almost 39 years on the throne, he recognised the futility of trying to regain popularity lost by scandal and arrogance. On June 18th Spain's parliament will give effect to the decision so his son can take the throne as Felipe VI. The news was greeted with joy. ""A new era!"" heralded one front page. Others spoke of a ""second transition"", to match the one from dictatorship to democracy that Juan Carlos helped to steer early in his reign. A country depressed by mass unemployment and corruption saw the abdication as proof that change is possible. Juan Carlos himself talked of ""hope"" as one of the gifts his 46-year-old son would bring a country emerging from a bruising double-dip recession. 
The Spanish monarch was a victim of his own success. His aims when he was put on the throne by Francisco Franco, who appointed him as his successor, were to restore democracy and re-establish a monarchy thrown out 44 years earlier. Remarkably, he achieved both. 
He began as a rare thing in the late 20th century: a monarch with considerable executive power. He gave up that power by leading his country into constitutional democracy. In return, Spaniards voted to keep the monarchy. They wanted to avoid renewed bloody confrontation between what the poet Antonio Machado called ""the two Spains"" (of left and right) that provoked civil war in the 1930s. Juan Carlos's swift squashing of an attempted coup in 1981 settled his place in Spaniards' hearts. For many years, he was one of Europe's most popular monarchs. 
The new monarchy had come with special privileges, including minimal public scrutiny of the king's personal and financial affairs. The press complied, ignoring the king's amorous adventures and the dodgy business dealings of those around him. The king, it was assumed, continued discreetly to exercise some power by banging politicians' heads together or helping to negotiate deals with foreign powers. He deserved to be left alone. 
Yet as Spanish democracy became more robust, this deal began to crack. A new generation that saw democracy as natural demanded transparency and higher ethical standards. The royal family did not notice. The king's daughter, Cristina, and son-in-law, Inaki Urdangarin, became embroiled in sleaze allegations that suggested how, at the very least, they exploited their royal status to rake in public money for consultancy work. Fraud and tax-avoidance claims against them are being investigated by the courts. 
Juan Carlos also behaved as if nothing had changed. In 2012, as Spain reeled from recession, he flitted to Botswana for a free elephant-hunting trip, accompanied by a glamorous German woman. Spaniards found out only after he was injured and a special aircraft was sent to bring him home. The local branch of the World Wide Fund for Nature fired him. Juan Carlos apologised in public. But the royal family was seen to be poking its snout in the same corruption trough as some politicians. Abdication means Spaniards may forget the scandals and recall Juan Carlos's contribution to their country's history. 
They may also benefit from some economic uplift. At a summit organised by The Economist in Madrid this week, Mariano Rajoy, the prime minister, crowed over record job growth in May. Luis de Guindos, the finance minister, announced lower borrowing because domestic demand and credit had risen faster than expected. Yet unemployment is still at 25%; it will take years to fall to pre-crisis levels. 
Luis Garicano, of the London School of Economics, says a recent surge in imports risks tipping Spain back into the sort of current-account deficit that left it so exposed before. Among the political risks facing the future king are the rise of an anti-capitalist, anti-monarchist left and of Catalan separatism. Those could hurt the economy too. The winds of change could yet blow in a less happy direction.

SPAIN is, as ever, in transition. Two old totems of pride, King Juan Carlos and the national soccer team, have crashed and burned. The now ex-king handed the throne to his son, Felipe VI, on June 19th, a day after Spain's trophy-laden soccer stars were booted out of the World Cup. Fortunately the country has meatier reasons for cheer. With recession over and jobs being created, it is shaking off the long hangover caused by its bubble-fuelled party. 
Even Mariano Rajoy, the centre-right prime minister, seems surprised by the pace of recovery. The government did not expect internal demand or credit to small companies and consumers to pick up so soon. Growth is already boosting employment, opening the way to a virtuous cycle of increased demand and more job creation. Growth predictions for next year are being revised upwards, some to over 2%. Investors have arrived in force, hoping it will soon be party time again. Life will get better for credit-starved small businesses, after the European Central Bank announced EUR 400 billion ($544 billion) of cheap loans to euro-zone banks that lend more to businesses. The government is promising small tax cuts, but steering clear of ambitious fiscal reform as it tries to recover popularity before next year's election. It has tightened this year's budget deficit target from 5.8% of GDP to 5.5%. 
Bond yields have plunged, meaning that convalescent Spain borrows at similar (or even lower) rates to the United States. That brings dangers, as it risks falling into the old vices of easy credit, trade deficits and a two-tier economy hobbled by poorly trained workers and undersized companies. Until now Mr Rajoy's government has preached the virtues of export-led growth. Exports have indeed boomed remarkably, but imports are now picking up, so Spain could easily tip back into a current-account deficit. And all this is happening in a country where public debt will rise above 100% next year, companies still owe more than 120% of GDP and unemployment is a shocking 25%. Exceptional accounting rules are still in place, even though they allow some companies to stay alive by ignoring the impact on their assets of the country's property crash. 
Spain's exports may have grown, but Jesus Terciado of Cepyme, a small- and medium-business organisation, points out that almost 90% still come from the largest 5,000 companies. Yet companies with more than 250 employees account for only 41% of Spanish jobs. The government sees making those smaller companies grow as the secret to a stronger recovery, but many are family-owned and conservative. 
Education remains divided, with an elite class passing through some of the world's best business schools even as others struggle through state and public universities that fail to make the top 150 in global rankings. The school system continues to expel underachievers and corruption bedevils training programmes. The OECD rich-country think-tank says that inequality grew more in Spain between 2007 and 2011 than in any other member country, with the young and poorest hit hardest. Many are turning away from traditional politics: far-left parties took more than 20% of the vote in the recent European elections. In Catalonia the escape valve for resentment is separatism. Even the arrival of a new king has not stemmed the flood of scandals engulfing Spain's institutions, the latest being the charging of his sister, Princess Cristina, with money-laundering and tax fraud.

It emerged that Zhou Yongkang, once one of China's most powerful men, is under investigation by the Communist Party for ""serious disciplinary violations""--ie, corruption. Mr Zhou, who was a member of the Politburo's ruling standing committee and who ran the state's security apparatus, is the most senior figure to be brought down in this way in decades. It perhaps marks a new consolidation of power by Xi Jinping, the president. 
Police shot dead dozens of Uighurs said to be attacking a police station with knives in China's restless western region of Xinjiang. It was the worst violence there for months. China adopts a hardline response to Uighur discontent. The authorities claimed to have thwarted a terrorist attack; Uighurs claimed excessive force. 
In the southern Philippines, Muslim rebels fired on a group making its way to a religious celebration, killing more than 20. The gunmen may have been from a militant group, Abu Sayyaf, that opposes a recent peace deal between the Philippine government and Muslim insurgents.

On July 30th Argentina entered into default for the eighth time in its history, after it failed to make a payment due to bondholders who had exchanged defaulted debt from 2001 for restructured securities. Argentina missed the payment after a ruling by a New York district court in favour of a small group of creditors who have been holding out for full repayment of the 2001 debt, plus interest. Axel Kicillof, the economy minister, criticised these ""vulture"" funds and the 
American judge. Last-ditch negotiations on a settlement between the government and the hold-outs fell through. Standard & Poor's promptly downgraded Argentina's foreign-currency debt.

The new sanctions make it harder for Europeans and Americans to invest in Russian state-owned banks, and prohibit the export of technology to its oil and defence industries. The gas industry was not targeted, presumably because several European countries depend on Russian gas exports. Russia called the measures ""destructive and short-sighted"". 
The death toll in the Ukraine war is mounting. The United Nations reported that by July 26th 1,129 people had been killed in eastern Ukraine, 799 of them civilians. Ukraine's army has made advances since the start of an offensive in early July, surrounding Donetsk, the region's biggest city, and establishing some control over border crossings. But many of the pro-Russian insurgents are now dug in to cities. To dislodge them, Ukraine may step up its shelling and engage in street fighting. That could speed up the rise in casualties. 
Spain's economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter of 2014, the fastest quarterly rate since the financial crisis began. This follows a report that Spain added 190,000 jobs in the past year, the first annual increase in six years. Economists view the gain as evidence that Spain's unpopular labour reforms are beginning to work. The prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, promised to enact further job-friendly measures after the summer break. 
The British government invited firms to bid for the right to extract shale gas, the first new licences for six years. Over 40% of Britain is now open for exploration. In an effort to assuage the concerns of environmentalists, the government said firms would be allowed to frack in national parks, heritage sites and areas of outstanding beauty only under ""exceptional circumstances"".

A federal judge overturned the District of Columbia's ban on carrying handguns in public, calling it unconstitutional. Police in Washington were instructed not to arrest residents with properly registered guns. City officials have 90 days to rewrite the law or appeal the decision. 
Elsewhere a federal appeals court in Virginia struck down a state ban on same-sex marriage. Nearly all of the legal challenges to state bans have succeeded since the Supreme Court struck down part of the Defence of Marriage Act. 
California implemented emergency water restrictions in response to worsening drought conditions. In January Governor Jerry Brown declared a drought emergency, and urged Californians to cut water use by 20%. Fines of up to $500 a day could be levied upon homes and businesses caught wasting water. Fast spreading wildfires, around Sacramento and Yosemite national park, forced hundreds of people from their homes.","Three and a half weeks after Israel launched its military campaign against Hamas, the Palestinians' Islamist movement in Gaza, the death toll continued to rise, to around 1,400 Palestinians, 59 Israelis and one Thai. Civilians and civilian infrastructure have borne the brunt of Israeli operations. Diplomats sought in vain to arrange a ceasefire. 
The American embassy in Tripoli, Libya's capital, was evacuated after fighting between militias, which started three weeks ago over control of the international airport, spread farther. Efforts by the UN and the European Union to bring peace were, for the moment, abandoned. 
Fears rose that the E bola disease, which took off in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea a few months ago, may spread farther, after an American died of it in Nigeria, having flown there from Liberia. So far this year there have been more than 1,200 confirmed, suspected or probable cases of Ebola in west Africa. 
Dishonourable discharge 
It emerged that Zhou Yongkang, once one of China's most powerful men, is under investigation by the Communist Party for ""serious disciplinary violations""--ie, corruption. Mr Zhou, who was a member of the Politburo's ruling standing committee and who ran the state's security apparatus, is the most senior figure to be brought down in this way in decades. It perhaps marks a new consolidation of power by Xi Jinping, the president. 
Police shot dead dozens of Uighurs said to be attacking a police station with knives in China's restless western region of Xinjiang. It was the worst violence there for months. China adopts a hardline response to Uighur discontent. The authorities claimed to have thwarted a terrorist attack; Uighurs claimed excessive force. 
In the southern Philippines, Muslim rebels fired on a group making its way to a religious celebration, killing more than 20. The gunmen may have been from a militant group, Abu Sayyaf, that opposes a recent peace deal between the Philippine government and Muslim insurgents. 
The last surviving crew member of the Enola Gay, the B-29 that dropped America's atom bomb on Hiroshima on August 6th 1945, died at the age of 93. The plane's navigator, Theodore ""Dutch"" Van Kirk, said he never regretted the deaths of an estimated 140,000 Japanese, mainly civilians, because it helped end the second world war.

On July 30th Argentina entered into default for the eighth time in its history, after it failed to make a payment due to bondholders who had exchanged defaulted debt from 2001 for restructured securities. Argentina missed the payment after a ruling by a New York district court in favour of a small group of creditors who have been holding out for full repayment of the 2001 debt, plus interest. Axel Kicillof, the economy minister, criticised these ""vulture"" funds and the 
American judge. Last-ditch negotiations on a settlement between the government and the hold-outs fell through. Standard & Poor's promptly downgraded Argentina's foreign-currency debt. 
Residents of the port of Buenaventura on Colombia's Pacific coast were left without power after an electricity-transmission tower was destroyed. President Juan Manuel Santos pointed the finger at FARC guerrillas, with whom he is currently conducting peace talks.

THIS was the news the government had been waiting for. ""Spain's labour market has made a 180-degree turn,"" crowed the prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, as the country announced the first annual rise in employment in six years. The numbers show that unpopular reforms to the malfunctioning labour market are starting to work. But there is plenty left to do. 
In the past year Spain has created 190,000 jobs. The unemployment rate, still one of the highest in the euro zone, fell from 26% to 24.5% (see chart), and the labour force stopped shrinking after six straight quarters of decline. 
The labour reform in 2012 gave companies more flexibility to set wages and working conditions themselves rather than through sector-wide bargaining, and cut severance payments for unfair dismissals. Those changes, buttressed by a deal between unions and employers, tempered wage growth that had far outstripped gains in productivity. How much credit do they deserve for the upturn in employment? 
The answer may determine the political fate of Mr Rajoy, who defied street protests to push reform through and faces a general election by the end of next year. The opposition Socialist Party claims that the number of unemployed has risen by more than 600,000 since Mr Rajoy took office in 2011, despite the reforms. Pedro Sanchez, the party's new secretary-general, promises to repeal them if it regains power. 
That would be a mistake. Other factors contributed to the jobs recovery, especially the ""whatever it takes"" pledge by the European Central Bank two years ago to save the euro. But reform played an important role, says Rafael Domenech, an economist at BBVA, a bank. One piece of evidence is that Spain is creating jobs at lower rates of GDP growth than before. In previous cycles, employment rose when growth hit 2%. This time the gain came during a year when GDP expanded by just 1.2%. 
To make a serious dent in unemployment, however, Spain will need to be more ambitious. Without further changes, the jobless rate will not dip below 20% until 2019, according to the IMF. The structural unemployment rate--the level reached when the economy is working at capacity--is 18%, triple that of America. 
One problem is that many small companies (with ten workers or fewer) have not benefited from greater flexibility. That is because the process of opting out of sector-wide agreements can be cumbersome. Such opt-outs could be made easier. 
Another is that nearly a quarter of workers are still on temporary contracts. This is damaging, because they are much less productive than those with permanent jobs and employers do not invest in them. One way to encourage firms to hire permanent workers would be to cut severance payments to the levels of other European countries. 
Nor has much been done for the 3.5m people who have been jobless for more than a year, says Marcel Jansen of Madrid's Autonoma University. Many are poorly educated: Spain has one of the highest school drop-out rates in the OECD. Those with qualifications often find that they are not the ones employers want. 
The answers, says Mr Jansen, include spending more on retraining and overhauling state-run employment offices, which do a poor job of matching workers' skills with local employers' needs. The government has tightened rules for people receiving unemployment benefit to encourage them to look for work or to take training courses. But they need to be effectively enforced. 
The government could lower the cost of hiring workers by cutting social-security contributions, which are high by European standards. A rise in value-added tax could pay for that. Others advocate lowering the minimum wage for unskilled workers. 
Mr Rajoy says he will not let up on reform until Spain's unemployment plague becomes merely a ""sad"" episode in history. He has started talks with unions and employers on a package of job-friendly measures, to be hammered out after the summer break. But with elections looming, few expect it to be bold.

SPANIARDS call a chat between two people unwilling to listen to each other a conversation between besugos--the grimacing, pop-eyed sea bream. The description often suits their politicians' discussions, but perhaps not for much longer. With Spain's traditional parties in decline and Catalan separatism on the rise, they may soon be forced into a proper dialogue. 
The prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, missed one chance to start such a discussion when he met Catalonia's regional president, Artur Mas, on July 30th. Catalonia's regional parliament, where Mr Mas's Convergence and Union (CiU) coalition is propped up by the separatist Catalan Republican Left (ERC), plans to pass a law in early September setting a non-binding referendum on independence for November 9th. Mr Rajoy, who wants to ban the referendum, will ask judges to declare it unconstitutional. That would force Mr Mas to square a circle: he has pledged both to stay within the law and to consult Catalans on independence. 
One way out might be to bring forward regional elections, though the ERC would probably win as more extreme parties snatch votes off moderates like the Socialists. The latter propose a ""third way"" solution of greater federalism that is gaining traction with voters across Spain. If, however, Scotland votes for independence from the United Kingdom in its referendum on September 18th, that would provide a precedent in the European Union and boost Catalans' separatist passions. 
In the rest of Spain, where regional elections are scheduled for next May and general elections about six months later, the political establishment is splintering. Polls put Mr Rajoy's centre-right People's Party (PP) at a 25-year low. The opposition Socialists are doing even worse. With GDP at the level of 2006 and a 24% unemployment rate, voters are tiring of the two parties who have run Spain for three decades. 
The Socialists have a new leader in 42-year-old Pedro Sanchez, a relative unknown who took over from Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba in July. The latter resigned after winning just 23% of the vote in European elections in May. Mr Sanchez heads a new generation of party leaders, but must still play by old rules. He is still only party secretary-general; he must win a separate primary to become the Socialist candidate in the general election, and could find himself in a messy fight. 
The bigger game-changer is a new far-left group, Podemos, which won 8% of the vote in May just months after being formed. Raw polling data now show it in a three-way tie with the Socialists and PP. Like Greece's Syriza and Italy's Five Star movement, Podemos is part of a new wave of radical parties to emerge from the wreckage of Europe's economic crisis. It calls for nationalising important industries, hiking business taxes, raising the minimum wage, imposing a maximum salary, limiting the working week to 35 hours and reducing the retirement age to 60. It also suggests non-payment of ""illegitimate"" parts of public debt, and a referendum on leaving NATO. If it can hold together until the regional elections, Podemos will hold the key to PP bastions like Madrid and Valencia. 
Podemos has a smart, telegenic leader, Pablo Iglesias, a university lecturer. But its popularity is best explained by the bad behaviour of traditional parties. Last month Jordi Pujol, a Catalan nationalist from Mr Mas's CiU coalition who served six terms as the region's president, admitted concealing millions of dollars from tax authorities. He joins a list of prominent tax cheats that already contains senior bankers, politicians and, allegedly, members of the royal family. Jaume Matas, a former PP president of the Balearic Islands government, is in jail. So is the PP's former treasurer. In the Socialist stronghold of Andalusia, a series of scandals has dragged senior party members and trade unionists before a judge. 
""Drip by drip, the corruption cases help Podemos,"" says Jose Pablo Ferrandiz of Metroscopia, a polling group. Mr Iglesias refers sneeringly to mainstream politicians as la casta (the caste). The collapse last month of Gowex, an internet firm that engaged in massive accounting fraud, has increased the gloom. Spaniards now rate corruption a higher concern than the economy. Only unemployment worries them more. 
Mr Rajoy hopes Spain's nascent recovery will help him with voters. The economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter, and showed annual net job creation for the first time since 2008. A speedy take-off could aid the PP, though stalled export growth is a danger. Only one thing seems assured: Spanish politics is fracturing. As a result parties will get smaller, and will probably have to form coalitions to govern. Sooner or later the besugos will have to start talking to each other.","A calendar dominated by Catalan separatism and elections

IT IS not the narrative that Catalan separatists hoped for as they face a stand-off with the Madrid government over a planned independence vote in November. Instead of a debate about evil Castilian conquistadors, their cause has been overshadowed by a scandal over a fallen hero, Jordi Pujol, who served for six terms as leader of Catalonia. 
Four weeks ago Mr Pujol admitted that his family had hidden money in Switzerland for the past 35 years. ""We never found the right moment to declare it,"" he said breezily. The confession comes at an awkward time. Mr Pujol's hand-picked successor as head of his Convergence and Union (CiU) group, and Catalonia's current leader, Artur Mas, has promised a referendum on November 9th. Spain's prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, will ban it. Separatists hoped this would swell their ranks. But now all the talk is of the 84-year-old Mr Pujol, a political giant in his region. 
The man who set Catalonia on a path from no self-government to an annual budget of EUR 25.5 billion ($33.9 billion, about half of Ireland's) liked to be called ""president"" or ""the most honourable"". A foundation bearing his name specialises in ethics. In 23 years as president until 2003, he became a master at persuading Catalans that they were victims of Madrid. The battle cry of the independence campaign is that the rest of Spain steals Catalan taxes and wastes them on lazy southerners. Now Mr Pujol himself has been found hiding his own stash of cash. 
Other family members are under investigation. A son, also called Jordi, goes before a judge in mid-September to answer questions about tax fraud and money-laundering after a girlfriend accused him of carrying bags of EUR 500 notes to Andorra. Another son, Oriol, has quit as secretary-general of the senior partner in the CiU group, Catalan Democratic Convergence: an investigating judge suspects him of taking bribes. A legion of longtime Pujol-haters in Spain are dancing on the dynasty's political grave and hoping that this may kill the referendum. 
The scandal will hurt Mr Mas, but it does not sink separatism. He is being tugged in opposite directions by his referendum pledge. His more moderate coalition partner, Democratic Catalan Union (UDC), has threatened to quit. The ardently separatist Catalan Republican Left (ERC), which props up his minority government, wants him to defy Madrid by calling an illegal referendum if need be. It also demands an inquiry if Mr Pujol does not appear before the Catalan parliament. 
Mr Mas may hold an early election that serves as a proxy for a vote on independence. Carme Forcadell, leader of a Catalan pressure group that has driven the separatist surge, insists on this if Mr Rajoy blocks the referendum. But opinion polls show CiU trailing ERC. The Pujol affair will damage it further. If the UDC walks out, Mr Mas's party may be hammered. 
A test of separatist feeling will come on September 11th, Catalonia's national day. In previous years Ms Forcadell's group has called out millions to demand an independence vote. This year's protest may be less impressive. Those who want a new deal with Spain but dislike full independence may stay away. Anger about the economy, a source of many gripes, is dimming, but the Pujol scandal will spread disillusion. The man who built up Catalan national pride is now undermining it.

SILVIA CATALA, a publisher in Barcelona, used to live in Glasgow. On September 18th her social-message apps filled up with photographs from Glaswegian friends of the red and gold Catalan flag being waved by activists from the north-eastern Spanish region, visiting for Scotland's referendum on independence. Back in Barcelona the Loch Inn, a Scottish bar, showed its support by serving haggis with neeps and tatties (turnips and potatoes). 
Even forlorn and far-flung separatist hopes were briefly fanned: in the run-up to the Scottish vote the Texas Nationalist League said it was ""paving the way"" for the secession of Texas from the United States. Catalonia is not the only place where die-hards have found inspiration even in Scotland's eventual No. Separatists in Quebec, who have twice lost referendums, and where the Parti Quebecois (PQ), the main separatist party, has recently suffered a crushing defeat in a provincial election, have started to hope again, too. And the wording of the Scottish vote, the response of national governments to the possibility of defeat and the differing fortunes of the three nations' separatists hold lessons for governments and independence movements around the world. 
Since 2008 the Catalan independence movement has been boosted by the euro crisis and by Spain's economic travails. The region is one of Spain's richest; locals believe they are held back by an inept Madrid government. Their cause was strengthened in 2010 by widespread outrage after the country's constitutional court overturned parts of a 2006 Catalan self-government charter that referred to the region as a ""nation"" and further privileged the Catalan language. In recent years Catalonia's national day, September 11th, has seen huge marches for independence. 
The day after Scotland's vote Artur Mas, the Catalan president, steered a law allowing local referendums through Catalonia's parliament. As The Economist went to press he was due to announce a non-binding referendum for November 9th. The Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, is expected to ask the constitutional court to overturn the law and halt the referendum (the constitution says only the central government may call referendums on major issues). But Mr Mas is showing no sign of backing down. 
Catalan separatists contrast Mr Rajoy's stance with that of David Cameron, Britain's prime minister. ""We could have blocked [the referendum]...but I am also a democrat,"" he said after the vote. Mr Mas says that all Catalans seek is the chance to make a similar choice. Catalan separatists also think Mr Cameron was right to say that, if he had not agreed to a referendum, Scottish separatism would have been given a fillip. ""The [Spanish] government has helped us a lot,"" says Carme Forcadell, head of the Catalan National Assembly, a pressure group founded in 2012 that has helped push support for separatism to historic highs. Polling results are mixed. Although three-quarters of Catalans say they want a referendum, only around half identify as separatists. 
If Mr Mas bows to a ban imposed by the centre it would enrage the fervently separatist Catalan Republican Left (ERC) party which props up his minority government. He might turn to Catalonia's Socialists, who oppose any referendum not supported by the central government. He could defy the constitutional court, face arrest and see Catalonia's self-government suspended. Or he could resign and call elections: a resounding victory for separatist parties would be hard for the national government to ignore. But the ERC, historically more hardline than Mr Mas's own Convergence and Union coalition, would probably emerge the biggest winner. 
From aye to oui 
Quebec has experienced no similar separatist surge. Referendums on independence were lost in 1980 and 1995. The second of those losses, by a wafer-thin margin, seems to have been a high-water mark for separatism. The PQ, whose vote share is a reliable indication of separatist sentiment, was tossed out of power in April and is now leaderless. 
Young voters, who used to be keenest on independence, had been leaving in droves. But after witnessing the campaign in Scotland they have started to come back, says Jean-Francois Lisee, a potential PQ leadership contender. The negotiations between the British and Scottish governments on holding the referendum, the respect for campaign-spending limits and the simple majority required for secession were also fine examples for Canada, he adds--and very different from Quebec's previous two votes. 
The federal Clarity Act passed in 2000 gave the government in Ottawa the right to decide whether the question posed in any future referendum on independence was clear and whether a ""clear majority"" had been achieved. A Yes vote would merely trigger negotiations with the federal government. Legal separation would then require amending the constitution, a slow and difficult process. ""The Canadian way has been completely rebuffed by the British government,"" says Mr Lisee. ""That's a very powerful message."" 
Another lesson from Scotland for Quebec's separatists is the importance of winning immigrants over to the independence camp. A big reason for the PQ's failure in April was its proposal for a ""charter of values"", banning the display of ""conspicuous"" religious symbols in public buildings or by public employees. This alienated many of Quebec's 1m immigrants and many voters in multicultural Montreal. 
Identity politics was not completely absent in Scotland, says Andre Lecours of the University of Ottawa, who studies independence movements and was in Edinburgh for the vote. But overall Scotland's nationalists presented an inclusive vision of the country's future as an independent nation. Eligibility to vote depended on residency, rather than place of birth. Both Mr Lisee and Bernard Drainville, the minister behind the charter and another potential leadership candidate, have noted that the Scottish separatists' commitment to inclusion seemed to help their cause. 
Perhaps the most important lesson Quebec can offer Britain--and all governments with restless regions--is that the losing side will watch closely to see whether promises made in the dying days of a campaign are kept. As the polls briefly swung in favour of Scottish secession, Mr Cameron said that, if Scotland stayed, it would continue to be favoured in the allocation of public money, and would be granted new powers on matters such as taxation and welfare spending. Those promises are now proving a headache. But should Mr Cameron be tempted to fudge, he should note that the Canadian federal government's reneging on promises made before the 1980 vote led directly to the referendum in 1995--and continue to keep the separatist dream alive today.","Scotland 's No to independence disappointed separatists everywhere .

CATALONIA'S referendum on independence, planned for November 9th, will not now happen. Or might it, after all? On October 14th the Catalan president, Artur Mas, admitted that, with the referendum officially suspended by Spain's constitutional court, it would have to be scrapped. But, he added, some other sort of public consultation will still happen on that day--and it will involve ballot boxes. 
Mr Mas refused to provide details. He claimed that he did not want to give the Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, too many clues about his plans. Given the legal obstacles, even Mr Mas may not be sure how to proceed. Catalonia's more radical and leftist separatists were angered by his decision to obey the court while calling for a watered-down, pseudo-referendum. They want an early election in this rich and populous region of north-east Spain. Mr Mas is trying to deflect the separatists' claims of cowardice by ramping up the war of words. ""The Spanish state is the adversary,"" he declared. 
A three-way game of brinkmanship between Mr Rajoy, Mr Mas and the separatist Catalan Republican Left (ERC) party that props up his government in Catalonia is creating uncertainty. Mr Rajoy has used the constitutional court to block the referendum, though it may take another five months to rule definitively that it is illegal. He offers little else beyond a readiness to talk. ERC proposes civil disobedience, an illegal referendum and, eventually, a unilateral declaration of independence. If it cannot have these, it wants an election that it is likely to win. If one is not called, it threatens to withdraw support from the government led by Mr Mas's Convergence and Union (CiU), making it impossible to pass a budget for 2015. 
Mr Mas is on a tightrope. His mock referendum buys time and is a clever bid to win temporary backing from the well-organised civil activists who are the motor behind separatism. After November 9th, he says, there should be a single-issue plebiscitary election, in which separatists stand together to allow Catalan voters formally to express their views on independence. But such an election would split CiU, which unites Mr Mas's mostly separatist Catalan Democratic Convergence (CDC) party with the largely non-separatist Democratic Union of Catalonia (UDC). The UDC has already suggested that it may form a new centrist coalition. 
Mr Mas wants ERC to join him in a single list, in effect forming another coalition. If ERC instead insists on standing separately, an election might be a long time coming, because Mr Mas's CDC would be hammered. It will lose the votes of moderates, who fear a damaging stand-off with Madrid, and of convinced separatists, who are shifting to ERC. But without holding an election, Mr Mas will be left leading a lame-duck government. 
Whoever wins in Catalonia will not gain an absolute majority. Nor, thanks to an upsurge of support for smaller parties, will the victor in Spain's general election, due late next year. Fragmentation of the political landscape only increases the uncertainty. But it could also force politicians of different stripes to negotiate--something that has been noticeably missing from the Catalan debate so far.","A referendum is off , but a vote is still on .

JOSE ANGEL FERNANDEZ VILLA led the biggest miners' union in northern Asturias. Francisco Granados was a key minister in the Madrid region. Jordi Pujol was president of Catalonia for 23 years. The three men have one thing in common: they all allegedly hid large sums of money in secret foreign bank accounts. The accounts, unveiled during a rash of recent arrests and investigations, are the tip of an iceberg of corruption that now threatens to sink the Spanish political establishment. Until this week the prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, and other mainstream Spanish politicians were sailing blithely towards it. Now they are scrambling for the lifeboats. 
Mr Granados was one of 51 people arrested on charges of bribery and embezzlement on October 27th, including six sitting mayors. Most, like Mr Granados, belong to Mr Rajoy's centre-right Popular Party (PP). But the main opposition party, the Socialists, faces corruption scandals too. So do the governing coalition in the region of Catalonia and the country's two largest trade unions, the Union General de Trubajadores and the Comisiones Obreras. 
The PP is the worst sinner. A former interior minister, Angel Acebes, is being probed for his role in a funding scandal that has already sent the party's treasurer, Luis Barcenas, to jail. Rodrigo Rato, a former finance minister and head of the IMF, allegedly used company credit cards to top up his salary tax-free while he was running a savings bank, Bankia, which the state later bailed out in 2012 at a cost of EUR 22 billion ($27 billion). Dozens of other officials used Bankia cards too, including not only PP but also Socialist politicians and union bosses. Mr Villa allegedly amassed EUR 1.4m in Swiss bank accounts even as his union's members lost their jobs. Mr Pujol kept his money hidden from the tax authorities while presiding over a foundation that specialised in ethics. 
Mr Rajoy has sometimes downplayed Spanish corruption as a matter of a few bad apples, but the wave of arrests has forced him to promise action. ""I apologise in the PP's name to all Spaniards,"" he said in a speech on October 28th. Other parties suddenly sound equally serious. Polls find that Spaniards rank corruption as their second-highest concern, after unemployment. Some also show both the PP and the Socialists falling behind Podemos, a grassroots leftist party that has taken Spanish politics by storm since it was founded in March. Full of enthusiasm but light on policy prescriptions, Podemos condemns the entire political establishment as a self-serving elite which it terms ""the caste"". It pledges to throw out the lot. 
In private, some ministers insist there is no more corruption in Spain than elsewhere. Things are better than in the 1990s, says one, when even the chief of the Civil Guard was on the take. The scandals at least show that the police and the courts take corruption seriously. But on the perceived-corruption index of Transparency International, Spain last year slipped from 30th to 40th place. A civic group based in Madrid, Access Info, claims Spain has been far behind other EU countries in introducing legislation concerning transparency. The country's Public Accounts Tribunal, which audits spending, is plagued by nepotism. The real problem, says Fernando Jimenez of Murcia University, is patronage: regulatory agencies and town halls are staffed by political appointees. Spain will hold municipal, regional and general elections in 2015. Either the political establishment reforms itself, says Mr Jimenez, or voters will be driven to wilder options such as Podemos. It is not clear that this message has got through yet.","A wave of arrests upends the political establishment 
 JOSE ANGEL FERNANDEZ VILLA led the biggest miners ' union in northern Asturias . Francisco Granados was a key minister in the Madrid region . Jordi Pujol was president of Catalonia for 23 years . The three men have one thing in common : they all allegedly hid large sums of money in secret foreign bank accounts . The accounts , unveiled during a rash of recent arrests and investigations , are the tip of an iceberg of corruption that now threatens to sink the Spanish political establishment . Until this week Mariano Rajoy were sailing blithely towards it . Now Mariano Rajoy are scrambling for the lifeboats . 
 Mr Granados was one of 51 people arrested on charges of bribery and embezzlement on October 27th , including six sitting mayors . Most , like Mr Granados , belong to Mr Rajoy 's centre - right Popular Party ( PP ) . But the main opposition party , the Socialists , faces corruption scandals too . So do the governing coalition in the region of Catalonia and the country 's two largest trade unions , the Union General de Trubajadores and the Comisiones Obreras . 
 The PP is the worst sinner . A former interior minister , Angel Acebes , is being probed for his role in a funding scandal that has already sent the party 's treasurer , Luis Barcenas , to jail . Rodrigo Rato , a former finance minister and head of the IMF , allegedly used company credit cards to top up his salary tax - free while he was running a savings bank , Bankia , which the state later bailed out in 2012 at a cost of EUR 22 billion ( $ 27 billion ) . Dozens of other officials used Bankia cards too , including not only PP but also Socialist politicians and union bosses . Mr Villa allegedly amassed EUR 1.4 m in Swiss bank accounts even as his union 's members lost their jobs . Mr Pujol kept his money hidden from the tax authorities while presiding over a foundation that specialised in ethics . 
 Mr Rajoy has sometimes downplayed Spanish corruption as a matter of a few bad apples , but the wave of arrests has forced him to promise action . "" I apologise in the PP 's name to all Spaniards , "" he said in a speech on October 28th . Other parties suddenly sound equally serious . Polls find that Spaniards rank corruption as their second - highest concern , after unemployment . Some also show both the PP and the Socialists falling behind Podemos , a grassroots leftist party that has taken Spanish politics by storm since it was founded in March . Full of enthusiasm but light on policy prescriptions , Podemos condemns the entire political establishment as a self - serving elite which it terms "" the caste "" . It pledges to throw out the lot . 
 In private , some ministers insist there is no more corruption in Spain than elsewhere . Things are better than in the 1990s , says one , when even the chief of the Civil Guard was on the take . The scandals at least show that the police and the courts take corruption seriously . But on the perceived - corruption index of Transparency International , Spain last year slipped from 30th to 40th place . A civic group based in Madrid , Access Info , claims Spain has been far behind other EU countries in introducing legislation concerning transparency .

SECESSION is a nasty business. A century and a half ago, America fought a civil war to prevent it. So it is not surprising that Spain, which has bad memories of its own civil war, should oppose independence for Catalonia. Spain's refusal to allow a referendum on the issue is, however, matched by Catalonia's determination to hold one--hence the vote the regional government held on November 9th, in which 80% of those who participated voted for independence (see page 39). The government in Madrid called the vote illegal, and a failure because turnout was only 37%; the Catalan one said that it demonstrated the case for Catalonia's independence. 
Neither is right. The case for holding a referendum is strong, but if there is one, Catalonia should vote to stay part of Spain. 
Better together 
The Popular Party government under Mariano Rajoy is holding firm to the position that, under the 1978 constitution, no referendum can be held at all. That line owes something to the government's desire to win nationalist votes in next year's Spanish election, but it also springs from genuine fear about what would happen to Spain if Catalonia peeled off. 
Catalan nationalists have drawn strength from the Scottish referendum earlier this year, but Catalonia is not Scotland. In relation to the rest of Spain, it is twice as big, with around 16% of the country's population. It is also much richer, contributing almost a fifth of GDP and, unlike Scotland, transferring substantial sums to the rest of the country. Moreover, Spain has other restless regions: were Catalonia to go, so might the Basque Country and Galicia. Catalan independence would thus pose a serious risk to Spain's very existence. 
Yet there are both principled and pragmatic reasons why the government should permit a vote. On the first, it is right to be cautious about breaking up countries, but when a region is a recognisable cultural, ethnic or linguistic entity, outright refusal to allow a vote is perverse. It would have been wrong to force Slovakia to remain in Czechoslovakia or Kosovo in Serbia, just as it was wrong for Britain to fight Irish independence. It would be just as wrong to make Flanders remain Belgian, Quebec stay Canadian or Scotland continue to be British, if a clear majority of voters preferred independence. 
The pragmatic case for a referendum is that, until recently, polls suggested that fewer than half of Catalans wanted independence, but a huge majority believed they should have the right to choose. The evidence is that, by rejecting the second demand, Madrid is helping the separatists. 
So the government should let the Catalans have a referendum. It should set some conditions, such as a minimum turnout of 80%, and maybe even a second vote, three years later. As Canada did with Quebec in its 2000 Clarity Act, it should insist on a fair process in any vote--a clear question that gets a clear answer, in other words. It should then devote its energy to persuading the Catalans to stay. As with Scotland, this newspaper would be on that side of the argument. 
Catalonia cannot plausibly claim to be a victim of central-government oppression. Catalan business and finance has benefited from being part of Spain, whose economy once again is growing. Excessive Catalan nationalism is more of a danger. It has already damaged the publishing and media industries in Barcelona. And secession would also raise doubts about Catalonia's continuing membership of the European Union (and the euro). 
The Spanish government could do plenty to persuade Catalonia to stay--as the British government belatedly did with Scotland. It should restore the powers that were ruled against by the Spanish constitutional court in 2010. It should also promise a constitutional convention that looks again at the distribution of powers agreed on in 1978. Spain is already the most devolved country in Europe. But although spending is often done at regional level, policies are frequently still laid down in Madrid. And powers of taxation could also be re-examined. As the opposition Socialists are hinting, a federal structure modelled on Germany's might suit both Catalonia and Spain. 
With an imaginative government at the centre, Catalonia might well vote to stay with Spain. But the issue now is whether Mr Rajoy wants to treat voters as grown-ups who can be trusted to decide sensibly about their own political future. By refusing even to contemplate a referendum for Catalonia on independence, he is failing to do that.","The Madrid government should let the Catalans have a vote -- and then defeat the separatists at the polls

MANUEL MOLINS remembers being called a ""Catalan dog"" after Spain's civil war in the 1930s. But the 93-year-old had his revenge on November 9th, when he voted for the region's independence in Lleida, one of Catalonia's four provincial capitals. ""Catalonia is important for Spain, but they treat us badly. If they didn't, I might think differently,"" he said. Mr Molins' vote brought no consequences. He was one of 1.9m Catalans (out of 6.3m who were eligible) to vote for independence at a mock referendum called by the region's president, Artur Mas. The turnout of 37% was hailed as a triumph by Mr Mas and a resounding failure by his opponents. 
The vote ends the game of legal cat-and-mouse between Madrid and Barcelona in which the constitutional court has twice banned Mr Mas's attempts to hold an official, if non-binding, vote. The polls show widespread support in Catalonia for a referendum on independence similar to the one that was held in Scotland on September 18th, even among many who are against secession. But Spain's prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, refuses to allow one. 
Mr Mas relied on separatist volunteers to man the polling booths, though opponents still want to know why police did not prevent taxpayers' money and public buildings being used. Mr Mas may be taken to court for disobeying the constitutional court. Madrid is wary of creating a separatist martyr, but Spain's sluggish courts would take years to decide whether to fine him or ban him from public office. 
Yet he was the obvious winner on November 9th. He honoured his promise to hold a vote and gained increased power over a separatist movement that he has struggled to control. He cocked a snook at Madrid, warming the hearts of many Catalans who see Mr Rajoy's Popular Party (PP) government as aggressively centralising. It is impossible to know how many voters were taking aim at the PP, which usually wins only 13% of Catalan votes, and how many really wanted independence. Nor does anyone know how abstainers would vote in a real referendum. Opinion polls suggest a vote could go either way. 
The immediate future is murky and quarrelsome. Mr Mas is calling for a formal referendum. Mr Rajoy will not give him one. So the Catalan president threatens to call a snap regional election instead, as a form of plebiscitary vote on independence. But that needs agreement with his rivals in the separatist camp and could break up his Convergence and Union (CiU) coalition, which has ruled Catalonia for 27 of the past 34 years. 
Doing a deal with his main rival, the separatist Catalan Republican Left (ERC), will be tricky. ERC leads in the opinion polls and is well-placed to wrench power from CiU. Much depends on whether Mr Mas and the ERC's leader, Oriol Junqueras, care more about an independence vote than about their parties. Negotiations are expected to revolve around Mr Mas's preferred option of separatists running on a single list. A plebiscitary election would probably see the junior partner in CiU, the Catalan Democratic Union, split away. Mr Mas's broad-based Catalan Democratic Convergence Party would also have to position itself clearly for independence. 
Mr Rajoy's government hopes the November 9th vote has released some steam from the separatist pressure cooker. It is waiting to see if Mr Mas and Mr Junqueras fall out. ERC has withdrawn support from Mr Mas's minority government, so it will be hard to pass a budget for next year. In the rosiest of scenarios for Madrid, Mr Mas would forget about an early election and govern with the support of Catalonia's moderate socialists, who propose a federalist reform of Spain's constitution, for another year or two. 
A darker scenario sees Mr Mas calling an election and losing resoundingly to ERC. Mr Junqueras threatens a unilateral declaration of independence. The consequences, for Catalonia and for Spain, are unforeseeable but potentially highly damaging. ""Even an orderly break-up of the country would pose risks to the national economy; much more so a disorderly break-up,"" says Fitch, a ratings agency. 
A plebiscitary election would force Catalan voters to think hard about the pros and cons of rupture. Chief among the risks is that, with Madrid against, Catalonia might be forced out of the European Union. Dolors Lopez, the PP boss in Lleida, points out that around 30% of local farmers' income comes from Brussels handouts. Benefits from independence would include more tax revenues generated in wealthy Catalonia being spent there. 
Many would like Mr Mas and Mr Rajoy to sit down and talk. The two leaders claim to be ready. But meaningful dialogue requires them to show more flexibility. With a general election expected at the end of 2015, both men could be out of office by next Christmas. Real dialogue may have to wait until after that.","The Catalan "" vote "" on November 9th will do little to resolve the future either of the region or of Spain

THEY chanted and sang and promised happiness. But after Spain's radical Podemos (""We Can"") party chose its leaders on November 15th it remained remarkably thin on policy. ""There is still much to do,"" admitted the party leader, Pablo Iglesias, after 89% of the party's 107,000 internet voters had ticked his name. 
The rise of Podemos is a triumph for Mr Iglesias and the technologically astute university lecturers and activists who designed, launched and kept control of the party in its first ten months. It also marks the resurgence of the indignados, protesters who peacefully took over city squares in May 2011, two-and-a-half years after Spain first plunged into the economic dumps. 
It has taken years of chronic unemployment, a banking bail-out, a second dip into recession (now over) and a flood of corruption cases to see the amorphous indignados take shape in party politics. In opinion polls support for Podemos has surged as high as 28%. But turning this into real votes may yet prove difficult. 
Podemos stood for its first elections, to the European Parliament, in May and took 8% of the vote. Just six months later it is neck-and-neck in the polls with both the Popular Party (PP) led by Mariano Rajoy, Spain's less-than popular prime minister, and the stuttering opposition Socialists. Along the way it has sunk Spain's communist-led United Left (IU) coalition. 
Mr Iglesias promises a new politics, beyond the left-right paradigm. Yet many are sceptical. Some senior party members come from groups with names like Youth with No Future or the Anti-Capitalist Left. Others have worked with Venezuela's Bolivarian left. On November 15th Mr Iglesias railed against Spain's ""regime"" and ""oligarchies"". He was greeted with cries of ""Yes, we can!"" and ""Let's get them!"" The guest speaker was Alexis Tsipras, leader of Greece's radical Syriza party. 
Mr Iglesias's main demand is for a rewrite of Spain's constitution to scrap the ""regime of 1978"" and get rid of a casta of supposedly self-serving, corrupt politicians. Podemos would solve the Catalan problem by allowing an independence vote. On the economy, Mr Iglesias wants a restructuring of Spain's public debt, government intervention and tax rises (especially for the rich) to pay for better public services. He also wants Spaniards to work fewer hours, as a way of reducing unemployment that is still running at 24%. Economists whom he cites include such well-known names as Joseph Stiglitz, Paul Krugman and Kenneth Rogoff. 
IU and the Socialists are watching Podemos closely. The head of IU, Cayo Lara, announced on November 16th that he would not lead the party into elections next November. Mr Lara is likely to be replaced by a 29-year-old economist, Alberto Garzon, who is another star from the ranks of the indignados. Mr Garzon is even younger than the most visible Podemos leaders, who are mostly in their 30s. Like the pony-tailed Mr Iglesias, he is popular on television talk shows. The two could yet work together. The Socialists have their own newish leader, Pedro Sanchez. They may have to decide whether to ally with Podemos or, if it takes enough of their votes, to join a grand coalition with the PP. 
The PP sees Podemos as a radical party that weakens its main Socialist rival. But the government also frets that it may scare off investors. Mr Rajoy is a dogged devotee of the constitution and a system that has seen the PP and the Socialists take it in turns to rule Spain for 32 years. He accuses Podemos of seeking to destroy progress made since Spain shed dictatorship.

SPAIN is facing a year of bruising, confrontational politics, with several elections that could result in dramatic changes in the way the country is governed. Not least, the constitution, which has underpinned democracy ever since 1978, may not survive in its present form. The prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, and his centre-right Popular Party (PP) may soon find themselves fighting on two fronts at once: trying to save Spain from disintegration if snap elections based around independence are held in Catalonia; and fighting to stop the PP being kicked into third place nationally when other regions and municipalities vote in May. 
Nor do Mr Rajoy's troubles end there. A general election looms in December 2015 which could result in either the Socialists or an upstart leftist party, Podemos, ousting Mr Rajoy and dismantling economic reforms brought in to tackle Spain's debt crisis. The country is now outperforming most of the rest of Europe. But the scars left by austerity and a lengthy recession have not yet healed. Unemployment remains at 24% and GDP is still below its previous peak. 
The timing of a Catalan election depends on the regional president, Artur Mas. He wants a quick vote to serve as a plebiscite on independence, but is also anxious not to hand power to his rival, the Catalan Republican Left (ERC) party. To that end he wants the ERC to stand on the same list as the separatist wing of his own Convergence and Union (CiU) coalition. The ERC prefers to be on a separate list of its own, but has guaranteed Mr Mas the presidency. ""The important thing is the [Catalan] republic, not the presidency,"" says the party's leader, Oriol Junqueras. If agreement does not come soon, the election may not happen. A pre-Christmas poll found the parties neck-and-neck. But backing for independence has dropped from 47.1% in April to 44.5% now. Adding to the uncertainty is the rise of a left-wing party, Podemos, which supports a referendum but is mistrusted by both Catalan and Basque separatists. 
The eruption of Podemos, which calls Spain's right ""the enemy"" but despises the entire political establishment, has set the tone for a newly combative era and changed the game. Podemos, which first appeared in May's European elections, is now intent on becoming the country's biggest party. The newish Socialist leader, Pedro Sanchez, has been pushed leftward, ruling out a ""grand coalition"" with Mr Rajoy and denouncing as mistaken reforms introduced by a former Socialist prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, at the height of the financial crisis in 2011. He would alter the constitution, softening a Zapatero measure that caps future budgets and further federalising Spain in a bid to keep the Catalans happy. 
But Mr Sanchez, appointed in July, has yet to secure the full backing of his party. The Socialists are losing voters to Podemos, whose leaders were once cheerleaders for anti-capitalism, debt-restructuring, ""degrowth"" and even Venezuela's former president, Hugo Chavez. Podemos is distancing itself from some of such nuttier stuff, but the political programme it is drawing up will still be far to the left of the Socialists. The party wants a big constitutional rewrite. It may seek alliances with a future left-wing Syriza government in Greece (it welcomed this week's news of an early Greek election) and with Sinn Fein in Ireland. Podemos clearly has Spain's financial and political elites in its sights. That appeals to many voters, who blame them for the debt crisis and its aftermath. 
Mr Rajoy's hopes of eventual victory rest on his boast to have ended Spain's economic crisis. Spanish voters seem disinclined to show him much gratitude.","A year of electoral turbulence lies ahead 
 SPAIN is facing a year of bruising , confrontational politics , with several elections that could result in dramatic changes in the way the country is governed . Not least , the constitution , which has underpinned democracy ever since 1978 , may not survive in its present form . Mariano Rajoy , and Mariano Rajoy's centre - right Popular Party ( PP ) may soon find themselves fighting on two fronts at once : trying to save Spain from disintegration if snap elections based around independence are held in Catalonia ; and fighting to stop the PP being kicked into third place nationally when other regions and municipalities vote in May. 
 Nor do Mariano Rajoy's troubles end there . A general election looms in December 2015 which could result in either the Socialists or an upstart leftist party , Podemos , ousting Mariano Rajoy and dismantling economic reforms brought in to tackle Spain 's debt crisis . The country is now outperforming most of the rest of Europe . But the scars left by austerity and a lengthy recession have not yet healed . Unemployment remains at 24 % and GDP is still below its previous peak . 
 The timing of a Catalan election depends on the regional president , Artur Mas . He wants a quick vote to serve as a plebiscite on independence , but is also anxious not to hand power to his rival , the Catalan Republican Left ( ERC ) party . To that end he wants the ERC to stand on the same list as the separatist wing of his own Convergence and Union ( CiU ) coalition . The ERC prefers to be on a separate list of its own , but has guaranteed Mr Mas the presidency . "" The important thing is the [ Catalan ] republic , not the presidency , "" says the party 's leader , Oriol Junqueras . If agreement does not come soon , the election may not happen . A pre - Christmas poll found the parties neck - and - neck . But backing for independence has dropped from 47.1 % in April to 44.5 % now . Adding to the uncertainty is the rise of a left - wing party , Podemos , which supports a referendum but is mistrusted by both Catalan and Basque separatists .

CATALAN independence, if it ever happens, has been pushed back at least seven months after the region's president, Artur Mas, decided not to call a snap election but to opt instead for September 27th. The election is still being promoted as a plebiscite on independence, but not in the way Mr Mas once hoped. His original plan for a single list uniting all the separatist parties has been dropped at the insistence of his rivals from the Catalan Republican Left (ERC). In last-minute horse-trading, he accepted that ERC would stand separately from his own Convergence and Union (CiU) coalition, in exchange for its support for this year's budget, which his minority government could not pass alone. 
That has turned the September poll into one as much about winning power as about independence, with ERC well-placed to oust CiU as the most popular party. The timing is both good and bad for the separatists. It comes just two weeks after Catalonia's national day, on September 11th, which campaigners have turned into a mass event in recent years. But they would still have preferred a February vote, before Catalans are distracted by a flurry of polls right across Spain. 
Elections in most other regions and municipalities will be held in May. They will test the staying power of the new upstart left-wing party, Podemos (""We Can""), which leads in several opinion polls, and its local party allies in various one-off groupings. One interesting battle will be in the Catalan capital, Barcelona, where Podemos backs a group called Guanyem (""We Win""). The Barcelona election, with several parties likely to win seats, will be an example of the fractured new politics of Catalonia and Spain: sometimes three parties may be needed for a majority. 
Catalonia's independence movement faces further internal spats. Mr Mas and the ERC leader, Oriol Junqueras, want to agree on a common road-map to independence. Mr Junqueras will push for it to be hard-hitting. But some of Mr Mas's allies within CiU want it weakened. If not, the coalition's junior partner, the Democratic Union of Catalonia, may split from Mr Mas's own Catalan Democratic Convergence. And the slim majority for independence found in some polls may go with it. 
Spain's prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, is hoping that economic recovery, with growth outstripping most of the rest of Europe, will create enough jobs and goodwill to stop the independence bandwagon. His Popular Party (PP) is also readying itself for a bruising confrontation with Podemos in cities and regions like Madrid and Valencia in May. A big Podemos march in Madrid on January 31st will be a demonstration of the new party's muscle. 
The party has its sights firmly set on the general election due in late November, which its leader, Pablo Iglesias, portrays as a battle between Podemos and the PP. Spain's mainstream Socialists, he hopes, will go the way of Greece's ailing Pasok. Mr Iglesias is duly campaigning for the Syriza party in Greece's election. But Podemos also seeks to dilute Catalan separatism by offering an alternative outlet for those frustrated with Mr Rajoy. And unlike Mr Rajoy, who refuses ever to contemplate an independence referendum, Podemos says the issue should be put to a vote.

THEY were hailed as heirs to those who fought Napoleon's troops with knives and stones in Madrid's streets in 1808 or who brought down Spain's monarchy in the 1930s. But the 150,000 people who gathered on January 31st in Madrid's Puerta del Sol for a rally by Podemos (""We Can""), Spain's answer to Greece's Syriza party, were not street-fighters. Most were middle-aged and middle-class. Podemos may ramp up the emotions, but this battle will be fought at the ballot box. 
It was an impressive turnout for a one-year-old party, although Podemos's claim to a ""social majority"" remains unconvincing. A recent poll put it on just 24%. Yet that is more than the main opposition Socialist party, PSOE; and it sets up a three-cornered race against Mariano Rajoy's Popular Party (PP) in a general election that is expected in November. 
Podemos's leader, Pablo Iglesias, talks of a country on its knees, humiliated by Germany and looted by corrupt politicians and neoliberal capitalists. Statistics give a rosier picture. Some 400,000 jobs were created in the year to January. Salaries are rising in real terms. Ana Botin, head of Santander bank, predicts that GDP growth will be above 2.5%, making Spain a euro-zone star. Yet too many Spaniards see none of this. Unemployment is running at 24%, and four-fifths of new jobs are on short-term contracts. The economy and jobs come top of the public's list of worries, along with corruption. 
Mr Rajoy's advisers called Podemos ""freaks"" just nine months ago. But the PP takes it seriously now. At a recent convention, PP speakers railed against being dubbed casta: the Podemos term for corrupt politicians, bankers, businesspeople and even trade unionists. Yet a former PP treasurer, Luis Barcenas, who had just been released on bail, claimed that Mr Rajoy knew all about dodgy party accounting. 
At one level, the rise of Podemos helps Mr Rajoy by bleeding the PSOE. But disgruntled PP voters are also fleeing, often to other smaller parties. Podemos remains light on policy. The Andalucia election on March 22nd, which requires a manifesto, may change that. Internal debate on the economy revolves not just around shorter working weeks and a Syriza-style restructuring of public debt, but also possible haircuts on private debt. 
The decision by Andalucia's PSOE president, Susana Diaz, to advance the regional election was a response to Podemos. Squeezed on all sides, the party risks being pushed down like Greece's Pasok. Andalucia, its heartland, is also home to many corruption scandals. If the PSOE cannot stem the tide there, it will fail across Spain when other regions and localities vote in May. Podemos faces a struggle in Andalucia, only its second-ever electoral outing after it took 8% of the vote in the European election last May. Yet even if Ms Diaz wins, she is not likely to get an absolute majority. Neither Podemos nor PP look like stable future partners. A similar instability threatens not just Andalucia, but Spain.

GREAT political debates in Spain can generate a powerful sense of occasion as legislators flock to a parliament building which is guarded by two large bronze lions as well as lots of police. 
But when deputies gathered for a solemn state-of-the-nation deliberation on February 24th, two of the four most important parties were missing. Chief among them was Podemos (We Can), the upstart left-wing group that leads some polls and has drawn comparisons, albeit imperfect ones, with the Syriza movement that has upended Greek politics. 
In recent weeks, however, a new player has arrived. Ciudadanos (Citizens), a centrist party, is scoring up to 13% in polling and it looks well placed to hurt the Popular Party (PP) led by Mariano Rajoy, the prime minister, and also to put a lid on the meteoric growth of Podemos. 
With parliament closed to newcomers until a general election late this year, these insurgent parties have found a home just around the corner at the Circulo de Bellas Artes, a cultural centre. That is where Pablo Iglesias, the Podemos leader, delivered his alternative state-of-the-nation address on February 25th, blaming PP for corruption, inequality and austerity. 
Like Alexis Tsipras, the new Greek prime minister, the pony-tailed Mr Iglesias is a crowd-puller. However he now has a rival in the Ciudadanos leader, Albert Rivera, who managed to fill two large rooms and left fans queuing outside when he came to Madrid from his native Barcelona on February 17th. 
Aged 35, Mr Rivera is slightly younger than Mr Iglesias and equally capable of presenting himself as a breath of fresh air in a stale scene. On arrival in the capital, he presented supporters with a new recruit whose academic credentials will impress some voters: Luis Garicano, a professor of ""economics and strategy"" at the London School of Economics. 
Mr Garicano took a swipe at Podemos's ""lack of sense"" before outlining a programme of pragmatic, workable economic ideas. They included labour reform to restrict the abuse of short-term contracts (massively favoured by employers as a way of avoiding the potential firing costs that permanent staff bring). Instead he would introduce a single contract in which those costs rise slowly and progressively over time. Temporary contracts currently account for 24% of jobs. He also wants American- or British-style tax credits to help the large number of Spanish workers who fail to earn the annual minimum salary of EUR 9,080 ($10,300). 
Another bright, but harder to implement, idea would encourage mobility by letting Spanish workers take incremental unemployment insurance with them from job to job. Some of these proposals may provide fast-working fixes to entrenched problems. Possibly the most vital reform was, however, one that would take many years to have an impact: modernising Spain's education system to teach skills beyond the ability to memorise swathes of facts, which the present system emphasises far too much. 
Mr Rivera set up Ciudadanos nine years ago to counter nationalism in his native Catalonia, where it won 8% of the vote in 2012 regional elections. Big expectations were triggered very quickly when he decided to go nationwide. That, along with the sudden burgeoning of Podemos, is a sign of how desperate Spanish voters are for something new.

WITH her folksy manner and humble origins, Susana Diaz does not at first sight seem a likely saviour of old-style Spanish politics. But this 40-year-old local heroine salvaged the fortunes of the battered Spanish Socialist Party (PSOE) by retaining her position as political leader of Andalusia in a regional election on March 22nd. She is now in the vanguard of a fightback by established parties as they resist newcomers bent on cleaning up politics. 
Although her age and sex mark her out (Spain has never had a female prime minister), Ms Diaz is very much an old-school politician. She worked her way discreetly through the party ranks, heading the regional youth group and becoming a city councillor in Seville at 24. Long experience at the political coalface made her a plausible successor when the previous Andalusian president resigned in 2013. 
Good at banging heads together, she made her name as an efficient (and feared) backroom apparatchik. Such skills are badly needed by her party. It says something about the state of Spanish socialism that her recent, moderately successful performance has won her accolades as a miracle-worker in an otherwise dismal situation. She held on to 47 deputies in the 109-seat regional parliament, while the Socialist vote dropped by four percentage points to 35%. That is a smaller decline than expected, though it is still the party's weakest showing in the 33 years that it has dominated Andalusia. Her personal rating is now so high that she sometimes overshadows Pedro Sanchez, the party's leader. 
He, and the party as a whole, have their hands full. Spanish socialism is fighting to avoid the fate of the PanHellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK), which dominated Greek politics for most of the years since 1981 but in January was almost wiped out by the more radical Syriza. 
In Spain, the Socialists face two adversaries. One is Podemos, an upstart Syriza-style party that has built up nationwide support of above 20% since appearing in the European elections ten months ago. The new party calls the Socialists part of la casta, a generic term for self-serving, corrupt political and financial elites. 
The other enemy is Ciudadanos (Citizens), a centrist party that has broken out of its Catalan home into the rest of Spain by pledging social democratic measures to reduce inequality, while also cleaning up corruption. Podemos and Ciudadanos took 15% and 9% respectively in the Andalusian poll, their debut in the region. 
If Ms Diaz is to lead a minority regional government, as seems probable, she must lean on one or other of these parties; both want firmer action against sleaze. But she is negotiating from relative strength, because her winning style limited the newcomers' surge. She said her only casta was the plumbing trade, her father's job. Her mix of empathy and firmness averted the rout that some feared, even though one in three Andalusians lacks a job and her two predecessors are due to testify to a magistrate who is probing corruption. 
Cronyism and rule-bending clearly alienate some voters, but they are also features of a political way of life that has served, and may still serve, to maintain the Socialists' domination of Spain's poor south. The enduring bad habits of the old system were confirmed on March 24th, when police in Andalusia detained 16 senior regional employment and training officials. A tape recording appeared to show one public servant telling underlings to campaign for the Socialists in the 2012 elections. Such things shock some voters, but probably not all of them. 
In any case, with a general election due by December, the PSOE still has reason to tremble. It has lost a third of its Andalusian voters since 2008 and can expect to do worse nationwide. In 2011, its score in the rest of Spain was eight percentage points below its performance in Andalusia. 
As for the Popular Party (PP) of Mariano Rajoy, the prime minister, it faces an even tougher future. Its share of the vote in Andalusia fell from 41% to 27%; this suggests that voters are ignoring signs of economic recovery, and that Ciudadanos may steal centrist or centre-right votes nationwide. 
Elections in 13 of the 17 Spanish regions on May 24th will be the next test of the new four-way split, forcing parties to strike pacts if they want to govern, according to Jose Pablo Ferrandiz of Metroscopia, a pollster. Podemos may come first in such regions as Asturias and Aragon, with the PP or PSOE winning elsewhere. The general election later this year is too close to call, with Podemos, PP and PSOE running level. 
Ms Diaz's comparative success vindicated her decision to call a snap regional election. Yet the two-party system that has prevailed in Spain since 1982 is clearly bust, and Andalusia has set a pattern by forcing an old party to seek help from newcomers. Spanish voters want change, though not, apparently, a complete revolution.","A feisty power - broker shows why a traditional style endures

A tape recording appeared to show one public servant telling underlings to campaign for the Socialists in the 2012 elections . Such things shock some voters , but probably not all of them . 
 In any case , with a general election due by December , the PSOE still has reason to tremble . It has lost a third of its Andalusian voters since 2008 and can expect to do worse nationwide . In 2011 , its score in the rest of Spain was eight percentage points below its performance in Andalusia . 
 As for Mariano Rajoy , Mariano Rajoy faces an even tougher future . Mariano Rajoy's share of the vote in Andalusia fell from 41 % to 27 % ; this suggests that voters are ignoring signs of economic recovery , and that Ciudadanos may steal centrist or centre - right votes nationwide . 
 Elections in 13 of the 17 Spanish regions on May 24th will be the next test of the new four - way split , forcing parties to strike pacts if they want to govern , according to Jose Pablo Ferrandiz of Metroscopia , a pollster . Podemos may come first in such regions as Asturias and Aragon , with the PP or PSOE winning elsewhere . The general election later this year is too close to call , with Podemos , PP and PSOE running level . 
 Ms Diaz 's comparative success vindicated her decision to call a snap regional election . Yet the two - party system that has prevailed in Spain since 1982 is clearly bust , and Andalusia has set a pattern by forcing an old party to seek help from newcomers . Spanish voters want change , though not , apparently , a complete revolution .",230,Spain,A30-57,IN TERM,True,"the Popular Party ( PP ) of Mariano Rajoy , the prime minister",3,True

SPANIARDS are used to former public officials getting rich from doing business with the state. When news emerged of investigations into a former official in Castile and Leon who had secured lucrative wind-farm licences from his ex-colleagues and a former official in Andalusia whose companies netted regional contracts for state-subsidised worker-training courses, few were surprised. Corruption and cronyism (the distribution of political favours to businesses) explain much of the Spanish public's growing disdain for the two parties that have run the country for the past 32 years: the ruling Popular Party (PP) and the opposition Socialists (PSOE). 
Distrust reached a nadir with the temporary arrest two weeks ago of Rodrigo Rato, a former PP finance minister who went on to run the IMF in Washington. Police searched Mr Rato's office and home in an investigation into unexplained income. He was already under scrutiny over freewheeling use of company credit cards during his chairmanship of Bankia, a bank that needed a EUR 22 billion ($27 billion) rescue under his stewardship. Mr Rato was seen as one of the architects of Spain's economic miracle in the early 2000s. That miracle now seems a distant memory. Unemployment is running at 23%, and the IMF says it will take nine years, until 2017, to return the economy to its pre-crisis size. 
Researchers are beginning to see links between Spain's excessively cronyistic and corrupt public administration, and the defects that have made it so hard for the economy to recover. The problems may have started well before the crash. From 1995 to 2007, while the Spanish economy was growing at 3.5% per year, productivity declined by 0.7% per year--even as overall EU productivity was growing at an average of 0.4% per year. 
Blame has traditionally been pinned on a housing bubble that fostered distorted growth in the construction industry. But a recent paper by a team headed by Manuel Garcia-Santana of the Universite Libre de Bruxelles finds that the productivity fall was spread more evenly across all sectors. It had little to do with skills, innovation or debt. ""We found that bad [less productive] companies grew faster than the good ones,"" says one of the co-authors, Enrique Moral-Benito. Productivity falls were greater when the government was heavily involved, through contracts, licences or regulations. Luis Garicano, the economics adviser of the liberal Ciudadanos party, says this points to an economy dependent on contacts, corruption and cronyism. 
Other explanations are possible as well. Banks may have been happier lending to companies with public contracts, and some more productive businesses may have limited their growth to avoid losing fiscal, labour or social-security advantages enjoyed by smaller firms. Either way, those who successfully negotiated their way around the public administration--whether through luck, knowledge, cronies or backhanders--did best. 
Popular anger over cronyism helps to explain why the PP government and its prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, seem likely to take a hammering in elections to regional governments and municipalities on May 24th. Over the past year 500,000 jobs have been created and growth is forecast at 2.9% this year, yet the PP has shed half its support. The Socialists are also low in the polls, while Ciudadanos and the left-wing Podemos party have risen. The elections are now a four-way race. A poor result on May 24th could even force Mr Rajoy to bring forward a general election due at the end of the year. 
The government is hunting for every bit of positive news. It trumpeted the latest economic-sentiment figures from the European Commission, which put Spain ahead of the other big euro-zone economies. But if voters are less concerned about the latest figures than about the underlying rot of decades of kickbacks and insider dealing, that may not count for much.

SIXTEENTH-CENTURY castles and contemporary Socialists make an odd mix.

But four years ago, when Spain's young indignados erupted in anger against the elites, she invited the protestersto assemble in the castle's courtyard. 
Ms Garcia is no bandwagon-jumper. On taking office in 2009 she made a point of personally meeting all 4,000 people on Alaquas's unemployment rolls. But politicians all over Spain have lately found themselves groping for a touch like hers, for the three-decade duopoly of the Socialists and the ruling centre-right People's Party (PP) appears to be expiring fast. 
The first rival to emerge was Podemos, a leftist populist party that fuses the theories of Marxists with the energy of the indignados. It was followed by Ciudadanos, a party formed in 2006 to oppose the independence movement in Catalonia that has suddenly found a national audience for its message of liberal reform. As voters in most of Spain's regions and municipalities prepare for elections on May 24th, polls show all four parties on around 20%. Four years ago about 75% plumped for the PP or the Socialists. 
Political insurgencies are hardly news in Europe. But the Spanish case is doubly unusual. First, unlike many other countries, Spain is not meant to have fragmented politics. The voting system put in place after the restoration of democracy in the late 1970s was designed to deliver strong majorities and a two-party system. It is now showing its age. The second oddity is the nature of the shock. The rise of Podemos is easy enough to understand in a country scarred by unemployment, spending cuts and corruption scandals. But Ciudadanos is an altogether odder phenomenon: liberal ideas have not flourished in the aftermath of the financial crisis, particularly in southern Europe. The party's policy ideas, drawn up with the help of Luis Garicano, an economist, include a slimmer public administration and a single labour contract--not the sorts of things to get protesters' pulses racing. 
The experience of Valencia provides a clue. The regional government has been run by the PP for 20 years; the city for 24. Many politicians were guilty of excess during Spain's pre-crisis years, when construction bubbles were inflated by the easy money that flowed into the country. But Valencia's may have been the worst. The region is littered with their follies, from a vast arts and science complex to the remains of a Formula 1 track ripped up after four years. Now Valencia has become a byword for waste and corruption. Some 150 PP officials face criminal trials, and the party's support is haemorrhaging. Ciudadanos's local candidate, Carolina Punset, rails against the clientelism and instruments of patronage she says allowed bad behaviour to flourish. 
The fracturing of politics across the country may leave Podemos and Ciudadanos holding the balance of power in many regions and town halls. That will give them a dilemma. Do the parties taint themselves by propping up incumbents, or remain pure but risk looking irresponsible? Ciudadanos's answer is to set the bar high: it will not enter coalitions in regions where it does not win, and will set strict conditions even before talking to other parties. But this may be a recipe for uncertainty. Exhibit A is Andalusia, Spain's most populous region, which after two months of post-election wrangling has failed to form a government. 
Inevitably, there have been growing pains. Last month a Podemos co-founder quit the party in protest over its scramble to the political centre to arrest a decline in the opinion polls. Last week a Ciudadanos candidate in Catalonia did the same after declaring herself shocked to find, on reading its programme, how right-wing it was. But such teething troubles should not diminish the newcomers' impact. Podemos's dismissal of the old guard as la casta (""the caste"") resonates beyond a leftist fringe; the idea is present in Ciudadanos's appeals to jaded voters, even if the phrase is not. Feeling the heat, Mariano Rajoy, the PP prime minister, finally apologised in October for all the scandals washing over his party. 
Looming over everything is a general election that is expected by January. Heartened by Spain's recent economic performance--jobs are being created at a rapid clip, thanks in part to a 2012 labour-market reform, and the government forecasts growth of 2.9% this year--the government hopes to do better than the polls suggest. But having underestimated Spaniards' anger with corruption, it risks overestimating their sense of economic security. A cocky Mr Rajoy recently posed a rhetorical question: ""Who, these days, is still talking about the bail-out, the recession or unemployment?"" The 5.2m Spaniards who represent one-fifth of Europe's jobless army may be one answer. 
Yes Spain can 
Spain's older parties have only themselves to blame for their woes. Mr Rajoy's government has not reformed enough, and it bungled the corruption issue. The Socialists have neither acknowledged their own failures in government between 2004 and 2011, nor found a way to channel the righteous anger of the indignados. Neither party seems to have the will to tackle the inefficiencies and injustices that mar Spain's public sector, from over-numerous municipalities to politicised bureaucracies. 
By contrast the newcomers have already revitalised Spanish democracy: Podemos, by giving voice to large parts of a generation alienated by stale politics and a broken economy; and Ciudadanos, by showing that radicalism can come from the centre and avoid the stain of corruption. Either party, or both, may fade; but each has left its mark. ""We are entering a new era in which new political manners will be required,"" says Jose Juan Toharia, president of Metroscopia, a pollster. Not before time.

THE regional and municipal elections in Spain on May 24th were billed as the latest test of the idealistic new parties that have emerged all across southern Europe in the wake of the euro crisis. Like Greece's Syriza and Italy's Five Star Movement, the left-wing Podemos and liberal Ciudadanos parties promised to give a voice to voters infuriated by corruption and economic hardship, and to shatter the political status quo. They have done so, transforming the two-party system that has dominated Spain since democracy was reintroduced in 1978 into a four-party one. They have also made the country a lot harder to govern. 
The conservative Popular Party (PP) of Mariano Rajoy, the prime minister, was able to claim a sort of victory: when all the regional and municipal elections were tallied, it finished first. But its share fell to just over a quarter of the votes. The opposition Socialists (PSOE) of Pedro Sanchez claimed to have launched a comeback, but they were beaten by the PP almost everywhere. Podemos was relegated to third place. Ciudadanos fell short of predictions that it would become Spain's new kingmaker. 
The two main parties' decline (see chart) would have been even steeper had Podemos run candidates under its own brand. Instead it backed a mosaic of ad hoc ""popular unity"" groups. There are now few jurisdictions left in which a single party will be able to govern alone. Most of the 13 regional parliaments chosen this week, and the country's main town halls, will need two, three or even more parties to form governments. This will require Spain to learn a new culture of coalition politics. 
The greatest changes came in Spain's two biggest cities, which both look set to be governed by broad, Podemos-backed coalitions. Ada Colau, a former housing-rights activist, will probably become mayor of Barcelona. In Madrid, Manuela Carmena, a 71-year-old former judge, appears to have ousted the PP. Madrid and Barcelona will become the experimental laboratories for a new form of radical left-wing politics, featuring direct internet-based democracy and so-called ""citizens' bail-outs"" of those who have suffered from Spain's economic woes. 
The upshot of the elections is that Spain is turning to the left. In most of the regions, only coalitions led by the PSOE are plausible. The PP has lost control of most of the big-spending regions it governs, putting the government's deficit targets at risk. Yet because the insurgent parties are so fragmented, it is not clear what their gains will mean for government policy. And it is hard for Podemos to claim a national mandate when so many voters picked Ciudadanos, in many ways their ideological opposites. 
The next contest will come in Catalonia, which will vote for its regional parliament in September in a battle coloured by demands for independence. Meanwhile, months of coalition bargaining await in the regions. The upstart parties may be reluctant to make compromises as they look towards the general election that must be held by January. The obvious alliances are between PP and Ciudadanos or between PSOE and Podemos. But voters who chose the upstart parties in protest against the old dinosaurs will not welcome such pacts; in Andalusia, where the Socialists and left-wing parties won an election in March, coalition talks are still dragging on. For anyone looking to Spain's elections for a message about the future of European politics, it seems to be that it will involve even more deal-making than it used to.","Voters angered by corruption split a two - party system into a four - party one

STROLLING around the European Parliament in Brussels recently Charlemagne asked his companion, an MEP's assistant, if the success of anti-European parties in last May's elections had changed the feel of the place. ""Well, for one thing you see posters like that,"" she said, pointing up at an image of Marine Le Pen gazing grandly from a prominent office window. Ms Le Pen's far-right National Front (FN) won the European elections in France, as did the United Kingdom Independence Party in Britain. Other Eurosceptic parties did well elsewhere. The results should not have been a shock. Dissatisfaction with the European Union dates back at least to 1992, when French voters registered their petit oui of 51% in a referendum on the Maastricht treaty. Across the EU, public support for the union has fallen from 65% to 50% since. 
But the second phase of discontent came in the form of new (or revived) populist parties. Outfits opposed to immigration or euro-zone bail-outs began to flourish in northern Europe around five years ago. (One of them, Timo Soini's Finns party, entered government in Finland this week.) More recently anti-austerity parties have emerged in the south--including the leftist Syriza, which has led the Greek government for four troubled months. 
Many still hope the populist threat will fade. Mariano Rajoy, Spain's prime minister, thinks he can ride to re-election later this year on the back of an economic recovery, despite the pounding that his Popular Party (PP) took at regional and local elections this week. Mr Rajoy's optimism, which not everybody in his party shares, is partly inspired by the success of the Conservatives in seeing off UKIP at the British general election. Indeed, UKIP's single-seat flop, as well as Ms Le Pen's recent quarrel with her father, the FN's founder, have led some to suggest that Europe's populist moment has passed. That seems hasty. UKIP's showing said more about Britain's electoral system than about its own failings, and the FN feud could yet help Ms Le Pen by distancing her from her father's toxic and outdated politics. 
Fractious, amateurish and often over-reliant on a charismatic leader, some populist parties may melt away once they try their hand at governance. (It will be fascinating to watch Mr Soini grapple with the compromises of coalition.) But others have shown staying power. Geert Wilders's Party for Freedom is now part of the political furniture in the Netherlands, after a spell propping up a minority cabinet between 2010 and 2012. 
Overall, the populists may represent even more of a danger to the centre-left than to the centre-right. That is because right-wing populists such as UKIP and the FN fish in the pond of working-class voters, whereas centre-right parties feel little threat from radical leftists. (The Spanish Socialists fear the fate of Pasok, the centre-left Greek party that has been decimated by Syriza's rise.) But populists make life harder for everyone. The idea of ""natural"" parties of government, like Ireland's Fianna Fail or the Dutch Christian Democrats, looks a bit quaint. 
There is little consensus over how to deal with the challenge. Indeed, Europe's populist successes often function as a kind of Rorschach test for observers. For anti-austerians they are what you get when you squeeze economies beyond the breaking point. For social conservatives they are the fruit of untrammelled immigration. For liberal reformers they are the inevitable result of sclerotic economies that fail to grow or create jobs. And so on. 
There is an element of truth in all these claims. But not all parties that attract the term ""populist"" are alike, or even similar. The radical leftists of Podemos in Spain profess an inclusive pro-Europeanism worlds apart from the nostalgic insularity of the Finns. 
Moreover, says Mujtaba Rahman at the Eurasia Group, a consultancy, the populists' strongest impact will often be indirect. Last year UKIP seemed to be driving Britain's EU policy despite lacking any seats in parliament. France's ambivalence over the EU's plan to resettle refugees across Europe is in part driven by fear of Ms Le Pen. One worrying outcome of the populists' rise, predicts Catherine Fieschi at Counterpoint, a research group, will be the growth of ""Coliseum politics"", where voters are asked to give the thumbs-up (or down) to apparently straightforward propositions, often in referendums. 
All the questions, none of the answers 
Yet populists can also help keep the established parties honest. Voters troubled by immigration, bail-outs or austerity need channels for their concerns, and mainstream parties have often failed to provide them. That is what makes Mr Rajoy's response so dreary. Podemos may be led by Gramsci-wielding ideologues, but many of the youngsters who make up much of its base are motivated by a more homely concern: that they will never enjoy the living standards of their parents. Que pasa? Au n no tenemos casa! (""What's up? We still don't have a house!"") runs a favoured chant. 
A more thoughtful response comes from Frans Timmermans, a former Dutch minister now safely insulated from voters as the first vice-president of the European Commission. The problem with Eurosceptics, Mr Timmermans says, is not that their assessment of Europe's deficiencies is wrong, but that it is often right. For many, particularly the jobless young, the EU has come to represent little more than managed decline. The politicians who have overseen its growth have little to say to those that resent it. 
That is partly because they must show fealty to European law and economic reality. But that limits their options. Italy's prime minister, Matteo Renzi, inadvertently put his finger on the challenge this week. Interviewed after an electoral surprise in Poland, he said: ""The wind in Greece, the wind in Spain, the wind in Poland...blows in opposite directions, but all these winds say that Europe must change."" Wonderful advice, if anyone can work out how to follow it.","Some parties may fade , but Europe 's populists are here to stay 
 STROLLING around the European Parliament in Brussels recently Charlemagne asked his companion , an MEP 's assistant , if the success of anti - European parties in last May 's elections had changed the feel of the place . "" Well , for one thing you see posters like that , "" she said , pointing up at an image of Marine Le Pen gazing grandly from a prominent office window . Ms Le Pen 's far - right National Front ( FN ) won the European elections in France , as did the United Kingdom Independence Party in Britain . Other Eurosceptic parties did well elsewhere . The results should not have been a shock . Dissatisfaction with the European Union dates back at least to 1992 , when French voters registered their petit oui of 51 % in a referendum on the Maastricht treaty . Across the EU , public support for the union has fallen from 65 % to 50 % since . 
 But the second phase of discontent came in the form of new ( or revived ) populist parties . Outfits opposed to immigration or euro - zone bail - outs began to flourish in northern Europe around five years ago . ( One of them , Timo Soini 's Finns party , entered government in Finland this week . ) More recently anti - austerity parties have emerged in the south -- including the leftist Syriza , which has led the Greek government for four troubled months . 
 Many still hope the populist threat will fade . Mariano Rajoy's thinks Mariano Rajoy can ride to re - election later this year on the back of an economic recovery , despite the pounding that Mariano Rajoy's Popular Party ( PP ) took at regional and local elections this week . Mariano Rajoy's optimism , which not everybody in Mariano Rajoy's party shares , is partly inspired by the success of the Conservatives in seeing off UKIP at the British general election . Indeed , UKIP 's single - seat flop , as well as Ms Le Pen 's recent quarrel with her father , the FN 's founder , have led some to suggest that Europe 's populist moment has passed . That seems hasty . UKIP 's showing said more about Britain 's electoral system than about its own failings , and the FN feud could yet help Ms Le Pen by distancing her from her father 's toxic and outdated politics . 
 Fractious , amateurish and often over - reliant on a charismatic leader , some populist parties may melt away once they try their hand at governance . ( It will be fascinating to watch Mr Soini grapple with the compromises of coalition . ) But others have shown staying power . Geert Wilders 's Party for Freedom is now part of the political furniture in the Netherlands , after a spell propping up a minority cabinet between 2010 and 2012 . 
 Overall , the populists may represent even more of a danger to the centre - left than to the centre - right . That is because right - wing populists such as UKIP and the FN fish in the pond of working - class voters , whereas centre - right parties feel little threat from radical leftists . ( The Spanish Socialists fear the fate of Pasok , the centre - left Greek party that has been decimated by Syriza 's rise . ) But populists make life harder for everyone . The idea of "" natural "" parties of government , like Ireland 's Fianna Fail or the Dutch Christian Democrats , looks a bit quaint . 
 There is little consensus over how to deal with the challenge . Indeed , Europe 's populist successes often function as a kind of Rorschach test for observers . For anti - austerians they are what you get when you squeeze economies beyond the breaking point . For social conservatives they are the fruit of untrammelled immigration . For liberal reformers they are the inevitable result of sclerotic economies that fail to grow or create jobs . And so on . 
 There is an element of truth in all these claims . But not all parties that attract the term "" populist "" are alike , or even similar . The radical leftists of Podemos in Spain profess an inclusive pro - Europeanism worlds apart from the nostalgic insularity of the Finns . 
 Moreover , says Mujtaba Rahman at the Eurasia Group , a consultancy , the populists ' strongest impact will often be indirect . Last year UKIP seemed to be driving Britain 's EU policy despite lacking any seats in parliament . France 's ambivalence over the EU 's plan to resettle refugees across Europe is in part driven by fear of Ms Le Pen . One worrying outcome of the populists ' rise , predicts Catherine Fieschi at Counterpoint , a research group , will be the growth of "" Coliseum politics "" , where voters are asked to give the thumbs - up ( or down ) to apparently straightforward propositions , often in referendums .

AIDA DEL VALLE lives in a block of new flats owned by Spain's ""bad"" bank, Sareb, with big windows overlooking a small Barcelona square. The 34-year-old former schoolteacher, who receives unemployment benefits of EUR 300 ($331) a month, pays no rent or utility bills. She owes her tenancy to a housing-activism group that broke into the unfinished building and took it over. One of the group's founders is Ada Colau, who on June 13th became Barcelona's mayor. 
Ms Colau is one of a number of candidates who have infused the Spanish left with fresh vigour. Her rainbow coalition of activists and parties, including the insurgent party Podemos, narrowly beat the incumbent Catalan nationalist Convergence and Union coalition (CiU). Podemos-backed candidates also took control of Madrid and other major cities. Ms Colau's first moves included slashing her salary by three-quarters to EUR 2,200 per month and dropping prosecution of student activists accused of vandalism. Her counterpart in Madrid, the 71-year-old Manuela Carmena, met the heads of Spain's mighty Santander and BBVA banks to discuss the thousands of homes they have seized since Spain's property bubble burst. The left's victories mean Spanish cities may start fining banks for holding on to empty houses. 
City halls will provide a first taste of how Podemos, which is just 18 months old, handles power. It may get a lot more of it in parliamentary elections this autumn. Current polls show the governing conservative Popular Party losing power to the Socialist Party. The Socialists would then have to form a minority government heavily dependent on Podemos. 
But while Spanish politics is shifting to the left, it is also fracturing. Barcelona's city hall now has seven groups on the 41-member council. On June 18th Catalan politics splintered further when the 37-year-old CiU coalition, made up of the Convergence and Union parties, fell apart over separatism. The Convergence leader, Artur Mas, who is also president of the region, wants to lead a separatist platform into the local elections on September 27th. The Union party calls for moderation and a negotiated settlement with Madrid. 
Many in Convergence are happy to be rid of Union. But they must now scrap for separatist votes with the Catalan Republican Left and the radically left-wing Popular Unity Candidates. The divorce is a major upheaval for Catalan politics, which had been dominated by CiU ever since the region regained a degree of self-government in 1980. Political institutions must be restructured. The CiU's deputies in the Madrid parliament, who have occasionally held the balance of power, have split too. 
Catalans are now divided into separatists, anti-separatists, and third-way federalists who believe the region should nonetheless be allowed to vote on independence (an option blocked so far by Mariano Rajoy, the prime minister). All three camps have at least two parties competing for their votes. But the eruption of Podemos has seen public interest shift from secession towards social matters like poverty and housing. ""Mas's government has used independence to cover up its cuts in health and education,"" says Carlos Macias, a housing activist in Barcelona. Podemos-style radicalism is an alternative to separatism for those with a Utopian bent. 
As if things were not complicated enough, the rise of the centrist Ciudadanos party has made Spain's general election a four-way race. The fracturing of politics is forcing politicians to learn how to build alliances. The task of forming governments has become harder. But solutions to some problems--including Catalan separatism--may become easier to find.

AMID the drama of the past few months over a possible Grexit, it has been easy to overlook that other parts of southern Europe have been recovering--just as Greece itself would have done if politics had not got in the way. The revival of Spain's economy is especially important because it is the fourth-biggest in the euro area and the one whose troubles seemed most likely to prompt a break-up of the single-currency club only three years ago. For some, the Spanish rebound is proof that structural reforms pay off. Yet so deep was the downturn that Spain is still far from regaining all the ground it lost. Moreover, it is not clear how much the recovery has to do with Spain's vaunted policy shifts. 
The Spanish economy has been growing for two years, following the extended double-dip recession in 2008-13 (see chart). The recovery was initially lacklustre but it picked up in the spring of 2014 and has sparkled particularly this year, with growth of 0.9% in the first quarter (an annualised rate of 3.8%) and 1% in the second quarter. Unemployment remains troublingly high, at 22.5% in June, but has fallen sharply from its peak of 26.3% in early 2013. 
The Spanish economy has been benefiting from a general cyclical upturn in the euro area. The sharp fall in energy prices caused by the collapse of the oil price has been acting like a tax cut; the European Central Bank's adoption of quantitative easing has been a further fillip. Yet Spain has been doing considerably better than the single-currency bloc as a whole, which grew in the first quarter of 2015 by a more sedate 0.4%. Indeed Spain's recent growth rate is among the highest in the euro area. 
For the government, led by Mariano Rajoy, the recovery is a vindication of the reforms it has pursued since taking office in late 2011. Much is made of a shake-up in 2012 of Spain's labour market, which tackled two dysfunctional features. One was the divide between cosseted permanent workers and temporary employees who took the brunt of lay-offs during the downturn. The other was collective pay-setting arrangements within industries between employers and trade unions that were imposed upon individual firms. The reforms sought to make it less expensive for employers to dismiss permanent workers by reducing severance payments. Companies were also allowed to opt out of the sectoral agreements and to strike their own bargains with workers. 
Other reforms have sought to encourage enterprise. In particular the government has made it easier to start a business, reducing the number of procedures involved from ten to six between 2013 and 2014. It is also striving to unify regulations across Spain's regions. Corporate-income tax has been lowered this year from 30% to 28%, and will fall to 25% in 2016. Encouragingly, Spain has moved up the World Bank's ""ease of doing business"" rankings, from 52nd two years ago to 33rd in 2014 (out of nearly 190 economies). 
The verdict on the reforms and their impact is mixed, however. Rafael Domenech, an economist at BBVA, Spain's second-biggest bank, argues that they help to explain why Spain has been doing better than other countries on the periphery such as Italy. He estimates that if the labour-market reforms had been in place during the crisis, unemployment would have peaked at 20% rather than 26%, sparing a third of the rise in the jobless rate. 
But Juan Jose Toribio of the IESE business school in Madrid counters that the source of the recovery has not been structural reforms but rather the adjustments forced upon businesses and workers in coping with the severe recession, in particular through lower wages. He also attaches importance to the clean-up of the banks, which was facilitated by a European bail-out of Spain's struggling financial sector in the middle of 2012. 
It is in any case important to put the Spanish recovery in perspective. It follows a decline of 8% in GDP between its peak in the spring of 2008 and its trough five years later. The economy may now be growing fast, but it is still 4% smaller than seven years ago, a bigger shortfall than that of the euro area as a whole, whose GDP is about 1% below its peak. Despite the decline in unemployment, the jobless rate in Spain is still the second-highest in Europe, exceeded only by Greece's. 
Moreover, the recovery has become over-reliant on domestic demand, especially consumer spending. Although Spanish exporters did well during the second dip of the recession in 2011-13, mitigating the severity of the downturn, net trade has faded as a source of growth despite a strong performance in tourism. Spain's poor public finances are another concern. The budget deficit was a swollen 5.8% of GDP in 2014 and is forecast by the European Commission to be 4.5% this year. Private and public debt are worryingly high in relation to GDP. 
The biggest concern is that the recovery has done little to heal the wounds opened up in the years of crisis. Santiago Fernandez Valbuena of Telefonica, one of Spain's largest companies with a big presence in Latin America, worries about the uneven pattern of the recovery, in which mainly younger temporary workers have had a far tougher time than permanent staff, despite those labour-market reforms. Greece's fledgling recovery in 2014 did not prevent the election of Syriza, which gave voice to the losers in the preceding depression. Spain's recovery has lasted longer and its recession was not as severe as Greece's (where the peak-to-trough fall in output was a huge 27%), but with an election due to be held later this year, it too remains vulnerable to political upheaval.","Growth has returned , but dangers still lurk

BENIGNO ROMERO, a Catalan taxi driver, reached coyly into his pocket and produced a key-ring bearing the horizontal gold-and-red striped flag of Spain. ""I respect everyone else's opinion. But if we get independence our pensions will go and this will be like Venezuela,"" he said. Mr Romero's worries reflect an increasingly bitter debate in this wealthy corner of north-east Spain as it prepares for elections that could bring a unilateral declaration of independence within 18 months. 
Catalonia's president, Artur Mas, has proclaimed regional elections on September 27th to be a plebiscite on independence. His centre-right Catalan Democratic Convergence party has teamed up with Catalan Republican Left and grass-roots separatists to present a joint list of candidates. If these, together with radicals from the Popular Unity Candidacy, win a majority of seats, they threaten to declare independence in spring 2017, setting up a dramatic confrontation for which neither Spain nor the European Union is prepared. While negotiations might prevent that happening, separatists seem unlikely to settle for anything less than a proper referendum--which the government in Madrid, led by prime minister Mariano Rajoy's Popular Party, has so far refused. 
Polls show that a narrow majority of Catalans prefer to remain Spanish. But they also suggest highly-motivated separatists are more likely to vote and may give Mr Mas the thin parliamentary majority he considers sufficient to embark on this defiant course. That is why Mr Romero is worried about his pension. On September 21st the governor of the Bank of Spain, Luis Maria Linde, said he saw little chance of Catalonia breaking away. But he gave a warning that without the backing of the European Central Bank, capital controls on Catalan bank deposits (akin to the limits imposed on Greece this summer) could follow. Mr Mas responded by warning that Spain too would suffer if there was no deal, as Catalonia, which accounts for a fifth of Spain's economy, might refuse to pay its share of the national debt. 
This unseemly stand-off has investors perplexed. Catalonia's own regional debt yields are rising, though overall foreign investment is growing and Moody's, a ratings agency, does not see independence as likely in the next three to five years. 
Yet the 1m separatists who took peacefully to the streets of Barcelona on September 11th to mark Catalonia's ""national"" day were a reminder of just how deep passions run. Lluis Llach, a famous Catalan-language singer whose protest anthems were heard across Spain in the 1970s, heads Mr Mas's ""Together for Yes"" list in the northern province of Girona. A constitutional court ruling that struck out parts of a self-government statute in 2010 shattered his dream that a constitution drawn up after the death of dictator Francisco Franco would allow Spain to become ""a nation of nations"", including not just Catalonia, but also the Basque Country and Galicia. It also pushed Mr Llach, and many other Catalans, towards active separatism. 
Mr Rajoy believes Mr Mas will lose the vote. In case he is wrong, however, the government is beefing up the constitutional court's powers to prevent a new regional government creating some of the institutions needed by an independent Catalonia. He also has an eye on general elections, due in December; parties seen as soft on Catalan independence may suffer in the rest of the country. 
Mr Mas's separatists can only be defeated on September 27th with the aid of what the government calls the ""radical leftists"" of Podemos. These have allied with others who see the pro-business Mr Mas as an austerity hawk and want working-class Catalans who do not normally vote--many from families who migrated from elsewhere in Spain--to turn out to evict him. Opinion polls are too close for accurate predictions about the result. The only certainty is that a victory for Mr Mas will create more uncertainty. That will not help either Spain or Catalonia as they try to maintain the momentum of economic recovery after a long recession.","Elections in Catalonia may launch a secession battle Europe is not ready for

 Mr Mas 's separatists can only be defeated on September 27th with the aid of what the government calls the "" radical leftists "" of Podemos . These have allied with others who see the pro - business Mr Mas as an austerity hawk and want working - class Catalans who do not normally vote -- many from families who migrated from elsewhere in Spain -- to turn out to evict him . Opinion polls are too close for accurate predictions about the result . The only certainty is that a victory for Mr Mas will create more uncertainty .

WHEN Mariano Rajoy and his conservative People's Party (PP) were elected in 2011, Spain had been knocked flat by the euro crisis and the bursting of a property bubble. Unemployment had more than doubled, to 20% (it peaked at 26% in early 2013), the economy was in a prolonged slump and most of the cajas (savings banks) were insolvent. Spain today is an altogether brighter place. The economy is still smaller than in 2008 but is set to grow by more than 3% in 2015--the best performance among large western European economies. Unemployment is falling steadily. Consumer and business confidence is robust. As Mr Rajoy proclaims: ""Spain has passed from being a country on the brink of bankruptcy to a model of recovery that provides an example to...the European Union."" 
Mr Rajoy hopes that this record will bring him victory at an election on December 20th (see page 41). He can claim some credit for the recovery. While other euro-zone countries dithered, his government acted boldly. It has sorted out the banks, halved the budget deficit and made Spain more competitive by reforming the labour and energy markets. He makes a good case for another four years. But many Spaniards want political renewal, too--and to that Mr Rajoy's response is a shrug. 
The slump exposed the accretion of corruption and cronyism in the PP and the opposition Socialists, which have largely run Spain since democracy replaced Franco's dictatorship. Both had recourse to illicit financing; their gouging of the cajas and their spendthrift regional governments contributed to the national collapse. Hence the crisis has spawned new political forces. Podemos (""We can"") is a cry of anger. Its leader, Pablo Iglesias, a leftist political-science professor, now spends less time talking about class struggle and more praising the Nordic social model. But his enthusiasm for Greece's disastrous experiment with his ideological soulmates, the Syriza party, bodes ill. 
A more constructive response to the euro crisis lies in Ciudadanos (""Citizens""), a liberal party (in the British sense) in a country where liberalism has never been strong. Its leader, Albert Rivera, aged 36, is untested, but his advisers propose many policies that Spain needs. Ciudadanos would do more than the PP to deepen economic reforms, cut wasteful duplication in government and boost sluggish productivity. It wants a single labour contract in place of the cosseting of insiders that leaves many young people as temporary hires. Like Podemos, it wants to reverse the PP-Socialist carve-up of institutions that ought to be independent, including the judiciary, the diplomatic service and the universities. It opposes Catalan independence but, unlike the PP, recognises that Spain is a pluricultural country. And unlike Podemos, it wants to build on, rather than threaten, the achievements of the past 40 years. 
Reform politics, as well as the economy 
If The Economist had a vote, it would go to Ciudadanos. But the next government is likely to be a coalition, because opinion polls suggest that, although the PP will again be the largest party in the Cortes, it will fail to keep its majority. Since his party is in the centre, Mr Rivera may have the casting vote. He should resist the temptation to join Podemos in a centre-left government led by the Socialists under their lightweight leader, Pedro Sanchez. Such a government would be weak, and the Socialists have promised to undo the PP's labour reforms. Rather, Ciudadanos should ally with Mr Rajoy--on condition that the next government adopts the anti-corruption agenda on which it has campaigned. Populism is on the rise in the EU.

IN MAY 2014 Isabel Carrasco was murdered as she walked across a footbridge over the Bernesga river in the north-western Spanish city of Leon. Ms Carrasco, a controversial local bigwig in the People's Party (PP) of the prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, was shot at point-blank range by the mother of a young woman whom she had excluded from her political patronage network. (The young woman, the daughter of a local police chief, had been refused a government job.) It was an act of madness, but within the local political context it made a crazy kind of sense. ""This was about cronyism, about her daughter's career,"" said Juan Carlos Fernandez, a local spokesman for Ciudadanos, a political party that campaigns against corruption. 
As Spain prepares for national elections on December 20th, cronyism is near the top of voters' concerns. Both the PP and the opposition Socialists, who have taken turns in government for the past 33 years, are viewed by voters as deeply corrupt. The Socialists once hoped that anger at Mr Rajoy's austerity programme would bring them back to power. But an economic recovery may allow the PP to hold on. 
Many Spaniards have embraced two upstart parties that vow to drive cronyism from public life. The anti-austerity Podemos party, led by Pablo Iglesias, a left-wing political-science professor, once seemed ready to sweep to power. But over the past year it has been surpassed by Ciudadanos, a liberal party led by a 36-year-old lawyer, Albert Rivera (pictured). Although voters worry most about the economy, ""those going to the new parties are almost as concerned about corruption,"" says Pablo Simon, editor of Politikon, a politics blog. Together, the newcomers look set to win nearly 40% of the vote and deny both the PP and the Socialists a majority. 
Ms Carrasco's power base was a part of Leon's government called the Diputacion (housed in a 16th-century palace), an intermediate layer in some Spanish provinces that distributes public works and largesse to small municipalities. She gained a reputation for iron-fisted favouritism; her successor, another PP appointee, was arrested (and later released on bail) in an investigation into corruption. Both Ciudadanos and Podemos want to scrap the Diputacion layer of government entirely. Ciudadanos also wants to merge many of Spain's 8,117 municipal councils, some of which represent just a few hundred villagers. 
Such measures are popular in urban areas that are too big to receive Diputacion money. But they are unpopular in Leon and other rural provinces. ""You don't win the rural vote by telling people you will take away their local councils,"" says Ms Carrasco's successor as PP provincial boss, Eduardo Fernandez. Besides, scrapping layers of government is difficult: civil servants have cast-iron job guarantees. And Spain's electoral system gives disproportionate weight to sparsely populated rural provinces. The state pollster, CIS, shows the PP winning 29% of the overall vote, but its strength in the countryside could give it up to 128 of the 350 seats in parliament. 
A PP victory, however marginal, would be Mr Rajoy's prize for turning around the economy. It shrank by 4% in 2010-13, but has grown 3% this year. Unemployment is falling but still high, at 21%. Most new jobs are short-term and unstable. Labour reforms pushed through by the PP in 2012 have helped Spain devalue by means of wage reductions, but this has reached its limits, says Alfredo Pastor of the IESE business school. Ciudadanos's solution is to free up the labour market with a single, catch-all employment contract, to get rid of Spain's sharp insider-outsider divide between protected permanent workers and those on precarious short-term contracts. Podemos and the Socialists propose to repeal the PP's partial liberalisation. 
Catalonia's desire for independence is a wild card. Neither the PP nor Ciudadanos has anything special to offer secessionist Catalans, which explains why Podemos, which supports an independence referendum, may win first place there. Mr Rivera is himself a Catalan; indeed, Ciudadanos began life as an anti-nationalist group in the region. Although he opposes independence, he may be better placed to understand local sensitivities than Mr Rajoy, who has seen a leap in support for secession on his watch. 
The new parties' strength shows how profoundly Spaniards want their system to change. It probably will. It is almost certain that no one party will gain an outright majority. Coalition government would require new skills of compromise and horse-trading from Spanish parties, which are used to governing alone. Yet the old politics has some life in it yet. Just 11 weeks before the election, the government shored up its support in Leon with a new high-speed rail link to Madrid, reminiscent of the dubious infrastructure projects that got Spain into trouble during the go-go years. Mr Rajoy himself cut the tape.","The economy is recovering nicely . Cronyism , alas , is rife

LESS than a minute into his speech and Albert Rivera, the leader of Ciudadanos, a centrist party that has stormed the barricades of Spanish politics, is already speaking of reformas estructurales.

Yet Ciudadanos has risen from single digits in the polls a year ago to around 20% today, and is set to act as kingmaker after Spain's unpredictable general election on December 20th (see page 41). 
Like bronzed pensioners on the Costa Blanca, several political ideas are seeing out their last days in Spain. One of them is that liberals of Mr Rivera's sort cannot thrive in southern Europe. Another is the prediction, often heard during the darkest days of the euro crisis, that the cuts countries like Spain had to endure would generate a devastating political blowback. Yet Spain's ruling People's Party (PP), helped by buoyant growth and jobs numbers, remains on top of the polls, albeit much weakened. 
It is a similar story elsewhere in the euro-zone periphery. Ireland's ruling Fine Gael hopes to win another term next spring on the back of a zippy recovery. Portugal's centre-right government came first in October's election, only to see a leftist alliance assemble a jerry-built coalition that will struggle to last a full term. In Greece Syriza's anti-austerity resolve crumbled on its first encounter with the German-led imperium. Even in Italy, which has failed to grow since joining the euro, Matteo Renzi, the centre-left prime minister, is just about keeping a ragtag of populists at bay. 
But it was in Spain, the euro zone's fourth-largest economy, where the backlash was most feared. Unlike Greece, Ireland and Portugal, Spain (just) avoided a full bail-out. But its calamitous crash left over half of young workers unemployed. In January Pablo Iglesias, the leader of Podemos, another political newcomer, addressed vast crowds in Madrid on the iniquities of austerity while his brother-in-arms, Alexis Tsipras, led Syriza to victory in Greece. Europe's panjandrums feared the spread of political ""contagion"" from Greece across the periphery, starting in Spain. 
What happened? A year later Mr Tsipras is dutifully executing the terms of Greece's third bail-out, Podemos's support has plummeted and Ciudadanos has waltzed through the door that Mr Iglesias prised open. In Ireland Sinn Fein, a party rooted in terrorism that has tried to reposition itself as the voice of anti-austerity, is slipping in the polls after once leading them. Today the populist momentum in Europe is with right-wingers, who have exploited the refugee crisis to tap into cultural as well as economic fears. 
A number of factors explain the left's struggle. In part, it is the difficulty of turning insurrections into political parties. Coalitions must be built and maintained, outrage transmuted into a policy platform. Podemos began life as a fusion of grassroots indignados and a cabal of hard-left political-science professors, and the fissures sometimes show: this year a gentle tack towards the centre has seen some senior figures quit in disgust. Sinn Fein's dark history renders it toxic for many Irish voters. In August an anti-euro faction split off from Syriza. 
Europe's anti-austerians have also learned that their crusades are hard to conduct inside the euro zone, with Brussels supervising their every fiscal move. Grounded in internationalism, none of the new left populists wants to leave the single currency. Pablo Bustinduy, a Podemos candidate, says his party's attacks on austerity go ""hand-in-hand"" with a pro-European message. But he is scathing about the austerian turn the euro zone has taken. The Europe that the new left professes to love often seems to be just an artefact of its imagination. 
Despite this, the right is in no position to crow. European politics has not yet returned to its pre-crisis routines. Although Podemos's standing in the polls has faded, Spain's politics has fractured and Mr Iglesias's support may turn out to be vital in forming a government (he has had a good campaign). In Ireland, Spain and Greece once-stable systems have become primaeval political soups from which all manner of governments may emerge. The left's cause retains vitality: Podemos's dedication, grounded in the suffering of the indignados, could yet prove more enduring than Ciudadanos's clever but bloodless proposals. 
Not barking, but growling 
More to the point, Podemos's anger could prove useful, even if its reheated socialism is no cure for Spain's economic ills. The country's corrupt politics were crying out for the disruption that both Podemos and Ciudadanos have brought. Young Spaniards were walloped by the crash, but the PP has pandered to the old: last week Mariano Rajoy, the unpopular prime minister, pledged to slash income tax for Spain's pensioners. Little wonder, notes Jorge Galindo of Politikon, a Spanish website: the PP is polling first among voters over 65, and fourth among everyone else. This is not a strategy for the long term. Nor do the tired Socialists appeal to Spain's disaffected young. 
Despite the strong recovery, only 12% of Spaniards say they trust their country's institutions--the lowest figure in the EU--and over one-fifth of the labour force remains jobless. Even those in work often struggle to pay the bills. The PP's reforms have helped, but Spain is still a country stratified by age and status in which protected insiders enjoy secure employment and pension rights while young outsiders struggle to gain a foothold. 
These conditions are ripe for any party that can credibly promise rupture and regeneration. Whoever takes office after Sunday's election will face difficulties, starting with yet more austerity: Spain's deficit remains the euro zone's highest. Podemos will still have lots to talk about.

IN MOST places, when 3,030 people take an up-or-down vote, some sort of decision will probably emerge. But one should never underestimate the contentiousness of the Catalans. On December 27th an assembly of the far-left Popular Unity Candidacies (CUP) party deciding whether to back Catalonia's acting president, Artur Mas, split the vote evenly--1,515 on each side. The deadlock means that, three months after elections, Mr Mas still cannot form a government to carry out his programme of moving steadily towards secession from Spain. 
The Catalan impasse is part of a wider Spanish gridlock. Elections on December 20th splintered the political landscape. The duopoly of the conservative People's Party (PP) of the prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, and the opposition Socialists (PSOE), who have traded turns in power for the past 33 years, has been upended. The insurgent left-wing Podemos and liberal Ciudadanos parties grabbed a third of the parliamentary seats between them, making a coalition or minority government a necessity. But Spain has little culture of coalition-building, and forming a government is a tall order. Fresh elections are also possible. 
After losing over a third of the PP's seats, Mr Rajoy's attempts to form a new government seem destined to fail. Meanwhile Pedro Sanchez, the Socialist leader, led his party to a historic low with barely one in five votes. A ""grand coalition"" between them, possibly backed by Ciudadanos, would be the most stable option. But decades of enmity make that unlikely. 
Instead Mr Sanchez fancies himself as the next prime minister. He would need to include the far-leftists of Podemos, which would be a triumph for southern Europe's anti-austerity rebellion. But Podemos demands that Catalonia be granted a referendum on independence, which the Socialists refuse to accept. Mr Sanchez himself may soon face a leadership challenge, especially if party heavyweights, led by Susana Diez, the president of Andalusia, think he is selling them out. And even if Mr Sanchez and Podemos reach agreement, they do not have enough deputies; they would need the backing of either Ciudadanos or Catalan separatist parties. 
Podemos and Ciudadanos would make strange bedfellows. One party rails against neoliberalism; the other backs liberal reforms. The leaders of Podemos, Pablo Iglesias, and of Ciudadanos, Albert Rivera, have good personal chemistry, and both see themselves as crusaders ridding Spanish politics of corruption. They agree on the need to depoliticise the judiciary and some regulatory agencies. Yet a government of the Socialists, Podemos and Ciudadanos would lack the votes to change the constitution, making it hard to resolve Spain's biggest looming problem: Catalonia's threat to secede. 
Mr Mas and his Catalan Democratic Convergence party have been plodding towards secession for years. To secure the CUP's backing, the once business-friendly leader is now dabbling in anti-austerity populism, promising to scrap a privatisation programme and commit his indebted region to an extra EUR 270m ($296m) of social spending. His next steps towards independence are likely to clash with Spain's constitution and may prod the new government to employ legal force against him. After four years without dialogue between Madrid and Barcelona, however, the two new governments may both be too weak to sort the problem out. 
Spain's economy grew by an estimated 3% in 2015, but the recovery remains fragile and inadequate. Unemployment is 21% and GDP is still lower than in 2007. The most recent report by Fitch, a ratings agency, stated the obvious: a long period of political uncertainty and reversals of reforms will damage business confidence.

ARTUR MAS spent five years as president of Catalonia leading its drive for independence but, for the most part, he was a pro-business centrist who embraced the cause of secession because politics demanded it. When Mr Mas stepped down on January 9th after three months attempting to form a government, it was to make way for a more ideologically pure successor, Carles Puigdemont. In a speech in 2013 Mr Puigdemont said, quoting a Catalan journalist executed under the dictatorship of Francisco Franco, that ""the invaders will be expelled from Catalonia""--referring to the Spanish government. 
On January 12th Mr Puigdemont became the first Catalan president to take the oath of office while omitting the traditional vows of loyalty to Spain's constitution and king. Spain's interior minister looked on in stony silence. 
It was Mr Puigdemont's long commitment to independence, which much of his centre-right Catalan Democratic Convergence (CDC) party has embraced only recently, that enabled him to form a government where Mr Mas had failed. It won him the trust of the far-left Popular Unity Candidacies (CUP) party, whose members thought Mr Mas a sleazy austerity-monger but apparently consider Mr Puigdemont a more trustworthy radical. 
Three months after the elections, Catalonia's independence movement now has control of the region's government. But that control has come at a cost to the secessionists' image. For years, the separatist movement has successfully sold itself as cool, kind and progressive. Backers of continued union with Spain were scorned as reactionaries, or even the inheritors of Franco's legacy. Now senior members of the independence movement worry that it will be identified with the CUP, whose raised fists and chaotic assemblies frighten conservative, middle-class Catalans. Mr Puigdemont's CDC has traditionally stood for order. The small but newly powerful CUP represents radical change. 
Separatism's squeaky-clean image has found its greatest expression in pro-independence demonstrations on Catalan national day, September 11th. For each of the past four years, at least 600,000 people, or around 10% of the population, have turned out to demonstrate. The good-natured protests pull in entire families, with small children holding grandparents' hands, banners in the red, gold and blue colours of the independence movement flying--""and not a single piece of litter on the street"", claims Jordi Sanchez, president of the Catalan National Assembly, the group that organises the festivities. 
Unionists complain that separatism's civilised facade hides an unpleasant sense of moral superiority. ""I call it the Kumbaya factor,"" moans an anti-separatist Catalan economist. The movement's righteous aura is aided by the participation of several nuns. One radical crowd-pleaser is Teresa Forcades, a Benedictine with a master's degree from Harvard who is on leave from her convent on Catalonia's Montserrat holy mountain. Mr Mas liked to be seen with one of his greatest fans, a Dominican nun named Lucia Caram. 
According to the coalition accord, Mr Puigdemont will now lead the Catalan government on an 18-month ""road map"" to independence. Yet Spain's constitution does not allow any move towards secession, nor are there plans for a referendum on it. The acting government in Madrid, led by Mariano Rajoy's conservative Popular Party (PP), has vowed to apply the full weight of the law as soon as it sees the constitution under threat. 
The question is whether Catalans will support an avowedly confrontational government. Mr Mas billed the regional elections as the referendum on independence that Madrid had refused to call. His Together for Yes coalition and CUP, which both backed the road map, jointly won more than half the seats--but only 48% of the vote. Even many separatists doubt that is enough. The ugly infighting of recent weeks and the radical antics of CUP are unlikely to have boosted support any further. 
The separatists' ranks have swollen dramatically over the past half-dozen years. This has been the result, in part, of Mr Rajoy's refusal to concede any Catalan demands for greater self-government. Most important, says Mr Sanchez, it is younger voters who are keenest on independence. That bodes well for the future of separatism. Much depends on how the central government in Madrid responds. Unfortunately, Spain's general election on December 20th left parliament so fractured that forming a government could take months, or require new elections. Catalonia may have a new president, but the question of its independence is not much closer to being resolved.","A province edging away from Spain gets a radical secessionist leader

WHEN Spaniards voted at a general election in December, they chose to change the way politics works. What they did not expect was that it would stop working altogether. Yet eight weeks later, they have no government and, with a fractured parliament, might not have one until the summer. The question that quickly arose was: does it matter? 
Surprisingly, many thought the answer was no. Luis De Guindos, the finance minister, estimated that Spain could hold out for six months with the current caretaker government led by Mariano Rajoy of the Popular Party (PP). A 2016 budget was passed last year. ""In the short run political uncertainty is likely to have limited impact on fiscal policy,"" noted Fitch, a ratings agency, after the elections. Much of the spending, on services like health and education, is done by regional governments. More important, the economy is recovering, unemployment is falling and growth looks set to continue at about 3% this year. Spanish newspapers, recalling Belgium's 589 days without a government in 2010-11, predicted everything from an economic boom to less corruption. 
But with jittery financial markets now threatening to upset Spain's fragile recovery, attitudes are changing. ""The assumption in Spain was that it didn't matter because in an environment with benign financial conditions and growth and employment being created, who cared?"" says Fernando Fernandez, an economist at the IE Business School in Madrid. Yet it would be foolish to forget that the Spanish economy is still vulnerable, he adds. Spain is heavily in debt, as are many Spanish families. The deficit remains high and unemployment, although falling, is still sky-high at 20%. If the current market turmoil provokes a large hike in bond yields, then the provisional government may have to make tricky spending decisions. And the problems are not just domestic. In Europe, too, Spain may have to take a stance on everything from Brexit to immigration. 
With a weak government, any major decisions risk being viewed as ephemeral, warns Jose Fernandez-Albertos, a political scientist at Spain's National Research Council. Unlike Belgium, Spain is not used to consensus-based coalition politics. It is more like the United Kingdom, where a change of government can bring a big shift in policy. Any decision Mr Rajoy takes could be reversed by a new government within weeks or months. 
All this could be avoided if Spain's political parties could agree on a new government. That is unlikely to happen soon, if at all. Mr Rajoy has run out of options and the socialist leader, Pedro Sanchez, is now trying to see if he can piece together a coalition. His two main potential partners are either the centre-right insurgent party Ciudadanos or the new left-wing radicals of Podemos. Yet both coalitions would result in unstable minority governments. 
If Mr Sanchez fails, new elections must be called. Whether that will resolve things is unclear. Polls show that the distribution of seats would be fairly similar. This might lead to a coalition with Podemos, a thought that frightens many investors. If that happens, Spaniards may look back on this period of political uncertainty fondly, says Lorenzo Bernaldo de Quiros, an economist.

ONCE a stronghold of the conservative Popular Party (PP), led by the prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, Valencia fell to a broad coalition of anti-austerity left-wingers in regional elections in May. Some now see that as a potential model for a national coalition government--a goal that has eluded Spain's politicians since the general election in December. 
Spain's voters created the three-month impasse by scattering their votes among four large parties and a smattering of small ones. The PP, which struggled with sky-high unemployment and corruption scandals, lost a third of its support. It can govern only in unlikely alliance with its arch-rival, the Socialist party. Likelier would be a broad left coalition headed by the Socialist leader, Pedro Sanchez, and backed by some of the parties--like the left-wing populist insurgents, Podemos--who prop up Valencia's current government. 
In Valencia, that coalition is governing with a programme in which pragmatism trumps radicalism. ""We run things better, and don't steal,"" says the region's deputy president, Monica Oltra. She helps lead Compromis, a local leftist party that allied with the Socialists and others to form the government. It also stood jointly with Podemos at December's general election, claiming second place in the region. 
High public debt has prevented Ximo Puig, the region's Socialist president, from pursuing many anti-austerity policies; he has raised taxes slightly and paid for some social welfare projects. But for voters tired of corruption scandals, it is enough for the government to appear clean and calm. The financial crisis revealed murky links between politicians, collapsed construction firms and failed savings banks; many of the local PP's former leaders now face court cases. Most deny wrongdoing, but Marcos Benavent, a former official known for his expensive designer jackets, appeared in court last year sporting a bushy white beard, earrings and hippy bangles, apologising and vowing to ""try to pay back all I stole."" 
Though the Socialists have co-operated closely with Compromis in Valencia, they have clashed repeatedly with Podemos in Madrid. In one of his first parliamentary appearances Podemos's leader, Pablo Iglesias, accused the former socialist prime minister, Felipe Gonzalez, of being stained with quicklime--a reference to the way in which state-sponsored death-squads disposed of the bodies of Basque separatists they murdered in the 1980s, when he was in office. Many Podemos members would prefer fresh elections to forming a coalition with the Socialists. And Mr Iglesias exercises direct control over only two-thirds of his party's parliamentary tally; the rest actually belong to local coalitions led by partners like Compromis. 
If the Socialists and Podemos do team up--indeed, even if they gain the help of the communist-led United Left--they will still lack a majority. For that, they would need the support of a mixed group of Catalan and Basque nationalists, some of them right-wing. Many politicians, tiring of coalition-building efforts, are already preparing for new elections. Yet that may not solve the stand-off; voters look set to elect another fractured parliament if they are called back to the polls. Spain may have to wait till autumn for its next government.","While regional parties collaborate , national ones remain at odds

Some now see that as a potential model for a national coalition government -- a goal that has eluded Spain 's politicians since the general election in December . 
 Spain 's voters created the three - month impasse by scattering their votes among four large parties and a smattering of small ones . Mariano Rajoy lost a third of Mariano Rajoy's support . Mariano Rajoy can govern only in unlikely alliance with Mariano Rajoy's arch - rival , the Socialist party . Likelier would be a broad left coalition headed by the Socialist leader , Pedro Sanchez , and backed by some of the parties -- like the left - wing populist insurgents , Podemos -- who prop up Valencia 's current government . 
 In Valencia , that coalition is governing with a programme in which pragmatism trumps radicalism . "" We run things better , and do n't steal , "" says the region 's deputy president , Monica Oltra . She helps lead Compromis , a local leftist party that allied with the Socialists and others to form the government . It also stood jointly with Podemos at December 's general election , claiming second place in the region . 
 High public debt has prevented Ximo Puig , the region 's Socialist president , from pursuing many anti - austerity policies ; he has raised taxes slightly and paid for some social welfare projects . But for voters tired of corruption scandals , it is enough for the government to appear clean and calm . The financial crisis revealed murky links between politicians , collapsed construction firms and failed savings banks ; many of the local PP 's former leaders now face court cases . Most deny wrongdoing , but Marcos Benavent , a former official known for his expensive designer jackets , appeared in court last year sporting a bushy white beard , earrings and hippy bangles , apologising and vowing to "" try to pay back all I stole . "" 
 Though the Socialists have co - operated closely with Compromis in Valencia , they have clashed repeatedly with Podemos in Madrid . In one of his first parliamentary appearances Podemos 's leader , Pablo Iglesias , accused the former socialist prime minister , Felipe Gonzalez , of being stained with quicklime -- a reference to the way in which state - sponsored death - squads disposed of the bodies of Basque separatists they murdered in the 1980s , when he was in office . Many Podemos members would prefer fresh elections to forming a coalition with the Socialists . And Mr Iglesias exercises direct control over only two - thirds of his party 's parliamentary tally ; the rest actually belong to local coalitions led by partners like Compromis . 
 If the Socialists and Podemos do team up -- indeed , even if they gain the help of the communist - led United Left -- they will still lack a majority . For that , they would need the support of a mixed group of Catalan and Basque nationalists , some of them right - wing . Many politicians , tiring of coalition - building efforts , are already preparing for new elections . Yet that may not solve the stand - off ; voters look set to elect another fractured parliament if they are called back to the polls . Spain may have to wait till autumn for its next government .",230,Spain,A30-57,IN TERM,True,"the conservative Popular Party ( PP ) , led by the prime minister , Mariano Rajoy",5,True

IN THE shade of a futuristic curving roof of wood and concrete slats, some 2,000 people have gathered at the Plaza de la Encarnacion in the heart of Seville for a campaign rally by Unidos Podemos (""Together we can""), Spain's new left-wing party. Among them are Luis Maroto, a teacher, and Reyes Santana, a pharmacist, both in their 30s, and their 14-day-old baby, Rafa. Ms Santana used to vote for the centre-left Socialists, who have governed Spain for 21 of the past 34 years. Unable to open her own business, she still works in her mother's pharmacy. This time her vote, and that of Mr Maroto, will go to Podemos. ""They have restored hope,"" he says. 
If the polls are right Podemos, formed only in 2014, will overtake the Socialist party in the election on June 26th to become the main force on the Spanish left. It will thus become the chief adversary of the centre-right People's Party (PP) of Mariano Rajoy, the prime minister since 2011. That would present Pedro Sanchez, the Socialist leader, with an agonising choice: allow the PP to remain in power, or play second fiddle to Pablo Iglesias (pictured), Podemos's leader, in a left-wing government. The first option would grate with the Socialists' traditional supporters. But the second would horrify business and the Socialists' own regional leaders. They fear Spain would face the sort of severe economic reversals that befell Greece when it put the far left in power last year. 
In a general election last December the rise of Podemos and of Ciudadanos, a new liberal party, upended a stable two-party system. The PP won the most seats, but Mr Rajoy lost his parliamentary majority. Mr Sanchez tried to form a centre-left coalition. He reached agreement with Albert Rivera, the leader of Ciudadanos. But his talks with Mr Iglesias foundered, prompting a new election. 
Spain is not Greece. Its economy grew by 3.2% last year, more than that of any other large country in the Eurozone; it added 450,000 jobs in the second quarter of this year. The unemployment rate is down to 20%, from 26% in 2013. Household spending is reviving. That is why the PP is again likely to come first. Mr Rajoy claims credit for the recovery, and points to his experience compared with the other parties' young leaders. Coming to office in the depth of recession, his government cut the fiscal deficit, cleaned up the financial system and reformed a rigid labour market. 
But years of recession and austerity left deep scars in society. Income per person is still well below its peak of 2008. Those who find jobs face lower wages and less security. The national statistics institute says that 14% of the population has insufficient income to last until the end of the month. 
In the eyes of many younger Spaniards, the PP and the Socialists share the blame. Both have suffered corruption scandals (the PP more so) which, though minor compared with serious kleptocracies, are rendered intolerable by austerity. That has given rise to a political generation gap. More than half of under-35s voted for the two new parties in December; most over-54s voted for the traditional ones. 
Podemos, in particular, has tapped the frustration of the young. Mr Iglesias has redefined Spanish politics as a struggle against l a casta (""the caste""), by which he means the leaders and hangers-on of the traditional parties who colonised institutions from the courts to the savings banks and the boardrooms of corporate Spain. Last year Podemos found allies among nationalists and leftists in Catalonia, Valencia and Galicia. In May, Mr Iglesias agreed to merge with the United Left (the former Communists), which won 3.7% in December. The electoral system may reward the merged Unidos Podemos (UP) with some 20 extra seats, overtaking the Socialists. 
UP promises an end to austerity and an extra EUR 15 billion ($16.9 billion) a year of public spending, even though Spain still has a large fiscal deficit and public debt, of 5.1% and over 100% of GDP respectively. It would increase income tax on those earning above EUR 60,000 and on companies. Podemos's leaders, a group of university political scientists, advised Venezuela's Hugo Chavez and are friends of Alexis Tsipras, Greece's leftist prime minister--links they now play down. Mr Iglesias has rebranded Podemos's ideology as ""new social democracy"", in an attempt to steal the Socialists' clothes. Though the liturgy of UP's campaign is that of the Ibero-American far left, it has banned red flags and other communist touches that might cost it votes. 
Its ever-changing programme is not what defines Podemos's leaders. ""What matters to them is power and the message, and 'when we're in power we'll see what we do',"" says Jose Rodriguez de la Borbolla, a former Socialist leader. As Mr Iglesias puts it, ""in Latin America we learned that it's possible to win."" In his negotiations with Mr Sanchez, he demanded control not of health and education but of hard power: the interior and justice ministries, state television and the intelligence service. Many in Spain worry that this revealed authoritarian tendencies. But others trust in Spanish institutions. ""We have democracy. In four years' time they would go if they make mistakes,"" says Mr Maroto, the teacher. 
While the Socialists' base is among the poor and the old, Podemos represents ""an impoverished, fed-up, tired middle class"" as well as a generational transition, says Xavier Coller, a sociologist at Pablo de Olavide university in Seville. ""We are immersed in a historic process of political change,"" Inigo Errejon, the deputy leader of Podemos, told his fired-up supporters in Seville. ""The question is whether they [the traditional parties] will be able to delay this...for four more years."" 
Mr Rajoy's riposte is a grand coalition of ""moderate"" parties. If such a coalition pushes through reforms--of the judiciary and of regional financing--it might help to restore the credibility of the old order. But Mr Rivera says his condition for allowing the PP to govern is that Mr Rajoy himself steps down. And Mr Sanchez refuses to contemplate any agreement with the PP. 
A lower turnout this time may give the PP and Ciudadanos a few more seats. Breaking the deadlock may even require a third election. A grand coalition could buy time for economic growth to heal some social scars. But if Mr Errejon is to be proved wrong, it will take a much bigger effort from the PP, and especially the Socialists, to reconnect with a lost generation.","The rise of Podemos and the resistance of Mariano Rajoy

After 33.6m votes were counted, 52% had opted to break away from the union after four decades. Turmoil ensued. David Cameron, Britain's prime minister, never an enthusiast for the EU but who nonetheless campaigned vigorously to remain, announced his resignation. The vote exposed deep divisions in British society, notably over immigration. An e-petition to the government, calling for a second referendum gathered over 4m signatures, mostly from Remainers. 
Mr Cameron was not the only party leader whose position became untenable. The opposition Labour Party imploded when two-thirds of the shadow cabinet resigned over the underwhelming support Jeremy Corbyn, the party's leader, gave to the Remain campaign. Mr Corbyn lost a vote of no confidence among the party's MPs by 172 to 40 but refused to go, claiming he had the backing of the party's grassroots. Adding to the imbroglio, one new appointment to the shadow cabinet resigned within two days. 
The referendum split the country. Many English cities, including London, voted to remain. So did Scotland. Its first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, promised to fight for Scotland's place in the EU, but France and Spain suggested they would oppose any kind of subnational deal. Politicians in Northern Ireland, which also voted to remain, said they were concerned that the reintroduction of ""hard borders"" with the south could unravel the province's fragile peace. 
In its second election in six months, Spain once again voted for a fragmented parliament. Following relatively successful results for his conservative People's Party, the prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, called for a grand coalition--a request that opposition parties have refused. Spain's far-left Podemos party fared badly.

FEW of the English people who voted to leave the European Union on June 23rd considered that in doing so they might trigger the break-up of another union: their own. Supporters of the EU in Scotland and Northern Ireland--both of which returned healthy majorities for Remain--are unhappy at being dragged out of Europe by the English. Some now believe the best remedy would be to leave the United Kingdom. 
Scotland's Nationalist government argues that Brexit provides grounds for a second independence referendum. One reason why 55% voted ""no"" to independence in the last one, in 2014, was the claim that remaining in Britain was the only way Scotland could stay in the EU. In fact, remaining within the UK has turned out to be a ticket out of Europe. Polls over the past week suggest that some 54-59% of Scots now support independence. 
Yet Nicola Sturgeon, the leader of the Scottish National Party and Scotland's first minister, is in no rush. Her aim, she told the Scottish Parliament on June 28th, is to ""protect Scotland's relationship with, and place in, the EU"" and to secure ""continued access to the single market"". She knows that, as happened with Quebec's push for independence from Canada, losing a second referendum would be fatal to her cause. The slump in the oil price means the financial arguments for independence are weaker than in 2014. Severe austerity would be needed to reduce a deficit of 9.7% of GDP. And an independent Scotland might not inherit Britain's EU opt-outs and would thus have to join the euro. 
So Ms Sturgeon has a two-track strategy: try to get Scotland a deal with the EU to secure the free movement of goods and people, and at the same time prepare for another independence referendum which, she says, is now ""highly likely"". She is doing this with her customary political skill, in stark contrast to the floundering of party leaders in Westminster. She has reached out to Fabian Picardo, the chief minister of Gibraltar, a British dependency on Spain's southern tip, where 96% voted to Remain, and Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, another pro-EU stronghold. Yet Spain and France have made clear that they oppose the EU negotiating with Scotland. ""If the UK leaves, Scotland leaves,"" said Mariano Rajoy, the prime minister of Spain, who has no desire to embolden Catalan separatists at home. 
Much will depend on the kind of deal that Britain does with the EU. Under a Norwegian-style arrangement, allowing the free movement of people, an independent Scotland could be a full member of the EU without needing to set up a hard border with England--something few Scots would want, since Scotland exports four times as much to England as it does to the EU. At the same time, however, such a deal might dampen calls for independence, since a Norwegian deal would not harm Britain's economy as badly as would total isolation from Europe. 
Twelve miles across the Irish Sea, Brexit is causing other problems. In Northern Ireland, 56% voted to remain in the EU. Most of the support came from Nationalists, largely because EU membership strengthens the north's links with Ireland. 
Following the result Sinn Fein, the main nationalist party, immediately called for a referendum on Northern Ireland's reunification with the south, a move that was ruled out by London and Dublin. Yet Brexit presents many other problems. If Britain exits the EU and ends the free movement of people, the hard border between north and south could come back. The psychological and practical impact of reinstituting checkpoints would be great on both sides. And the region would lose not just cross-border trade and EU farm payments but billions of pounds of other EU grants that have helped build a foundation for peace. 
The Good Friday Agreement, the 1998 deal in which Northern Ireland's peace process was underpinned by the EU, was predicated on free movement between north and south, part of a compromise that persuaded those on both sides to put down their weapons. The moment that Britain leaves the EU it will be in breach of that agreement, which sets out how the governments in Westminster and Dublin are to co-operate in matters pertaining to Northern Ireland. It is ""inconceivable"" that Sinn Fein, the main nationalist party, would not make representations to the UN, says Jonathan Tonge of the University of Liverpool. 
The power-sharing Northern Ireland Assembly, which is still in reasonable shape despite years of crises, must now be protected. It will face many challenges in any post-Brexit world because of the possibility of new Anglo-Irish tensions, border-security issues and threats to the economy. Northern Ireland is facing its most delicate political moment in years. It will require the full attention of the new British prime minister--whose attention, of course, will be entirely elsewhere.","The vote to leave the EU spells trouble for Scotland and Northern Ireland

One reason why 55% voted ""no"" to independence in the last one, in 2014, was the claim that remaining in Britain was the only way Scotland could stay in the EU. In fact, remaining within the UK has turned out to be a ticket out of Europe. Polls over the past week suggest that some 54-59% of Scots now support independence. 
Yet Nicola Sturgeon, the leader of the Scottish National Party and Scotland's first minister, is in no rush. Her aim, she told the Scottish Parliament on June 28th, is to ""protect Scotland's relationship with, and place in, the EU"" and to secure ""continued access to the single market"". She knows that, as happened with Quebec's push for independence from Canada, losing a second referendum would be fatal to her cause. The slump in the oil price means the financial arguments for independence are weaker than in 2014. Severe austerity would be needed to reduce a deficit of 9.7% of GDP. And an independent Scotland might not inherit Britain's EU opt-outs and would thus have to join the euro. 
So Ms Sturgeon has a two-track strategy: try to get Scotland a deal with the EU to secure the free movement of goods and people, and at the same time prepare for another independence referendum which, she says, is now ""highly likely"". She is doing this with her customary political skill, in stark contrast to the floundering of party leaders in Westminster. She has reached out to Fabian Picardo, the chief minister of Gibraltar, a British dependency on Spain's southern tip, where 96% voted to Remain, and Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, another pro-EU stronghold. Yet Spain and France have made clear that they oppose the EU negotiating with Scotland. ""If the UK leaves, Scotland leaves,"" said Mariano Rajoy, the prime minister of Spain, who has no desire to embolden Catalan separatists at home. 
Much will depend on the kind of deal that Britain does with the EU. Under a Norwegian-style arrangement, allowing the free movement of people, an independent Scotland could be a full member of the EU without needing to set up a hard border with England--something few Scots would want, since Scotland exports four times as much to England as it does to the EU. At the same time, however, such a deal might dampen calls for independence, since a Norwegian deal would not harm Britain's economy as badly as would total isolation from Europe. 
Twelve miles across the Irish Sea, Brexit is causing other problems. In Northern Ireland, 56% voted to remain in the EU. Most of the support came from Nationalists, largely because EU membership strengthens the north's links with Ireland. 
Following the result Sinn Fein, the main nationalist party, immediately called for a referendum on Northern Ireland's reunification with the south, a move that was ruled out by London and Dublin. Yet Brexit presents many other problems. If Britain exits the EU and ends the free movement of people, the hard border between north and south could come back. The psychological and practical impact of reinstituting checkpoints would be great on both sides. And the region would lose not just cross-border trade and EU farm payments but billions of pounds of other EU grants that have helped build a foundation for peace. 
The Good Friday Agreement, the 1998 deal in which Northern Ireland's peace process was underpinned by the EU, was predicated on free movement between north and south, part of a compromise that persuaded those on both sides to put down their weapons. The moment that Britain leaves the EU it will be in breach of that agreement, which sets out how the governments in Westminster and Dublin are to co-operate in matters pertaining to Northern Ireland. It is ""inconceivable"" that Sinn Fein, the main nationalist party, would not make representations to the UN, says Jonathan Tonge of the University of Liverpool. 
The power-sharing Northern Ireland Assembly, which is still in reasonable shape despite years of crises, must now be protected. It will face many challenges in any post-Brexit world because of the possibility of new Anglo-Irish tensions, border-security issues and threats to the economy. Northern Ireland is facing its most delicate political moment in years. It will require the full attention of the new British prime minister--whose attention, of course, will be entirely elsewhere.",230,Spain,A30-57,,False,,0,True

THE idea of re-running a vote when the first result is unsatisfactory has been getting a bad press recently. But Spain's second general election in six months, on June 26th, showed that if the goal is to break a political deadlock, do-overs can be useful. The big winners were Mariano Rajoy, the prime minister, and his centre-right People's Party (PP). Though they failed to get an absolute majority, they took 33% of the vote, up from 29% in the December election, which was so splintered that no party could form a government. Now, with 137 seats in the 350-member Cortes (parliament), Mr Rajoy is set to remain prime minister, albeit at the head of a coalition or minority administration. 
The election's big surprise was that Podemos, a new far-left party dedicated to reversing austerity and defenestrating the traditional political class, stalled. Contrary to all poll forecasts, it failed to overtake the more moderate Socialist Party to become the largest force on the left. Podemos had merged with the old Communists of the United Left party for this election, but the merged force won 1m fewer votes than its constituent parts did last time. 
The long faces of Podemos's young leaders as the results came in were eloquent. The Socialists did poorly compared to the past, winning 22.7% of the vote and 85 seats (down five). But it felt like a victory for Pedro Sanchez, the party's leader, who almost certainly did enough to keep his job. Ciudadanos, a new liberal party which won 32 seats (down eight), paid the price for having tried to form a government with Mr Sanchez after the December election. Some of the former PP voters who had supported it switched back. 
Mr Rajoy became prime minister in 2011 with Spain deep in recession. He has set it on the path to economic recovery, cleaning up the banks and reforming the labour market. Budget cuts and corruption scandals hurt the PP, but it has proved resilient. Outwardly stolid and unimaginative, Mr Rajoy is a shrewd strategist who has repeatedly defied rivals and expectations. 
The prime minister wants the Socialists to join him in a German-style ""grand coalition"". Socialist leaders have rejected that. The left and right have never worked together in Spain, and the Socialists fear leaving Podemos to monopolise the fruits of opposition. A pact with Ciudadanos and moderate regional parties would put Mr Rajoy within one seat of a majority. But Albert Rivera of Ciudadanos would have to drop his demand for Mr Rajoy to resign. 
Weeks of talks among the party leaders lie ahead. Mr Rajoy can expect at least the abstention of Ciudadanos, and perhaps of the Socialists, to let him form a minority government. Nobody wants a third election. There will be a government by early August, Mr Rajoy said. But it may not be strong enough to push through the reforms--of regional government and the judiciary, for example--that Spain needs. 
Yet Mr Rajoy has reason to be cheerful. ""Spain has moved to the right,"" says Pablo Simon, a political scientist at Carlos III University in Madrid. One reason, he says, is that whereas in December voters were preoccupied by the PP's corruption scandals, this time the run-up to the vote was dominated by the failure of the left to reach an agreement to govern. 
The turbulence prompted by Britain's decision to leave the European Union seems to have influenced the vote. Spain's stockmarket fell by 12.4% on June 24th. Some who had been prepared to back Podemos seem to have stayed at home, while others switched to the Socialists. Nationalist adventurism in Britain thus deterred left-wing adventurism in Spain. As a result, the country's traditional political class has been given a new lease on life.","Another centre - right government , but a weaker one

BACK in June, after Spain's second indecisive election in six months, many people expected Mariano Rajoy (pictured), the prime minister, to form a new government quickly. Although his conservative People's Party (PP) did not win a majority, it remained the largest party, with 137 of the 350 seats in parliament, and was the only one to increase its share of the vote. But summer has come and gone and Spain's political stalemate is no closer to ending. 
In two parliamentary votes, on August 30th and September 2nd, Mr Rajoy fell short of securing a mandate, with 170 votes in favour but 180 against. These votes started the clock for a third election, once seen as unthinkable. If no one can secure a majority by the end of October, parliament will be dissolved and Spaniards will face a Christmas election. 
For this, most commentators put the blame squarely on Pedro Sanchez, the leader of the opposition Socialists. His 85 deputies hold the balance of power. But he refuses to allow enough of them to abstain to give Mr Rajoy his mandate. He accuses Mr Rajoy and the PP of betraying Spaniards' trust and of burdening the country with austerity and corruption. 
Mr Rajoy argues that in 2011-15 his government took the tough measures required to return Spain's economy to growth. Year-on-year GDP growth was 3.1% in the second quarter; for the European Union as a whole it was just 1.8%. Last month Mr Rajoy struck an accord with Ciudadanos, a new liberal party, to crack down further on corruption, reform the judiciary and restore social spending. 
So what now? The PP has brushed off suggestions that Mr Rajoy might step down in favour of another of its leaders. The pressure will remain firmly on Mr Sanchez to bend. He hinted that he might seek to form a government himself, with Podemos, a new far-left party. But he failed to do that after the election in December, and the numbers now do not add up. 
The party leaders are still struggling to adapt to a new political world, in which a two-party system has given way to a fragmented parliament, while Catalan and some Basque nationalists are set on independence rather than deals in Madrid. The Socialists are split. Several of the party's regional leaders support abstention; others favour continued opposition. Mr Sanchez's calculation seems to be that the Socialists would gain in a third election at the expense of Podemos, which may have peaked. Several corruption trials involving former PP officials are due to start in the autumn, which may hurt Mr Rajoy. 
This is a risky course for the Socialists. Mr Rajoy rightly charges that Mr Sanchez's blocking of a government ""carries a steep bill which all Spaniards will have to pay"". Spain has already marginalised itself from the EU's discussions about its post-Brexit future. Without a government, it will be unable to approve a budget for 2017 or meet promises to the EU to cut its fiscal deficit from 5.1% of GDP in 2015 to 3.1% in 2017. 
Some Socialists are muttering about forcing Mr Sanchez to shift his stance or go. They have the increasingly shrill support of El Pais, a newspaper that generally backs the party. The pressure will mount if the Socialists do poorly in regional elections in the Basque Country and Galicia on September 25th. That might induce them to let Mr Rajoy form a government before the late-October deadline. But the chance of a third election is rising steadily.

IF ANY political party can claim to have invented modern Spain, it is the Socialists. They have ruled for 21 of the 39 years of Spain's restored democracy. Under Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), to give it its full name, took the country into the EU and NATO and modernised its economy. And under Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero it modernised cultural attitudes, loosening restrictions on abortion and approving gay rights. 
Now the PSOE threatens to tear itself apart. Amid extraordinary scenes at its headquarters in the placid Madrid barrio of Arguelles, the party's general secretary, Pedro Sanchez (pictured), clung to his post for three days after more than half his executive resigned. Following a 12-hour meeting of the party's nearly 300-strong federal committee on October 1st, which featured shouts, tears and what looked like an attempt to rig a secret ballot, Mr Sanchez resigned, defeated by 132 votes to 107. He has been replaced by a caretaker committee. 
One cause of this internal warfare was the party's string of electoral defeats. It faces new rivals, in Podemos on the far-left and in Ciudadanos, a centrist liberal party. After four years of an unpopular conservative government under Mariano Rajoy, in an election last December Mr Sanchez still lost almost half the PSOE's seats compared with its recent peak of 2008. It did no better at a second election in June. 
Spain's fragmented parliament left the the Socialists with a uniquely uncomfortable dilemma. They could try to form a government with Podemos and Catalan separatists, which would be repudiated by their more moderate voters, or abstain to let Mr Rajoy govern, even though they are infuriated by his austerity measures and instances of corruption in his People's Party (PP). Worried about letting Podemos claim the mantle of opposition, Mr Sanchez took the first course. ""No means no,"" he said of his refusal to end the deadlock. 
That stance would have meant a third election in December, at which the Socialists were likely to lose more ground. This alarmed most of the PSOE's powerful regional barons and all of its previous leaders. After the party was trounced in regional elections in Galicia and the Basque country on September 25th, they acted. 
Mr Rajoy will probably have a second go at winning a parliamentary mandate later this month. At least some Socialists are likely to abstain. After ten months without a government, Spain would have one at last, in the form of a minority PP administration backed by Ciudadanos. 
This buys time for PSOE to renew itself. Mr Sanchez is a symptom rather than the cause of PSOE's difficulties. As the first Socialist leader chosen in a primary of the membership, he claimed the backing of the grass-roots, ignoring the regional barons. ""The PSOE does not just belong to its activists, but also to the citizens who voted for it,"" replied Susana Diaz, the leader of the regional government in Andalusia and Mr Sanchez's most powerful foe. The battle for the leadership may be rejoined at a party congress next year. 
The party is divided geographically. In eastern Spain it has cut deals with Podemos and nationalist parties. In the poorer south it practises clientelism. Spain's two main parties wield enormous powers of patronage. ""They are machines which have become disconnected from the citizens,"" says Jose Maria de Areilza, a professor of constitutional law. Both Mr Sanchez and Ms Diaz have made their careers entirely within the party. 
The underlying problem is that the PSOE's electoral base has shrunk to a core, mainly of the rural working class. It has lost the urban middle class: in most cities it came no better than third at the last election, points out Ignacio Urquizu, a Socialist deputy, writing in El Pais, a newspaper. 
The PSOE's problems are those of all European social-democratic parties, writ large. It has lost more ground than any of the others apart from Greece's PASOK, according to Kiko Llaneras, a political analyst. The party paid a price for being in office when the financial crisis broke in 2008. Any Socialist leader would have found it hard to respond to the rise of Podemos, which took 21% of the vote at the last two elections by voicing young Spaniards' rage at a self-serving political establishment. 
All is not lost for the PSOE. The 22% vote share it won in June is relatively high. And Podemos has its own problems as it tries to go beyond a protest movement. It is visibly split three ways between Pablo Iglesias, its Leninist leader; Inigo Errejon, his more moderate deputy; and its big-city mayors, who take little notice of either. As for Mr Rajoy, he will probably be rewarded for his strategic patience. But to get much done, he may need the votes of the Socialists in parliament. That gives the PSOE a chance to take the initiative again, if only it can find leaders imaginative enough to seize it.

EVEN Pablo Iglesias, the leader of the leftist Podemos party, this week recognised that one of the political qualities of Mariano Rajoy, Spain's conservative prime minister, is patience. Having endured seven years as opposition leader, Mr Rajoy won power in a landslide in 2011 and had to pick up the pieces of his country's housing bust. His fiscal curbs and a raft of financial and labour-market reforms speeded up a vigorous economic recovery, but were unpopular. Together with corruption scandals in local government, that cost Mr Rajoy his majority in an election last December. His People's Party (PP) remained the largest party, but in a newly fragmented parliament. 
Since then, Spain and Mr Rajoy, reduced to an impotent caretaker, have waited for more than 300 days. No party has been able to assemble a parliamentary majority. A second election in June boosted the PP (from 123 seats in December to 137 out of 350) but failed to break the deadlock. Then after a wrenching internal struggle and faced with a third election at which they would probably lose more seats to the PP, the opposition Socialists at last agreed to abstain. That should allow Mr Rajoy's new government to be approved in a parliamentary vote expected on October 29th. 
How much the prime minister can achieve with his powers restored is unclear. Mr Rajoy has the support of Ciudadanos, a new liberal party with 32 seats. To approve a budget, and the further belt-tightening required to meet the targets agreed with the European Commission for the fiscal deficit (to 3.1% of GDP next year, from a target of 4.6% this year), the prime minister will have to try and scrape up votes from Basque nationalists or rely on further Socialist abstentions. 
This is new territory for a Spanish government. The PP has the fewest seats of any ruling party since democracy was restored in the 1970s. Accustomed to steamrollering laws through, Mr Rajoy acknowledged that he will now have ""to earn governability...day by day"". He has some cards: he can threaten to call a fresh election, and can only be overthrown if the opposition unites around an alternative. 
Apart from the economy, the most pressing issue facing the new government is Catalonia. Its regional government plans to hold a referendum on independence next September. Mr Rajoy, backed by Ciudadanos, refuses even to talk about that. Catalans could still be dissuaded if offered more autonomy, as the Socialists propose. But confrontation looks likely. 
A minority government will test the opposition, too. The Socialists fear ceding to Podemos the mantle of opposition to Mr Rajoy. Having flirted with a post-modern politics of the centre, Mr Iglesias has retreated towards the hard left. 
Many Spaniards dislike Mr Rajoy, but they want a government and the signs are that they want their politicians to co-operate. Last year the rise of Podemos and Ciudadanos prompted many commentators to write the obituary of the two traditional parties. In the new world of minority government, Mr Rajoy and the Socialists will still be the key players. And patience may continue to gain its reward.

That should allow Mariano Rajoy's new government to be approved in a parliamentary vote expected on October 29th . 
 How much Mariano Rajoy can achieve with Mariano Rajoy's powers restored is unclear . Mariano Rajoy has the support of Ciudadanos , a new liberal party with 32 seats . To approve a budget , and the further belt - tightening required to meet the targets agreed with the European Commission for the fiscal deficit ( to 3.1 % of GDP next year , from a target of 4.6 % this year ) , Mariano Rajoy will have to try and scrape up votes from Basque nationalists or rely on further Socialist abstentions . 
 This is new territory for a Spanish government . The PP has the fewest seats of any ruling party since democracy was restored in the 1970s . Accustomed to steamrollering laws through , Mariano Rajoy acknowledged that Mariano Rajoy will now have "" to earn governability ... day by day "" . Mariano Rajoy has some cards : Mariano Rajoy can threaten to call a fresh election , and can only be overthrown if the opposition unites around an alternative . 
 Apart from the economy , the most pressing issue facing the new government is Catalonia . Its regional government plans to hold a referendum on independence next September . Mariano Rajoy , refuses even to talk about that . Catalans could still be dissuaded if offered more autonomy , as the Socialists propose . But confrontation looks likely . 
 A minority government will test the opposition , too . The Socialists fear ceding to Podemos the mantle of opposition to Mariano Rajoy . Having flirted with a post - modern politics of the centre , Mr Iglesias has retreated towards the hard left . 
 Many Spaniards dislike Mariano Rajoy , but they want a government and the signs are that they want their politicians to co - operate . Last year the rise of Podemos and Ciudadanos prompted many commentators to write the obituary of the two traditional parties . In the new world of minority government , Mariano Rajoy and the Socialists will still be the key players . And patience may continue to gain its reward .

""AS BAD as having no government is having a government that can't govern,"" the Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, told parliament in October, just before the vote that gave him a mandate to form a new administration. Spain had grown rather used to the former situation: it spent ten months in a state of limbo, as two elections delivered parliaments so fragmented that no party could broker a coalition. It is a step forward that Mr Rajoy has been able to form a minority government. But as he foresaw, governing is not going to be easy. 
The parliamentary arithmetic is unforgiving. Mr Rajoy's conservative People's Party (PP) has 137 of the 350 seats in the Cortes (parliament). It has the support of the 32 legislators of Ciudadanos, a liberal party. To pass laws, it must either scrape together seven further votes from Basque nationalists and Canarian regionalists (who want more autonomy for the Canary Islands), or hope the opposition Socialists abstain. 
The first big test is next year's budget. The government faces contrasting pressures. It has promised the European Commission that it will cut the fiscal deficit from 4.6% this year to 3.1% in 2017. But the PP agreed with Ciudadanos to increase spending on job training and reverse some cuts. It also faces pressure from cash-strapped (and often spendthrift) regional governments. The answer, in the draft budget approved by the cabinet, has been to close loopholes in corporate tax, which officials hope will provide most of the extra EUR 4.8bn ($5.1bn) in needed revenue in 2017. To win the acquiescence of the Socialists, the government set a slightly less strict deficit target for the regions and approved a rise in the monthly minimum wage from EUR 655 to EUR 708, the biggest in 30 years. 
The underlying question is whether such a weak government can take the measures needed to sustain the country's economic recovery. Political uncertainty has already damaged investment, business and consumer confidence, and growth, says Rafael Domenech, an economist at BBVA, a bank. He expects a tighter fiscal policy, Brexit and further uncertainty to trim growth from 3% this year to 2.5% next. With Spain's public debt at 100% of GDP, he worries that the country will be hit by an increase in international interest rates before it has the deficit under control. 
Pablo Casado, a PP official, reels off a list of measures on the government's agenda, including laws to boost competitiveness and to make all levels of the state more efficient, as well as seeking cross-party pacts on education and the financing of regional governments. But he admits that the government will have a fight on its hands just to prevent malcontents from repealing its past reforms of the labour market and education. Already it has been forced by the Cortes to drop new school tests that were part of its educational reform of 2013. 
For Mr Rajoy, who enjoyed an absolute majority in 2011-15, the need to negotiate with opponents is a big change. But he is not under threat of eviction from the Moncloa, the prime-ministerial compound. To topple a government, the constitution requires a majority vote for an alternative one, something a divided opposition is unlikely to muster. And many opposition motions will be deflected into the long grass of parliamentary subcommittees. 
Some in Madrid think the prime minister will be happy to trundle on like this through the remainder of this parliament's term. ""He is not a great reformist,"" says Lorenzo Bernaldo de Quiros of Freemarket, a consultancy. ""He is a conservative in the strict sense of the word, who favours the status quo."" Others think Mr Rajoy will seize the right moment in the next year or two to call a fresh election at which he can hope to come closer to a majority. Either way, the prime minister's position is less weak than it looks. Indeed, compared to most countries in western Europe, Spain is starting to look like an island of relative political stability.","Mariano Rajoy's quest for governability in a fractured parliament

IF YOU look up from the bustle of the winter tourists thronging the streets of Barcelona, you will see some balconies draped with the estelada, a blend of the Catalan and Cuban flags that has become the banner of those who want their land to become independent. There are fewer than there once were, but still enough to inspire the Catalan regional government's pledge to hold a binding referendum on independence in 2017. Since the Spanish government refuses to contemplate such a vote, a confrontation seems inevitable. 
Indeed, it has already begun. Some 300 Catalan officials face court cases for flouting the law, in acts ranging from a previous unilateral effort in 2014 to organise an independence vote to petty protests, such as flying the estelada from town halls. Carles Puigdemont, the president of the Generalitat (the Catalan government), promises to push through ""laws of disconnection"" this summer, such as one setting up its own tax agency, prior to holding a referendum, probably in September. His pro-independence coalition has a majority in the Catalan parliament. On December 14th Spain's Constitutional Tribunal warned the Generalitat that the referendum would be illegal. Spain could face unprecedented defiance of its democratic constitution. 
How has it come to this? Spain's constitution of 1978 gave Catalonia, one of the country's most prosperous regions, more self-government than almost any other part of Europe. The Generalitat controls not just schools and hospitals but police and prisons. It has made Catalan the main language of teaching. Under Jordi Pujol, the skilful moderate nationalist cacique (political boss) who headed the Generalitat from 1980 to 2003, Catalonia was content with this settlement, using its votes in the Madrid parliament to extract increments to it powers and revenues. 
Two things upset matters. The first was when the Constitutional Tribunal in 2010 watered down a new autonomy statute, which recognised Catalonia's sense of nationhood and granted additional legal powers to the Generalitat. It had been approved by referendum in Catalonia and by the Spanish parliament. The second factor was the economic crisis after the bursting of Spain's property bubble in 2008. 
In 2012 demonstrators against austerity began to put the blame on Madrid, rather than Artur Mas, Mr Pujol's heir. Support for independence surged from less than 25% to more than 45%. ""Society moved towards more radical positions,"" thinks Joan Culla, a historian. Others see this as at least in part induced by the Generalitat, with its money and powerful communications machine. It allowed the nationalists to keep power, despite budget cuts and revelations that for decades they had taken rake-offs on public contracts. 
Catalan society remains split. ""There aren't the numbers to advance [to independence] but there's enough to make a lot of noise,"" says Jordi Alberich of the Cercle d'Economia, a business group. 
Best of enemies 
This stand-off has been politically profitable not just for the Catalan nationalists but also for Mariano Rajoy, Spain's prime minister, and his conservative People's Party. His staunch defence of his country's territorial unity is popular in most places outside Catalonia. For years Mr Rajoy did nothing to respond to Catalan grievances, some of which are justified. Catalonia pays more into the central kitty than it gets back, but its transport systems have been neglected while Madrid has spiffy metro lines and a surfeit of motorways. 
Yet weariness with the deadlock has taken hold, in both Barcelona and Madrid. Last month Mr Rajoy put his deputy, Soraya Saenz de Santamaria, in charge of the Catalan question. She is putting feelers out to the Generalitat. Mr Puigdemont has published a list of 46 points to negotiate. It starts with the ""binding referendum"". 
It is not hard to divine the contours of a deal. Mr Rajoy could offer concessions on financing and infrastructure. More controversially, he could propose recognising the Catalan language or that Catalonia is a nation within Spain. 
The toughest issue is the referendum. This is no moment to contemplate any sort of plebiscite with equanimity. Catalan nationalists claim to be exemplary pro-Europeans. But there are many echoes of Brexit in Catalonia. Instead of Brussels, it is Madrid the nationalists accuse of stealing Catalans' money. They argue that independence would be quick and easy. ""The great growth in support for independence from 2012 was the first manifestation of populism in Spain,"" says Javier Cercas, a writer who lives in Barcelona. 
Mr Puigdemont insists that blocking the referendum ""would be bad news for democracy"". He is prepared to negotiate its timing. But he adds: ""We won't easily renounce it. I think we've earned the right to be heard."" Some in Barcelona believe the Generalitat's leaders are searching for a dignified way to back down. Mr Puigdemont talks also of ""constituent"" elections to found a new state. But his party, clouded by corruption, may suffer. The Catalan variant of Spain's left-wing Podemos, which already runs Barcelona's city government and which is forming a new, broader, party, is likely to gain ground. It wants Catalonia to form part of a ""plurinational"" Spain, a cleverly vague formula. 
""Is being part of Spain a problem in the daily life of Catalans?"" asks Ines Arrimadas of Ciudadanos, an anti-nationalist party that leads the opposition in the Catalan parliament. ""For us the problems of Catalonia are unemployment, poverty and corruption."" The longer the deadlock lasts, the harder Mr Puigdemont may find it to persuade Catalans otherwise.

A LONG dictatorship ended in a negotiated transition to democracy. The centre-left took office with a moderate programme, reassured the right by pursuing pro-market economic policies, added better social provision and reconnected the country to the world.

Then the centre-left returned, this time as a new generation critical of the compromises of the transition. It veered further left but faced economic difficulties. 
Spain? Yes. But Chile, too. Since the dictatorships of Generals Franco and Pinochet, politics in the two countries has run along uncannily parallel tracks, with Chile lagging Spain by ten to 15 years. In Spain, Felipe Gonzalez, the Socialist prime minister in 1982-96, laid the foundations of democracy, combining liberal economic reforms with a new welfare state and leading the country into Europe. When Jose Maria Aznar of the conservative People's Party (PP) took over, he continued many of Mr Gonzalez's policies. Then the Socialists returned under Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, who confronted the right through progressive social reforms (such as abortion and gay marriage) and by approving a Law of Historical Memory, an implicit criticism of the amnesty agreed during the transition. 
Spain's transition served as an example for democrats in Chile, where the centre-left Concertacion coalition governed in the mould of Mr Gonzalez from 1990 onwards (though with a more timid increase in public spending and welfare provision). In 2010, with Pinochet dead and discredited by his indictment for human-rights abuses by a Spanish judge, Sebastian Pinera, a billionaire businessman, won power for the centre-right. Like Mr Aznar, he followed policies similar to his predecessor's. Then in 2014 Michelle Bachelet, who in her first term governed for the Concertacion as a moderate, came back determined, like Mr Zapatero, to shake up the transition settlement, though in a different way. She has tried to push through reforms of tax, education, labour, pensions and the electoral system, as well as a new constitution, with the aim of replacing ""the model"" bequeathed by the dictatorship. One of her allies called this deploying a ""retroexcavadora"" (backhoe loader) against this legacy. 
In Spain, Mr Zapatero's government was overwhelmed by the euro crisis, which spawned Podemos, a new far-left party. The crisis, and then the left's divisions, have delivered successive election victories for Mariano Rajoy and the PP. Chile has not suffered anything as dramatic. But the economy has grown sluggishly since 2014, partly because of the uncertainty caused by Ms Bachelet's reforms, many of which have been clumsily handled. 
Does the Chilean centre-left, now called the New Majority, face a Spanish future of division and defeat? The main credential of its likely candidate in a presidential election in November, Alejandro Guillier, is his past as a television anchorman. Although a senator since 2014, he comes over as a new face who is not part of a political class that, as in Spain, has been discredited by scandals. His ideas seem vague: he has both presented himself as a moderate and called for ""rupture"" with the present. Some on the centre-left call him a populist. Above all, he seems to stand for a continuation of Ms Bachelet's model-breaking approach. 
That may not help him. She is unpopular. Mr Guillier may also face rivals within the New Majority: the Christian Democrats may run their own candidate. A stronger far-left, akin to Podemos, has emerged from student protests in 2011. 
With seven months to go, the election is still open, but it looks like Mr Pinera's to lose. That seems to be the view of Ricardo Lagos, the most successful of the Concertacion presidents. At the age of 79, he sought the support of the Socialist Party only to be snubbed in favour of Mr Guillier. In announcing his withdrawal this month he warned of the ""strategic dispersion"" of progressive forces"" and a ""conservative...restoration that could last many years"".

ON THE morning of May 7th about 300 members of Spain's Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) gathered in a conference hall on the site of Zaragoza's international exhibition of 2008, across the river Ebro from the city centre. The bleak expo park with its abandoned cable car has seen better days. So has the PSOE. The party faithful were gathered to listen to Susana Diaz (pictured), the narrow favourite in a primary to elect the Socialists' leader on May 21st. Her message, delivered in an Andalucian accent and the crescendos of an old-fashioned tub-thumper, was that she alone could unite her party ""so that the PSOE becomes an alternative government again"". 
That will be no small task. After governing Spain for 22 of the 29 years to 2011, the Socialists have lost the past three general elections. Unlucky enough to find themselves in power, under Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, when Spain's housing and credit bubble burst in 2008, they were obliged to take unpopular measures. Since then, the PSOE has lost almost half its voters to the upstarts of Podemos, a far-left party formed out of the anti-austerity protest movement known as the indignados. 
The Socialists now face a bitter internal feud. Its outcome will not just affect the battle for supremacy on the Spanish left; it may determine whether or not the minority government of Mariano Rajoy and his conservative People's Party (PP) will last. 
Ms Diaz is only 42, yet as the president of the regional government in Andalucia, the Socialists' last great bastion, she represents the party establishment and its traditional working-class base (her father is a plumber). She was once expected to win easily: she has the backing of nearly all the party's grandees. Her chief opponent is the PSOE's previous leader, Pedro Sanchez, who was ousted in October. He has mounted a strong bid to reclaim his job by appealing to rank-and-file members. 
Party of crisis 
The puzzle for the Socialists is how to regenerate themselves in the shadow of Podemos. The new radical party has won over middle-class young people in the big cities, whose expectations of ease and prosperity were dashed by the financial crisis. Apart from its bitterness at Mr Zapatero's economic squeeze, this generation thinks the PSOE has become too comfortable with power. ""The Spanish left is split in two sociologically and ideologically,"" says Manuel Arias Maldonado, a political scientist at the University of Malaga. 
""Social democracy in the 21st century means a very competitive economy and very redistributive public spending,"" says Ignacio Urquizu, a PSOE deputy who supports Ms Diaz. Some in Podemos, by contrast, want an indiscriminate spending binge and a European version of the Kirchners' Argentina. Nevertheless, many people in both parties are struggling to define a new social contract for a globalised economy. More than policy, what differentiates them is the PSOE's sense of responsibility towards Spain's restored democracy and Podemos's populist contempt for it. 
""The rational thing would be an agreement between the two forces,"" notes Xavier Domenech, who leads the Catalan affiliate of Podemos. But ""underlying tensions"" prevent this, he adds. It may take several years of political trench warfare to determine which is the senior partner. Demography helps Podemos: the audience for Ms Diaz in Zaragoza was mainly middle-aged or older. ""I think we are in a new world,"" says Mr Domenech. ""The economic crisis has put in question institutions that were very worn-out,"" including the PSOE. 
The insurgents argue that a more radical left can win disillusioned voters over, but they have little evidence. At the last election, in June 2016, Pablo Iglesias, Podemos's leader, allied his party with the United Left, the former Communist Party. The alliance secured 1.1m fewer votes than its constituent parts had managed in the election the previous December, and failed to overtake the PSOE. At a party congress in February, Mr Iglesias sidelined his more moderate deputy, Inigo Errejon. He seems determined to retreat to the hard left and the politics of permanent protest. 
Meanwhile, Spain's economy has been recovering vigorously (see chart). Though Spaniards are still worried about unemployment and corruption, as the crisis recedes fewer are indignados. ""I think Podemos is a party of the crisis, rather than an expression of the crises of parties,"" says Mr Arias. That should offer an opportunity to the Socialists--if they can recover from their leadership battle. 
Mr Sanchez claims to be further left than Ms Diaz. In his campaign he has gestured both to Catalan nationalism (Spain should recognise that it is a ""plurinational"" country, he says) and to Podemos (pledging to collaborate with other ""progressive forces""). Yet the differences between the two ""are not really ideological"", according to a former secretary-general of the party. Indeed, Ms Diaz's support was decisive in electing Mr Sanchez as the party leader in 2014, running as an economic liberal. 
Rather, the battle is over power and over the party's future identity. In the manner of Jeremy Corbyn, the hard-left leader of Britain's Labour Party, Mr Sanchez promises to give power over all decisions to the members, while Ms Diaz defends the PSOE's traditional system of letting elected leaders choose its policies. Mr Sanchez has certainly been the more intransigent of the two: after leading the Socialists to electoral defeat in June 2016, he insisted on opposing Mr Rajoy's investiture as prime minister. Since that would have triggered a third election in a year, at which the Socialists seemed certain to lose further ground, Ms Diaz and other party barons ousted Mr Sanchez and allowed Mr Rajoy to form a minority government. 
Mr Sanchez has campaigned by attacking this decision, saying it makes the PSOE complicit in the PP's corruption scandals. Ms Diaz replies that it was his leadership that reduced the party to just 85 of the 350 seats in the Cortes (parliament). ""Pedro, your problem is you,"" she said this week. 
Spain's Socialists are not the only European social-democratic party that is struggling to put a shine back on a tarnished brand. Their counterparts in France and the Netherlands are doing even worse. ""The main task for the PSOE is to accept that it's in a very difficult situation and act with patience,"" says Mr Arias. ""It needs a young leader who can enthuse the rank-and-file and create a [post-crisis] ideology."" Neither of the main contenders in the primary fits that bill. If Mr Sanchez wins, Mr Rajoy may engineer a fresh election to press his advantage. Even if Ms Diaz triumphs, she faces a battle to put the party back together again. Either way, as elsewhere in Europe, the clear winner from the left's divisions and introspection is the centre-right.","The Socialists , threatened by Podemos , are close to coming apart 
 ON THE morning of May 7th about 300 members of Spain 's Socialist Workers ' Party ( PSOE ) gathered in a conference hall on the site of Zaragoza 's international exhibition of 2008 , across the river Ebro from the city centre . The bleak expo park with its abandoned cable car has seen better days . So has the PSOE . The party faithful were gathered to listen to Susana Diaz ( pictured ) , the narrow favourite in a primary to elect the Socialists ' leader on May 21st . Her message , delivered in an Andalucian accent and the crescendos of an old - fashioned tub - thumper , was that she alone could unite her party "" so that the PSOE becomes an alternative government again "" . 
 That will be no small task . After governing Spain for 22 of the 29 years to 2011 , the Socialists have lost the past three general elections . Unlucky enough to find themselves in power , under Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero , when Spain 's housing and credit bubble burst in 2008 , they were obliged to take unpopular measures . Since then , the PSOE has lost almost half its voters to the upstarts of Podemos , a far - left party formed out of the anti - austerity protest movement known as the indignados . 
 The Socialists now face a bitter internal feud . Its outcome will not just affect the battle for supremacy on the Spanish left ; it may determine whether or not the minority government of Mariano Rajoy and Mariano Rajoy's conservative People 's Party ( PP ) will last . 
 Ms Diaz is only 42 , yet as the president of the regional government in Andalucia , the Socialists ' last great bastion , she represents the party establishment and its traditional working - class base ( her father is a plumber ) . She was once expected to win easily : she has the backing of nearly all the party 's grandees . Her chief opponent is the PSOE 's previous leader , Pedro Sanchez , who was ousted in October . He has mounted a strong bid to reclaim his job by appealing to rank - and - file members . 
 Party of crisis 
 The puzzle for the Socialists is how to regenerate themselves in the shadow of Podemos . The new radical party has won over middle - class young people in the big cities , whose expectations of ease and prosperity were dashed by the financial crisis . Apart from its bitterness at Mr Zapatero 's economic squeeze , this generation thinks the PSOE has become too comfortable with power . "" The Spanish left is split in two sociologically and ideologically , "" says Manuel Arias Maldonado , a political scientist at the University of Malaga . 
 "" Social democracy in the 21st century means a very competitive economy and very redistributive public spending , "" says Ignacio Urquizu , a PSOE deputy who supports Ms Diaz .

ON A back road in the Llobregat valley west of Barcelona, amid a jumble of old wine-growing villages and modern factories, stands a research centre owned by Gestamp, a Spanish firm that in just two decades has become one of the world's leading makers of car body-parts, doors and bonnets. With 100 plants in 21 countries and sales last year of EUR 7.5bn ($8.4bn), Gestamp is a specialist in hot stamping. This process makes parts six times more resistant than if they are cold-stamped, allowing cars to be safer, lighter and less polluting. What was once mere metal-bashing has become a high-tech operation. 
Gestamp invests 3.8% of its sales in research and development, and holds more than 900 patents. ""We are working on cars that will only go into production in five or six years' time,"" says Juan Jose Matarranz, one of the 58 scientists and engineers at the research centre. Alongside, in a factory equipped with robots, laser-cutters and high-temperature forges, Gestamp churns out parts for shipment to Ford and Audi in the United States as well as for SEAT's large plant down the road at Martorell. 
Globalised and innovative, Gestamp is a symbol of the transformation of Spain's economy. In 2012 the country was a vortex which threatened to suck down the euro. The conservative government of Mariano Rajoy had to go cap in hand to Brussels for a EUR 100bn bail-out for Spain's broken savings banks. A housing bust and the financial crunch plunged the country into a five-year slump, from 2009 to 2013. 
Now Spain is heading for its third consecutive year of economic growth of just over 3%, the fastest of any large economy in the euro area (see chart 1). It is creating about 500,000 jobs a year. According to Luis de Guindos, the economy minister, last month the country's GDP surpassed its pre-crisis peak. Much of the credit for this recovery goes to structural reforms the government pushed through in 2012. 
Europe's economy as a whole is picking up, too. But apart from Spain, the European Union's Mediterranean countries remain its weakest links. In Italy and Greece growth has been disappointing. Italy's labour reforms have been tentative, and it is only now tackling its banks' bad debts. Greece is being dragged into reform by its EU creditors, but has howled all the way. Spain tackled these issues earlier and more decisively. Its efforts are bearing fruit. 
Once more, but with exports 
Spain's renewed growth has sounder foundations than in the past. In the early years of this century the economy was powered by construction, which accounted for up to a fifth of GDP, and by foreign loans. This time the growth is led by exports, which have reached 33% of GDP (up from 23% in 2009). ""We've recovered competitiveness,"" says Mr de Guindos. 
Spain is now continental Europe's second-biggest car producer and exporter after Germany. Tourism is booming, too. The country has diversified its exports into chemicals, pharmaceuticals, machinery and professional services. More than 150,000 Spanish companies export, half as many again as in 2007, according to Jesus Sainz of the Circulo de Empresarios, a think-tank. A digital startup economy is sprouting in Madrid and Barcelona, and growth is spreading from exports to the domestic economy. ""It was a dispirited country. That's changed a lot,"" says Inigo Mendez de Vigo, the education minister. 
Good fortune, in the form of low oil prices and interest rates, has played a part. The export boom owes something to the recent pickup in world trade and the cheapness of the euro. But these have helped all euro-zone countries; they do not explain the fact that Spain is gaining global market share, notes Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo, a director of BBVA, a bank. 
Rather, much of Spain's success is down to its structural reforms. In an election in November 2011, Mr Rajoy won an absolute majority, displacing the hapless Socialist government of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. The new team took three fundamental measures: reforming the labour market, cleaning up the financial system and curbing a burgeoning fiscal deficit. 
The labour reform brought flexibility to a rigid system. It cut severance pay from 45 days to 33 days per year worked; in the past companies sometimes closed because they could not afford to lay off workers. More importantly, Spain devolved wage bargaining to firm level, helping to make companies competitive. 
Spanish banks still have more dud loans than their European peers, but credit is flowing again. This month euro-zone banking supervisors forced the shaky Banco Popular, the country's sixth-largest, into a takeover by Santander; that led bond yields for some smaller lenders to rise. But ""nobody is confusing Popular's situation with the system as a whole"", says Mr Gonzalez-Paramo. The debt of households and firms has fallen. Meanwhile, tax increases and spending cuts shrank the budget deficit from 10.6% in 2012 to 4.3% last year. 
To the rest of southern Europe, this looks rather good. Italy's GDP did not fall as far as Spain's in the crisis, and its budget deficit and unemployment rate never went as high. But neither has it experienced a strong recovery: growth is stuck at around 1% and unemployment, still over 11%, is barely declining. While Spain's labour costs fell, Italy's kept rising, so its export growth has been far weaker. Greece's labour costs have fallen, but it has scarcely any export industry to take advantage of them. And its grudging reforms and political bickering have deterred the investment that would be needed to create them. 
Make Talavera great again 
Spain may be an example to others, but its own recovery is far from complete. Public debt has surged to around 100% of GDP, and the government does not expect a primary fiscal surplus (ie, before interest payments) until next year. ""We have lost a decade, and our GDP today should have been at least 20% higher than it is,"" says Mr Guindos. ""That is the legacy of the bust."" Almost 230,000 companies perished, says Mr Sainz. Real average wages are about where they were a decade ago. Unemployment is still close to 3.5m (or 17%), though that is well down on the peak of 5m. Spain's once-stable two-party political system has been shaken, especially by the rise of Podemos, a far-left group which claimed 21% of the vote in an election last year. 
Talavera de la Reina, in the Tagus valley an hour and 40 minutes south-west of Madrid by train, was long known chiefly for its blue and yellow hand-painted pottery. It is now notorious for unemployment. Although the town's population has shrunk by 5,000 (to 85,000) since 2012, its jobless rate is still around 35%. 
On the wall of the bullring someone has spray-painted, in English, ""Make Talavera Great Again"". There is only the faintest hope of that. Its pottery has fallen out of fashion; nobody thinks its textile or construction jobs will come back in numbers. The exhibition centre, usually used for livestock fairs, hosted a two-day ""Job and Enterprise Fair"" earlier this month, but only about 100 jobs were on offer. ""Talavera needs to change its economic structure,"" says Joaquin Echeverria of the local chamber of commerce. 
That applies to the country as a whole. Most Spanish companies are small, family-owned businesses which do not innovate, export or grow. That is partly because they face regulatory barriers. If a firm has 50 workers it must create a union committee. If its sales exceed EUR 6m--a threshold unchanged for 20 years--it faces more onerous tax procedures. 
Some digital startups must cope with too little regulation rather than too much. Fintech companies need a regulator if they are to be trusted by customers and funders, says Martha Planas, who co-founded Digital Origin, an electronic microloan and payment service. ""If the government doesn't make the [digital] ecosystem happen, we will have to leave,"" she says. 
Officials reel off a list of other reforms undertaken since 2012. But many have foundered on bureaucratic resistance and amiguismo (cronyism). Companies face a thicket of regulations by regional governments. Public bodies like employment offices or universities are not evaluated for effectiveness. ""The main difference between Spain and others in Europe is its weakness in carrying out public policies,"" says Raymond Torres of Funcas, a think-tank. 
The 2012 reform did not give employers enough incentives to offer permanent contracts. ""Many of the new jobs are highly unstable, low-paid and temporary,"" notes Marcel Jansen, a labour economist at Fedea, a think-tank. And too little is being done to help the unemployed get back into work. During the boom, young Spanish men dropped out of school to work on construction sites. They have no other skills. Some 57% of the unemployed have been out of work for over a year, and a quarter for four years or more. ""Spain is not developing the policies and institutions needed to deal with this problem,"" Mr Jansen says. Training courses are patchy; employment offices offer almost no guidance. 
At the height of the boom, 32% of young Spaniards dropped out before completing secondary school. The rate fell to 19% in 2016, but is still the highest in the EU (bar Malta). Mr Mendez de Vigo, the education minister, says he wants to halve it by 2025. A parliamentary committee is discussing a pact to overhaul the education system. 
In an election in 2015 Mr Rajoy lost his majority. After almost a year of political limbo and a second election, he formed a minority government last November. With parliament split, he cannot unilaterally push through reforms. Compounding the problem, last month the opposition Socialists re-elected Pedro Sanchez, an uncompromising critic of Mr Rajoy and the labour reform, as their leader. 
""We can live for ten or 12 years from what we did in 2012, provided we don't make mistakes,"" says Mr de Guindos. Certainly Spain deserves much credit for the reforms it has undertaken, and its outlook is much sunnier. But if the global economy becomes less favourable, Spaniards may come to lament that Mr Rajoy did not tackle more of the country's problems when he had the chance.","Spain 's reforms are a lesson for Europe 's anxious south

THE production was as dramatic as any other the National Theatre in Barcelona has seen. There, on July 4th, the president of Catalonia's government, Carles Puigdemont, announced plans to hold a unilateral referendum on independence from Spain on October 1st. The draft law he unveiled says that, whatever the turnout, if those voting in favour outnumber those against, within 48 hours the Catalan parliament will declare independence. To Mr Puigdemont's supporters, this is a national epic. To Mariano Rajoy, Spain's conservative prime minister, it is ""authoritarian delirium"". He is determined that it should not take place. 
Mr Puigdemont's push follows five years of secessionist agitation in Catalonia, one of Spain's richest regions, whose 7.5m people are 16% of the country's total. Separatism was fuelled partly by the Constitutional Tribunal's rejection of parts of a new statute that would have granted the region more autonomy. But the main forces were nationalist politicians in Barcelona who blamed euro-crisis austerity on Madrid. In a regional election in 2015, parties campaigning for independence won, but only just: the ruling coalition got 48% of the vote but 53% of the seats in the parliament. 
Mr Puigdemont invokes ""the legitimate right to self-determination of a thousand-year-old nation"". National and international law is against him. Spain's constitution of 1978--approved by over 90% of Catalan voters in a referendum--granted the regions great autonomy. But it affirmed ""the indissoluble unity of the Spanish nation"". Only the Spanish parliament can change the constitution. Catalonia's own autonomy statute, which Mr Puigdemont's law would replace, can only be amended by a two-thirds majority of its parliament. And the Council of Europe, which Mr Puigdemont consulted, said in June that any referendum must be carried out ""in full compliance with the constitution"". 
Mr Rajoy insists that he must uphold the law. At Madrid's urging, the courts have fined and suspended from office the Catalan politicians who organised a previous, unofficial referendum in 2014 (in which just 2.3m people voted, a 37% turnout). This time the Catalan government plans to thwart legal action by rushing the referendum law through its parliament, by simple majority, in September. It claims the vote, unlike that of 2014, will be binding. 
Soraya Saenz de Santamaria, Spain's deputy prime minister, responded that ""24 hours will be enough"" for the state to strike down the referendum law once it is passed. In this, Mr Rajoy has the support of the opposition Socialists. Even Podemos, a far-left party, says that the referendum is not binding. The Catalan government has tried but failed to get international support. Spain's European partners see Catalonia's status as a strictly internal matter. 
With his threat of a declaration of independence, Mr Puigdemont's last throw seems to be to provoke an overreaction by Mr Rajoy and a popular rebellion in Catalonia. Article 155 of the constitution lets the government force regional officials to fulfil their legal obligations. Never invoked, it is portrayed in Barcelona as ""tanks in the streets"". Rather than Article 155, the government will probably use the courts to block the referendum less dramatically, by slapping lawsuits on those who sign or vote for unconstitutional measures. 
Opinion polls show that around 40-44% of Catalans support independence, depending on how the question is framed. That is not enough to make a revolution. The march to illegality is prompting strains in Barcelona. Mr Puigdemont this month sacked Jordi Baiget, a member of his government, for saying that a binding referendum ""probably"" won't happen. Mr Baiget said he was prepared to go to prison, but not to expose his family to fines. 
Mr Rajoy's approach may be unimaginative, but it is effective. It is politically profitable for him in the rest of Spain, where many are fed up with what they see as Catalan whining. But it ignores Catalonia's unhappiness with Spain's current constitutional arrangements. Keeping the country together may require revisiting them.","The Catalans throw down the referendum gauntlet 
 THE production was as dramatic as any other the National Theatre in Barcelona has seen . There , on July 4th , the president of Catalonia 's government , Carles Puigdemont , announced plans to hold a unilateral referendum on independence from Spain on October 1st . The draft law he unveiled says that , whatever the turnout , if those voting in favour outnumber those against , within 48 hours the Catalan parliament will declare independence . To Mr Puigdemont 's supporters , this is a national epic . To Mariano Rajoy's , it is "" authoritarian delirium "" . Mariano Rajoy is determined that it should not take place . 
 Mr Puigdemont 's push follows five years of secessionist agitation in Catalonia , one of Spain 's richest regions , whose 7.5 m people are 16 % of the country 's total . Separatism was fuelled partly by the Constitutional Tribunal 's rejection of parts of a new statute that would have granted the region more autonomy . But the main forces were nationalist politicians in Barcelona who blamed euro - crisis austerity on Madrid . In a regional election in 2015 , parties campaigning for independence won , but only just : the ruling coalition got 48 % of the vote but 53 % of the seats in the parliament . 
 Mr Puigdemont invokes "" the legitimate right to self - determination of a thousand - year - old nation "" . National and international law is against him . Spain 's constitution of 1978 - -approved by over 90 % of Catalan voters in a referendum -- granted the regions great autonomy . But it affirmed "" the indissoluble unity of the Spanish nation "" . Only the Spanish parliament can change the constitution . Catalonia 's own autonomy statute , which Mr Puigdemont 's law would replace , can only be amended by a two - thirds majority of its parliament . And the Council of Europe , which Mr Puigdemont consulted , said in June that any referendum must be carried out "" in full compliance with the constitution "" . 
 Mariano Rajoy insists that Mariano Rajoy must uphold the law . At Madrid 's urging , the courts have fined and suspended from office the Catalan politicians who organised a previous , unofficial referendum in 2014 ( in which just 2.3 m people voted , a 37 % turnout ) .

IT HAS become a heartbreaking routine. This week Barcelona has seen the outpourings of solidarity and defiance in the aftermath of terrorism that have acquired a grim familiarity for Europeans. Like their peers in London, Paris and elsewhere, the jihadists who caused carnage on August 17th were attacking Europe's very way of life, one of freedom, tolerance, openness and hedonism. They slaughtered 15 people and injured some 130 from more than 30 countries, most of them on Barcelona's great boulevard, the Ramblas. 
Many Spaniards had hoped to be spared. They suffered the murder of 192 people in the jihadist bombing of four commuter trains in Madrid in 2004. But of late Spain has played only a minor role in military operations in the Middle East and north Africa. Its security services are effective, honed by long experience against the Basque terrorists of ETA. The country's Muslim population is proportionately smaller than that of most of its neighbours, and has arrived more recently. Only around 190 Spanish residents have travelled to the Middle East to join Islamic State (IS), and only about 25 have returned. 
Reversing the reconquista 
None of that has made Spain immune. IS has not forgotten Al-Andalus, the Muslim caliphate that ruled much of the country during the Middle Ages. Spain, and especially Catalonia, hosts many Salafists, devotees of an ultra-conservative brand of Sunni Islam; a minority of its adherents favour violent jihad. The authorities have recently adopted a proactive policy, jailing hundreds of terrorist suspects on lesser charges (such as extremist propaganda) before they could commit violence. A disproportionately large number of those arrests have been in Catalonia, which has become ""the main site of jihadist activity"" in Spain, according to Fernando Reinares of the Elcano Institute, a think-tank. 
The attack on August 17th fits the recent pattern of jihadist terrorism in Europe. Its leader was Abdelbaki es Satty, a Moroccan immigrant radicalised while in jail for drug smuggling. In 2015 he turned up as the imam at a mosque in Ripoll, a Catalan town at the foot of the Pyrenees. Es Satty, who had contacts in both Belgium and France, secretly recruited a tight-knit group of young men who were not especially religious, including four sets of brothers. 
Spain rightly prides itself on its tolerance towards immigrants. Most of the Ripoll group had arrived from Morocco as small children, and were apparently well-integrated. They spoke Catalan, had jobs and played in a local football team. None of that was enough to prevent them attacking their adopted country. 
There is a second reason why the events of August 17th pose unusually sharp questions for Spain's political leaders. Catalonia's regional government is bent on organising an unconstitutional referendum on independence on October 1st. Should the ""yes"" side win, a unilateral declaration of independence will follow. The conservative government of Mariano Rajoy in Madrid is determined to stop the referendum. 
Both Mr Rajoy and Carles Puigdemont, the pro-independence president of the Catalan government, have been careful not to politicise the attacks. (They have learned the lessons of 2004, when the conservative government wrongly blamed the bombings on ETA, helping the opposition Socialists to win the election three days later.) Mr Rajoy went to Barcelona, met Mr Puigdemont and called for unity. Mr Puigdemont reciprocated: ""Our absolute and sole priority is to attend to the victims and pursue the criminals,"" he declared. 
Yet the underlying political tension has surfaced in coded form. The Catalan police force, the Mossos d'Esquadra, responded effectively to the attack: of the 12 men involved, six were killed by police, four arrested and two, including es Satty, died when their improvised bomb factory blew up. (His original plan was apparently to bomb a Barcelona landmark, perhaps the Sagrada Familia basilica.) Standing beside his police chief, Mr Puigdemont hailed their success as evidence that the Mossos should have a seat at international police agencies like Europol, implying they had been denied intelligence by Madrid. 
The Mossos have recently gained a representative at the Spanish national office of Europol. But both Europol and Interpol recognise only a single national counterpart, notes a former police commander. The bigger problem is inter-force rivalry in Catalonia. Since 2010 the Mossos have had counter-terrorism responsibilities, which they share with Spain's national police and the Civil Guard, a paramilitary corps. Each counts several thousand officers experienced in tackling terrorism. The Mossos's current political bosses ""do not allow them to interact normally"" with the national forces, says Mr Reinares. Others in Madrid have criticised the Mossos for failing to detect es Satty's activities. 
If Mr Puigdemont wanted a pretext to back down from his confrontation with Madrid, he now has one. But there is no sign he will take it. The political truce is unlikely to last beyond a march in Barcelona in tribute to the victims on August 26th. Will the attacks change public opinion towards independence? For its supporters, it is an emotional cause. In answer to those who see the referendum as a distraction--now more than ever--they will claim that Catalonia would be more secure alone. 
The attacks have produced a wave of public sympathy towards Catalonia in the rest of Spain, after years of growing estrangement. An imaginative government might build on that to offer the Catalans more recognition of their unique status as a ""cultural nation"" within Spain, something Mr Rajoy has resisted. But the country also needs to think hard about what it offers its immigrants, especially as the second and third generations grow up. Unlike Britain or France, Spain has no ministers or political leaders and scarcely any national-team footballers of immigrant extraction. For Muslim and other immigrants to feel they belong, that will have to change.

EACH year Sergi Rubio has joined the huge demonstrations that Catalans have held since 2010 on September 11th, their national day, to demand independence from Spain. This year several hundred thousand people thronged the streets of Barcelona in warm sunshine. It was a festive, family affair with giant puppets and human castles. But there was a change, said Mr Rubio, a manager in his mid-30s from Vilafranca del Penedes, in cava country: ""Now we have politicians who are standing up and fighting for their ideals."" 
Days before, the Generalitat, as the Catalan government is known, had rammed through the Catalan parliament a law mandating a ""binding"" referendum on independence and another requiring a unilateral declaration of independence within 48 hours in the event of a ""Yes"" vote. ""We have a single objective: to be able to decide on our future...and that prevails over everything else,"" said Carles Puigdemont, the Catalan president. 
With that, he set Catalonia, one of Spain's most populous and richest regions, on a collision course with the conservative government of Mariano Rajoy in Madrid. For months Mr Rajoy has been warning that the referendum cannot take place because it violates Spain's constitution. The prime minister has pledged to act ""with firmness and proportionality"" to stop any vote happening. 
The situation is getting steadily nastier. Acting on a government petition, Spain's constitutional court has suspended Catalonia's referendum law. Madrid has taken temporary charge of Catalonia's finances, in an attempt to prevent spending on the referendum. The attorney-general has begun proceedings against Mr Puigdemont and his cabinet for misappropriation of public funds, a charge that carries a potential prison sentence. The police have seized campaign materials, and have orders to do the same with ballot boxes as they are deployed. On September 20th, acting on the orders of a judge, the Guardia Civil raided offices of the Generalitat, arresting 14 officials involved in organising the referendum. This was an ""aggression"", said Mr Puigdemont, and a de facto supension of Catalonia's autonomy. 
Nevertheless, more than 700 mayors (out of 948 in the Catalonia region) say they will defy a legal warning not to assist the holding of the vote. ""I'm not scared of being arrested,"" Mr Puigdemont said recently. ""We haven't committed any crime."" Indeed, he is visibly enjoying the battle he has unleashed. He appears to want to provoke Mr Rajoy into a heavy-handed overreaction. ""If there is penal action, that will prompt solidarity,"" warns Miquel Iceta, leader of the Catalan Socialist Party, which does not support the referendum. 
Mr Puigdemont claims a mandate for pursuing independence, but it is a debatable one. His coalition of nationalists and republicans won only 39.5% in a regional election in 2015 that it had claimed was ""plebiscitary"". His narrow majority in the parliament comes from an alliance with an anti-capitalist outfit, which won 8.2% and also supports independence. 
Surveys by the Generalitat's own pollster show that support for independence, while double that in 2008, has never amounted to a majority and is drifting gently down (see chart 1). Some recent polls, though (see chart 2), predict a majority for independence on October 1st, though many No voters will stay away, making the size of the turnout crucial, assuming the poll goes ahead. 
Generalitat dissatisfaction 
That so many Catalans want a referendum is the result of three main grievances. The first is the bad blood left by an attempt by Mr Iceta's party to change Catalonia's statute of autonomy to give preferential status to the Catalan language, and to note formally that the Catalan parliament has defined the region as ""a nation"". This rather modest reform was approved by referendum in Catalonia, and by the Spanish parliament in 2006. But Mr Rajoy's People's Party (PP) campaigned against it, and in 2010 the constitutional court overturned these and other clauses. ""For Catalan society, that was an insult,"" says Ferran Mascarell, a former Socialist who is now the Generalitat's delegate in Madrid. 
The second factor is the recession and the austerity that followed the bursting of Spain's property bubble in 2009. The mood was inflamed by the nationalists' claim that the Spanish state ""robs"" them. The gap between what Catalans pay in taxes and what they get back in services is EUR 8bn-10bn a year. Angel de la Fuente, a public-finance specialist, argues that it is normal for Catalonia, and other richer regions such as Madrid, to be net contributors. But as part of a review begun earlier this year, the size of the gap may be reduced. Catalan governments, for their part, have spent much on things like subsidised local media and foreign ""embassies"". 
Catalans also complain that they get less than their due in public investment. In that they are partly right, says Mr de la Fuente. Spanish governments have followed an investment policy that, he says, has ""probably been too redistributive at the expense of efficiency"", partly because of EU funding mechanisms. 
The third, less tangible, gripe concerns identity. According to Mr Mascarell, society is fed up with ""permanent and stupid quarrels against the Catalan language"". Catalan governments have educated two generations of youngsters in the historically questionable notion that Catalonia is an ancient nation-state oppressed by Spain. 
Behind the support for the referendum lies a sense of insecurity. Catalans like to see themselves as a highly advanced part of a backward country. This is no longer as true as it was. The rest of Spain has caught up. In 1962 income per person in Catalonia was 50% above the national average; now Catalonia's is only 19% higher, according to Mr de la Fuente. 
In that sense, Catalan nationalism reflects the fear of loss of relative status, also embodied by Italy's Northern League and other right-wing populist movements. This fear has been exacerbated by the way that governments in Madrid have washed their hands of Catalonia. Barcelona hosts almost no institutions of the Spanish state. ""Spain is more like [decentralised] Germany, but it has tried to be like [centralised] France,"" says Jordi Alberich of the Cercle d'Economia, a business think-tank. ""Spain has to try to win over Catalans again,"" admits Xavier Garcia Albiol, who heads the PP in the region. ""If we don't generate a narrative that seduces, Catalonia is lost."" 
In 2014 the Generalitat supported an informal referendum on independence in which it claimed 1.86m people voted Yes. If it manages to get as many to vote on October 1st it will claim victory. But the courts are likely to strip Mr Puigdemont and his colleagues of their jobs nonetheless, possibly even before the referendum takes place. One way or another, at a minimum Catalonia is almost certainly headed for a fresh regional election. ""Whatever happens, October 1st is the end of a chapter, though not of the book,"" says Mr Alberich. ""The next chapter has to be to find a third way."" That is a job for politicians, not courts, and in today's poisonous atmosphere, it will be hard.","The discontents and divisions behind an illegal referendum

The most that will happen, predicts another official in Madrid, is an informal exercise in which some votes may be cast in makeshift stalls. 
The conservative government of Mariano Rajoy has relied on the courts to disrupt arrangements for the vote. On the orders of a Barcelona prosecutor, a dozen key Catalan officials were arrested (and later freed) and 9.8m ballot papers seized. The Generalitat, as the Catalan government is called, dissolved the electoral authority it had set up after Spain's constitutional court threatened its members with daily fines of EUR 12,000 ($14,100) each. The interior ministry has flooded Catalonia with thousands of extra police. A prosecutor has ordered the local police force to seal off schools and other public buildings that are normally used as polling stations. 
Mr Puigdemont complains that all this amounts to a de facto suspension of regional autonomy, and insists the referendum will still go ahead. He told La Sexta, a television channel: ""What makes a referendum? The people."" But will the people co-operate? The arrests were met with protests in Barcelona, but demonstrators have so far numbered only in the low tens of thousands. Some of his supporters want him to issue a unilateral declaration of independence on October 2nd. But he has played down such talk, saying it would be for the Catalan parliament to decide. 
In the absence of a clear majority for independence in Catalonia, Mr Puigdemont's administration is waging a propaganda battle. It portrays the Spanish state as repressive and undemocratic. Photos of queues of people unable to vote would reinforce that image. 
One of the Generalitat's main targets is international opinion. It has set up ten ""embassies"" abroad and plans more. Yet the only foreign leaders who have expressed support for the referendum are Nicolas Maduro of Venezuela and Nicola Sturgeon of Scotland. 
There has been muttering around Europe at what some see as Mr Rajoy's heavy-handed approach. But no government is keen to encourage separatism, in Spain or elsewhere. The European Commission has restated that Catalonia would leave the EU if it leaves Spain. Alfonso Dastis, the country's foreign minister, says he is satisfied with the level of support he has received. Even Donald Trump has backed Madrid. 
According to Mr Puigdemont, the Generalitat has ""broadened the perimeter of knowledge of what's happening in Catalonia"". Its efforts are focused on parliaments and the foreign media more than governments. It is playing a long game for international opinion. Mr Rajoy may be winning the immediate legal battle, but the political war over Catalonia is far from over.","A propaganda battle over the Catalan referendum

WHEN a democracy sends riot police to beat old ladies over the head with batons and stop them voting, something has gone badly wrong. Catalans say that almost 900 people were hurt by police in the referendum for independence on October 1st. Whatever the provocation from Catalan leaders in staging an unconstitutional poll, the reaction of Mariano Rajoy, the prime minister, has thrown Spain into its worst constitutional crisis since an attempted coup in 1981. 
If Mr Rajoy thought that cracking heads would put a stop to secessionism, he could not have been more wrong. He has only created a stand-off that has energised his enemies and shocked his friends (see page 29). On October 3rd Catalonia, one of Spain's richest regions, was paralysed by a protest strike. Hundreds of thousands of demonstrators have marched to express their outrage. 
Secession would be a disaster for Spain. The country would lose its second city and risk the further loss of the Basque region. Secession would also hurt Catalans, which is why a majority of them probably oppose it. And Catalan independence might stir up separatism elsewhere in Europe--in Scotland again, no doubt, but also in northern Italy, in Corsica, perhaps even in Bavaria. To prevent the crisis deepening, both sides need to seek a new constitutional settlement. Instead, they are digging in and Catalonia is on the brink of unilaterally--and illegally--declaring independence. 
After Franco 
Spain has a historical fear of dismemberment. Catalan secessionism was one of the factors that brought about the Spanish civil war of the 1930s. Many Spaniards no doubt share the anger of King Felipe who, in a rare televised speech, denounced Catalonia's leaders for irresponsibly and disloyally tearing up the constitution of 1978. After all, Catalans overwhelmingly endorsed that settlement, which entrenched democracy, brought prosperity and granted a large dose of autonomy to Spanish regions, including Catalonia. 
A well-run democracy must abide by the rule of law. That is what protects democratic liberties, not least the freedom of minorities to express discontent. Until referendum day, nobody who experienced the vibrancy of Barcelona could seriously claim that Catalonia was oppressed. With few exceptions, notably when empires collapse, the world generally favours national unity over self-determination by subnational groups. Many of the states liberated by the break-up of the Soviet empire joined the European Union, but these days the EU is wary, warning would-be secessionists that new states have no automatic right to join. Without Spain's support, Catalonia would find itself on the wrong side of a new customs wall. 
For all these reasons the Catalan leader, Carles Puigdemont, does not have a strong case for independence. Nor can he claim a real mandate. He rammed the laws authorising the referendum through the Catalan parliament with a narrow majority and without proper debate. Those laws have no formal legal standing. Before his referendum, opinion polls suggested that only 40-45% of Catalans wanted to break away. The 90% vote to leave was 90% of an unregistered turnout of well under half, because Catalonia's Remainers mostly declined to take part. As with populists elsewhere, Mr Puigdemont has offered a simplistic vision, without explaining the costs of independence or how it might come about. 
But that is not the end of the story. Democracy rests on the consent of the governed. Even some who disagree with Mr Puigdemont's methods believe Catalonia has a case for nationhood. It could survive economically. A lot of its people think it constitutes a nation. Under autonomy, Catalan leaders have promoted their language and their nationalist creed. 
The pain in Spain 
Whatever the legality of separatism, once the desire for independence reaches a critical point, governments must deal with it in three ways: crush it, bow to it, or negotiate in good faith, knowing that separation may still be the outcome. 
Mr Rajoy has failed to grasp the nature of this choice. First he blocked the nationalists in the courts and, last weekend, he resorted to force. His deployment of policemen to suppress the Catalan vote was not only a propaganda gift to them but, more important, crossed a line. Aggression against crowds of peaceful citizens may work in Tibet but cannot be sustained in a Western democracy. In the contest between formal justice and natural justice, natural justice wins eventually every time. Constitutions exist to serve citizens, not the other way around. Rather than uphold the rule of law as he intended, Mr Rajoy ended up tarnishing the legitimacy of the Spanish state. 
Will Mr Puigdemont declare independence? That would be reckless and irresponsible but, if he does, Mr Rajoy should resist the temptation to arrest Catalan leaders and, for the time being, avoid using his power to suspend regional rule. Just now, either measure would only compound his mistakes. 
Only a negotiation can restore calm and it should start immediately. Even now most Catalans can probably still be won over with the offer of greater autonomy, including the power to raise and keep more of their own taxes, more protection for the Catalan language and some kind of recognition of the Catalans as a ""nation"". Mr Rajoy might even take up the opposition Socialists' idea of turning Spain into a federal state. 
Any settlement, though, must include the option of a referendum on independence. Separation would be a wrenching change for Catalonia and the rest of Spain, so should not be done lightly. A majority of Catalans eligible to vote should be the minimum threshold for independence. A follow-up vote on the terms of a separation might be wise, too. 
For all his deficiencies, David Cameron, the former British prime minister, was right about allowing a referendum on Scottish independence in 2014. He made the case for Scotland to stay, and won the vote convincingly. Mr Rajoy should do the same. The case for the unity of Spain is strong. But it must be won by force of argument. By using force alone, Mr Rajoy is not preventing the break-up of Spain, but hastening it.","Catalonia is on the brink of declaring independence , but it is not too late to step back from calamity

WHEN Mariano Rajoy pledged that the referendum on independence organised by the Catalan government for October 1st would not take place, it always looked like a hostage to fortune. And so it has proved. As riot police used force to evict activists from polling stations, pictures of elderly citizens bloodied by truncheon blows caused dreadful damage to the image of Spanish democracy. And the vote mostly went ahead regardless. 
For Mr Rajoy, Spain's conservative prime minister, it was the worst of both worlds. It leaves a question-mark over the future of his government, and even of his country. On the back of the vote, Carles Puigdemont, the Catalan president, said the region's parliament would issue a unilateral declaration of independence (UDI) in the coming days, in accordance with a law it rushed through last month. Spanish democracy faces ""very grave times"", declared King Felipe in a rare televised address on October 3rd. He was right. 
The referendum took place peacefully in much of Catalonia, in a celebratory atmosphere. The trouble happened in Barcelona and other larger towns. Activists had occupied schools where polling was to take place. Riot squads of the Spanish national police and the Civil Guard waded in to evict them, causing almost 900 injuries, four of them serious, according to the Generalitat, as Catalonia's regional government is known. The central government said 33 policemen were hurt. Although the police closed some 320 polling stations before being ordered to withdraw, thousands of others functioned. The Generalitat claimed that 2.3m people voted, or around 43% of an electorate of 5.4m. With opponents of independence staying away in droves, 90% of the votes were Yes. The numbers cannot be verified, but are in line with recent opinion polls, which have support for leaving at 40-45%. 
In the event of a UDI, few doubt that Mr Rajoy will feel obliged to suspend, at least in part, Catalonia's autonomy, is possible under Article 155 of Spain's constitution (never before invoked). The king appeared to signal this when he criticised the Catalan authorities' ""inadmissible disloyalty"" to the democratic state and called for the upholding of constitutional order. But invoking Article 155 ""will be another error in a long list of mistakes"" by the Spanish government which have boosted support for independence, Mr Puigdemont told the BBC this week. 
The events of October 1st have given the pro-independence coalition new allies. Ada Colau, the left-wing but non-secessionist mayor of Barcelona, backed a regional general strike on October 3rd called to protest against police violence and ""in defence of democratic liberties"". For the first time, Catalan secessionism has won some sympathy in Europe beyond far-left and far-right allies. The European Commission ignored Mr Puigdemont's invitation to mediate, but did criticise violence and called on both sides to talk. It also reiterated its support for Mr Rajoy and his efforts to uphold the constitution. 
Mr Puigdemont has repeatedly outwitted Mr Rajoy. The government underestimated the strength, staying power and unity of the independence movement. ""We are convinced that time will defuse this problem,"" a senior official in Madrid said in March. That it did not showed how out of touch with Catalan realities the government is. Mr Rajoy's government is stuffed with abogados del estado--state lawyers who form an elite bureaucratic corps--but is short of politicians and communicators. On the referendum, the prime minister ""decided to act in the only way he knows how, which is to apply the law"", says a source close to the ruling People's Party (PP). ""He's disconcerted because applying the law didn't work. He doesn't know what to do."" 
What's there to talk about? 
On the evening of the vote, Mr Rajoy blamed the violence on the Generalitat. ""We did what we had to do,"" he said. But he also called on all political forces in the parliament to ""reflect together on the future"". Ministers insisted that after October 1st, talks could start. But can they? Neither side now trusts the other. The government has said it cannot negotiate with Mr Puigdemont, because of his defiance of the constitution; many in Catalonia abhor Mr Rajoy and the PP, which campaigned against an attempt to give the region greater powers in a new autonomy statute in 2006. 
The bigger difficulty is what to discuss. Spain's constitution of 1978 granted sweeping powers of self-government to Catalonia. It gave Spain, including Catalonia, democracy, a welfare state and much greater prosperity (until a housing bubble burst in 2008). But the system was made unwieldy by a decision to grant regional autonomy across the country, rather than just to the Catalans, Basques and Galicians who had long demanded it. And it has not diminished Spanish conservatives' attachment to a centralising tradition, says Jose Alvarez Junco, a historian of nationalism at Madrid's Complutense University. ""They'd like to think Spain is like France and Madrid like Paris."" As a result, Barcelona does not have the status of a de facto joint capital that it deserves. 
Mr Rajoy is thus constrained by pressure from his base. ""The PP wins elections thanks to its [Spanish] nationalism and explicit anti-Catalanism,"" says Mr Alvarez. Over the past few days, Spanish flags have started to appear on balconies across much of the country. 
Mr Rajoy's dogged determination, sangfroid and quiet ruthlessness helped Spain out of its banking crisis and economic slump. But he shows little sign of the flexibility and imagination that resolving the Catalan problem demands. Letting it fester carries a cost. Mr Rajoy's minority government has had to postpone sending the 2018 budget to Congress, because the events in Catalonia mean it has lost, for now, the support of the Basque nationalists. The Catalan conflict could dent economic recovery. This week Spanish shares and bonds have been pummelled. 
The Catalan government has quietly constructed the rudiments of an independent state. It has schooled two generations in its (questionable) narrative of oppression. The Catalan police chose not to use force to close polling stations. ""Catalonia is already different, it's a new state in Europe,"" exclaimed Dolors Sola, a representative of the ruling pro-independence coalition at a polling station in Vic, a town north of Barcelona. 
Not yet: secessionism has failed to achieve sufficient support in Catalonia to impose itself. A silent, divided and leaderless majority is against it, including some 30% of the population who want a better deal within Spain. Letting matters fester has costs for Catalonia, too. ""If there's no negotiation we could go to an Ulsterisation...with two worlds living in the same space,"" fears Xavier Capelles, a tax lawyer in Vic, recalling the religious bitterness that disfigured Northern Ireland for years. 
Until now, the independence movement has been impeccably non-violent, albeit constantly provocative. But the situation is volatile. If Mr Puigdemont and Mr Rajoy cannot between them swiftly take constructive steps towards an agreement or, worse, if Mr Rajoy attempts to arrest the Catalan leader, that could easily change.","Mariano Rajoy mishandles Catalan defiance

Weighty figures 
The number of obese children and adolescents in the world has increased tenfold in four decades, according to the World Health Organisation. In the mid-1970s less than 1% of those aged 5-to-19 were obese. By 2016 it was 7%, or 124m. Another 213m were overweight, meaning nearly a fifth of young people were unhealthily fat. The WHO predicts that the number of obese children could surpass undernourished ones by 2022. 
Raila Odinga, Kenya's main opposition candidate, pulled out of a re-run of the presidential election that was scheduled for October 26th. He said failures by the electoral commission that prompted the courts to annul the results of the presidential election in August had not been rectified. 
The electoral commission in the Democratic Republic of Congo declared that elections cannot be held before April 2019, deepening a constitutional crisis. The president, Joseph Kabila, was supposed to step down in December 2016 at the end of his last term. But he has remained in power because his government has failed to organise elections despite promising to do so this year. 
An Iraqi court ordered the arrest of Kurdish officials who were involved in organising a referendum last month over the region's independence. Most of those who voted in the referendum cast their ballots in support of the Kurdish region breaking away from Iraq. 
Dream on 
The White House asked Congress to pass its agenda on curtailing illegal immigration, such as building a wall along the border with Mexico, in exchange for a deal on safeguarding the future of young undocumented migrants, or Dreamers. Last month Democratic leaders in Congress surprised their party, and Republicans, by announcing they had reached a compromise with Donald Trump over the Dreamers. Those hopes now seem a bit premature.

At least 23 people were killed in counties north of San Francisco when they were caught in wildfires that spread across California's best-known wine-growing region. 
Testing the waters 
China accused America of violating Chinese and international law by sending a warship close to the Paracel islands in the South China Sea, which are claimed by China, Taiwan and Vietnam. The destroyer kept farther than 12 nautical miles from the islands, the maximum extent from shore of a country's territorial sea. 
Immigration officers in Hong Kong refused to allow a British human-rights activist, Benedict Rogers, to enter the territory. Mr Rogers said no reason was given for barring him, though he is an outspoken critic of China's restrictions on democracy in Hong Kong. 
The Cambodian government pushed to ban the main opposition by asking the Supreme Court to dissolve the Cambodia National Rescue Party ahead of next year's election. Hun Sen, Cambodia's prime minister since 1985, has cracked down on dissent, imprisoning opposition leaders, shutting down newspapers and radio stations and kicking several NGOs out of the country. 
Amid falling popularity ratings, President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines removed the police from the front line of his shoot-to-kill campaign against suspected drug dealers. Officers from the national drugs agency will instead lead the operations. Officially, 3,850 people have died during Mr Duterte's campaign. Human-rights groups think the real figure is much higher.

A court in Brisbane, Australia, decided that an unsent text found on a dead man's mobile phone constituted his last will and testament. The message was discovered in the phone's drafts folder and said it gave ""all that I have"" to the man's brother and nephew, instead of his wife. The message also stated where he wanted his ashes to be spread, and noted a bit of cash kept behind the TV.","Catalonia's president, Carles Puigdemont, declared that the Spanish region had voted for a mandate for independence at a referendum on October 1st, but said he intended to delay acting on it pending negotiations. Spain's prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, did not offer talks, asking instead whether Mr Puigdemont was declaring independence or not. A few days earlier, huge pro-Spanish- unity rallies took place in Madrid and Barcelona, urging Catalonia not to secede. 
Public-sector unions in France staged a one-day strike against Emmanuel Macron's labour-market reforms. Mr Macron has seen his popularity wane since his election as president in May. 
America enraged the Turkish government by suspending most visa approvals for Turks, in retaliation for the arrest of a Turkish national employed at the American consulate in Istanbul. Turkey then responded in kind. 
Running from the outside 
Margarita Zavala, a former first lady in Mexico, resigned from the conservative National Action Party after clashing with its leader, Ricardo Anaya. Ms Zavala, who is married to Felipe Calderon, president from 2006 to 2012, said she would run as an independent in next year's presidential election. 
Police in Colombia fired into a crowd of farmers protesting against coca eradication efforts in Tumaco, one of the country's poorest areas, killing six. Three days later police shot at foreign human-rights workers and journalists attempting to investigate the incident. President Juan Manuel Santos called the episode ""regrettable"". Four police officers were suspended.

IT WAS a case of trying to have your cake and eat it--and the cake's owner may end up with nothing. On October 10th Carles Puigdemont, the president of Catalonia's devolved government, told his parliament that he was ""assuming the mandate"" of the people to proclaim an independent republic and thus leave Spain. But seconds later he asked the parliament to ""suspend the effects of the declaration of independence"" to allow for negotiation. All clear? 
This baffling manoeuvre followed an unauthorised referendum on independence held on October 1st in which, his administration says, 2.3m (around 43% of the electorate) voted, 90% of them in favour. Those numbers are not verifiable. But for many of the thousands of flag-waving demonstrators who gathered outside the parliament in Barcelona, the Catalan capital, they were enough to declare independence straight away, and the speech left them deflated. Mr Puigdemont's tortuous formulation reflected the conflicting pressures he is now under. Business leaders and opposition politicians in Catalonia, one of Spain's richest regions and home to 7.5m people, warn that he is taking them towards a costly political void. He is trying to play for time. 
Mariano Rajoy, Spain's conservative prime minister, swiftly called his bluff. With the support of the opposition Socialists and of Ciudadanos, a centre-right party, he set in motion Article 155 of Spain's democratic constitution. Never previously invoked, this allows the government to ""compel"" an autonomous region to fulfil its constitutional obligations. The government has given Mr Puigdemont until October 16th formally to clarify whether he has declared independence or not; if he has, then he has until October 19th to revoke it. 
Mr Puigdemont must thus choose climbdown or defiance. If he opts for the latter, Spain is heading into the unknown. The government may try to remove the Catalan administration and call a fresh election, as the constitution probably gives it the right to do. But some in Barcelona warn that doing so will require force. 
Not so simple 
The past few days have delivered a sharp reality check to Mr Puigdemont, contradicting the claims of his ruling coalition that independence would be painless. First, and most damagingly, around 40 of the largest companies in Catalonia moved their legal domicile to other parts of Spain. Companies rushed to withdraw their treasury operations from Catalan banks. They fear the legal uncertainty an independence proclamation entails. Although Mr Puigdemont's people minimised the significance of the moves, over time jobs and tax revenues will go too. Suspending the declaration, rather than withdrawing the unconstitutional laws under which it was issued, merely prolongs the agony for business. 
Second, on October 8th some 400,000 people marched in Barcelona for the unity of Spain. It was the first time that the silent majority opposed to independence found its voice. Now there are a few Spanish flags draped on Barcelona balconies, not just the ubiquitous esteladas, the starred flag of independence. ""People finally believed they would declare independence, and that produced in days a reaction that hadn't happened in years,"" says a business leader. 
Third, no European government has shown the slightest interest in Mr Puigdemont's pleas for mediation (see Charlemagne). The leaders of the independence drive have clung to the belief that if they create enough disruption, ""Europe"" would step in to support them. ""Catalonia is a European issue,"" Mr Puigdemont insisted this week. But Europe's leaders think it is an internal Spanish one. 
The diverse independence coalition is fracturing. Moderates, silent for the past few months, successfully pressed for delay. By contrast, the CUP, an anarchist group that wants immediate independence, did not applaud Mr Puigdemont's speech. At their insistence, representatives of the ruling coalition signed a declaration of independence after the parliamentary session; but it was not formally tabled. The CUP may now boycott parliament for a month, depriving Mr Puigdemont of his majority. ""I don't think he can last a month without calling an election"" in Catalonia, says a senior politician from his party. 
As for Catalan business ""the will to declare [independence] is the same as declaring it,"" says Anton Costas, an economist at the University of Barcelona. Hours after the parliamentary session Planeta, a big Barcelona publishing house, said it, too, is moving its domicile to Madrid. 
The cause of independence has never commanded more than a narrow and fleeting majority of Catalans. But more general discontent goes far wider. It began when the Constitutional Tribunal, at the urging of the PP, struck out clauses in a new autonomy statute of 2006 that would have recognised Catalonia as a nation and strengthened its power over the teaching and use of the Catalan language. 
Polls show that most Catalans want a better deal from Spain. That would probably have to involve a return to the original statute of 2006, as well as keeping more Catalan money in Catalonia and giving locals more control over infrastructure. Mr Rajoy has accepted a Socialist proposal for the Spanish parliament to begin debating constitutional reforms next year. 
One way or another, in the coming weeks Catalans are likely to vote, and legally this time, for a new regional government. That would at least allow everyone to draw breath. But there is a risk that before then Catalonia will be plunged into further conflict, civil disobedience and even violence.","The independence dream dissolves on contact with reality

SEPARATISM in Europe these days comes draped in a blue flag with yellow stars. ""If in Europe you're not a member state, you're nobody,"" said Josep Huguet i Biosca, a Catalan politician who favours independence, back in 2004. His quote appeared in a now-dusty manifesto for ""An Independent Flanders within Europe"", published in 2005 by a group seeking liberation from the yoke of the Belgian state. The Scottish bid for independence, in 2014, was similarly shrouded in European aspirations. For some of its more starry-eyed advocates, the European Union was supposed to dissolve atavistic nationalisms. In some places, it seems instead to have encouraged them. 
The post-national argument was always overdone. The powers that voters mostly care about--taxation, public services, welfare--remain largely in the hands of national governments. One Catalan grievance, for example, is that the rest of Spain lives high on the hog by spending more of their tax revenues than Catalonia gets back. Indeed the success of the EU may actually have stoked rather than quelled the flames of secession, by potentially reducing its costs. For small states, the EU means access to a large and deep single market, membership of a big trading bloc, and even a dash of foreign and security policy. For Scottish, Catalonian or Flemish voters, such considerations may well make secession look less daunting. ""Not only does the EU make independence possible,"" argues the Flemish manifesto, ""it also stimulates it."" 
Catalonia is plainly a viable EU member. It is rich, for the most part well-governed, and has strong trade links to the rest of Europe, which takes two-thirds of its exports. Like the rest of Spain, it is strongly pro-European. But the EU has no provision for dealing with a region's secession in defiance of a member country. (Scotland's accession bid would probably have been accepted eventually, since the UK accepted its right to seek independence.) 
That is why pro-independence Catalans have struggled to win European sympathy. They expected it after footage of riot police bashing Catalan voters circulated on October 1st. The next day the European Commission's turgid daily press briefing was broadcast live on Catalan television. But beyond a call for restraint, the commission had little to offer them: it agreed that the vote was unconstitutional and left the matter to Mariano Rajoy, Spain's prime minister. The main political groups in the European Parliament, courted assiduously by Spanish ministers, were similarly reluctant to stir the pot. What support the Catalans have found comes from friends they would rather avoid: populists like Nigel Farage and Geert Wilders, Greek anarchists (who invaded a Spanish embassy) and the odious Julian Assange. 
If regions are legally toothless inside the EU, there are other ways for them to flex their muscles. They establish ""embassies"" and hire lobbyists; the Catalans have effectively courted the international press. When the Belgian Walloons (French-speakers) threatened to scupper an EU trade deal with Canada last year, they were publicly denounced by their Flemish brethren. And citizens have rights enshrined in the EU's treaties, which could not be ignored if the violence in Spain escalated. 
But for all the fuzzy aspirations of its founders, the EU remains firmly a club of its member states. Spain is one; Catalonia is not. Mr Rajoy has taken supportive calls from the likes of Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron, and this week Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, publicly urged Carles Puigdemont, the president of the Catalan government, to step back from the brink. European leaders, especially those with separatist stirrings inside their own borders, have each other's back. ""No one would risk the EU's cohesion by questioning Spain's right to handle this situation,"" says one foreign minister. Catalan officials fear that Madrid will understand the EU's approach as an endorsement of its hard line. They are right to. 
A still bigger headache for the Catalans is the ""Prodi doctrine"", named after a former commission president, which states that any region that breaks away from an EU member will automatically leave the club and have to reapply under the usual rules, a lengthy process that leaders will have no incentive to abbreviate. Even if it were to secede with Spain's consent, an independent Catalonia would be cut off from the rest of Europe, possibly facing barriers to the movement of people and goods, perhaps even ejected from the euro zone. This is a far cry from the romantic vision Mr Puigdemont has offered his supporters. 
If at first you don't secede 
The EU is tricky for both sides in the Catalan debate. The independence movement is a coalition that includes radicals who think the EU is a neoliberal plot from which they seek liberation. The Spanish government is reluctant to debate an independence proposition it considers illegitimate to start with. Yet the prospect of secession from Europe undoubtedly colours the argument. Lluis Orriols, a political scientist at Charles III University in Madrid, argues that independence movements must win their battle on three fronts: emotional, instrumental and international. By depriving the nationalists of the last, and thereby threatening the second, the EU pulls the rug from under their feet. 
This tips some Catalans into magical thinking. The Prodi doctrine was a throwaway remark with no legal standing, they argue. Should Catalonia win its freedom, Europe's leaders will put pragmatism before principle and ensure its place in the EU remains unmolested. Independence-minded business groups even suggest that worried German investors in Catalonia would lean on Mrs Merkel to shield it from ejection. (Brexit-watchers will recognise this questionable line of thinking.) It is hard for dreamers to swallow, but the existence of the EU has become the best guarantee of its members' territorial integrity. For separatists, the EU once looked like the net that would guarantee their safety as they leapt into freedom. Instead, it has become their cage.","Secessionists thought the European Union helped their cause . They were wrong

WITH its mastery of social media and identity politics, the Catalan independence movement is very 21st-century. But the latest chapter in its struggle with the Spanish government has featured an old-fashioned tool: an exchange of letters, delivered by fax. In these Carles Puigdemont, the head of the Generalitat, Catalonia's government, twice this week refused to clarify or revoke the ambiguous proclamation of independence that he had issued and immediately ""suspended"" in a speech to his parliament on October 10th. In response, the Spanish government said it will go ahead and seek extraordinary powers to impose constitutional rule in Catalonia. 
Spain is thus entering its worst constitutional crisis since the 1930s. It is the culmination of years of rising discontent in Catalonia, one of the country's richest regions, which has 7.5m people and its own language and culture. Although Catalonia enjoys broad self-government, many Catalans want it to have more money, more powers, and to be recognised as a nation. Their demands grew louder after Spain's economic slump of 2008-12. Since 2015 the region's ruling coalition has been bent on secession, a possibility not recognised by the Spanish constitution of 1978. 
Mr Rajoy will now ask the Senate to approve invoking the constitution's Article 155. Never before used, it empowers the government to take ""all measures necessary to compel"" a region to obey the constitution. Its vagueness gives Mr Rajoy broad discretion. He is likely to start by tightening control over Catalan finances and appointing a new regional police chief. ""We would have to organise a parallel government,"" says Alfonso Dastis, the foreign minister. 
Having erred in deploying riot police to try to prevent an illegal independence referendum called by the Generalitat on October 1st, the government is proceeding more gingerly. The violence was limited, but won sympathy abroad for the Catalan cause. ""We wouldn't want those pictures to be repeated,"" says Mr Dastis. The Generalitat says 2.3m people (around 43% of the electorate) voted, 90% of them in favour. Those figures are not verifiable, but Mr Puigdemont wields them as a mandate for independence. In his letters to Mr Rajoy, he says he wants ""dialogue"". But what he proposes to talk about is that ""the majority of the Catalan people...want to take the road of an independent state."" 
Since October 1st Mr Rajoy has moved more adeptly. He persuaded Pedro Sanchez, the leader of the opposition Socialists, to support the use of Article 155 in return for Mr Rajoy's backing for a congressional committee on constitutional reform, which will ultimately try to reach a settlement with Catalonia. Since Mr Rajoy's People's Party holds most of the seats in the Senate and is supported by Ciudadanos, a centre-right group, Article 155 will command a big majority. 
For his part, Mr Puigdemont faces conflicting pressures. The drive for independence is hurting the economy: almost 700 companies have moved their legal domicile out of Catalonia in the past fortnight, while tourist bookings in Barcelona have dipped. Moderates want Mr Puigdemont to call a fresh regional election; radicals want a formal declaration of independence backed by a campaign of civil disobedience. All three may happen. 
The radicals got a boost on October 16th when a judge of the National Court in Madrid ordered the pre-trial detention of the leaders of two secessionist social movements. They are being investigated for sedition for directing a demonstration in Barcelona in September in which protesters destroyed three police vehicles. 
Help, we're being repressed 
""Sadly, we have political prisoners again in Spain,"" Mr Puigdemont tweeted. Tens of thousands demonstrated in Barcelona against the arrests. The judiciary is independent, but secessionists argue that ""the Spanish state"" is ganging up on them. ""It's not so simple,"" says Jorge Galindo, a political consultant. ""Prosecutors and some judges are taking a harsher position than the government."" 
The arrests mean that the government is likely to slow the application of Article 155, hoping protests die down. The road ahead is fraught with danger, especially for Catalonia. Despite Mr Puigdemont's claim, there is no evidence that secession commands a majority. ""Today, the main problem is not the divide between Catalonia and Spain, but the fracture among Catalans themselves,"" Marius Carol, the editor of La Vanguardia, a Barcelona newspaper, wrote this week. Judicial overreach in Madrid will not conceal that for long.","The government prepares to intervene in Catalonia 
 WITH its mastery of social media and identity politics , the Catalan independence movement is very 21st - century . But the latest chapter in its struggle with the Spanish government has featured an old - fashioned tool : an exchange of letters , delivered by fax . In these Carles Puigdemont , the head of the Generalitat , Catalonia 's government , twice this week refused to clarify or revoke the ambiguous proclamation of independence that he had issued and immediately "" suspended "" in a speech to his parliament on October 10th . In response , the Spanish government said it will go ahead and seek extraordinary powers to impose constitutional rule in Catalonia . 
 Spain is thus entering its worst constitutional crisis since the 1930s . It is the culmination of years of rising discontent in Catalonia , one of the country 's richest regions , which has 7.5 m people and its own language and culture . Although Catalonia enjoys broad self - government , many Catalans want it to have more money , more powers , and to be recognised as a nation . Their demands grew louder after Spain 's economic slump of 2008 - 12 . Since 2015 the region 's ruling coalition has been bent on secession , a possibility not recognised by the Spanish constitution of 1978 . 
 Mariano Rajoy will now ask the Senate to approve invoking the constitution 's Article 155 . Never before used , it empowers the government to take "" all measures necessary to compel "" a region to obey the constitution . Its vagueness gives Mariano Rajoy broad discretion . Mariano Rajoy is likely to start by tightening control over Catalan finances and appointing a new regional police chief . "" We would have to organise a parallel government , "" says Alfonso Dastis , the foreign minister .

MANY Spaniards have long hoped that an all-out confrontation between the government and the pro-independence leaders of Catalonia could be avoided. But this week time all but ran out. 
On October 21st Mariano Rajoy, Spain's prime minister, asked the Senate to grant him the constitutional power to dismiss the Catalan regional government, impose direct rule and call a fresh regional election within six months. With Catalan leaders pledging resistance, it is unclear whether this heralds the start of a solution or a worsening of Spain's constitutional crisis. 
As The Economist went to press, Carles Puigdemont, the president of the Generalitat, as Catalonia's devolved government is known, was due to address his parliament. Many in his coalition, which holds a bare majority of seats, want him to declare independence. Since no European government will recognise this, it would be purely symbolic. Over the past few days pressure has grown on Mr Puigdemont in Barcelona, the Catalan capital, to stave off intervention by calling a regional election himself. Mr Puigdemont turned down an offer to make his case before the Senate. 
Having invoked Article 155 of the constitution, which grants the Spanish government wide powers to compel a region to obey the law, many in the cabinet and the ruling conservative People's Party want to go ahead regardless. ""No government of any democratic country can tolerate the breaking of the law,"" said Mr Rajoy. The laws Mr Puigdemont's executive pushed through the Catalan parliament last month allowing an independence referendum violated Catalonia's statute of self-government, as well as Spain's constitution. But if Mr Puigdemont does call an election, the opposition Socialists may wobble in their support for Article 155, which the Senate is due to approve on October 27th. Mr Rajoy is unlikely to want to plough on alone. 
The Generalitat says 43% of the electorate voted in the unauthorised referendum on October 1st, 90% of them in support of secession. It takes that as a mandate to declare independence. But it faces a number of unpleasant realities. Since October 1st more than 1,300 companies, including almost all the big ones, have moved their domiciles outside the region, and tourist bookings have dipped. 
If it goes ahead, the government's intervention is likely to start with the dismissal of Mr Puigdemont's cabinet, the naming of new commanders for the Catalan police, and the takeover of the Generalitat's finances and IT centre. The next targets might be Catalan public television and radio, which the government sees as separatist mouthpieces. ""They will try and do it surgically,"" says a former minister. 
Mr Puigdemont promises resistance. The government ""has undertaken the worst attack on the institutions and people of Catalonia"" since Francisco Franco, Spain's dictator from 1939-75, he proclaimed. The 200,000-odd employees of the Generalitat will not take orders from Madrid, Raul Romeva, a Catalan councillor, told the BBC. Their trade unions say they will only obey the Generalitat. 
Weeks of civil disobedience in Catalonia probably lie ahead. Officials in Madrid are worried about whether they can make intervention stick. But if the Spanish state decides to move, it cannot afford to lose the subsequent trial of strength. Mr Puigdemont has repeatedly called for ""dialogue""--but only about the ""terms and timescale for independence"", as Mr Rajoy complained this week. Polls show that most Catalans want a better deal within Spain, rather than to leave it. Mr Rajoy has agreed to a Socialist proposal to set up a congressional committee to discuss constitutional reform. If there is a solution to Spain's ills, that is where it lies.

A SECESSIONIST leader flies into exile, seeking protection after being threatened with a 30-year prison sentence for sedition and rebellion. In the capital the government takes emergency powers, suspending a regional parliament after it illegally declares independence, assuming direct control of its police and civil service. Pinch yourself. This is not some poor, decrepit country but, incredibly, a modern western European democracy--Spain. 
Nobody emerges well from the sorry tale of arrogance, inflexibility and even violence in Catalonia (see page 33). Although the immediate crisis seems, thankfully, to be over, the impact of the October madness will be felt for years to come. Nearly 2,000 businesses have moved their headquarters out of Barcelona and other Catalan cities. For many people, Spanish politics has become harsher and more divisive than at any time since the death of the dictator, Francisco Franco, in 1975. 
How to repair the damage? The first thing is to recognise that there have been grave faults on both sides. The worst mistakes have been those of Carles Puigdemont, the president of Catalonia until he was removed on October 27th. His extra-constitutional referendum, held on October 1st, was legally flawed even in its own terms, conceived without proper Catalan parliamentary debate. In the brief campaign Mr Puigdemont failed to explain how independence would come about, falsely suggesting that Catalonia could swiftly become an EU member. That idea has been shot down in Brussels. Finally, he issued a hollow declaration of independence, even though it was clear that this would force the hand of the central government in Madrid. Having cooked up a mess, Mr Puigdemont has fled the scene and left others to clean it up. 
But the Spanish government has made mistakes, too. Mariano Rajoy, the prime minister, inflamed the situation on October 1st, when he sent in police to break up Mr Puigdemont's referendum, injuring peaceful Catalans taking part in a democratic exercise that he would have been better advised to ignore. Although he was right to respond to the declaration of independence by suspending the Catalan government, the attempt by the attorney-general to threaten Mr Puigdemont with a long prison term is another error. Mr Rajoy is also guilty of the original blunder that set the course for today's collision. Back in 2006, when he was leader of the opposition, he demanded revisions to Catalonia's autonomy statute, rolling back concessions that had given the Catalan language preferential status and had defined Catalonia as a nation. The resulting sense of betrayal galvanised the secessionists. 
Of late, Mr Rajoy has learned to temper his firmness. He has sought consensus with opposition parties in Madrid and expressed a readiness to review the constitution. In reimposing central authority on Catalonia, he ensured that direct rule would be as short as possible by calling a snap election for December 21st, sparing Catalonia's streets from protests. 
Mr Rajoy now has a valuable breathing space before December's vote. He must use it. The causes of the discontent will not suddenly disappear. A large minority of Catalans are unhappy with the current dispensation and want to break away. So a political solution is needed, not merely a legal one. Mr Rajoy needs to sketch out the contours of a new deal he could offer in future talks. They will take time and the courage to confront his own party; any new constitutional settlement will have to involve all of Spain. For now, Mr Rajoy should indicate a willingness to offer concessions in those talks, These could include something like a return to the 2006 statute; mechanisms to let Catalonia, one of Spain's wealthiest regions, keep more of its tax revenues; and the possibility of a future referendum on independence after a new deal has been concluded. 
How to support loyalists 
Some will say that talk of concessions would reward bad behaviour. In fact, it would give voice to the majority of Catalans who want to remain in Spain. That is what Britain did with Scotland and Canada with Quebec. If Mr Rajoy can woo the decisive middle ground--the perhaps one-third of Catalans who want reform rather than secession--he will handily see off the separatists at the ballot box. If not, they might even win again, and claim another victory for independence. That could portend an even deeper crisis after December.","Catalans have accepted direct rule from Madrid for now .

 Mariano Rajoy now has a valuable breathing space before December 's vote . Mariano Rajoy must use it . The causes of the discontent will not suddenly disappear . A large minority of Catalans are unhappy with the current dispensation and want to break away . So a political solution is needed , not merely a legal one . Mariano Rajoy needs to sketch out the contours of a new deal Mariano Rajoy could offer in future talks . They will take time and the courage to confront Mariano Rajoy's own party ; any new constitutional settlement will have to involve all of Spain . For now , Mariano Rajoy should indicate a willingness to offer concessions in those talks , These could include something like a return to the 2006 statute ; mechanisms to let Catalonia , one of Spain 's wealthiest regions , keep more of its tax revenues ; and the possibility of a future referendum on independence after a new deal has been concluded . 
 How to support loyalists 
 Some will say that talk of concessions would reward bad behaviour . In fact , it would give voice to the majority of Catalans who want to remain in Spain . That is what Britain did with Scotland and Canada with Quebec . If Mariano Rajoy can woo the decisive middle ground -- the perhaps one - third of Catalans who want reform rather than secession -- Mariano Rajoy will handily see off the separatists at the ballot box . If not , they might even win again , and claim another victory for independence . That could portend an even deeper crisis after December .",230,Spain,A30-57,IN TERM,True,"Mariano Rajoy , the prime minister",19,True

ON THE morning of October 30th five police vans staked out the Palace of the Generalitat, the part-medieval seat of the government of Catalonia on the Placa Sant Jaume in Barcelona's gothic quarter. But there was no sign of Carles Puigdemont, Catalonia's now ex-president, nor of any demonstrators protesting against his dismissal by the Spanish government. Instead, there were foreign journalists waiting for the clash that didn't happen. 
Three days earlier, Placa Sant Jaume overflowed with a euphoric crowd celebrating a declaration of independence by the Catalan parliament. ""Freedom"", they chanted. ""It's a dream, it's marvellous,"" said David Regalos, an estate agent who had brought his teenage daughter for what he saw as a historic occasion. ""It may hurt the business I work in,"" he admitted, ""but I'm thinking of the future of my children."" 
But as dusk fell with an autumnal chill, the dream was revealed to be delirium. Even as the crowd caroused, in Madrid Mariano Rajoy, Spain's prime minister, announced that the government was taking direct charge of Catalonia, using extraordinary powers under Article 155 of the constitution of 1978. The move was approved by Spain's Senate minutes after the vote in the Catalan parliament. The government swiftly sacked Mr Puigdemont and his government, and replaced the commander of the Catalan police. And, to the surprise of many, Mr Rajoy called a regional election in Catalonia for December 21st. 
By abbreviating direct rule to the minimum, he removed much of its sting. Mr Puigdemont called for ""democratic opposition"", but he opted not to organise resistance on the streets of Barcelona. Instead, he fled to Brussels. Spain's National Court is to investigate him and his colleagues over charges of rebellion, which carries a sentence of up to 30 years. Summonsed to appear on November 2nd, he said he would stay in Belgium until he receives guarantees of a ""fair trial"". 
Enabling Catalans to vote swiftly may help to release the tension that accumulated in the region before and after the unauthorised referendum on independence held on October 1st by the Generalitat. But it cannot hide the gravity of Spain's underlying constitutional crisis. Article 155, which is an almost exact copy of a provision in the German constitution, has never before had to be invoked. 
""This is a momentous decision,"" said a senior official in past Socialist governments. ""It supposes the breakdown of the constitution's territorial model"" under which Spain decentralised many powers and revenues to 17 self-governing ""autonomous communities"". The constitution, which ushered in democracy after Franco's long dictatorship (and was approved overwhelmingly by Catalans), has given Spain the best years of its modern history. Since 1978 the country's income per person has doubled in real terms while regional inequalities have narrowed. Spain has built an advanced democracy, created a welfare state and cast off its past isolation to join the European Union. Although the slump that followed the bursting of a housing bubble in 2008 inflicted much hardship, Spain avoided social conflict. 
The aftermath of austerity eroded but did not break the two-party system, in which the Socialists and Mr Rajoy's conservative People's Party (PP) have alternated in government. Despite the emergence of Podemos, a populist far-left party, Mr Rajoy, who governed alone in 2011-15, managed to form a minority administration last year with the support of Ciudadanos, a new centre-right party. But having held Podemos at bay, Mr Rajoy has found that populism in Catalonia poses an even bigger problem, notes a former minister. 
In the land of make-believe 
Mr Puigdemont called the application of Article 155 ""the worst attack on the institutions of Catalan self-government"" since Franco. His critics say he precipitated it, starting with laws his parliament approved in September to call the referendum and begin the transition to an independent state. As well as violating the Spanish constitution, these implicitly abolished the Catalan autonomy statute. The government was not ""suspending autonomy but...returning Catalonia to self-government and legality as soon as possible,"" declared Mr Rajoy. 
According to the Generalitat, 43% voted in the referendum (90% of them Yes), though the numbers cannot be verified. Buoyed by a wave of international sympathy, which was brought about by the government's disastrous deployment of riot police who tried and failed to stop the vote, Mr Puigdemont took the result as a mandate for a unilateral declaration of independence. That prospect has prompted more than 1,800 companies to move their legal domicile out of Catalonia since October 1st. Tourist bookings and consumer confidence have both fallen. Alarmed, moderate nationalists pressed Mr Puigdemont to draw back. On October 26th he was poised to do so by calling a fresh regional election himself, which would have stalled Article 155. 
But faced with accusations of treachery from hardline nationalists, he instead pushed the Catalan parliament to pass a resolution ""constituting the Catalan republic as an independent and sovereign state"". Approved by 70 votes out of 135 (the opposition walked out), it was a hollow declaration. No country recognised it. Privately, officials of the Catalan government admitted they were completely unprepared for statehood. Evidently, they were also unprepared for the consequences of declaring independence. 
Things fall apart 
So why did it happen? Mr Puigdemont, an affable former journalist and mayor of Girona, blamed the government's refusal to talk. Mr Rajoy's riposte was that Mr Puigdemont only ever wanted to talk about holding a referendum, although the constitution, in line with the continental European norm, does not recognise a right of self-determination for regions. 
In the end Mr Puigdemont was as much the prisoner as the leader of the grass-roots independence movement the Catalan government has promoted. After the referendum, separatists were further inflamed by the jailing, pending trial for obstructing a police raid, of the leaders of two secessionist social movements. They formed part of what in Barcelona was called ""the general staff of the independence process"", seeming to co-govern with Mr Puigdemont. 
While the government underestimated the strength of the independence movement, its leaders overestimated it. Josep Borell, a Catalan former Socialist minister and opponent of independence, says that he has ""lifelong friends with whom I can no longer talk"". Some bookshops in small-town Catalonia now refuse to stock his best-selling book questioning the secessionists' arguments. In this conflict, propaganda is the key weapon, he adds, and ""they use it very well and the government and unionist groups very badly."" 
However, the Generalitat fell into the trap of believing its own propaganda. First, it denied that companies would leave, and then minimised their departure, saying they would return. ""That is not so easy,"" says a Catalan business leader, citing the parallel with Quebec. Montreal never recovered its position as Canada's leading business centre after the secessionist scare in the 1980s and 1990s. That may be Barcelona's fate: companies will gradually transfer head-office functions and jobs, predicts Anton Costas, an economist at the University of Barcelona. 
Second, Catalan officials always thought that the EU would embrace their cause, although there was no reason to believe that. They failed to appreciate that outsiders were left open-mouthed by their comparison of Catalonia's plight within Spain to Lithuania's liberation from the Soviet Union or Kosovo's from Serbia. 
Third, they seemed to believe their populist claim to speak for ""the Catalan people"". No sooner had they stated that 2.3m people voted on October 1st than they started claiming that police had ""stolen 700,000 votes"", for which there is not a scrap of evidence. After the independence vote in the parliament, Mr Puigdemont declared that ""the immense majority"" of Catalonia's political representatives ""have fulfilled a mandate validated by the ballot box"". The reality is that independence has never commanded a majority, despite a post-referendum spike in a poll this week (see chart 1). The ruling coalition won only 48% of the vote in the 2015 regional election; it had a bare majority of seats in the dissolved parliament only because of the over-representation of the region's interior. Catalonia is more divided and angrily polarised than at any time since 1978. The better-off, and those in smaller towns or with Catalan-speaking parents, favour independence; poorer Catalans, and those living in greater Barcelona or immigrants from the rest of Spain do not. 
Placa Sant Jaume has seen it all before. In the 1930s the Second Republic granted self-government to Catalonia. Yet on October 6th 1934--two years before Franco started the civil war--Lluis Companys, the Catalan president, appeared on the balcony of the Generalitat to declare a ""Catalan state"". It lasted just ten hours. ""Even if we lose,"" Companys had said, ""Catalonia will win because we need martyrs who will tomorrow assure definitive victory."" 
It is easy to see a parallel in Mr Puigdemont's conduct. By the same token, he sees himself as the inheritor of a long tradition. He styles himself ""the 130th president of the Generalitat"". But if nations are ""imagined communities"", as Benedict Anderson, a historian, wrote, Catalonia is more imagined than most. 
""Before the 20th century, there was no nation called Catalonia,"" writes Jordi Canal, a Catalan historian. The Generalitat began as a feudal institution in the Frankish County of Barcelona. This was absorbed first into the Crown of Aragon and then that of Spain. The region's emergence as the industrial powerhouse of Spain brought social upheaval and immigration--and a cultural renaissance centred on the revival of the Catalan language, which in turn spawned a nationalist movement among the powerful Catalan bourgeoisie. According to Mr Canal ""It was the nationalists who, from the late 1890s, set out to build a nation and to nationalise Catalans."" Something similar happened in the Basque Country and to a lesser extent Galicia, which each have their own language. 
These regional exceptionalisms challenged a weak Spanish state, whose impulse was to centralise. In the parliamentary debate on the Catalan statute of 1932, Jose Ortega y Gasset, Spain's foremost 20th-century philosopher, argued that Catalonia was a ""perpetual"" problem that ""cannot be settled, it can only be lived with"". Manuel Azana, the prime minister (later president) of the Republic, replied that Spain should positively embrace its regional diversity as part of its ""spiritual wealth"", recognised in self-government. 
That was the spirit, too, of the 1978 constitution, albeit flawed by the dilution of regional exceptionalism with decentralisation for the whole country. Nevertheless, the constitution was approved by 91% of voters in Catalonia on a 68% turnout. For years, it satisfied the nationalists. But then several things came together to ignite the drive for independence. 
The first was an ill-fated attempt in 2006 by a Socialist-led regional government to reform the Catalan statute, giving the Generalitat more powers (over the courts, for example) and in tortuous phrasing recognising Catalonia as a nation. ""The whole process was unfortunate,"" says the Socialist former official, who was involved in it. ""Nobody had demanded a new statute, the negotiation was very chaotic and they came up with a jigsaw puzzle that didn't fit."" Approved by 73% in a referendum (with a 49% turnout) in Catalonia, the 2006 statute was then partially rejected by the Constitutional Tribunal in 2010. That turned it into a casus belli. 
The tribunal's ruling coincided with the onset of the economic slump. Artur Mas, the nationalist president of the Generalitat, at first had no compunction about applying austerity. In June 2011 several thousand indignados surrounded the Catalan parliament to protest against his budget cuts. That prompted him to demand fiscal concessions from Mr Rajoy, just when Spain was on the brink of having to seek a European bail-out. Rebuffed, he launched the drive for an independence referendum. 
Umbrage in Catalonia 
Another red rag to Catalan nationalism was the PP. It had campaigned against the new statute. Many Catalans see the party as the embodiment of Castilian centralism, and feel marginalised by its drive to aggrandise Madrid. The Spanish state has failed to base any important institutions in Barcelona, for example. Many PP politicians in turn blame the rise of secessionism on what they see as the disloyal abuse of self-government by the Generalitat systematically to build a nation. This has had ""very effective levers"" in ""the education system, the public and subsidised private media, and the gradual acceptance of the disappearance of the symbols of the state and of Spain in Catalonia"", Josep Pique, a Catalan former PP minister, told El Pais, a Madrid newspaper. 
Mr Puigdemont's flight to Brussels marks the end of what Catalans call the proces, the drive for an independence referendum. ""Now the movement will concentrate on defending its leaders,"" says Andreu Mas-Colell, the economic councillor in Mr Mas's government. Even if the separatist coalition stays together and wins the election, after the October debacle it is unlikely to do so on a platform that gives priority to independence. 
Must Spain ""live with"" an unresolvable Catalan problem? On paper, it is not hard to sketch a new solution: Catalans would probably settle for a bit more money, guarantees for the Catalan language and symbolic recognition of Catalonia as a nation. Another approach would be federalism, which would clarify responsibilities. Since change to the constitution and Catalonia's statute requires a referendum, it could offer the vote the nationalists want. 
But is any of this politically doable? In return for Socialist support over Article 155 Mr Rajoy agreed to a congressional committee to discuss constitutional reform. Mr Mas-Colell is sceptical that it will produce anything useful. In the past two months, Catalan nationalism has awakened its dormant Spanish counterpart. Many Spaniards see Catalans as tight-fisted whingers. Supporters of the PP and of Ciudadanos, formed to oppose Catalan nationalism, want to roll back decentralisation. 
The underlying task is the restoration of mutual trust between Catalonia and the rest of the country. ""This is an emotional problem, and the solution has to be emotional,"" says Javier Vega de Seaone of the Circulo de Empresarios, a business group. 
The Catalan crisis is merely the most dramatic sign that Spain's constitution needs updating. Decentralisation across the country has added complexity and thrown up regulatory barriers. And Spain's entry into the EU in 1986 removed powers from the central government. ""The important thing is that constitutional reform doesn't become a price to be paid but rather is a shared project,"" says Jose Maria de Areilza, a law professor at ESADE, a business school. 
The transition to democracy generated a sense of purpose in Spain that has recently been missing, despite the country's vigorous economic recovery. Spain's leaders now have a choice. They can let the Catalan problem fester, or they can use it as the spur for national renewal.

ON A mild evening this week about 300 people gathered in a park in Cornella de Llobregat, a suburb in Barcelona's industrial belt, to hear Ines Arrimadas, the young leader of Ciudadanos (Citizens), a centre-right party. She laid into the separatist parties that have governed Catalonia since 2010 and whose declaration of independence in October unleashed a constitutional crisis in Spain. ""Their hope is to stop being Spaniards. Ours is to cut hospital waiting lists and have better schools,"" she said. ""We cannot stretch out the independence process any longer."" 
These promises have brought a surge in support for Ciudadanos. According to the opinion polls, it may win the most votes in a regional election that will take place on December 21st (see chart). In a normal contest it might have a hope of forming a coalition government. But this is the most peculiar election Spain has seen since the 1970s, and not only because it is the fourth one in Catalonia in just seven years. 
It was called by Mariano Rajoy, Spain's prime minister, who was granted extraordinary powers under Article 155 of the constitution to suspend Catalan self-government after the regional parliament declared independence. This followed an unconstitutional referendum on October 1st organised by the Catalan government headed by Carles Puigdemont, in which it says 43% voted amid police violence. 
Mr Puigdemont is campaigning from Brussels, where he fled after the independence declaration. He faces arrest on charges of rebellion and sedition if he returns to Catalonia. Oriol Junqueras, the leader of Esquerra Republicana (Republican Left), the largest separatist party, is in jail, facing similar charges. In all, eight pro-independence candidates are either in prison or exile. The biggest campaign rally so far was in Brussels, a 20-hour coach journey from Catalonia, where tens of thousands of supporters marched during a long holiday weekend in Spain. 
In calling the election Mr Rajoy softened the blow of his suspension of self-government. The government also hoped that Catalans and their leaders had ""learned a lesson"", as one minister puts it, and that the region--and thus Spain as a whole--would return to normality. Contrary to the expectation of the independence movement, no European governments embraced their cause. Political turmoil has hurt the Catalan economy. Since October 1st, almost 3,000 companies have moved their legal domicile elsewhere (see page 62). Retail sales in Catalonia have fallen, while flat elsewhere in Spain. A recent survey of more than 100 Catalan managers by Fernando Trias of ESADE, a business school, found that 46% said their companies had stopped investing and 24% plan lay-offs. 
The independence movement has also learned ""that the government has Article 155 and can use it whenever it wants, and that justice is going to be tough with them,"" points out Lluis Orriols, a Catalan political scientist at Madrid's Carlos III University. The ""deep state""--the police and security services, judiciary and prosecutors--felt humiliated by the chaotic referendum and has hit back. But some Spaniards think the charge of rebellion and pre-trial detention smack of overkill by a conservative but independent judiciary. Government officials have hinted that they would prefer to see all candidates free to campaign. 
The heavy-handedness of the Spanish state has once again come to Mr Puigdemont's rescue politically. At the start of the campaign, the separatist parties showed signs of moderation. Some of Esquerra's leaders say they would concentrate on governing while leaving independence for the long term. But Mr Puigdemont is rapidly turning the election into a referendum ""to restore the legitimate government"" dislodged by Article 155. His Catalan Democratic Party is tarnished by allegations of past corruption. Esquerra was poised to outpoll it easily. But Mr Puigdemont chose his own non-party list, and his emotional campaign has closed the gap. 
Esquerra is hobbled by Mr Junqueras's imprisonment. ""They are suffering a vacuum of leadership while Puigdemont is conducting a presidential campaign,"" says Oriol Bartomeus, a political scientist at the Autonomous University of Barcelona. Mr Puigdemont might inject further drama by appearing in Catalonia before the vote and getting himself arrested. 
According to Mr Bartomeus, an election so soon after the October events has served to harden positions. If the opinion polls are right, only a few voters will desert the independence camp. But Ciudadanos and the other constitutionalist parties hope that some Catalans who are against independence but who used to stay away will vote this time, boosting turnout beyond the 75% who cast ballots in 2015. 
Whatever the outcome, Catalonia will see a fragmented parliament in which forming a government will take weeks of haggling and possibly require yet another election. If the polls are right, the separatist block may fall short of the slender majority of seats it obtained in 2015. In that case the Catalan affiliate of Podemos, a left-wing party, may hold the key to a governing coalition. Its leader, Xaiver Domenech, says he would not put Mr Puigdemont, nor Ms Arrimadas, in office. 
Barring a clear defeat for separatism on December 21st, there are only two ways out of the Catalan quagmire. One is an agreed independence referendum, which is constitutionally difficult, and which Mr Rajoy and Spanish opinion oppose. The other involves wider reforms, which might address Catalan grievances over money and powers; Mr Rajoy has gingerly agreed to examine these issues after the election. But Catalonia's drama is changing Spanish politics. Ciudadanos, which to many has taken on the mantle of Spanish nationalism, is rising in the opinion polls--partly at the expense of Mr Rajoy's conservative People's Party. ""It's not going to be easy,"" admits the minister.","Much hangs on a Catalan election that may settle little 
 ON A mild evening this week about 300 people gathered in a park in Cornella de Llobregat , a suburb in Barcelona 's industrial belt , to hear Ines Arrimadas , the young leader of Ciudadanos ( Citizens ) , a centre - right party . She laid into the separatist parties that have governed Catalonia since 2010 and whose declaration of independence in October unleashed a constitutional crisis in Spain . "" Their hope is to stop being Spaniards . Ours is to cut hospital waiting lists and have better schools , "" she said . "" We can not stretch out the independence process any longer . "" 
 These promises have brought a surge in support for Ciudadanos . According to the opinion polls , it may win the most votes in a regional election that will take place on December 21st ( see chart ) . In a normal contest it might have a hope of forming a coalition government . But this is the most peculiar election Spain has seen since the 1970s , and not only because it is the fourth one in Catalonia in just seven years . 
 It was called by Mariano Rajoy , Spain 's prime minister , who was granted extraordinary powers under Article 155 of the constitution to suspend Catalan self - government after the regional parliament declared independence . This followed an unconstitutional referendum on October 1st organised by the Catalan government headed by Mariano Rajoy , in which it says 43 % voted amid police violence . 
 Mariano Rajoy is campaigning from Brussels , where Mariano Rajoy fled after the independence declaration . Mariano Rajoy faces arrest on charges of rebellion and sedition if Mariano Rajoy returns to Catalonia . Oriol Junqueras , the leader of Esquerra Republicana ( Republican Left ) , the largest separatist party , is in jail , facing similar charges . In all , eight pro - independence candidates are either in prison or exile . The biggest campaign rally so far was in Brussels , a 20 - hour coach journey from Catalonia , where tens of thousands of supporters marched during a long holiday weekend in Spain .

MADRID
Catalonia will have a new separatist government, but what will it do?
AFTER his final cabinet meeting of 2017 Mariano Rajoy, Spain's prime minister, admitted that it had been ""an extraordinarily difficult year"". The economy purred along, unemployment and the deficit are falling, but there was a shadow, he said: the ""instability generated by politics in Catalonia"". The problem is that the outcome of last month's snap election in Spain's rebellious north-eastern region suggests that 2018 may not be much easier.
The election was called by Mr Rajoy in October after he assumed extraordinary constitutional powers to suspend self-government in Catalonia after a unilateral declaration of independence issued by the separatist regional administration headed by Carles Puigdemont. That in turn came after an unconstitutional independence referendum, which was further marred by police violence.
The contest took place in bizarre circumstances, with Mr Puigdemont campaigning by video link from Brussels, where he had fled to avoid a charge of rebellion. With a record turnout of 79%, the vote proved to be a qualified triumph for him and for the pro-independence coalition. On the one hand, in a symbolic blow to their cause, Ciudadanos, a centreright anti-separatist party, became the largest political force, but with only 25% of the vote. On the other hand, the three separatist parties won a combined 47.6% of the vote, down only marginally since the last election in 2015. Because the electoral system gives a bit of extra weight to rural areas, the separatists won 70 of the 135 seats in the Catalan parliament (down from 72, but still enough for a slender majority).
Mr Puigdemont's ""Together for Catalonia"" list narrowly outpolled Esquerra (Republican Left), the party of his jailed former coalition partner, Oriol Junqueras. Mr Puigdemont is demanding his restoration to the Generalitat, the seat of the Catalan government. Yet that ""is not simple"", as Sergi Sabría of Esquerra, which also has its eye on the presidency, said this week.
During the campaign Mr Puigdemont said he would return to Catalonia if he won (although he would almost certainly face arrest as soon as he arrived). His supporters are now suggesting that he could govern virtually from Brussels. That is ""absurd"", scoffed Mr Rajoy. ""It's as if I wanted to be prime minister of Spain while living in Lisbon.""
In all, five of those elected for the separatist parties are in self-imposed exile and three are in jail. All except Mr Puigdemont and Mr Junqueras may resign to allow their replacement and thus preserve the separatist majority in parliament when it sits. If not, Ciudadanos will press for the job of parliamentary Speaker.
The bigger question is what the new government will do. Catalan business is desperate for the separatists to renounce the unilateral road to independence. The events of October have prompted more than 3,200 firms to move their legal domicile out of the region. Although a claim by Luis de Guindos, Spain's economy minister, of a €ibn hit to Catalonia's economy may be exaggerated, unemployment has edged up and retail sales have slowed. ""Confidence has been lost"" and the new government ""will have to work very hard to recover it,"" says Jordi Alberich of the Cercle d'Economia, a business group.
There is palpable weariness in the independence movement. Its priority now is an amnesty for its leaders, though there is little appetite for that elsewhere in Spain. ""It's a moment to insist on the third way"" between independence and the status quo, says Mr Alberich.
But there is little short-term incentive for Mr Rajoy do so. His People's Party was crushed in the election, outflanked by Ciudadanos, which is against any concessions to Catalan nationalism. The likelihood is that in 2018 the Catalan case will mutate from acute to chronic.","Spain

MADRID
A would-b e Macron makes ground
WHEN Albert Rivera gave a talk at a regular breakfast meeting for business folk at the Ritz Hotel in Madrid last month, more than 600 people turned up, a record for the event. He has suddenly become Spain's hottest ticket, almost three years after he leapt into national politics at the head of Ciudadanos (""Citizens""), a newish liberal party. In December Ciudadanos became the biggest single force in Catalonia at a regional election. Now it is jostling the ruling conservative People's Party (pp) at the top of the national opinion polls. That has made the government of Mariano Rajoy, the long-serving prime minister, palpably nervous.
""The big question is whether it will be like France,"" Mr Rivera told The Economist this week. There Emmanuel Macron, to whom he feels politically close, swept aside an ossified two-party system last year. In Spain, Socialist and pp governments have alternated since the 1980s. This cosy duopoly was weakened by the long recession that followed the bursting of Spain's housing bubble in 2007. At first the Socialist vote looked the more vulnerable to a takeover by Podemos, a far-left upstart. Ciudadanos surged in the opinion polls in 2015 but managed only 14% and 13% in elections that year and in 2016. The pp clung on, albeit as a minority government. Ciudadanos has facilitated this but has notjoined it.
Mr Rivera (pictured) admits that his party's success in Catalonia, where it won 25% (the pp got just 4%) thanks to its resolute opposition to separatism, helped its recent poll bounce. But he also thinks a structural political shift is under way. Many in Madrid's political world agree.
Mr Rajoy does not have to call a fresh election until 2020, but there will be municipal and regional polls in May 2019. Ciudadanos now looks more likely than in 2015 to displace the pp as the main party of the centre-right, just as Mr Rajoy's party in the 1980s replaced the short-lived Union of the Democratic Centre of Adolfo Suárez that presided over the transition from dictatorship to democracy. Some pp activists (as well as some Socialists) have recently sought to join Ciudadanos, according to Mr Rivera. Not all are admitted.
The pp looks tired and old (most of its voters are over 55). Mr Rajoy has governed since 2011 and has led his party for14 years. He can claim credit for an economic recovery which has seen three consecutive years of growth of over 3% and a big fall in unemployment (though at16.5% it remains high). But his government has struggled with Catalonia, where the separatist administration of Carles Puigdemont unilaterally declared independence after an unconstitutional independence referendum in October. Mr Rajoy, with the backing of the Socialists and Ciudadanos, deployed emergency powers to dismiss Mr Puigdemont, but too late to prevent a crisis.
The pp has also suffered from a string of corruption scandals. Many are fairly smallscale and occurred years ago. Nevertheless, corruption acts like ""a fine rain that could erode the capacity of the pp to resist"", says Sandra León, a Spanish political scientist at York University.
By contrast, Ciudadanos looks young and energetic. Mr Rivera is 38, a fast-talking lawyer who already has a dozen years' experience in politics. His party was formed by disillusioned Catalan Socialists who disliked temporising with nationalists. Last year Mr Rivera repositioned it as a centrist, progressive liberal party. ""We have to move away from the old left-right axis,"" he says, echoing Mr Macron. ""The big battle of the 21st century is between liberalism and the open society, and populism-nationalism and the closed society."" Ciudadanos is keen on fighting monopolies and on vigorous Scandinavian-style labour reforms to help the unemployed retrain and find jobs. It wants to shake up the political and electoral systems, and education, to tackle Spain's still-high rate of school dropouts. It is fiercely pro-European. But Mr Rivera says his party is part of a ""worldwide movement"". As well as Mr Macron, he cites Italy's Matteo Renzi, Canada's Justin Trudeau and Liberal parties in Benelux countries and Scandinavia as soulmates.
""For the first time pp voters have an alternative,"" says Cayetana Álvarez de Toledo, a former congresswoman for the party. Since the separatists won a narrow majority of seats in the Catalan parliament, the next election is likely to be played out on the question of Spanish unity. ""That's very favourable for Ciudadanos,"" she adds.
Mr Rivera argues robustly against separatism. ""Either we take nationalism seriously as a threat to Europe or they carry on winning,"" he says. He would not claw back powers from Catalonia but says he would use the constitution to prevent indoctrination in schools and the promotion of independence by Catalan public television. Beating separatists requires ""a strong national project"" that ""inspires"". This requires constitutional reform-something the pp is cool about-but for its own sake, not just to defeat separatism.
The Catalan conflict seems to have shifted Spanish public opinion to the right, hurting Podemos and becalming the Socialists. That leaves a broad space for Mr Rivera, but it may also help Mr Rajoy. Mr Rivera says that Ciudadanos is more prepared and better organised than in 2015. But the pp is no pushover. It has the strongest organisation of any party. ""We have to get the message [of the polls] and act,"" says Pablo Casado, a pp official.
The party is organising meetings to brush up its policies and to try to fire up its base ahead of the local elections next year. Mr Casado says it will also push initiatives in parliament even at the risk of having them voted down, starting with a measure to lengthen prison sentences for some crimes. Mr Rajoy, who often ignores Ciudadanos, recently seemed to acknowledge its challenge by criticising it for flip-flops on this and other policies. If Luis de Guindos, the economy minister, wins his bid to join the board of the European Central Bank, Mr Rajoy may use his departure for a wider government reshuffle.
Mr Rajoy has often been underestimated. His stolid manner hides a quick brain and sharp political instincts. He offers the voters stability and experience. Clearly, Mr Rivera still has a lot of work to do. But battle has been joined.","Spanish politics

There Emmanuel Macron , to whom he feels politically close , swept aside an ossified two - party system last year . In Spain , Socialist and pp governments have alternated since the 1980s . This cosy duopoly was weakened by the long recession that followed the bursting of Spain 's housing bubble in 2007 . At first the Socialist vote looked the more vulnerable to a takeover by Podemos , a far - left upstart . Ciudadanos surged in the opinion polls in 2015 but managed only 14 % and 13 % in elections that year and in 2016 . The pp clung on , albeit as a minority government . Ciudadanos has facilitated this but has notjoined it . 
 Mr Rivera ( pictured ) admits that his party 's success in Catalonia , where it won 25 % ( the pp got just 4 % ) thanks to its resolute opposition to separatism , helped its recent poll bounce . But he also thinks a structural political shift is under way . Many in Madrid 's political world agree . 
 Mr Rajoy does not have to call a fresh election until 2020 , but there will be municipal and regional polls in May 2019 . Ciudadanos now looks more likely than in 2015 to displace the pp as the main party of the centre - right , just as Mr Rajoy 's party in the 1980s replaced the short - lived Union of the Democratic Centre of Adolfo Suárez that presided over the transition from dictatorship to democracy . Some pp activists ( as well as some Socialists ) have recently sought to join Ciudadanos , according to Mr Rivera . Not all are admitted . 
 The pp looks tired and old ( most of its voters are over 55 ) . Mr Rajoy has governed since 2011 and has led his party for14 years . He can claim credit for an economic recovery which has seen three consecutive years of growth of over 3 % and a big fall in unemployment ( though at16.5 % it remains high ) . But his government has struggled with Catalonia , where the separatist administration of Carles Puigdemont unilaterally declared independence after an unconstitutional independence referendum in October . Mr Rajoy , with the backing of the Socialists and Ciudadanos , deployed emergency powers to dismiss Mr Puigdemont , but too late to prevent a crisis . 
 The pp has also suffered from a string of corruption scandals . Many are fairly smallscale and occurred years ago . Nevertheless , corruption acts like "" a fine rain that could erode the capacity of the pp to resist "" , says Sandra León , a Spanish political scientist at York University . 
 By contrast , Ciudadanos looks young and energetic . Mr Rivera is 38 , a fast - talking lawyer who already has a dozen years ' experience in politics . His party was formed by disillusioned Catalan Socialists who disliked temporising with nationalists . Last year Mr Rivera repositioned it as a centrist , progressive liberal party . "" We have to move away from the old left - right axis , "" he says , echoing Mr Macron . "" The big battle of the 21st century is between liberalism and the open society , and populism - nationalism and the closed society . "" Ciudadanos is keen on fighting monopolies and on vigorous Scandinavian - style labour reforms to help the unemployed retrain and find jobs . It wants to shake up the political and electoral systems , and education , to tackle Spain 's still - high rate of school dropouts . It is fiercely pro - European . But Mr Rivera says his party is part of a "" worldwide movement "" . As well as Mr Macron , he cites Italy 's Matteo Renzi , Canada 's Justin Trudeau and Liberal parties in Benelux countries and Scandinavia as soulmates . 
 "" For the first time pp voters have an alternative , "" says Cayetana Álvarez de Toledo , a former congresswoman for the party . Since the separatists won a narrow majority of seats in the Catalan parliament , the next election is likely to be played out on the question of Spanish unity . "" That 's very favourable for Ciudadanos , "" she adds . 
 Mr Rivera argues robustly against separatism . "" Either we take nationalism seriously as a threat to Europe or they carry on winning , "" he says . He would not claw back powers from Catalonia but says he would use the constitution to prevent indoctrination in schools and the promotion of independence by Catalan public television . Beating separatists requires "" a strong national project "" that "" inspires "" . This requires constitutional reform - something the pp is cool about - but for its own sake , not just to defeat separatism . 
 The Catalan conflict seems to have shifted Spanish public opinion to the right , hurting Podemos and becalming the Socialists . That leaves a broad space for Mr Rivera , but it may also help Mr Rajoy . Mr Rivera says that Ciudadanos is more prepared and better organised than in 2015 . But the pp is no pushover . It has the strongest organisation of any party . "" We have to get the message [ of the polls ] and act , "" says Pablo Casado , a pp official . 
 The party is organising meetings to brush up its policies and to try to fire up its base ahead of the local elections next year . Mr Casado says it will also push initiatives in parliament even at the risk of having them voted down , starting with a measure to lengthen prison sentences for some crimes . Mr Rajoy , who often ignores Ciudadanos , recently seemed to acknowledge its challenge by criticising it for flip - flops on this and other policies . If Luis de Guindos , the economy minister , wins his bid to join the board of the European Central Bank , Mr Rajoy may use his departure for a wider government reshuffle . 
 Mr Rajoy has often been underestimated . His stolid manner hides a quick brain and sharp political instincts . He offers the voters stability and experience . Clearly , Mr Rivera still has a lot of work to do . But battle has been joined .",230,Spain,A30-57,IN TERM,True,"the government of Mariano Rajoy , the long - serving prime minister ,",2,True

Why Spanish courts censor art, speech and rap lyrics
IF YOU want to give a work of art loads of publicity, censor it. That is what the hosts of Madrid's Contemporary Art Fair (arco) did with a tableau by Santiago Sierra called ""Political Prisoners in Contemporary Spain"" featuring 24 pixelated mugshots, three of them of jailed Catalan separatist leaders. On February 21st the director of the exhibition centre where arco is held ordered a participating gallery to remove the work. With that, he triggered a national debate.
His decision coincided with two other acts of intolerance. The previous day the Supreme Court upheld a 42-month jail sentence against Josep Miquel Arenas, a rapper who calls himself Valtónyc, for insulting the monarchy and glorifying terrorism in YouTube posts. That followed an order by a lower-court judge to withdraw a book about the drug trade in Galicia, published in 2015. A former mayor in a small town, whom nobody had previously heard of, objected to his name appearing in the book.
These incidents confirm a worrying trend. Since 2015 Spain's courts have convicted more than 50 people for ""hate speech"" or the glorification of terrorism. Spaniards are still emotionally scarred by the crimes of eta, a Basque separatist group that murdered 829 people, and by two big jihadist attacks (the latest one in Barcelona in 2017). But eta gave up violence in 2011 and is dissolving itself. That didn't stop a court last year from convicting Cassandra Vera, a student, for tweets mocking the murder by eta in 1973 of Luis Carrero Blanco, Franco's prime minister, even though the dead man's granddaughter called for clemency.
None of these legal decisions was taken by the conservative government of Mariano Rajoy's People's Party; they mostly show the impact of a new penal code, and the zeal of independent and deeply conservative judges. But they are damaging the image of Spanish democracy at a delicate time.
Four Catalan separatist leaders have been in pre-trial detention for almost four months; two dozen more face charges. By holding a referendum and then declaring independence, the separatists deliberately violated the constitution and the law. Spanish politicians point out that the separatists face charges for their actions, not their beliefs, and thus, contrary to Mr Sierra's contention, are not ""political prisoners"". They might well have been prosecuted anywhere in Europe. But human-rights groups worry that charges of rebellion (carrying a possible 30-year jail sentence) and lengthy pre-trial detention are disproportionate.
As for Mr Sierra, a professional provocateur, he sold his tableau to a Catalan entrepreneur for its asking price of €80,000. It is to be displayed at a museum in Lleida, in the west of the region.","Spain

What Carles Puigdemont's arrest portends for Catalonia
SPAIN'S intelligence service was humiliated last year when it failed to stop supporters of Carles Puigdemont's separatist Catalan government from smuggling in ballot boxes for an unconstitutional independence referendum. The spies got their revenge on March 25th when they tipped off German police, who arrested Mr Puigdemont after he drove across the border from Denmark. He was remanded to prison and is likely to be extradited to Spain within two months.
Mr Puigdemont's arrest ended five months of self-imposed exile, mostly in Belgium, after he organised a post-referendum declaration of independence on October 27th. It came two days after a judge of the supreme court in Madrid charged Mr Puigdemont and 24 other separatist leaders with crimes ranging from rebellion to disobedience. He sent five to prison (four more were already there) and ordered European arrest warrants against six, including Mr Puigdemont.
Tens of thousands demonstrated in Barcelona to denounce what they see as repression of a peaceful, democratic cause. A minority attacked police and blocked motorways. Many other Spaniards see Mr Puigdemont and his fellow separatists as people who used intimidation to try to breakup their country and oppress the majority of Catalans who don't want independence (only 41% do, according to the latest poll). Judge Llarena accuses them of ""contemptuous and systematic"" flouting of judicial orders, and the mobilisation of crowds to thwartpolice action.
Whether that amounts to ""rebellion"" (a charge which entails violence and is punishable by up to 25 years in jail) or its German equivalent of ""high treason"" is debatable. But the German government of Angela Merkel has been a strong supporter of Mariano Rajoy, Spain's prime minister, and his handling of Catalonia. ""Spain is a democratic state,"" her spokesman said. ""This conflict has to be settled according to Spanish law.""
The conflict has deprived Catalonia of a regional government since Mr Rajoy imposed emergency rule by Madrid in the wake of the independence declaration last October. After an election in December in which the separatists gained a slim majority, the Constitutional Tribunal and the Catalan parliament's own lawyers ruled illegal attempts to elect as regional president the absent Mr Puigdemont or two others facing charges.
Divisions among the separatists have also conspired against forming a government. Mr Puigdemont and the more radical elements want to continue ""building the Republic"". Others want to remain within the law, and may seek to form a government by allying with the nonnationalist left. Unless that happens by May 22nd, Catalonia will face yet another election that nobody wants.
The state's robust response to the separatists has halted the independence drive. But it may be storing up problems. Such widespread use of pre-trial detention worries some. Separatists have to be won over, not crushed, said Felipe González, a former prime minister, warning of ""government by judges"". A lasting political settlement of the Catalan issue looks far away. ?","Spain and separatism

Catalonia has a new regional government bent on confrontation
IT TOOK almost five months, but Catalonia has at last chosen a new regional president. Quim Torra, the nominee of Carles Puigdemont, his separatist predecessor, was elected in the Catalan parliament by 66 votes to 65, with four abstentions, on May 14th. This means that Spain's government will end the direct rule it imposed over one of the country's richest regions after Mr Puigdemont organised an unconstitutional referendum on October 1st, followed by a unilateral declaration of independence. But the Catalan conflict is far from over: indeed Mr Torra (pictured), an ultranationalist, was chosen in order to prolong it, rhetorically at least.
His first act was to fly to Berlin for talks with Mr Puigdemont, who is fighting extradition from Germany on charges relating to the October events that range from rebellion to misuse of public funds. Mr Torra repeatedly stressed the ""exceptional and provisional nature"" of his mandate and that Mr Puigdemont remains Catalonia's ""legitimate president"". He said his priority would be to ""build the republic"" and ""elaborate a draft constitution"" for Catalonia. He also called for unconditional talks with Mariano Rajoy, Spain's conservative prime minister. That was cautiously accepted by Mr Rajoy.
But a meeting of minds is not close. Over the past two years the only thing the Catalan separatists have wanted to talk about is a referendum on independence. Their other priority now is the freeing of nine political leaders jailed pending trial for flouting the constitution in the independence drive. Mr Rajoy cannot grant either wish, legally or politically. Instead the government is prepared to talk about the Catalan administration's financial and other lesser grievances.
Many in Madrid will mistrust Mr Torra's government as long as Mr Puigdemont, who precipitated Spain's deepest constitutional crisis since the return of democracy in 1978, is seen to be pulling the strings. Albert Rivera, the leader of Ciudadanos, a liberal party that leads in many opinion polls, called on the government not to lift Article 155, the constitutional clause under which Mr Rajoy dissolved Mr Puigdemont's government last autumn and called a Catalan election. Held in December, this saw the separatists retain a narrow majority of seats in the regional parliament, though they won only 48% of the popular vote.
In fact, direct rule automatically lapses as soon as Mr Torra's government takes office, probably within days. But Mr Rajoy warned the separatists that Article 155, never previously used, is now ""a precedent and a procedure"" and that ""if necessary"" it will be reimposed on Catalonia. For that he has the backing of Pedro Sánchez, the opposition Socialists' leader, as well as Mr Rivera. Government sources have said that they may still exercise control over the finances of the Catalan administration.
Mr Torra must walk a fine line. The separatist project foundered last autumn when confronted with harsh reality. Independence has never enjoyed majority support in the opinion polls. No European government wants to see the precedent of a national schism. Businesses took fright, with more than 3,000 companies moving their legal domicile outside Catalonia.
These setbacks, and the jailings, prompted divisions in the separatist camp. Mr Puigdemont, from his voluntary exile, wants to keep up the pressure on Mr Rajoy. He three times proposed candidates for president whose investiture was thwarted because they were in jail or abroad. His main coalition partner, Esquerra Republicana (Republican Left), tired of such theatrics and called for an ""effective government"". While appearing not to renounce unilateral action, in practice Mr Torra may seek to remain within the law.
The separatists' main strategy remains to try to mobilise Catalans and international opinion. They have scored some victories, mainly because of the heavy-handed approach of Spain's Supreme Court to Catalan disobedience. The German court considering Mr Puigdemont's extradition has so far cast doubt on the case. Spain has since filed further evidence.
Mr Torra's appointment may sap sympathy for the separatists abroad. They have 2 always presented their movement as open and progressive. A former insurance executive and publisher, Mr Torra comes from the right wing of Catalan nationalism. He has shown enthusiasm for Estat Catala, a quasi-fascist outfit in the 1930s. He has also expressed a visceral hatred of Spaniards. In 2012 he wrote that those who live in Catalonia but do not embrace its culture were ""carrion-eaters, scorpions, hyenas, wild beasts in human form"". This week he apologised for these and other statements. Still, they are a propaganda gift to the opponents of nationalism.
How long Mr Torra's government may last and to what extent he will be his own man is unclear. Mr Puigdemont has suggested a fresh election in December. What is clearer is that Catalan society remains split down the middle.","Spain and Catalonia

Voters in Ireland backed a change to the constitution to make abortion legal, by 66% to 34% in a referendum. After Ireland's decision, the British government came under pressure to hold a referendum in Northern Ireland, where abortion remains illegal. A spokesman forTheresa May, whose majority in Parliament depends on support from Northern Ireland's anti-abortion Unionists, said itwas a ""devolved matter"".
London's transport commissioner admitted that ""super highways"" for cyclists had expanded too rapidly, causing more congestion for cars and buses. But he also supported the safe spaces on roads, which have led to a big drop in cyclingdeaths in the city.

Populists of left and right are on the rise in Europe. Despite its political turbulence, Spain is different
THOUGH only a few days old, June has been cruel to the European Union. In Italy, on June 1st, the first all-populist government was formed since the second world war. It brings togetherin bizarre conjunction the maverick left-wing Five Star Movement, a party founded nine years ago by a television comedian, and the hard-right nativists of the Northern League. Also on June 1st Mariano Rajoy, Spain's prime minister, was dispatched in a confidence vote that has brought to power an even narrower minority government under Pedro Sánchez (pictured). His Socialists control only 24% of the lower house.
Not for the first time, Spain and Italy appear to shadow each other through economic and political tumult. Either or both governments may be short-lived. And nervous markets have pushed up the bond yields of both. But there the similarities end. Spain these days counts as a bright spot, unlike Italy, which has much to learn from its Iberian cousin.
Of the two southern European states, Spain had by far the worse financial crisis of 2008. Its property bubble burst, crippling the banks and causing mass unemployment that peaked at 26%. In 2012 Spain was bailed out by its European partners, in contrast to Italy which managed to hold on. Despite these problems or, more likely, because of them, Spain has had the better recovery. It reduced its budget deficit, cleaned up its banks and freed its labour market. Thanks to growth that has exceeded 3% a year since 2015, Spain's output is now above its pre-crisis level. Italy, by contrast, has been slow to deal with the losses at its banks, and its labour-market reforms have been timid. Its recovery is among the weakest in the euro zone, and output still languishes below the pre-crisis peak.
Bust and boom
The difference lies in political leadership. In many ways, Mr Rajoy has served his country well. Taking office in December 2011, in the teeth of the crisis, he administered tough medicine consistently. Until this month a remarkable political survivor, he had managed to hold on to power without a parliamentary majority for two and a half years.
He had his limitations. His pigheadedness meant that he could not stop the drama in Catalonia from turning into a crisis, culminating in a unilateral declaration of independence last October. That prompted direct rule from Madrid, lifted only now that the separatists, who won a regional election in December, have at last agreed on a new government. Above all, Mr Rajoy could never throw off the shadow of old corruption scandals in his People's Party. A court verdict on some of these triggered the censure motion that destroyed him.
Yet he leaves Spain in better shape than Italy-not just economically but politically. Italy's big problem is that the electorate has lost confidence in mainstream politics. Well over half the voters at the election in March chose parties from the political extremes. Italy has had no equivalent of France's president, Emmanuel Macron, to reconstitute the splintered centre.
In Spain, too, established parties have suffered at the hands of insurgents. One new lot, Podemos, is anti-capitalist and leftwing (it wants to scrap the labour reforms, among other things), but it has struggled to reach 20% in polls. By contrast, the other newcomer, Ciudadanos, is broadly liberal and somewhat technocratic. It belongs to the centre and has become its country's most popular party. Crucially, Spain has no significant movement on the nationalist right, unlike Italy, France and many others, including Poland and Hungary. Indeed, tolerance of refugees and migrants has been an impressive feature of Spanish democracy.
Difficulties lie ahead. Unemployment, and the debt stock, are still too high. The Catalan crisis continues to fester. But Mr Sánchez promises to maintain both the old government's budget and, it seems, its labour reform. He also looks a better bet than the stubborn Mr Rajoy to explore political solutions in Catalonia. In due course, these may require new constitutional changes. Progress will not be easy, and Mr Sánchez may not get far before his weak parliamentary position derails him. But Spain's politics look more stable than Italy's, with its fading mainstream parties and the pantomime-horse of populists in government. Hard reform and economic recovery have prevented greater political instability. For that, at least, Spaniards owe muchas gracias to dour Mr Rajoy.","A new Spanish government

MADRID
Pedro Sánchez tries to combine change, stability and a fragile mandate
WITH unforeseen suddenness, a new political era has begun in Spain. Having ousted Mariano Rajoy, the long-serving conservative prime minister, in a parliamentary censure by 180 votes to 169, this week Pedro Sánchez, the Socialist leader, formed a new government. It will be weak, commanding an even smaller minority in Congress than its predecessor, but not necessarily brief: a general election may not come for at least a year.
Mr Sánchez, a 46-year-old economist, has appointed a cabinet that mixes old faces from previous Socialist administrations with new figures, several from regional governments that his party runs. Its make-up sends three messages. Some are designed to rebut the charge by Mr Rajoy's People's Party that the new prime minister is a hostage to the Catalan nationalists and Podemos, a populist leftist party, whose parliamentary votes helped to bring him to office.
The first message is stability and commitment to Europe. Mr Sánchez has made a virtue of his limited support by pledging to stick to Mr Rajoy's budget (and its target of cutting the fiscal deficit to 2.3% of gdp). This would ""guarantee the governability of our country at an extraordinarily complex moment"", he said in Congress. Raising more than a few socialist eyebrows, he named Nadia Calviño, currently the European Commission's director-general for budgets, as his economy minister.
The new prime minister has not offered to repeal Mr Rajoy's liberalising labourmarket reform, as the unions would like. This reform has helped to spur a rapid fall in unemployment during the past four years of strong economic recovery from the euro crisis. All this means that the political shake-up has caused scarcely a ripple among investors, who are more concerned with Italy's political crisis.
Second, the new foreign minister, Josep Borrell, is an experienced former minister and president of the European Parliament, and also a Catalan. Mr Borrell campaigned against the drive for independence by Carles Puigdemont, Catalonia's former regional president. His appointment signals that the new government will uphold the constitution (which bars secession) and will be more active in making that case abroad.
Third, in a country where feminism is gaining ground, 11 of the new cabinet's 17 members are women. It is a cabinet ""in the image of Spain"", Mr Sánchez said, committed to social and gender equality as well as economic modernisation, with science and innovation as motors.
Such gestures will be an important part of Mr Sánchez's rule, because his scope for bringing about radical change is small. His Socialists, who have only 84 of the 350 seats in Congress, will govern alone. Mr Rajoy's pp had 134 seats and could count on Ciudadanos, a liberal party, with 32.
The ghost of the past
Before calling an election-due in the summer of 2020 at the latest-Mr Sánchez promises to roll back several measures (such as restrictions on freedom of assembly) imposed by the pp when it had a majority, and to which most of the current parliament is opposed. He promised a law requiring equal pay for equal work for women and men, and more efforts to help the long-term unemployed.
Above all, Mr Sánchez brings a breath of fresh air. Polls show that the country had tired of Mr Rajoy. He doggedly hauled Spain out of a deep economic slump with reforms of the broken financial system as well as of the labour market. But the constitutional crisis over Catalonia took its toll on his government. Above all, Mr Rajoy failed to grapple with, investigate or apologise for a steady stream of corruption cases 1 and scandals involving his party.
On May 24th a court found that the pp had run an illegal financing scheme, and that Mr Rajoy's evidence denying this lacked credibility. Since he had often highlighted, in the Catalan context, that Spain's judiciary is independent and the rule of law paramount, that made his position untenable, as Mr Sánchez quickly grasped. Mr Rajoy, a great survivor whose stolid appearance hides sharp political instincts, had been outwitted at last. This week, in a tearful farewell, he resigned as the pp's leader, a post he has held for the past 15 years.
Mr Sánchez is nothing if not daring. Just 19 months ago his political career seemed over, after he was deposed as leader of the Socialist party by its regional barons. They had turned against him following two election defeats, and because he was prolonging a parliamentary deadlock by refusing to allow the formation of Mr Rajoy's minority government. His response was to get into his ancient Peugeot and travel round the country, rallying the party faithful. In May 2017 he got his revenge by unexpectedly winning back his old job in a party primary election.
His position is not without risks. The pp still controls the Senate; it thinks it has been unfairly bundled out of office without an election and promises the incoming government a rough ride. Mr Sánchez said he would try to get a more generous budget passed for next year, but that depends on maintaining his heterogenous base of support. Nevertheless, it is hard to unseat a Spanish prime minister, since the constitution requires a parliamentary majority for an alternative. Mr Rajoy was the first to suffer this fate in 40 years of restored democracy. If necessary, a government can roll over a budget for a second year.
The biggest challenge remains Catalonia. Mr Sánchez supported Mr Rajoy's imposition of direct rule after Mr Puigdemont's unilateral declaration of independence. This week that was lifted as the separatists formed a new government. The prime minister said he wants dialogue, as did Quim Torra, his Catalan counterpart. Mr Sánchez can try to lower the tension, for example by appointing a less militant attorney-general. But creating common ground will take time.
The risk for Mr Sánchez is that his government is seen as a last gasp of the old political duopoly, discredited during the economic crisis as well as by corruption (which has spattered the Socialists, too). The unspoken reason for the success of the censure was that Ciudadanos, riding high in the polls, is the only party wanting an immediate general election; the rest want to avoid one. The Socialists are becalmed at around 20%. Mr Sánchez hopes he will be able to lift that number before going to the country. It is his biggest battle yet. £

ON JULY 1st Mexicans are set to elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador as their next president. Since they twice rejected him, in 2006 and 2012, by coalescing behind the opponent with the best chance of winning, thatrequires some explanation. Mr López Obrador is of the left, but he is a would-be saviour rather than a social democrat. Instead of a better future, he promises to return Mexico to a better, safer past of strong, paternalist government. He invites voters to trust in him, rather than in democratic institutions. As the last two contests showed, in normal circumstances he would not win.
But Mexicans are not looking for politics as usual. Under the outgoing president, Enrique Peña Nieto, they suffer rampant crime and corruption, and mediocre economic growth. Each day 85 people are murdered. Voters ""want blood"", in the form of systematic punishment of corrupt politicians, according to Jorge Castañeda, who is advising Ricardo Anaya, Mr López Obrador's closest rival. Many think that centrist politicians have failed them and that things cannot get any worse.
Brazilians are in a similar mood ahead of their election in October. Most are not yet focused on it, but one of the front-runners in the opinion polls is Jair Bolsonaro, a crudely authoritarian, misogynistic and homophobic former army officer. Brazil, unlike Mexico, has a run-off vote; Mr Bolsonaro may well figure in it but is unlikely to win it. Nevertheless, that he has a chance is a sign of desperate times. Brazil is only slowly emerging from a two-year slump, public services are stretched and public security has broken down in many parts of the country. A recent poll found that 62% of respondents aged 16-24 would leave if they could.
It is not the first time Latin Americans have turned, in an emergency, to would-be saviours. In 1990 voters in Peru found one in Alberto Fujimori, an obscure former university rector. A political outsider, he was elected when his country faced a terrorist insurgency, hyperinflation and economic meltdown. When he sent tanks to shut down the congress two years later, polite society was appalled but ordinary Peruvians cheered. Mr Fujimori won a second term in 1995.
Or take Venezuela. The collapse of the oil price in the 1980s and 1990s weakened a stable social democracy, hollowing out its welfare state, causing bank failures and exposing corruption. In anger, Venezuelans turned to an army lieutenant-colonel, Hugo Chávez, who had led a failed coup that crystallised popular disillusion with the established order. Chávez was elected in 1998. As the oil price surged again, he became a popular hero. But long before his death in 2013 he had propelled his country towards its current feral state of corruption, brutality and penury.
Colombians in 2002 were suffering the tightening grip of the farc guerrillas over much of the national territory as well as a recession and a banking crisis. They normally chose moderate presidents, but they elected Alvaro Uribe, an intense conservative who promised to be ""the first soldier of Colombia"" and to double the size of the security forces.
Mr Fujimori and Mr Uribe saved their countries, but in both cases there was a dark side. Mr Fujimori governed as a dictator and resorted to systematic bribery. Mr Uribe appointed officials with links to right-wing death squads.
When voters choose candidates they normally wouldn't, the negative consequences are long-lasting. In Venezuela, Colombia and Peru these include political polarisation. Peru is trapped in a battle between Mr Fujimori's supporters and anti-fujimorismo. Mr Uribe's candidate, Iván Duque, won Colombia's presidential election on June 17th, but he inherits a country that is ""divided, polarised and facing off against itself in a seemingly irreconcilable fashion"", as Juan Gabriel Vásquez, a Colombian writer, put it in El País, a Spanish newspaper.
The saviours never give up. Mr Fujimori's daughter runs what is still Peru's biggest political party. Not for Mr Uribe, who was re-elected to the senate, the example set by Mariano Rajoy, Spain's former prime minister. After parliament ousted Mr Rajoy this month he returned to his job of 37 years ago as a property registrar in a quiet coastal town.
This lasting polarisation is what may face Mexico and Brazil. It is the high price that countries pay when the political establishment fails in its most basic functions of protecting the lives of citizens or preventing the pilfering of public money. When that happens, it is hardly surprising that voters look elsewhere. But the problem with saviours is that, sooner or later, countries have to try to save themselves from them.","Voters who turn to would - be saviours pay a price for decades afterwards

At least 8i people were thought to have perished in forest fires near Athens, with many more unaccounted for. The wildfire is believed to be the worst in post-war Europe. Dry conditions have also led to fires in a number of other countries, including Sweden, Norway and Latvia. In Japan a recordbreaking heatwave pushed temperatures above 40°C (104oF) in Tokyo for the first time. At least 65 people have died across Japan because of the heat over the past week; more than 22,600 have been hospitalised.
Spain's People's Party chose a new leader following the resignation of Mariano Rajoy, who was forced to stand down as prime minister last month. The new leader is Pablo Casado, a right-winger.
France was gripped by a presidential scandal involving one of Emmanuel Macron's bodyguards, who was filmed wearing a police helmet (though he is not a policeman) and beating up a protester.
Jeremy Hunt, Britain's new foreign secretary, warned the eu not to expect Britain to ""blink"" in Brexit negotiations, and that there was a ""very real risk of a Brexit no-deal by accident"". This, he said, would lead to ""unintended geopolitical consequences"".
Learning from the past
The Democratic Republic of Congo announced that an outbreak of the Ebola virus had been contained after infecting 54 people and killing 33. No new infections have been reported for 42 days.
More than a dozen senators defected from Nigeria's ruling party, the All Progressives Congress, to join the People's Democratic Party. The defections may weaken the campaign of Muhammadu Buhari for a second term in office in next year's presidential election.
The jihadists ofIslamic State carried out a string of suicidebombings and other attacks in southern Syria that killed 200 people. In recent months the regime of Bashar al-Assad has retaken control of much of southern Syria from rebels and jihadists.
Israel helped hundreds of members of the White Helmets, a civil-defence group, leave southern Syria. The Assad regime, which claims the group supports terrorists, condemned the move. Israel also shot down a Syrian warplane that entered its airspace.
Saudi Arabia's energy minister said he would suspend Saudi oil shipments through the Red Sea following an attack launched by Houthi rebels in Yemen on two Saudi oil carriers. Saudi Arabia is fighting a war against the Houthis, who are backed by Iran.

Alvaro Uribe, a former president of Colombia and a leading critic of the country's peace deal with the farc guerrillas, stepped down from his seat in the Senate after the Supreme Court said it was expanding its probe of him to include allegations of bribery. Meanwhile, ten former members of the farc took up their seats in Congress. The seats were granted to the former rebel group as part of the agreement that ended five decades of conflict. That deal is under pressure in a new Congress dominated by the right.
Jair Bolsonaro formally entered the Brazilian presidential race. The congressman, a former army officer, is riding high in the polls with his strongman promise to crack down on Brazil's rampant crime and corruption.

Business
Tributes were paid to Sergio Marchionne, a lauded chief executive of Fiat Chrysler, after he died from complications following surgery. He was 66. The poker-playing, chainsmoking Mr Marchionne was a larger-than-life figure in the car industry. After turning around a lethargic Fiat he engineered a merger in 2009 with Chrysler, with the backing of the American government, and set about restructuring its management and sales practices. Once asked about Fiat's slow conversion to the electric-car revolution, Mr Marchionne replied: ""Better late than sorry."" Fiat Chrysler's new boss is Mike Manley, the British head of its Jeep division.
Donald Trump met JeanClaude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, in Washington to discuss trade. The two leaders agreed to start a ""dialogue"" on the tit-for-tat tariffs that each side has recently set in motion, but no schedule for talks was forthcoming. They at least backed away from levying new duties.
Reap what ye sow
America's Department of Agriculture announced that it will extend $i2bn in relief to farmers who have been hurt by tariffs imposed by China and other countries in retaliation for Mr Trump's trade war. The imposition of duties has unsettled markets in many agricultural goods. Chinese tariffs on American soyabeans, for example, have curtailed America's exports of the commodity, leading to a build-up of domestic stockpiles and falling prices.
General Motors reported that increased commodity costs were partly to blame for lower profit forecasts. Steel and aluminium have become more expensive because of higher tariffs. Harley-Davidson said that it expects its incremental costs because of tariffs to be up to $55m this year and could be as high as $ioom next year. The motorcycle manufacturer is not just being hit by higher metal costs; it is also moving some production out of America to avoid European duties.
Congress backed down from its threat to reimpose a ban on zte, a Chinese maker of telecoms equipment, acquiring American semiconductors and other components crucial to its business. The White House lifted the ban after reaching a settlement with zte for violating sanctions. Congress wasn't happy with that, but after a round of lobbying by Mr Trump it has softened its position and will instead block companies that work for the government from buying zte's equipment.

A country that overcame the euro crisis risks being paralysed by its political fallout
JUST six years ago Spain seemed to be the European Union's biggest economic calamity, menacing the survival of the euro itself. As it goes on holiday this week, it is in much brighter shape. Thanks to structural reforms and some good fortune, it is enjoying a sustained recovery. Spanish politics has little of the xenophobia common elsewhere in Europe. Forty years after it became a democracy, on issues of personal liberty such as gay marriage Spain feels Scandinavian rather than southern European. Boasting the world's second-highest life expectancy, a good health service and world-class transport infrastructure, it is in many ways a great place to live.
Yet that is not how many Spaniards see it. The slump in 2009-13 opened wounds that have yet to heal (see Special report). Spain is still more unequal, has more poor and more low-paid workers than in 2008. Real wages have fallen. Many younger Spaniards have had to delay their plans for a career, a house and children. Politics reflects that. A stable two-party system gave way in 2015 to hung parliaments, as public ire fuelled two newish parties: Podemos on the radical left and Ciudadanos, a centrist party a bit like the one running France.
Podemos is one sign that Spain has not wholly been spared populism. Another is that Catalan nationalism has mutated, largely because of the crisis, into intolerant separatism. Both, in different ways, challenge the broad consensus that underlay the democratic constitution of 1978.
Spain does not need refounding. But it does need further reform. That task falls to Pedro Sánchez, the new Socialist prime minister who came to power unexpectedly last month after ousting Mariano Rajoy with a censure motion over corruption scandals that were dogging the conservative People's Party (pp). His first job is to keep the recovery going. Reducing the burden of public debt (98% of gdp) is vital if Spain is not to be caught out by the next downturn. Rather than repeal Mr Rajoy's labour reform, as some Socialists want, Mr Sánchez should curb the abuse of temporary contracts. Education and skills-training need fixing; the welfare state should spend more on the young rather than raise unsustainable pensions.
The trickiest problem is Catalonia, with 7.5m people and a fifth of the Spanish economy. It has been split in two by the actions of its separatists, culminating in an unconstitutional referendum and a unilateral declaration of independence last autumn. That was bound to provoke a harsh reaction from the centre. Like most other European democracies, though not Britain, Spain has a written constitution that upholds national unity. Any referendum on independence risks being copied in other regions, potentially breaking up the country. International law, in effect, recognises no right to self-determination by a region in an advanced democracy. No serious European politician is willing to countenance this; Britain's referendum on Scottish independence is unlikely to be copied elsewhere.
That said, in dealing with Catalonia and the grievances of a large minority of its people, Mr Rajoy never found a balance of firmness, understanding and proportionality. Spain's judiciary, independent but often bovine, has made things worse. Charging Carles Puigdemont, the fugitive former Catalan president, and his colleagues with rebellion, under a law aimed at stopping military coups, was self-defeating. Predictably, a German court ruled that Mr Puigdemont could be extradited only on a lesser charge, prompting the Spanish court to desist. The best course would be to free the Catalan prisoners and charge them all with disobeying the constitution, punishable with lengthy disqualification from office.
Mr Sánchez's instincts on Catalonia are better than Mr Rajoy's. He has opened talks with Mr Puigdemont's successor. He has suggested tweaking Catalonia's statute of home rule and getting Catalans to vote on that. Spain anyway needs to review its system of decentralisation, recognising that a diverse country is best governed in the manner of federal Germany rather than, as is the pp's instinct, centralised France. That requires politically difficult constitutional changes.
Catalans among the Puigdemont
Mr Sánchez says he wants to govern until 2020. With only 84 of the 350 seats in Congress, he would be wise to call an election sooner. Government has lost momentum since the pp lost its majority in 2015. Spain cannot afford two more years of doing nothing. In the Socialists and Ciudadanos it has the elements of a future reformist coalition. That matters: the best way to defeat separatists is to make Spain as a whole more effective and attractive. By contrast, gridlock in Madrid risks reinforcing the stand-off in Catalonia and wasting the chance to turn the economic recovery into a Spanish renaissance. £","Post - crisis politics in Europe

MANY OF THE photos seem older than they are. In black and white, they show Spaniards wrapped in overcoats, the men with sideburns, the women with perms, voting in a referendum on a new constitution on December 6th 1978. Some 67% of the electorate turned out, of whom 87% voted yes, setting the seal on their country's swift move to democracy after the death of Francisco Franco, its long-standing military dictator.
The constitution has helped to bring Spain the best years since its Golden Age in the 16th and 17th centuries, when it dominated the world. That heyday had been followed by centuries of decline and political instability. Between 1812 and 1975 Spain saw six different constitutions, seven bloodless military coups, four royal abdications, two dictatorships and four civil wars. In the last and worst of those, in 1936-39, around 600,000 people died after General Franco rose against a chaotic parliamentary republic, and Hitler, Mussolini and Stalin intervened.
Since 1978 Spain has transformed itself into a stable and prosperous democracy. Yet the past decade has been difficult. The global financial crisis in 2007-08 hit the country hard, triggering a prolonged slump. Since 2014 the economy has enjoyed a robust recovery. Helped by low European interest rates and (until recently) cheap oil, that is mainly because the conservative government of Mariano Rajoy, elected with an absolute majority in 2011, pushed through sweeping reforms of the labour market and the banks. After a period of unpopular austerity, the economy in mid-2017 surpassed its peak size of 2007. The most promising change is what a group of economic researchers calls ""Spain's export miracle"". A new, more outward-looking, higher-value economy is emerging.
The social scars of the financial crisis, however, will take longer to heal. ""Spain was very egalitarian, with a strong sense of equality of opportunity and constant progress since the 1960s,"" says Charles Powell of the Elcano Royal Institute, a think-tank in Madrid. ""A lot of the middle class now feel that their children will be poorer than them."" Their disillusionment has changed politics. Spain is not alone in suffering ""a crisis in the governance of representative democracy"", according to Felipe Gon- zález, who served as prime minister in Socialist governments in the 1980s and 1990s. This has given rise to ""the politics of rancour"", he says. In 2011 crowds of young people (dubbed los indignados) occupied city squares across the country, claiming that politicians had become selfserving and corrupt. The indignation was at its most virulent in Catalonia, one of Spain's richest regions, where nationalist parties embraced separatism.
Public anger eventually spawned two new parties: Podemos (We Can) on the populist left and, on the centre-right, Ciudadanos (Citizens), which began as an anti-nationalist party in Catalonia. They ate away at the votes of the two main parties, the Socialists (psoe) and Mr Rajoy's People's Party (pp). Elections in 2015 and 2016 returned hung parliaments. To avoid yet another election, the Socialists in 2016 allowed Mr Rajoy to form a minority government, with help from Ciudadanos.
Though he applied himself doggedly to hauling Spain out of its economic slump, Mr Rajoy paid little attention to anything else, including discontent in Catalonia. Following a string of corruption scandals within the pp, on May 24th a court concluded that the party had benefited from illegal financing and that Mr Rajoy's evidence as a witness lacked credibility. The Socialist leader, Pedro Sánchez, seized the opportunity to file a censure motion. With the backing of Podemos and the Catalan and Basque nationalists, it passed with 180 to 169 votes. Mr Sánchez was swept to prime-ministerial office, heading a Socialist government with just 84 seats.
Because of his age (46) and his fresh approach, Mr Sánchez can claim to represent political renewal. Until a few months ago he was widely regarded as an erratic apparatchik. Yet in his clinical dispatch of Mr Rajoy he showed daring and shrewd political instincts. He has appointed 12 women to a cabinet of 17. He has said he wants to govern for the remainder of the parliament, until June 2020, and can probably count on broad support from Podemos. But he could opt to call an election much sooner.
Whenever that comes, it seems unlikely that Mr Sánchez can win a majority for the Socialists even if he makes a success of his term in office. Across the political spectrum, many believe that the new four-party system is here to stay. That will require national politicians to learn the habit of coalition politics, which is already being practised atregional and municipal levels.
Continuing political deadlock would come at great cost. Spain needs further reforms. It suffers from skills mismatches, a flawed education system, a generation gap and an ageing population. Its public administration, at all levels, is marred by cronyism and inefficiency. Above all, the politicians must deal with Catalan separatism and, more broadly, some accumulated flaws in the sweeping decentralisation mandated by the constitution.
Dissolving the indissoluble
In September 2017 Carles Puigdemont, the president of the Generalitat (the Catalan government), pushed laws to ""disconnect"" Catalonia from Spain through his parliament, calling a ""binding"" referendum on independence for October 1st. These laws violated both Catalonia's statute of autonomy (home rule) and the constitution, article 2 of which proclaims ""the indissoluble unity of the Spanish nation"".
Mr Rajoy's response was to send in riot police to try to stop the referendum, a public-relations disaster for Spanish democracy. According to the Catalan authorities' (unverifiable) count, 43% of the electorate turned out, of whom 92% (or over 2m people) voted in favour of leaving. The Catalan parliament declared independence on October 27th. Even as a euphoric crowd celebrated in Barcelona, the Senate in Madrid approved direct rule in Catalonia under article 155 of the constitution-an unprecedented step. Mr Puigdemont and some of his councillors fled abroad.
The half of Catalonia's population that wants to stay in Spain took to the streets to protest against independence, and more than 4,000 businesses moved their legal domicile out of Catalonia. A Supreme Court justice has charged Mr Puigdemont and 24 other separatist leaders with offences ranging from rebellion to misuse of public funds. Nine are in jail, pending trial. But the case all but collapsed this month after a German court rejected a request to extradite Mr Puigdemont for rebellion.
All this smacked of a wild judicial overreaction by the Spanish state, but Mr Puigdemont's actions had been highly provocative. Officials in Madrid insist that no other continental European democracy would have acted differently if faced with such defiance. But many in Spain also blame Mr Rajoy for failing to come up with a more imaginative political response, and for allowing things to get so far out of hand in the first place.
Catalonia poses questions that matter for Europe as well as for Spain. It represents a clash of two conceptions of democracy. Mr Puigdemont's is plebiscitarian and based on popular mobilisation, whereas Spain's constitutionalist politicians defend a representative democracy that is anchored in the rule of law and respects minority rights. At issue, too, is what it means to be a nation, and whether that should be an overriding identity in 21stcentury Europe. ""The right to decide"" is a simple and seductive slogan. But international law recognises a right to self-determination only in cases of colonisation, invasion or gross denial of human rights. None of these applies in Catalonia. £

 MANY OF THE photos seem older than they are . In black and white , they show Spaniards wrapped in overcoats , the men with sideburns , the women with perms , voting in a referendum on a new constitution on December 6th 1978 . Some 67 % of the electorate turned out , of whom 87 % voted yes , setting the seal on their country 's swift move to democracy after the death of Francisco Franco , its long - standing military dictator . 
 The constitution has helped to bring Spain the best years since its Golden Age in the 16th and 17th centuries , when it dominated the world . That heyday had been followed by centuries of decline and political instability . Between 1812 and 1975 Spain saw six different constitutions , seven bloodless military coups , four royal abdications , two dictatorships and four civil wars . In the last and worst of those , in 1936 - 39 , around 600,000 people died after General Franco rose against a chaotic parliamentary republic , and Hitler , Mussolini and Stalin intervened . 
 Since 1978 Spain has transformed itself into a stable and prosperous democracy . Yet the past decade has been difficult . The global financial crisis in 2007 - 08 hit the country hard , triggering a prolonged slump . Since 2014 the economy has enjoyed a robust recovery . Helped by low European interest rates and ( until recently ) cheap oil , that is mainly because the conservative government of Mariano Rajoy , pushed through sweeping reforms of the labour market and the banks . After a period of unpopular austerity , the economy in mid-2017 surpassed its peak size of 2007 . The most promising change is what a group of economic researchers calls "" Spain 's export miracle "" . A new , more outward - looking , higher - value economy is emerging . 
 The social scars of the financial crisis , however , will take longer to heal . "" Spain was very egalitarian , with a strong sense of equality of opportunity and constant progress since the 1960s , "" says Charles Powell of the Elcano Royal Institute , a think - tank in Madrid . "" A lot of the middle class now feel that their children will be poorer than them . "" Their disillusionment has changed politics . Spain is not alone in suffering "" a crisis in the governance of representative democracy "" , according to Felipe Gon- zález , who served as prime minister in Socialist governments in the 1980s and 1990s . This has given rise to "" the politics of rancour "" , he says . In 2011 crowds of young people ( dubbed los indignados ) occupied city squares across the country , claiming that politicians had become selfserving and corrupt . The indignation was at its most virulent in Catalonia , one of Spain 's richest regions , where nationalist parties embraced separatism . 
 Public anger eventually spawned two new parties : Podemos ( We Can ) on the populist left and , on the centre - right , Ciudadanos ( Citizens ) , which began as an anti - nationalist party in Catalonia . They ate away at the votes of the two main parties , the Socialists ( psoe ) and Mariano Rajoy's People 's Party ( pp ) . Elections in 2015 and 2016 returned hung parliaments . To avoid yet another election , the Socialists in 2016 allowed Mariano Rajoy to form a minority government , with help from Ciudadanos . 
 Though Mariano Rajoy applied Mariano Rajoy doggedly to hauling Spain out of its economic slump , Mariano Rajoy paid little attention to anything else , including discontent in Catalonia . Following a string of corruption scandals within the pp , on May 24th a court concluded that the party had benefited from illegal financing and that Mariano Rajoy's evidence as a witness lacked credibility . The Socialist leader , Pedro Sánchez , seized the opportunity to file a censure motion . With the backing of Podemos and the Catalan and Basque nationalists , it passed with 180 to 169 votes . Mr Sánchez was swept to prime - ministerial office , heading a Socialist government with just 84 seats . 
 Because of his age ( 46 ) and his fresh approach , Mr Sánchez can claim to represent political renewal . Until a few months ago he was widely regarded as an erratic apparatchik . Yet in his clinical dispatch of Mariano Rajoy he showed daring and shrewd political instincts . He has appointed 12 women to a cabinet of 17 . He has said he wants to govern for the remainder of the parliament , until June 2020 , and can probably count on broad support from Podemos . But he could opt to call an election much sooner . 
 Whenever that comes , it seems unlikely that Mr Sánchez can win a majority for the Socialists even if he makes a success of his term in office . Across the political spectrum , many believe that the new four - party system is here to stay . That will require national politicians to learn the habit of coalition politics , which is already being practised atregional and municipal levels . 
 Continuing political deadlock would come at great cost . Spain needs further reforms . It suffers from skills mismatches , a flawed education system , a generation gap and an ageing population . Its public administration , at all levels , is marred by cronyism and inefficiency . Above all , the politicians must deal with Catalan separatism and , more broadly , some accumulated flaws in the sweeping decentralisation mandated by the constitution . 
 Dissolving the indissoluble 
 In September 2017 Carles Puigdemont , the president of the Generalitat ( the Catalan government ) , pushed laws to "" disconnect "" Catalonia from Spain through his parliament , calling a "" binding "" referendum on independence for October 1st . These laws violated both Catalonia 's statute of autonomy ( home rule ) and the constitution , article 2 of which proclaims "" the indissoluble unity of the Spanish nation "" . 
 Mariano Rajoy's response was to send in riot police to try to stop the referendum , a public - relations disaster for Spanish democracy . According to the Catalan authorities ' ( unverifiable ) count , 43 % of the electorate turned out , of whom 92 % ( or over 2 m people ) voted in favour of leaving . The Catalan parliament declared independence on October 27th . Even as a euphoric crowd celebrated in Barcelona , the Senate in Madrid approved direct rule in Catalonia under article 155 of the constitution - an unprecedented step . Mr Puigdemont and some of his councillors fled abroad . 
 The half of Catalonia 's population that wants to stay in Spain took to the streets to protest against independence , and more than 4,000 businesses moved their legal domicile out of Catalonia . A Supreme Court justice has charged Mr Puigdemont and 24 other separatist leaders with offences ranging from rebellion to misuse of public funds . Nine are in jail , pending trial . But the case all but collapsed this month after a German court rejected a request to extradite Mr Puigdemont for rebellion . 
 All this smacked of a wild judicial overreaction by the Spanish state , but Mr Puigdemont 's actions had been highly provocative . Officials in Madrid insist that no other continental European democracy would have acted differently if faced with such defiance . But many in Spain also blame Mariano Rajoy for failing to come up with a more imaginative political response , and for allowing things to get so far out of hand in the first place .

A would-be nation divided
VIC, A PROSPEROUS town of 43,000 people about 90 minutes north of Barcelona, is sometimes called ""the capital of Catalan Catalonia"". Almost every building in its medieval town square has a banner calling for ""democracy"" and the release of the detained separatist leaders. ""They think that with prison and repression they will make us disappear,"" says Anna Erra, the mayor, who is from Mr Puigdemont's Catalan Democratic Party (pdecAT). ""With this they make the breach bigger."" It is hard to find a sign in Vic that is not in Catalan. When speaking Spanish Ms Erra, a teacher, sometimes searches for words.
At the other end of the railway line is L'Hospitalet, Catalonia's second-most-populous municipality, wedged between Barcelona and its airport. It was long a densely packed dormitory for factory workers who had migrated from the rest of Spain. Now it also has an ultra-modern quarter of gleaming offices and hotels, along with Barcelona's new trade fair, host to the Mobile World Congress. The new municipal library, housed in a former textile factory, has an exhibition of Andalusian mantillas. As elsewhere in Catalonia, children are taught in Catalan, but here they speak Castilian (Spanish) in the playground and at home. ""We won't forget the contempt"" the separatists showed for those who disagree with them, says Nuria Marín, L'Hospitalet's Socialist mayor. ""Levels of trust have fallen a lot.""
Today, there are two Catalonias that increasingly do not talk or listen to each other. When Mr Rajoy, then Spain's prime minister, imposed article 155 in October last year, with the support of the Socialists and Ciudadanos, he dissolved the Catalan parliament and called a regional election which was held in December. That merely confirmed the battle lines. The three separatist parties won 48% of the vote and retained a narrow majority in parliament. Ciudadanos, the most combative anti-separatist voice, emerged as the single biggest force, with 25% of the vote. ""Society is split in two,"" says Ines Arrimadas, the leader of Ciudadanos in Catalonia. Mr Puigdemont's claim to represent ""a single people"" is hollow.
The separatists are right in saying that the drive for independence has been broadly peaceful, but there is an undertone of intimidation and intolerance. Ms Arrimadas has been declared persona non grata in several towns and her party's offices suffer constant vandalism. In June separatist demonstrators broke up an academic conference on Cervantes at Barcelona University. Many, on both sides, worry that it will be hard to restore social harmony, and they disagree on how to set about it.
Supporters of independence list a jumble of grievances, ranging from claims that ""Spain robs us"" and does not invest in infrastructure in Catalonia to the Spanish courts knocking down Catalan laws. Such instrumental arguments are potentially negotiable, but there is an emotional separation too. ""At bottom, they [other Spaniards] don't like us,"" says Ms Erra. That has become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Many Spaniards now see the separatists as bent on breaking up their country and on using their control over education and the public media in Catalonia for indoctrination.
""This is a dispute between political elites over power and money, not a clash between ethnic communities,"" says José Álvarez Junco, a historian of nationalism at Madrid's Complutense University. Nevertheless, many of the Catalan separatist leaders talk the language of identity. In some cases that borders on racism. Take Quim Torra, Mr Puigdemont's nominee and replacement as president of the Generalitat. In 2012 he wrote: ""It's not natural to speak Spanish in Catalonia. And when someone decides not to speak in Catalan they are turning their back on Catalonia."" He went on to describe Spaniards as ""wild beasts in human form"" (he recently apologised). Others put it less tempestuously. ""We are a people who have a language, a history, a culture,"" says Ms Erra. ""We are already a nation."" In cultural terms, that is true. But like Spain itself, Catalonia has a plurinational culture, and its history is contested.
Unlike Scotland, Catalonia was never an independent nation state. Its origins lie in the County of Barcelona, a Frankish principality established as part of the Carolingian empire during the reconquest of Spain from Muslim rule. In 1137 it was merged by dynastic marriage into the Kingdom of Aragon, and in 1479, under Ferdinand and Isabella, into Habsburg Spain. The separatists make much of the War of the Spanish Succession, when the victorious Bourbon monarch, Philip V conquered Barcelona after a gruelling siege and abolished Aragon's feudal ""constitutions"". But in the war Catalonia was divided between the Austrian and French side. In due course it would thrive as an integral part of Bourbon Spain.
The contemporary idea of the Catalan nation was born in the 19th century, when nationalism and popular sovereignty emerged as organising principles in Europe. The Spanish state, having lost most of its empire and been invaded by Napoleon, was weak and penniless. ""A weak state can't eliminate local differences,"" Mr Álvarez Junco points out. There were few schools to impose linguistic uniformity or inculcate the idea of the Spanish nation. Geography added to the difficulty of nation-building: after Switzerland, Spain is western Europe's most mountainous country. Madrid was a court more than a capital, surrounded by the barren tablelands of Castile. The economically dynamic and industrialising regions in the 19th century, especially Catalonia and the Basque country, were on the coast.
It was that industrial bourgeoisie which created Catalan nationalism. It wanted trade protection from Madrid but was also influenced by German Romanticism, especially the ideas of Johann Gottfried Herder, who believed that a nation was an organic essence defined by language rather than a cultural and political construct, as theorists today think. Artur Mas, Mr Puigdemont's predecessor, defined Catalans as ""more Germanic than Roman"" (despite their abundant Roman ruins). From the mid-19th century, as migrants began to flood in from southern Spain to work in Catalonia's factories, a cultural renaissance rescued the Catalan language from slow decline and promoted Catalan history and culture. In the early 20th century that movement turned into a political demand for home rule, which was achieved briefly from the early 1930s but snuffed out by Franco, who barred the public use of Catalan. The Basque country went through a similar process.
Centrifugal v centripetal
Spain has found it almost impossible to strike the right balance between unity and diversity. Historically, the pendulum has swung back and forth. The 1978 constitution came down firmly on the side of recognising diversity. It created 19 ""autonomous communities"" which included both historic ""nationalities"" (the Basque country, Catalonia and Galicia) and newly created regions elsewhere. Today Spain is the most decentralised country in Europe. The regions are responsible for education, health, much economic regulation and even a good chunk of overseas aid, and have their own television and radio stations. Catalonia and the Basque country have their own police forces, and Catalonia runs its own prisons.
The regions have the power to vary the rates of income, wealth and inheritance taxes. In most cases the central government collects taxes on their behalf. But the Basque country and Navarre do their own tax-collecting, under an arrangement dating back to the 19th century. Many economists believe they hand over too little revenue to the central government.
The Catalan government insists on all teaching in state schools being in Catalan, with Spanish taught as a foreign language, which some parents find vexing. A ruling by the Supreme Court in 2015 that at least 25% of teaching should be in Spanish has been ignored. The history taught in Catalan schools has a nationalist tinge.
Catalans voted overwhelmingly for the new Spanish constitution 40 years ago. Basques did not, though mainly because of political competition between the terrorist separatists of eta and moderate nationalists. Catalans and Basques might have felt happier if they alone had been granted self-government, but Spain has, or has developed, other strong regional identities. Andalusia, for example, insisted on being treated much the same as Catalonia during the transition to democracy. In half a dozen regions Castilian Spanish is not the only language.
Decentralisation has had its successes, helping to reduce regional inequalities, but over time the fudges in the constitution's provisions for what Spaniards call ""the territorial model"" have come back to haunt the country. The decentralisation process was left open-ended and the distribution of powers is ambiguous, partly because the regional governments were set up after the constitution was introduced (except for the Generalitat in Catalonia). This has led to constant wrangles at the constitutional tribunal. The pp, Ciudadanos and many voters now think that decentralisation has gone far enough (or even too far). To make things worse, the system for financing regional governments is opaque and widely seen as unfair (see box, previous page).
When Spain still had a predominantly two-party system, the Basque and Catalan nationalists were able to exert leverage over minority governments in Madrid, always extracting more powers or money for their votes. Jordi Pujol, Catalonia's nationalist president from 1980 to 2003, was a master of this. He rejected offers to join Spanish governments, preferring to build a nation at home. He wanted to sharpen the constitution's fudged distinction between ""nationalities"" and ""regions"". But the pp governments of 1996-2004 leant in the opposite direction. Their investment in a radial network of high-speed trains and motorways was seen in Catalonia as favouring Madrid.
Still, support for independence in Catalonia ran at only around 15% until 2006, when a centre-left government in Barcelona tried to reform Catalonia's statute of autonomy. The reform was approved by the Catalan and national parliaments and by Catalans in a referendum (in which only 49% voted). But in 2010 the constitutional tribunal knocked out several of the key changes as incompatible with the constitution, including those that indirectly recognised Catalonia as a nation and granted it control over the courts. That exposed a flaw in the constitution, which failed to stipulate that any proposition put to referendum must first command agreement that it is constitutional. In Catalonia the ruling was seen as a victory for Spanish nationalism.
The desire for independence was magnified by the economic crisis. Protesters took to the streets of Barcelona to demonstrate against austerity, for which the Catalan government blamed Madrid. Critics also point to a scandal over illegal commissions on public contracts in Catalonia, claiming that the drive for independence was a way of distracting attention from this.
The Basque country offers a variation on the Catalan theme. eta's terrorism stripped Basque calls for independence of all democratic legitimacy. After a request for a referendum on Basque self-determination was rejected in the Spanish parliament in 2005, the hard-headed Basque National Party (pnv) has devoted itself to achieving the best possible economic deal. It starts from a strong position because the Basque country has fiscal autonomy. The pnv's current leadership is realistic. ""The Basque national cause is not incompatible with Spain,"" says Andoni Ortuzar, the party's president. ""A nation doesn't have to have a state, not in Europe today."" Nevertheless, some in Spain are suspicious of the pnv's long-term intentions.
In Catalonia, the nationalist camp is now split between maximalists, led by Mr Puigdemont, and a more moderate group of realists who think they should bank their gains. ""History has speeded up,"" says Joan Tarda, a congressman in Madrid for Esquerra Republicana, the pde cat's coalition partner. ""We've never come so far nor been so many."" But to win independence, ""we need there to be more of us."" After months in which Mr Puigdemont insisted on naming people who were in prison as potential Catalan presidents, Esquerra eventually got him to agree to the formation of an ""effective"" government in Barcelona in May under Mr Torra.
The maximalists want to ""fulfil the mandate of October 1st"" and ""build the republic"", as Mr Torra put it. Whether that will involve further defiance of the constitution is unclear. It will certainly focus on the battle for European public opinion. There the separatists have recently suffered setbacks. Mr Torra and his past statements highlight that Catalan nationalism has always contained an ugly, identitarian right wing as well as progressive moderates. Second, whereas Mr Rajoy was a toxic figure in Catalonia, Mr Sánchez, Spain's new prime minister, speaks soothingly of dialogue and detente. They would be good for both Catalonia and Spain-not least because the Catalan crisis has diverted energy from other urgent problems. £","The Catalan question

It will certainly focus on the battle for European public opinion . There the separatists have recently suffered setbacks .

A new economy is beginning to spread its wings
A LARGE, FEATURELESS shed by the motorway between the Castilian towns of Burgos and Lerma is home to ASTI Mobile Robotics. Inside, on the main shop floor, a score ofworkers armed with iPads test driverless contraptions mounted on red and orange steel frames. The automatic guided vehicles (AGVs) they are designing, building and controlling with customised software already operate in factories and warehouses in 16 countries around the world, including some belonging to Fiat, Airbus and Nestlé. The robots deliver parts to production lines, bringing more flexibility and efficiency to the jobs that conveyor belts, forklifts and tractors used to do.
They are the brainchild of Veronica Pascual, a 39-year-old aeronautical engineerwho took over her parents' small conveyor- belt firm when it ran into trouble 15 years ago. At the time the customers were mainly confined to northern Spain, but now 70% of sales are abroad. She is confident that turnover this year will rise to €35m ($41m), from €25m in 2017, and will reach €100m by 2020. Her staffhas expanded more than tenfold, to 210, ofwhom 25 are working at an innovation centre in Madrid. One hundred new staffjoined last year alone. The business is highly profitable, says Ms Pascual, and continuously reinvests those profits in growth. ""We're thinking always of where we want to be in five years,"" she explains.
As a research-intensive high-tech companywith global ambitions, growing fast and run by a woman, ASTI is everything thatSpanish business is traditionallynot. Before the financial crisis Spain had a clutch of multinationals, most of them in Madrid in regulated sectors such asbanking, telecoms and infrastructure (the bigexception was and is Inditex, a fast-fashion giant based in Galicia). Catalonia and the Basque country had medium-sized industrial firms, most of them family-owned. Below that came hundreds ofthousands of small family businesses.
The crisis brought wrenching change. Between 2008 and 2013 Spain lost 9% of its GDP in real terms, private consumption fell by14% and unemployment surged. The subsequent recovery owed much to Mr Rajoy's reforms. The previously rigid labour market became more flexible. Wage bargainingwas devolved to firm level, which helped make companies more competitive. Redundancy pay was cut from 45 days per year worked to a stillgenerous 33 days, making lay-offs more bearable for companies.
Helped by the promise of a €100bn loan from the EU (of which only €40bn was used), the government also cleaned up the financial system, merging or shutting down scores of broken cajas (savings banks) which had made reckless property loans. The non-performing loan ratio is still slightly above the EU average but has declined steadily, and credit is flowing again. The collapse of Banco Popular in 2017 (and its absorption by Santander, a bigger rival) was a delayed effect of the crisis, not a sign of new problems ahead. The government also paid offthe arrears that regional governments had run up with their suppliers, which added up to 5% ofGDP. That saved many small businesses.
Mr Rajoy also consolidated the public finances, cutting the budget deficit from a peak of 11% of GDP in 2009 to 3.1% in 2017. His approach was politicallycrafty. The firstand boldest decision he tookwas to reject advice from manyquarters to seek a general Greek-style bail-out of the economy. That gave him the freedom to hold pensions steady (the PP relies heavily on the over-60s vote) and extend the period forwhich unemployment benefit is paid. He brought down the deficit gradually by slashing public investment and squeezing other spending.
Recoverywas helped byfavourable external conditions, including lowinterest rates and oil prices (almost all the country's oil is imported). Both are now rising, but Spain's economy has changed since the crisis. Ithasproved more flexible than Italy's or France's, says José Luis Escrivá, directorofa newindependent fiscal authority appointed by Congress. Compared with 1999, a cyclically neutral year, he seesmany differences. Back then, Spain had a current-account deficit of 3.3% ofGDP; nowit enjoys a current- account surplus of close to 2% ofGDP. Before the crisis, inflation and labour costs in Spain were uncomfortably high. Since then unit labour costs have been well belowthe euro-zone average in every year except 2015, and inflation is currently slightly lower than in Germany.
Yet in 1999 public debtwas 61% ofGDP and falling; that year the government posted a primary fiscal surplus (before interest payments) of 2% of GDP. Now the public debt stands at 98% of GDP, and the government will not achieve a primary fiscal surplus until next year at the earliest. Still, companies and households are far less indebted than before the crisis.
Mr Sánchez's government faces a delicate balancing act. It would like to reverse Mr Rajoy's public-spending cuts, but has promised to stick with his budget for this year. In theory, this aimed at a fiscal deficit of 2.2% ofGDP, but in fact 2.7%, according to European officials. Nadia Calviño, Mr Sánchez's economy minister has adopted the latter figure. But she insists: ""We are a country committed to fiscal balance."" Since interest rates are likely to rise, it would be prudent to cut public debt faster, so some taxesmay have to go up.
Can it last?
To overcome the social problems leftby the crisis, several more years of steady growth are needed. The recovery is already in its fourth year, so howlong can it continue? Rafael Doménech, head ofmacroeconomic analysis at BBVA, a bank, thinks that the economy can go on growing faster than the euro-zone average for some time because unemployment is still high. The question, he says, is just howlong it can carry on doing so without starting to generate the sort ofcostpressures experienced in the past. Raymond Torres of Funcas, a think-tank, does not see growth continuing at its current pace much beyond 2020 without further reforms, especially in education, skills and regulation.
Spain enjoys a world-class infrastructure, as seen in its high-speed trains, motorwaynetworkand modern portsand airports. Its fibre-optic network for high-speed data transmission covers 76% of the population, the biggest proportion in Europe, and will reach 95% by 2021, according to José Maria Lasalle, who was responsible for digital policy under Mr Rajoy. But the software often falls short, and Spain still wraps everything in red tape. In the World Economic Forum's competitiveness index, Spain ranks 12th out of 137 countries on infrastructure but a shameful 113th for the burden ofgovernment regulation, well belowcountries such asGuatemala and Paraguay. Decentralisation has added an extra layerof regulation; for example, business permits for one region are not automatically valid in others.
The country's tax system manages to be both punitive and lax. A headline corporate-tax rate of 25% is mitigated bymyriad deductions and exemptions (though efforts are being made to prune these). Buya bottle ofbeeror a softdrinkin a supermarket, and you will pay value-added tax at 21%; buy the same thing in a bar, and youpay10%. That iswhySpain hasmore bars perperson than any other European country (which fanswould say is part ofwhatmakes it such a civilised place). And bysome reckonings, the ""black"" economyamounts to 17% ofGDP.
The chief cause for optimism is the change that has taken place in business. Construction is no longer the driver of the economy, as itwas before the crisis. Tourism remains important, but it is no longer just about sun- and sangria-seekers; cities such as Bilbao, Valencia and Seville are now attracting better-heeled visitors. Total exports of goods and services in 2016 were up by 46% on 2009, accounting for 33% of GDP. Spain produces more cars than any other European country except Germany; it is also starting to sell business services abroad. The number of exporting firms has increased by almost one-third since 2011, according to the Círculo de Empresarios, a business think-tank.
Companies like ASTIhave sprungup across the country, led by a new generation of entrepreneurs, many of them educated abroad and more internationallyminded than theirparents. The Basque country is a hive ofinnovation. In the Automotive Intelligence Centre outside Bilbao, 31 companies, mainly componentmakers, engage in ""collaborative innovation"" on things such as driverless vehicles, lighter parts and shorter time to market for new products. They are selling to the whole of Europe and beyond, according to Ines Anitua, the centre'smanager.
A business incubator at Vizcaya Technology Park, near Bilbao airport, houses 23 start-ups, mainly in advanced manufacturing and biosciences. One is the Art ofDiscovery, whose founder, Iñigo Angulo-Barturen, used to head the unit for therapeuticeffectiveness studies of GSK, a big drug company. With a staffof ten, it is now working on new medicines for prolonging life, as well as doing not-for-profitworkon malaria.
Barcelona has several good universities and a clutch of tech start-ups. More surprisingly, perhaps, such companies can be found across Spain, according to Adrián García-Aranyos of Endeavour, an entrepreneurship foundation. He points to Cabify, a Madrid-based rival to Uber, that has become Spain's first ""unicorn"", with a valuation of over $1bn. Or take Glamping Hub, a global booking site for luxury campingholidays, a Silicon Valleystyle startup based in offices in the heart of Seville. With 75 staff(and 25 in a second office in Denver) and triple-digit annual sales growth since it was founded in 2013, it is the creation of David Troya. He grewup in Triana, a Seville district famous for flamenco, and did an MBA in San Francisco on a grant from the regional government ofAndalusia. Raising finance has taken longer than it does in California, he says. But venture-capital funds and the supply of riskcapital are nowexpanding fast in Spain.
The transformation of the economy is still a work in progress. The mass of small firmswith lowproductivity is still there. Under1% offirmshave more than 50 workers, compared with 3% in Germany and 1.8% in Britain, according to the Círculo. Cristina Garmendia, a formerscience ministerwho nowheads a foundation to promote innovation, sees a ""systematic deficit"" in investment in research and development and in software. Public spending on R&D was cut hard in the crisis; it now totals only around 1.2% ofGDP, half the average in the OECDgroup ofmainly rich countries. Yet people like Mr Troya say their biggest problem is finding the right people to workfor them, even in a country with 3.3m registered unemployed. 7","Business and economy

Public money could be better spent
IN THE HELIOPOLIS further-education college in Seville, a class of 15 students dressed in black trousers, white shirts and black-and-white striped ties stand around a table set with spirits and liqueurs. They are training to become head waiters. Normally they would be in their teens, but this group ranges in age from 19 to 42. Most are confident they will get a job locally when they finish the two-year course. They are lucky to have got in. ""There is always more demand than places,"" says Ildefonso Rodríguez, the college's director. ""The problem is those who don't get here.""
Spain's education and training system has long been failing many of its students, and the economic crisis has made things worse. ""Skill levels in Spain are like an hourglass,"" says Marcel Jansen, a labour economist at Fedea, a think-tank. The proportion of graduates at the top is in line with the European average; at the bottom is a bulge of people with few or no qualifications. There is only a slender middle of well-trained technicians.
Almost one in five students drops out of school early, and many others stay on only until they can legally leave at 16. During the construction boom in the 2000s the number of school dropouts surged further. An unskilled building worker could take home €1,000 ($1,170) a month after tax whereas a university professor got only €1,300, notes Fátima Báñez, the labour minister under Mr Rajoy. That was one reason why around half of Spain's 3.3m jobless never finished secondary school, she says. Almost 2m of those 3.3m have been out of work for more than a year. Youth unemployment is particularly high, though now falling. Some 23% of 20- to 34-year-olds are not in work, education or training, well above the eu average of 18%. Another large group consists of men in their 40s and 50s, including many former building labourers who may never work again.
This social problem is ""quite invisible"", says Xavier Coller, a sociologist at Pablo de Olavide University in Seville. ""People demonstrate for other things but not over unemployment."" That is because the jobless are poor but ""not dying of hunger"". They receive €400 a month from the government, with top-ups from extended families and the black economy. The European Commission found in 2016 that some 28% of Spaniards were suffering, or were likely to suffer, from poverty and social exclusion. Income inequality has risen above the oecd average, mainly because those at the bottom have become worse off. ""The costs of the crisis were shared out very unequally and the recovery has also been very unequal,"" says Carlos Martín, chief economist of Comisiones Obreras, one of the two big trade unions.
Mr Jansen thinks that ""it's difficult to see a convergence with the rest of Europe without ambitious post-crisis measures."" But few have materialised. The unemployed, for example, receive little public help to get back into work. The government received European money to tackle youth unemployment but spent much of it on subsidies for hiring new workers, which often did not lead to permanent jobs. Both the public employment service and responsibility for skills training are decentralised. The Basque country and, to a lesser extent, Catalonia and Madrid do these things well. Many other regions do not. Andalusia's retraining courses were shut for three years because of spending cuts and allegations of corruption.
Public retraining schemes used to be run jointly by unions and bosses' organisations. At the insistence of Ciudadanos, the Rajoy government introduced a voucher scheme that allowed jobless people to choose private training providers, but many regional governments have blocked this. Few other active labour- market policies are in place. Public employment services fill only 3% of job vacancies, compared with a European average of 10%.
Education has undergone some reform, but needs more. Much teaching still involves learning by rote. In theory all political parties favour a national pact to improve schools and teacher training, but they have not been able to reach agreement. Spain's education system starkly contrasts with its health service, which is generally agreed to be efficient and of high quality. Luis Garicano, the chief economic adviser to Ciudadanos, explains that hospitals have professional managers and doctors have flexible contracts, but head teachers have little autonomy and schools are not subject to proper evaluation. Ms Báñez introduced results-based financing for vocational education and a new dual training system for young people modelled on German apprenticeships, but this has only just begun. In general, vocational education continues to be seen as a poor relation.
Many new jobs involve temporary contracts and low wages, creating a ""precariat"". Some 27% of jobs in Spain are temporary, the highest figure in the eu. On average, it takes ten years to get a permanent contract because job protection for insiders is so strong, says José Ignacio García Pérez, an economist at Pablo de Olavide University. This problem predates the labour reform. Even if Mr Sánchez wanted to repeal that, he lacks the necessary votes. Officials say the new government will focus on tweaks acceptable to both bosses and unions. Ciudadanos wants a single contract instead of the present two-tier labour market, with lower severance pay but portable retraining credits for those laid off. Others consider this impractical because seasonal industries, such as tourism and farming, are big employers. But there is scope to crack down on the abuse of rolling temporary contracts.
Even for those in work, jobs are no longer a secure route out of poverty. Starting pay for young people fell by about 35% in real terms between 2007 and 2014, according to Mr Jansen. No wonder that many talented young Spaniards have moved abroad in the past decade.
Spain's welfare state is not just smaller than the European average; it is not very redistributive and not particularly good at helping the neediest. It ""collects taxes from the middle class and spends them on the middle class"", says Pablo Simón, a political scientist at Carlos III University in Madrid. Its backbone is pensions, which are generous, averaging 80% of final salaries. That is one reason why a yawning generation gap in incomes has opened up. Not surprisingly, age has become a powerful determinant of voting behaviour, with younger voters much likelier to support the new parties.
Generation game
Earlier this yearpensioners across the country turned out to protest against a pension reform introduced in 2013 that restricted the rise in pensions to 0.25% a year and would have allowed for rising life expectancy in calculating pensions from 2019 onwards. The protests, and the need to win parliamentary support for his budget, prompted Mr Rajoy to move the 2019 deadline to 2023 and promise to raise pensions in line with inflation, a commitment that remains unfunded.
Relatively speaking, pensioners have done well in recent years. The average annual pre-tax income of households headed by 65- to 74-year-olds rose from €27,000 in 2008 to €29,700 in 2014, whereas for those under 35 it fell from €34,300 to €25,500. On present trends many of the baby-boom generation will retire on the maximum pension of €36,600 a year, in a country where 72% of the workforce earns less than €27,600.
This financial generation gap comes on top of a demographic problem. Young women in Spain are having far fewer children, and later, than their mothers. The same is true in many other rich countries, but Spain's total fertility rate (the number of children a woman can expect to have during her child-bearing years), at1.3, is among the lowest in the eu.
The country also has the world's second-highest life expectancy after Japan. As a result, by 2050 the number of pensioners will rise to 76 for every 100 workers (from 30-plus now), according to the oecd. The pay-as-you-go pension system, which in 2011 had reserves of almost €70bn, now depends on government top-ups to fund its annual deficit of €18bn. That is partly because fewer jobs and lower pay have kept contributions down, but with more people retiring and pensioners living longer, economic recovery will not easily reverse the trend.
Spain needs policies to promote a higher birth rate or immigration, or both. Since the turn of the millennium it has absorbed some 4.5m immigrants with remarkably little trouble. It helps that around a third of them are Latin Americans, speaking the same language (outside Catalonia) and with a similar culture. And over much of the past century many Spaniards have been emigrants themselves. Moreover, many immigrants work in social care, as maids or nannies. ""We have experienced them in our homes,"" explains Belén Barreiro of MyWord, a social-research company.
When Mr Sánchez invited the Aquarius, a rescue ship carrying hundreds of migrants from Africa, to dock in Valencia last month after Italy had turned it away, the Spanish public generally favoured this humanitarian gesture. But if many more Africans arrive, that welcome may not last. £

During the construction boom in the 2000s the number of school dropouts surged further . An unskilled building worker could take home € 1,000 ( $ 1,170 ) a month after tax whereas a university professor got only € 1,300 , notes Mariano Rajoy . That was one reason why around half of Spain 's 3.3 m jobless never finished secondary school , Mariano Rajoy says . Almost 2 m of those 3.3 m have been out of work for more than a year . Youth unemployment is particularly high , though now falling . Some 23 % of 20- to 34 - year - olds are not in work , education or training , well above the eu average of 18 % . Another large group consists of men in their 40s and 50s , including many former building labourers who may never work again . 
 This social problem is "" quite invisible "" , says Xavier Coller , a sociologist at Pablo de Olavide University in Seville . "" People demonstrate for other things but not over unemployment . "" That is because the jobless are poor but "" not dying of hunger "" . They receive € 400 a month from the government , with top - ups from extended families and the black economy . The European Commission found in 2016 that some 28 % of Spaniards were suffering , or were likely to suffer , from poverty and social exclusion . Income inequality has risen above the oecd average , mainly because those at the bottom have become worse off . "" The costs of the crisis were shared out very unequally and the recovery has also been very unequal , "" says Carlos Martín , chief economist of Comisiones Obreras , one of the two big trade unions . 
 Mr Jansen thinks that "" it 's difficult to see a convergence with the rest of Europe without ambitious post - crisis measures . "" But few have materialised . The unemployed , for example , receive little public help to get back into work . The government received European money to tackle youth unemployment but spent much of it on subsidies for hiring new workers , which often did not lead to permanent jobs . Both the public employment service and responsibility for skills training are decentralised . The Basque country and , to a lesser extent , Catalonia and Madrid do these things well . Many other regions do not . Andalusia 's retraining courses were shut for three years because of spending cuts and allegations of corruption . 
 Public retraining schemes used to be run jointly by unions and bosses ' organisations . At the insistence of Ciudadanos , the Rajoy government introduced a voucher scheme that allowed jobless people to choose private training providers , but many regional governments have blocked this . Few other active labour- market policies are in place . Public employment services fill only 3 % of job vacancies , compared with a European average of 10 % . 
 Education has undergone some reform , but needs more . Much teaching still involves learning by rote . In theory all political parties favour a national pact to improve schools and teacher training , but they have not been able to reach agreement . Spain 's education system starkly contrasts with its health service , which is generally agreed to be efficient and of high quality . Luis Garicano , the chief economic adviser to Ciudadanos , explains that hospitals have professional managers and doctors have flexible contracts , but head teachers have little autonomy and schools are not subject to proper evaluation . Mariano Rajoy introduced results - based financing for vocational education and a new dual training system for young people modelled on German apprenticeships , but this has only just begun . In general , vocational education continues to be seen as a poor relation . 
 Many new jobs involve temporary contracts and low wages , creating a "" precariat "" . Some 27 % of jobs in Spain are temporary , the highest figure in the eu . On average , it takes ten years to get a permanent contract because job protection for insiders is so strong , says José Ignacio García Pérez , an economist at Pablo de Olavide University . This problem predates the labour reform . Even if Mariano Rajoy wanted to repeal that , Mariano Rajoy lacks the necessary votes . Officials say the new government will focus on tweaks acceptable to both bosses and unions . Ciudadanos wants a single contract instead of the present two - tier labour market , with lower severance pay but portable retraining credits for those laid off . Others consider this impractical because seasonal industries , such as tourism and farming , are big employers . But there is scope to crack down on the abuse of rolling temporary contracts . 
 Even for those in work , jobs are no longer a secure route out of poverty . Starting pay for young people fell by about 35 % in real terms between 2007 and 2014 , according to Mr Jansen . No wonder that many talented young Spaniards have moved abroad in the past decade . 
 Spain 's welfare state is not just smaller than the European average ; it is not very redistributive and not particularly good at helping the neediest . It "" collects taxes from the middle class and spends them on the middle class "" , says Pablo Simón , a political scientist at Carlos III University in Madrid . Its backbone is pensions , which are generous , averaging 80 % of final salaries . That is one reason why a yawning generation gap in incomes has opened up . Not surprisingly , age has become a powerful determinant of voting behaviour , with younger voters much likelier to support the new parties . 
 Generation game 
 Earlier this yearpensioners across the country turned out to protest against a pension reform introduced in 2013 that restricted the rise in pensions to 0.25 % a year and would have allowed for rising life expectancy in calculating pensions from 2019 onwards . The protests , and the need to win parliamentary support for his budget , prompted Mr Rajoy to move the 2019 deadline to 2023 and promise to raise pensions in line with inflation , a commitment that remains unfunded . 
 Relatively speaking , pensioners have done well in recent years . The average annual pre - tax income of households headed by 65- to 74 - year - olds rose from € 27,000 in 2008 to € 29,700 in 2014 , whereas for those under 35 it fell from € 34,300 to € 25,500 . On present trends many of the baby - boom generation will retire on the maximum pension of € 36,600 a year , in a country where 72 % of the workforce earns less than € 27,600 . 
 This financial generation gap comes on top of a demographic problem . Young women in Spain are having far fewer children , and later , than their mothers . The same is true in many other rich countries , but Spain 's total fertility rate ( the number of children a woman can expect to have during her child - bearing years ) , at1.3 , is among the lowest in the eu . 
 The country also has the world 's second - highest life expectancy after Japan . As a result , by 2050 the number of pensioners will rise to 76 for every 100 workers ( from 30 - plus now ) , according to the oecd . The pay - as - you - go pension system , which in 2011 had reserves of almost € 70bn , now depends on government top - ups to fund its annual deficit of € 18bn . That is partly because fewer jobs and lower pay have kept contributions down , but with more people retiring and pensioners living longer , economic recovery will not easily reverse the trend . 
 Spain needs policies to promote a higher birth rate or immigration , or both . Since the turn of the millennium it has absorbed some 4.5 m immigrants with remarkably little trouble . It helps that around a third of them are Latin Americans , speaking the same language ( outside Catalonia ) and with a similar culture . And over much of the past century many Spaniards have been emigrants themselves . Moreover , many immigrants work in social care , as maids or nannies . "" We have experienced them in our homes , "" explains Belén Barreiro of MyWord , a social - research company . 
 When Mariano Rajoy invited the Aquarius , a rescue ship carrying hundreds of migrants from Africa , to dock in Valencia last month after Italy had turned it away , the Spanish public generally favoured this humanitarian gesture . But if many more Africans arrive , that welcome may not last . £

Spanish institutions are still a work in progress
CRISTINA CIFUENTES, THE pp president of the Madrid regional government since 2015, had vowed ""zero tolerance"" of corruption, and facilitated a judicial investigation of her predecessor for alleged kickbacks involving the regional water company. In April she resigned, mainly because of the revelation that she had obtained a master's degree from King Juan Carlos University in Madrid without doing any work for it.
In all, more than 900 pp politicians have faced corruption probes, Mr Sánchez claimed when he proposed the censure motion against Mr Rajoy. In most cases the charges related to something they did when they were in regional government. The Socialists themselves are not without sin: several of their ministers who had served in the 1980s were charged, and two former presidents of Andalusia and an ex-minister are on trial over fraudulent payment of subsidies (all deny the charges). Even the royal family is not spotless: last month Iñaki Urdangarin, King Felipe's estranged brother-in-law, began a jail sentence for influencepeddling, together with a former pp president of the Balearics.
An opinion poll in 2017 by Eurobarometro found that 94% of Spanish respondents thought corruption was widespread in their country. But in the same poll only 2% said that they had been asked to pay a bribe in the past year, half the eu average. Spain's particular problem is the sense of entitlement throughout its political class, as illustrated by Ms Cifuentes's bogus degree. This is more marked in regional and municipal governments, which are often the fiefs of a single party or leader.
The authors of Spain's constitution sought to create strong political parties because they were mindful that weak ones had played a part in Franco's overthrow of the second republic. In the eyes of its critics, the two-party system turned into a ""partidocracy"", capturing institutions from universities to public broadcasters and regulatory bodies that should be independent. That is compounded by another Spanish vice, amiguismo-a culture of mutual back-scratching among friends. ""The partidocracy counts on the complicity of newspapers, unions, big companies and so forth,"" says Victor Pérez Díaz, a sociologist. ""It's not just the politicians that have created the Spain we have."" The leftwingers of Podemos call it la casta, the ruling caste.
Take the universities, which are run by the regional governments. Spain has two private business schools in the world's top 20 (in the ft Global mba ranking) but no public universities in the top 100 (in the qs ranking). They have suffered funding cuts, but their main problem is governance. With the tacit consent of the politicians, they have used their legal autonomy to turn themselves into closed shops. Mr Garicano points out that 73% of university teachers work where they graduated. Only 2% of faculty are foreign. The universities do not collect data that would allow their performance to be evaluated, such as how their graduates fare in the jobs market.
The judiciary's image, too, has been damaged by the suspicion of political capture. The constitution insists on a strict separation of powers, but a Socialist government in the 1980s pushed through a change under which the General Council of the Judiciary, which picks judges, is chosen by Congress (meaning the two main parties). The government also appoints the attorney-general. In practice, the vast majority of judges and prosecutors are fiercely independent. But the judiciary is slow and understaffed, and judges tend to be conservative box-tickers.
The civil service suffers from similar problems. It is both bureaucratised and politicised, according to a recent study on the quality of Spanish institutions for the Círculo de Empresarios. A big reason for the red tape highlighted by the World Economic Forum is that civil servants are trained to apply rules blindly rather than consider outcomes. The bureaucratic elite are abogados del estado (state lawyers) rather than public-sector managers. Mr Rajoy's cabinet was full of them.
The mirror image of strong parties is a relatively weak civil society. Spaniards are good at demonstrating. Recent months have seen big, peaceful demonstrations by pensioners, by both sides in Catalonia and by women protesting against machismo. But there is a gap between the parties and the street. The two main parties carry out many tasks that in other countries would fall to think-tanks, ngos or civic groups. That is partly because there are few tax incentives for charitable donations. ""For a strong civil society you need money,"" says Eduardo Serra, a former chairman of the Prado art museum.
Who wants to be a politician?
By common consent, the quality of both political leadership and the public administration has declined since the early years of democracy, not least because Spain's opening to the world has offered plenty of alternative careers for the ambitious. The two main parties have also become more inward-looking. Both Mr Rajoy and Mr Sánchez brought in rule changes that make it harder for party committees to eject leaders. A former party leader says that the current crop of politicians value loyalty over quality and initiative. It does not help that they are much less well paid than many of their high-flying peers. A backbench legislator is paid €4,600 a month, including expenses.
The emergence of Ciudadanos and Podemos has shaken up this cosy world. It is a good sign that the public anger created by the economic crisis has thus been institutionalised rather than allowed to fester. No powerful right-wing populist movement has appeared (though some would say that Catalan nationalism is playing that role), partly because there is little anti-immigrant feeling, but also because the pp leaves little space to its right. A far-right Spanish nationalist group, Vox, has grown a bit as a result of the Catalan crisis, but not much.
A third reason is Podemos. ""In Spain there isn't an extreme right that is electorally important, to a large extent because we [Podemos] were born, because we have channelled part of the political and social frustration,"" says Iñigo Errejón, one of the party's leaders. They did it, he adds, ""not in a xenophobic, reactionary and anti-democratic sense but with a clear patriotic will...of a fatherland understood as a civic project."" In a slightly different way, Ciudadanos would say the same. £","Politics

How to be a normal European country
JOSEP BORRELL, MR SÁNCHEZ'S foreign minister, reflects that in the course of the past two years Spain's constitution has passed three unprecedented tests: ""We were unable to form a government and had to repeat elections; we've applied article 155; and we had a censure motion...These things happened in complete normality.""
Over the past decade Spain's democracy has been tested, too. The country responded to the financial crisis with structural reforms that were painful but paid off with the vigorous economic recovery. Its political system has absorbed the populist assault of Podemos. However, the third problem, Catalan separatism, remains unresolved, and little of substance has been achieved since the pp lost its majority in 2015.
Mr Sánchez's first task is to nurture the economic recovery. To tackle the social problems left by the crisis and restore the trust of the middle class will require several more years of uninterrupted growth. That may not come automatically. As this report has shown, many public policies-especially on education, training and employment, pensions, the civil service and the organisation of political life-need reform. From the 1980s to 2007 Spain benefited from having joined the European Union and from the German-level interest rates that the euro brought in its wake. Now it must become more efficient.
Reforms depend on a strong government with a majority. That can only come from a general election, and in all probability will require another first: a formal coalition government at national level. Who might form it? The pp is still licking its wounds and seems unlikely to recover in time. Some in Podemos are moving towards social democracy, but the party does not look ready yet. Ciudadanos is offering many good technocratic solutions to Spain's problems, but its young leader, Albert Rivera, was the biggest loser from the change of government. His party, a robust defender of Spain's unity, rose to the top of the opinion polls on the back of public anger directed at the Catalan separatists, but Mr Sánchez stole the moment. Still, a coalition between the Socialists and Ciudadanos (in either order) looks like the best chance of a reformist government.
Although the constitution has generally held up well, some parts of it need fixing. In return for approving direct rule in Catalonia under article 155 last year, Mr Sánchez insisted on a congressional committee being set up to review the constitution's title VIII on decentralisation. The committee is now at work, though the nationalists and Podemos have so far refused to take part. Its chairman, José Enrique Serrano, hopes to come up with recommendations after municipal, regional and European elections next May. The proposals will probably focus on clarifying the distribution of power and money among different levels of government and perhaps on reforming the Senate to turn it into a body representing the regions.
To deal with the Catalan crisis, the governments in both Madrid and Barcelona will have to reach some agreements. But public opinion is unwilling to reward what is widely seen as an illegal power grab by the separatists, who are accused of betraying the unwritten pact of loyalty that underpins any democratic constitution. Equally, though, the central government cannot simply ignore the 2.1m people in Catalonia who want to leave Spain. The forthcoming trials of the separatist leaders will inflame emotions. The first step will have to be confidence-building both within Catalonia and in the rest of Spain. That may have begun with a meeting this month between Mr Sánchez and Mr Torra.
Politically and constitutionally, Spain will find it almost impossible to recognise Catalonia's ""right to decide"". Few serious politicians in the European Union want to help break up its constituent countries by recognising a right to self-determination where none exists under international law. (In Germany and Italy, proposed separatist referendums in Bavaria and Veneto have been turned down as unconstitutional.) Besides, referendums are crude instruments that invite polarisation.
History shows that Spain is better governed as a networked rather than a radial nation, more like Germany than France. Sensible reform would take account of that. Rather than further administrative decentralisation, this would im_ _ greater recognition of Catalonia as a cultural nation within Spain and a more · ""į wholehearted acceptance of the country's diversity.
The consensus underlying the 1978 constitution was that Spain should become a normal European country. It was a rejection of the idea that ""Spain is different"", in the words of a Franco-era tourist poster. That idea was revived by the separatists in a propaganda battle in which they proved themselves far more adept than Mr Rajoy's government, leading many abroad to believe that Spain remains a franquista state. It is not. As Mr Borrell (who is Catalan) points out, Spain is a country that respects human rights, believes in the separation of powers and is high on the list of the world's advanced democracies. It is increasingly feminist and tolerant of immigration, and it upholds gay rights. There are few better places in which to live. If it can fix some of the problems that have arisen over the past decade, it will have a better chance of convincing all its citizens of that. £

MADRID
The politics of the permanent election campaign
WHEN they returned this month after their long summer holiday, Spain's politicians had much to contemplate. There are signs that the economic recovery is starting to flag. The Socialist minority government of Pedro Sánchez must strike a balance between eliminating the deficit, restoring social spending and raising business taxes. A year after its independence referendum, Catalonia's government remains sullen, awaiting the controversial trial for rebellion of some of its imprisoned former leaders. And Mr Sánchez has pushed through an overdue law to remove the remains of Francisco Franco, Spain's former dictator, from the triumphalist mausoleum he built outside Madrid.
But Spanish politics have been convulsed by a less uplifting matter: whether the postgraduate degrees some of its leaders boast of were fairly obtained. On September 11th Carmen Montón resigned as health minister after it emerged that she had been awarded a master's degree in 2011 from King Juan Carlos University (urjc) in Madrid without doing the requisite work. In April the same fate had befallen Cristina Cifuentes, president of the Madrid regional government and a member of the conservative People's Party (pp), who had secured a bogus master's from urjc's Institute of Public Law.
Opposition newspapers have claimed that Mr Sánchez's doctoral thesis was plagiarised or written by someone else. The thesis, entitled ""Innovations in Spanish economic diplomacy"", is hardly an academic ground-breaker. It was approved by a low-powered examination panel at a private university. But there is no evidence that it was not his own work.
That allegation looked like a smokescreen to protect Pablo Casado, the new pp leader, who is potentially in far more serious trouble. In 2008 he obtained the same degree as Ms Cifuentes. He admits that he was credited with 18 of 22 assignments without doing any work. He insists he did nothing wrong. But in July a judge ruled that his degree could have constituted an undue gift; she has asked the supreme court to lift Mr Casado's judicial immunity in order to charge him. The institute is now closed and its founding director charged with fraud.
All this sets the bad example that the way to get ahead is through contacts, not merit and hard work. Like urjc, several other Spanish universities have become party fiefs. But what explains the politicians' need to inflate their credentials? There are a handful of genuine intellectuals in the Congress. But nowadays the average Spanish politician is a party hack plying a discredited trade, argues Victor Lapuente, a political scientist at Gothenburg University. ""Getting a postgraduate degree is a way of seeming to be a trained professional,"" he says.
The fuss over degrees is also a sign that an election may not be far off. Mr Sánchez took office in June after dispatching Mariano Rajoy, the pp prime minister, in a censure motion. After years of austerity under the dour Mr Rajoy, Mr Sánchez, aged 46 and with an easy charm, brought a breath of fresh air. But his Socialists have just 84 of the 350 seats in parliament. He has governed with gestures, such as Franco's exhumation, and with u-turns (having initially welcomed a migrant ship, his government is now sending migrants back to Morocco).
Mr Sánchez says he wants to see out the parliament's term until 2020. Despite his inexperience, he has the sense of opportunity of a more seasoned politician. To embarrass Mr Casado, this week he proposed a constitutional amendment to curb parliamentary immunity, a popular move. But he may struggle to get the 2019 budget approved. Having lifted the Socialists to a narrow lead in the polls, he may be tempted at any moment to go to the people.","Spain 
 MADRID 
 The politics of the permanent election campaign 
 WHEN they returned this month after their long summer holiday , Spain 's politicians had much to contemplate . There are signs that the economic recovery is starting to flag . The Socialist minority government of Pedro Sánchez must strike a balance between eliminating the deficit , restoring social spending and raising business taxes . A year after its independence referendum , Catalonia 's government remains sullen , awaiting the controversial trial for rebellion of some of its imprisoned former leaders . And Mr Sánchez has pushed through an overdue law to remove the remains of Francisco Franco , Spain 's former dictator , from the triumphalist mausoleum he built outside Madrid . 
 But Spanish politics have been convulsed by a less uplifting matter : whether the postgraduate degrees some of its leaders boast of were fairly obtained . On September 11th Carmen Montón resigned as health minister after it emerged that she had been awarded a master 's degree in 2011 from King Juan Carlos University ( urjc ) in Madrid without doing the requisite work . In April the same fate had befallen Cristina Cifuentes , president of the Madrid regional government and a member of the conservative People 's Party ( pp ) , who had secured a bogus master 's from urjc 's Institute of Public Law . 
 Opposition newspapers have claimed that Mr Sánchez 's doctoral thesis was plagiarised or written by someone else . The thesis , entitled "" Innovations in Spanish economic diplomacy "" , is hardly an academic ground - breaker . It was approved by a low - powered examination panel at a private university . But there is no evidence that it was not his own work . 
 That allegation looked like a smokescreen to protect Pablo Casado , the new pp leader , who is potentially in far more serious trouble . In 2008 he obtained the same degree as Ms Cifuentes . He admits that he was credited with 18 of 22 assignments without doing any work . He insists he did nothing wrong . But in July a judge ruled that his degree could have constituted an undue gift ; she has asked the supreme court to lift Mr Casado 's judicial immunity in order to charge him . The institute is now closed and its founding director charged with fraud . 
 All this sets the bad example that the way to get ahead is through contacts , not merit and hard work . Like urjc , several other Spanish universities have become party fiefs . But what explains the politicians ' need to inflate their credentials ? There are a handful of genuine intellectuals in the Congress . But nowadays the average Spanish politician is a party hack plying a discredited trade , argues Victor Lapuente , a political scientist at Gothenburg University . "" Getting a postgraduate degree is a way of seeming to be a trained professional , "" he says . 
 The fuss over degrees is also a sign that an election may not be far off . Mr Sánchez took office in June after dispatching Mariano Rajoy , in a censure motion . After years of austerity under Mariano Rajoy , Mr Sánchez , aged 46 and with an easy charm , brought a breath of fresh air . But his Socialists have just 84 of the 350 seats in parliament .

Catalan separatism faces new dilemmas one year on
FOR Catalans of whatever persuasion, October 1st 2017 was a day of infamy. Catalonia's 2m or so separatists recall Spanish riot police baton-walloping citizens waiting to vote in a referendum on independence. Other Catalans recall that the referendum was unconstitutional, and see the unilateral declaration of independence that followed it as an alarming plot to breakup Spain.
A year on, nothing and everything has changed. Spain's government suspended Catalan autonomy and its courts charged Carles Puigdemont, the regional president, and 12 others with rebellion. Having won a narrow majority of seats (though not votes) in an election in December, the separatists are back in charge of the Generalitat in Barcelona, the regional government. The declaration of independence might never have happened.
Still, tens of thousands of Catalans marked the anniversary this week with a demonstration at which they carried scores of the ballot boxes used last year. They see October 1st as a bigger defeat for the Spanish government than for their own cause. ""It put Catalonia on the international map,"" says Elsa Artadi, a senior official at the Generalitat. ""It showed that the state doesn't control some parts of Catalonia."" But the horizon is different. In Madrid Mariano Rajoy, the stolid conservative who sent in the riot police, has given way as prime minister to Pedro Sánchez, a Socialist. The Catalan nationalists backed the censure motion that brought Mr Sánchez to power. Unlike Mr Rajoy, he says Catalonia requires a political solution. Several ministers have said they would prefer the prisoners not to be in pre-trial detention (though only the courts can free them).
These changes have left the separatist movement ""disoriented"", without a clear strategy and increasingly split, says an adviser to Mr Sánchez's administration. The rhetoric remains confrontational. Quim Torra, Mr Puigdemont's replacement, claims to be ""building the [Catalan] republic"". This week he gave Mr Sánchez ""a month"" to agree to an independence referendum or face a withdrawal of Catalan nationalist support in parliament.
This is bluster. Mr Torra commands only a few of the MPs in question. In practice, the Generalitat is acting within the law. ""We are re-establishing normal relations,"" says an official in Madrid. While Ms Artadi warns that Mr Sánchez has so far offered ""a few words"" but no action, she says the Generalitat wants to talk, even as it mobilises its supporters.
The divorce between rhetoric and reality is prompting splits. Hours after Mr Torra called on radicals, organised in the Committees for the Defence of the Republic, to ""keep pressing"", they broke away from the October 1st demonstration to attack Catalan police with smoke-bombs and bottles.
Perhaps half the 2m independence supporters want to pursue civil disobedience, says the government adviser. The other half might settle for reforms in Catalonia's home rule, but are inhibited from speaking out until the trials, due to start in January, are over. Mr Sánchez can do little without winning a clear mandate at a general election. The opposition in Madrid already accuses him of appeasement. ""This will take years,"" says a minister. Indeed so.","Spain

Taxing and spending are to rise-but only a little
""We've spent years being told that the crisis was over. The time has come for Spaniards to feel it."" With that, María Jesús Montero, the finance minister in the new Socialist government of Pedro Sánchez, unveiled a draft budget for 2019 that modestly increases social spending while raising some taxes too. It comes along with a proposed 22% increase in the minimum wage. For the government, these measures mark an overdue assault on rising income inequality and a rebuilding of the welfare state after years of austerity. For the opposition, they will kill off an economic recovery now in its fifth year. Both are exaggerating. In doing so they are setting some clear battle lines ahead of an election that must come by mid-2020 at the latest.
Mr Sánchez heads a minority government which unexpectedly came to power in June after a censure motion toppled Mariano Rajoy, his conservative predecessor. Mr Rajoy had picked up the pieces after an economic slump in 2008-12. He gradually trimmed the fiscal deficit from 11% of gdp in 2009 to 3.1% last year, mainly by cutting spending.
Mr Sánchez's budget is the result of an agreement between his Socialists and Podemos, who are further left. It proposes additional spending of €5.1bn ($5.9bn, or around 0.5% of gdp), mainly on pensions, student grants, housing and social care. But it also projects new revenues of €5.7bn, from small increases in personal and corporate income taxes, and new imposts on share transactions and digital platforms. Officials stress that the budget will cut the deficit from 2.7% of gdp this year to 1.8%, a target agreed with the European Commission. And Spain's tax burden will remain below the European average.
The projected increase in revenue looks ambitious. Raymond Torres of Funcas, a think-tank, says he thinks the deficit will end up at about 2.2% of gdp. That would be in line with Mr Rajoy's performance. But the risks are increasing. Growth, while still healthy, is decelerating. The cost of servicing a public debt that stands at 97% of gdp is set to rise.
With the unemployment rate still at 15%, many economists worry that the steep rise in the minimum wage will discourage hiring, especially of younger workers. Under Mr Rajoy, unions and bosses had agreed to a more gradual increase. However, the minimum wage kicks in for fewer than one in 20 workers, despite Spain's comparatively low wages. Mr Torres thinks average wages will rise next year by 2.1%. That is more than the growth in productivity but only slightly above inflation. The rise may help to boost flagging consumption.
Pablo Casado, who has replaced Mr Rajoy as leader of the conservative People's Party (pp), called the budget ""irresponsible, impossible and suicidal"". In fact, the most irresponsible item is an increase in pensions, which the pp supports. But his comment suggests that both sides see a political opportunity to be exploited.
To get the budget approved in Congress, Mr Sánchez needs not just Podemos and the Basque nationalists but also the Catalan separatists. They say they will vote for it only if the government intercedes to free their leaders, imprisoned over an unconstitutional independence bid. Mr Sánchez cannot and will not do that. In the end the Catalans will probably fall into line.
But the pp could still block the budget in the Senate, where it has a majority. If it does so, Mr Sánchez might choose to call an election. He would offer Spaniards a clear choice between a slightly bigger state and less inequality, or slightly lower taxes and perhaps faster growth. That's democracy.","Spain 's budget politics

MADRID
The fraught Catalan issue pushes Spain to the brink of its third general election since 2015
THE NOTION that Pedro Sánchez could govern his country for long without calling a general election always seemed unlikely. He came to office as prime minister unexpectedly last June following a censure motion against his conservative predecessor, Mariano Rajoy. But his socialist party has only 84, or 24%, of the 350 seats in Congress. The alliance of leftists and Basque and Catalan nationalists that backed his minority government was united chiefly in rejecting Mr Rajoy. On February 13th Mr Sánchez's government seemed to run out of road when its budget was rejected, by 191 votes to 158. On February 15th the prime minister is due to announce if- and more likely when-he will call a general election.
It would be the third time in little more than three years that Spaniards have been called upon to vote. The past two elections produced hung parliaments and weak governments, and the same outcome seems inevitable this time around. Indeed, politics has become even more fragmented with the recent rise of Vox, a far-right nationalist party which is poised to enter parliament for the first time.
What doomed Mr Sánchez, as in part it had done Mr Rajoy, was the conflict in Catalonia, where almost half of voters support independence. By chance, the budget debate coincided with the start of the oral phase of the trial of 12 separatist leaders who face charges of rebellion and misuse of funds for organising an unconstitutional referendum followed by an illegal declaration of independence in October 2017.
Mr Sánchez attempted to defuse the Catalan conflict, talking to the separatist government in Barcelona about their more everyday grievances. The budget included an 18.5% increase in public investment in Catalonia. Rejecting it would be ""a historic mistake which you will have to explain to Catalans"", María Jesús Montero, the finance minister, told separatist legislators during the parliamentary debate.
But the 17 Catalan nationalist deputies joined the opposition to vote it down nonetheless. Partly because of the emotive climate generated by the trial, as a condition for backing the budget their leaders had insisted that Mr Sánchez agree to talks with an international mediator about self-determination in Catalonia. In what was Mr Sánchez's biggest mistake in his short time as prime minister, he dallied with that proposal, agreeing to inter-party talks in Catalonia with an external ""rapporteur"". That was not enough for the separatists, but opponents seized on it as a concession to the independence movement's long-standing demand to ""internationalise"" the Catalan conflict. Mr Sánchez swiftly retreated, breaking off contact with the separatist administration in Barcelona.
An independence referendum is legally impossible without amending the constitution, a cumbersome procedure. And it is a political non-starter: the vast majority of Spaniards and many Catalans reject the separatists' attempt to break up their country. International law does not recognise a right to self-determination in an advanced democracy. The government insisted this week that it would not trade the budget for a referendum.
In a febrile political atmosphere the three right-of-centre parties held a rally in Madrid's Plaza Colón on February 10th at which some 45,000 people, many waving Spanish flags, turned out under the slogan ""For a United Spain-elections now"". Pablo Casado, who replaced Mr Rajoy as leader of the conservative People's Party in the summer, has operated in hyperbolic gear ever since. This month he has called Mr Sánchez a ""traitor"", ""liar"" and ""felon"".
Mr Sánchez has said several times that if his budget was rejected, that would shorten the life of the parliament, which in theory runs until June 2020. The betting in Madrid is that he will go to the country in * April. If so, he will doubtless try to make the budget, with its modest increase in spending, social provision and taxes, the main issue in an old-fashioned left-right battle. His government was notable for its feminism (more than half of his cabinet are women) and for his determination that Spain should play an active international role. But a spring election would take place against the background of the Catalan trial. Most of the defendants claim that they are political prisoners. The prosecutor argues that they are being judged for their actions, not their ideas. The opposition would try to make the election about defending the constitution and keeping Spain together.
Opinion polls give five parties between 10% and 25% of the vote. Mr Sánchez is an effective campaigner. But at the outset, the most likely outcome is a right-of-centre coalition, backed by Vox. Some of the separatists have long claimed, implausibly, that their battle is against Spanish ""fascism"". With their parliamentary vote this week, they seem to want to bring some semblance of that into being.","Spanish politics

MADRID
Catalan separatism has pushed politics to the right-but how far?
IN IMPROBABLY WARM weather some 500 people gathered on February 23rd in Plaza de la Villa, one of Madrid's oldest squares, to launch the election campaign of Ciudadanos (Citizens), one of Spain's newer political parties. A year ago Ciudadanos, which describes itself as a centrist, liberal party, was leading the opinion polls, with around 27% of the vote in a crowded field. Now it trails behind both the governing Socialists and the conservative People's Party (pp). Yet Ciudadanos and its young leader, Albert Rivera, may still hold the key to Spain's next government.
Mr Rivera fired the opening shot in the campaign by rejecting, from the outset, a coalition with the Socialist party of Pedro Sánchez, the prime minister since June, whom he accused of disregard for the constitution in his negotiations with Catalan separatists. In doing so, Mr Rivera has tried to define the character of the election due on April 28th. It will be about the unity of Spain and it will be a contest between the Socialists on the one hand and a threeheaded block to the right of centre in which Ciudadanos has lined up with the PP and Vox, a new ultra-conservative party.
A fortnight earlierthis trio joined forces in a much bigger demonstration in another Madrid square, to protest against Mr Sánchez. Vox is a Spanish nationalist party that in some respects resembles far-right movements elsewhere in Europe. This is a strange place to be for a liberal party once compared to Emmanuel Macron's En Marche in France. ""I'm surprised they are putting a cordon sanitaire against me and not the far right,"" said Mr Sánchez.
This stance can only be understood in the ""exceptional circumstances"" of Spain, says Inés Arrimadas, until now Ciudadanos's leader in Catalonia and the party's star attraction, who announced in the Plaza de la Villa that she will run for parliament for Barcelona. In October 2017 the separatist regional administration in Catalonia held a ""binding"", although unofficial, referendum and declared independence later that month in defiance of the constitution. These events amounted to a ""coup"", says Ms Arrimadas.
Mr Sánchez came to office after a censure motion against Mariano Rajoy, the previous pp prime minister, and with the backing of Catalan and Basque nationalists in the Madrid parliament. Mr Sánchez has attempted to defuse the conflict in Catalonia through a less confrontational attitude. Ms Arrimadas accuses him of making ""concessions"" to coup-mongers by failing to stop the separatists from using public resources to promote their ""republic"".
Ciudadanos, which was formed in Catalonia, has always had two souls: one liberal and the other anti-separatist and thus Spanish nationalist. It is still liberal on lifestyle issues and favours modernising economic reforms, but these proposals are ""harder to understand"" in a ""polarised scenario"", says Toni Roldán, a Ciudadanos legislator. The party's rise and its decline owe much to the political earthquake caused by Catalan separatism. In a regional election in Catalonia in December 2017 Ms Arrimadas's muscular campaigning helped Ciudadanos win the most votes, although the three separatist groups retained their narrow majority of seats in the Catalan parliament. Because of separatist intimidation ""it's not easy being Ciudadanos in Catalonia,"" she said in the Plaza de la Villa. But as the embodiment of the defence of the Spanish nation, the party surged in the national opinion polls.
The Catalan events pushed public opinion, traditionally slightly left of centre, to the right. At the last election in 2016 the right won 46% of the vote; today it polls at 55%, points out Kiko Llaneras, a psephologist. The difference is that today the right is split in three, which means it will probably win fewer parliamentary seats. From nowhere, Vox took 11% of the vote in a regional election in Andalucía in December, helping to eject the Socialists from the regional administration they had run for almost 40 years. Mr Rivera's vetoing of Mr Sánchez is thus a ""defensive move"" to stop Ciudadanos voters moving to Vox, says Mr Llaneras.
It may help Mr Sánchez, in two ways. He broke off talks with the separatists last month, although this contributed to him losing his budget and thus precipitated his calling of the election. He is now seeking votes in the centre ground from which Ciudadanos is retreating. After the shock in Andalucía, where some 400,000 left-wing voters stayed at home, the Socialists expect the spectre of Vox to help get out the vote. The core of Mr Sánchez's campaign will be about ""what kind of country do you want"", says Manuel de la Rocha Vázquez, an adviser to the prime minister. ""Do we want a closed, nationalistic, xenophobic, maledominated society? We strongly believe that the majority of Spaniards are in favour of an open, pluralistic, multicultural, tolerant society,"" he says.
Although this is the third general election since December 2015, its character shows how quickly the country has changed. The past two were held in the shadow of austerity and corruption involving the pp and the Socialists, who seemed to face extinction at the hands of Podemos, a far-left party. Now Podemos is fading amid internal splits.

Catalan separatism has pushed politics to the right-but how far?
IN IMPROBABLY WARM weather some 500 people gathered on February 23rd in Plaza de la Villa, one of Madrid's oldest squares, to launch the election campaign of Ciudadanos (Citizens), one of Spain's newer political parties. A year ago Ciudadanos, which describes itself as a centrist, liberal party, was leading the opinion polls, with around 27% of the vote in a crowded field. Now it trails behind both the governing Socialists and the conservative People's Party (pp). Yet Ciudadanos and its young leader, Albert Rivera, may still hold the key to Spain's next government.
Mr Rivera fired the opening shot in the campaign by rejecting, from the outset, a coalition with the Socialist party of Pedro Sánchez, the prime minister since June, whom he accused of disregard for the constitution in his negotiations with Catalan separatists. In doing so, Mr Rivera has tried to define the character of the election due on April 28th. It will be about the unity of Spain and it will be a contest between the Socialists on the one hand and a threeheaded block to the right of centre in which Ciudadanos has lined up with the PP and Vox, a new ultra-conservative party.
A fortnight earlierthis trio joined forces in a much bigger demonstration in another Madrid square, to protest against Mr Sánchez. Vox is a Spanish nationalist party that in some respects resembles far-right movements elsewhere in Europe. This is a strange place to be for a liberal party once compared to Emmanuel Macron's En Marche in France. ""I'm surprised they are putting a cordon sanitaire against me and not the far right,"" said Mr Sánchez.
This stance can only be understood in the ""exceptional circumstances"" of Spain, says Inés Arrimadas, until now Ciudadanos's leader in Catalonia and the party's star attraction, who announced in the Plaza de la Villa that she will run for parliament for Barcelona. In October 2017 the separatist regional administration in Catalonia held a ""binding"", although unofficial, referendum and declared independence later that month in defiance of the constitution. These events amounted to a ""coup"", says Ms Arrimadas.
Mr Sánchez came to office after a censure motion against Mariano Rajoy, the previous pp prime minister, and with the backing of Catalan and Basque nationalists in the Madrid parliament. Mr Sánchez has attempted to defuse the conflict in Catalonia through a less confrontational attitude. Ms Arrimadas accuses him of making ""concessions"" to coup-mongers by failing to stop the separatists from using public resources to promote their ""republic"".
Ciudadanos, which was formed in Catalonia, has always had two souls: one liberal and the other anti-separatist and thus Spanish nationalist. It is still liberal on lifestyle issues and favours modernising economic reforms, but these proposals are ""harder to understand"" in a ""polarised scenario"", says Toni Roldán, a Ciudadanos legislator. The party's rise and its decline owe much to the political earthquake caused by Catalan separatism. In a regional election in Catalonia in December 2017 Ms Arrimadas's muscular campaigning helped Ciudadanos win the most votes, although the three separatist groups retained their narrow majority of seats in the Catalan parliament. Because of separatist intimidation ""it's not easy being Ciudadanos in Catalonia,"" she said in the Plaza de la Villa. But as the embodiment of the defence of the Spanish nation, the party surged in the national opinion polls.
The Catalan events pushed public opinion, traditionally slightly left of centre, to the right. At the last election in 2016 the right won 46% of the vote; today it polls at 55%, points out Kiko Llaneras, a psephologist. The difference is that today the right is split in three, which means it will probably win fewer parliamentary seats. From nowhere, Vox took 11% of the vote in a regional election in Andalucía in December, helping to eject the Socialists from the regional administration they had run for almost 40 years. Mr Rivera's vetoing of Mr Sánchez is thus a ""defensive move"" to stop Ciudadanos voters moving to Vox, says Mr Llaneras.
It may help Mr Sánchez, in two ways. He broke off talks with the separatists last month, although this contributed to him losing his budget and thus precipitated his calling of the election. He is now seeking votes in the centre ground from which Ciudadanos is retreating. After the shock in Andalucía, where some 400,000 left-wing voters stayed at home, the Socialists expect the spectre of Vox to help get out the vote. The core of Mr Sánchez's campaign will be about ""what kind of country do you want"", says Manuel de la Rocha Vázquez, an adviser to the prime minister. ""Do we want a closed, nationalistic, xenophobic, maledominated society? We strongly believe that the majority of Spaniards are in favour of an open, pluralistic, multicultural, tolerant society,"" he says.
Although this is the third general election since December 2015, its character shows how quickly the country has changed. The past two were held in the shadow of austerity and corruption involving the pp and the Socialists, who seemed to face extinction at the hands of Podemos, a far-left party. Now Podemos is fading amid internal splits. Mr Sánchez, a politician of no fixed ideology, has hastened that process by feinting left in office, with a big increase in the minimum wage and budget proposals for higher social spending. Instead of the Socialists, it is Ciudadanos and the pp who now have to fight on two fronts. Catalan separatism is Spain's thorniest problem. But it is Vox, rather than Podemos, which seems to many like the immediate threat to the system. All this suggests that Mr Rivera's bet on forming a centreright government is a risky one.",230,Spain,A30-57,,False,,0,True

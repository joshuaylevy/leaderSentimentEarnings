IN THE middle of Syntagma Square in central Athens, flanked on one side by parliament and on another by luxury hotels, would-be revolutionaries jostle for space with phlegmatic African street-traders selling handbags. On June 22nd one group of youngsters conducted a spontaneous ""economics lesson"" in which terms such as ""credit event"" and ""haircut"" were explained and deconstructed. Petrograd 1917, or even Paris 1968, it was not.
Nonetheless, the stakes are very high. It is entirely possible that in the weeks to come the situation in Athens could go from being strained, angry and confused to plain catastrophic: negotiations between Greece's economic rescuers and its political leaders may fail, and the state may run out of money and/or crash out of the euro, triggering a financial crisis that would reverberate round the world. 
Even if that were avoided, Greece's fundamental problems would hardly improve. For the country is not just bust, it is deeply uncompetitive, and dealing with that will require years of painful reforms. 
But those gritty realities seem to have escaped most of the actors in the drama which is unfolding inside and outside the Greek parliament. In time-honoured fashion, the country's political parties are jockeying for advantage, with little regard for the disaster that they might help to bring about. Meanwhile, the demonstrators outside are chanting slogans implying that the happy days of living well on borrowed money can come back if they only shout loud enough, and if the ""traitors"" and ""thieves"" who spoiled the party are given their just deserts. 
In the short term, the Socialist government has gained some breathing space in its struggle to endure the twin pressures of popular discontent (over the austerity already imposed) and international demands for reform. The ruling party's fractious legislators, galvanised by fears they might lose power, rallied behind George Papandreou, the prime minister, in the early hours of June 22nd to give his new cabinet a vote of confidence. All 155 Socialists turned out for the roll-call vote, which went strictly along party lines.
Minutes before the vote the opposition walked out because of a noisy, petty argument over whether ""democracy"" had returned to Greece in 1974, when the military dictatorship fell, or in 1981 when the first left-of-centre administration was elected. Mr Papandreou managed to coax his opponents back by pointing out what an appalling impression such squabbles make on the rest of the world at such a grave hour in the country's history. 
New Democracy, the centre-right opposition party, is withholding support for an internationally agreed austerity and privatisation plan on the ground that it can and should be renegotiated, with more emphasis on tax cuts. Few people outside Greece see much scope for that. But some of the government's critics, especially on the left, gleefully observed that Greece's international partners seemed to soften their stance slightly around June 15th, when street protests came to a head and the country looked ungovernable. 
This week's small successes for the government left the anti-austerity protesters outside parliament unimpressed. They said they were issuing their own vote of no confidence in the country's entire political class. Admittedly, their four-week-old tent village (modelled on the Spanish version) looks scruffier by the day. But the protesters say they will stick it out at least until the next critical vote, on a five-year austerity package intended to prevent a default and put the country on the road to recovery. They are planning a ""day of action"" as the vote takes place.
Regardless of the atmosphere on the streets, there are big question-marks over Greece's future. The current EUR 110 billion ($159 billion) bail-out package from its European partners and the International Monetary Fund will not be enough. Mr Papandreou is betting that the EU and the IMF will come up with another EUR 100 billion (or so) to keep the country going until well into 2014, when, perhaps, it can move seamlessly into the EU's new stability mechanism for propping up fiscal miscreants. 
The vote reassured anxious European bureaucrats who have been relying on Mr Papandreou to impose fiscal discipline, setting aside his ""soft"" Socialist credentials. The prime minister had already won a standing ovation from his Panhellenic Socialist Movement's (Pasok's) parliamentary group after reneging on an earlier suggestion that he might make way for a non-political premier--Lucas Papademos, a respected former deputy president of the European Central Bank--and a group of technocrats to handle the next crucial round of reform. 
Some of Mr Papandreou's party faithful were riled by the fact that he mooted the idea of a national-unity government at a meeting with Antonis Samaras, the leader of New Democracy, before he had cleared it with his Socialist colleagues. Aides to Mr Papandreou say his proposal to Mr Samaras, made in the highest interests of the country, was torpedoed within hours when New Democracy leaked the content of their discussion to the press. So it was clear enough who had acted in a statesmanlike way, and who was playing small-time politics. Tough men to the fore
The prime minister moved quickly to shore up his own position within the party by promoting some old Socialist warhorses and dispensing with some young proteges who were seen as personal friends. Out went Tina Birbili, the environment and energy minister, who opposed privatisation of the state electricity company, and Dimitris Droutsas, whose youth and inexperience had made him a surprising choice as foreign minister. Also demoted was Louka Katseli, an American-trained economist who, as labour minister, had got involved in public disagreements with number-crunchers from the IMF. 
Into the forefront of politics came a group of tough Socialists led by Evangelos Venizelos, formerly the defence minister, who has now been appointed finance minister. Mr Venizelos was once a rival of Mr Papandreou's, challenging him unsuccessfully for the party leadership after Pasok's 2007 election defeat. The burly constitutional lawyer, a powerful orator whose manner is both earthy and cerebral, took over from George Papaconstantinou, a technocratic figure who had become a liability because of his indefatigable efforts to carry out EU- and IMF-mandated reforms to the letter. 
Mr Venizelos has held seven previous cabinet posts; he oversaw preparations for the 2004 Athens Olympics, which were considered a huge success in spite of serious cost overruns and a graveyard of white-elephant buildings left behind. In a passionate speech during the confidence vote, he caught public attention by saying that whatever the numbers might show, the government understood how desperate things were for many ordinary folk. 
On the debit side, Mr Venizelos has never held a finance portfolio. And he annoyed his colleagues at his first meeting of euro-area finance ministers by suggesting, in a piece of posturing, that the euro zone needed Greece just as much as Greece needed the zone (see Charlemagne). 
Will the new cabinet prove any more effective at reforming? The lenders' demands seem huge: cutting 150,000 public jobs and raising EUR 50 billion from privatisation sales by 2015. Job protection in the public sector and keeping control of state-owned utilities are two of Pasok's most cherished sacred cows. Mr Venizelos may chip away at the edges by closing down some outdated state entities and selling shares in some profitable state companies. But the sweeping changes required by the EU and the IMF are unlikely to happen, at least in the short term. 
Mr Samaras, as opposition leader, has taken an equivocal position. He argues that the medium-term budget targets are correct, but the methods proposed to hit them are wrong. The economy, he says, has already been squeezed to the point of collapsing. 
The depth of Greece's recession, with the economy set to shrink by another 3.8-4% this year--more than projected--after dwindling by 4.5% in 2010, suggests that Mr Samaras has a point. The conservatives voted for more than a dozen pieces of legislation required under the current bail-out, but are insistent that they will vote against the new package. This stance infuriates both the EU and the IMF, who worry that if Greece's fractious politicians cannot unite even when bankruptcy threatens, then they have little chance of avoiding that fate. Summer's respite
The stakes are rising. Greece needs to get a EUR 12 billion loan tranche by mid-July or risk being unable to pay wages and pensions at the end of the month. EU and IMF officials arrived on June 22nd to help fine-tune EUR 6 billion of emergency fiscal measures aimed at bringing this year's budget back on track, as well as the EUR 22 billion medium-term package--just as Mr Venizelos and Mr Papaconstantinou, now the energy minister, were tweaking some unpopular measures to make them more palatable to voters. Mistrust between Greece and its international lenders runs high, after months of near-standstill in Athens on the reform effort. 
With his new government in place, Mr Papandreou has a good chance of winning the votes on the new package and an enabling law to ensure that individual measures can be implemented quickly. Greeks will then start feeling moderately hopeful that euro-zone finance ministers will sign off on the July loan tranche and, if all goes better than expected, even reach a deal on the second, EUR 100 billion-odd bail-out loan for their country. 
The political mood in Greece improves almost automatically in July and August as the urban population heads en masse for family villages in the islands or mountains. There are few human woes that cannot be eased a little by exposure to the dreamlike beauty of the Aegean. But this year may yet prove an exception, especially if politicians and protesters alike insist on behaving as if they lived almost anywhere except on planet Earth.

IT TOOK several days of back-and-forth talks, missed deadlines and public and private outrage, but Greece finally has a new prime minister. On November 10th Lucas Papademos, a former vice-president of the European Central Bank, was named to replace George Papandreou, who had pledged to stand down four days earlier. The decision meant Greece had come full circle in less than a working week: on November 7th Mr Papademos had looked like a shoo-in for the job before negotiations went sour.
It may have taken a while to reach, but the choice at least looks sensible. Mr Papademos, an academic economist and a member of no political party, has the reputation to reassure Greece's bail-out partners, and his financial expertise should prove useful when it comes to implementing the complexities of the looming 50% haircut private holders of Greece's bonds must suffer, under a deal struck in Brussels on October 26th.
The last casualty of this week's wrangling was Philippos Petsalnikos, the speaker of parliament. A German-speaker skilled at keeping Greek lawmakers in order, he looked like a dead certainty to replace Mr Papandreou on the afternoon of November 9th. Mr Papandreou even delivered an emotional valedictory television address to the nation (although he did not name Mr Petsalnikos as his successor). Yet later that day Mr Papandreou (pictured, above, with President Karolos Papoulias) was forced to withdraw Mr Petsalnikos's candidacy amid a threatened rebellion by backbenchers in his Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok). They blamed Mr Petsalnikos for helping Mr Papandreou put together his ill-fated proposal for a referendum on Greece's new EUR 130 billion ($178 billion) bail-out package. That plan had been shot down by euro-zone leaders at the G20 summit in Cannes, triggering Mr Papandreou's decision on November 6th to step down (see Charlemagne).
Mr Papademos's ""first"" candidacy fell foul because he wanted to choose his own economic team. This proved unacceptable to Pasok, largely because it would probably not have included Evangelos Venizelos, Mr Papandreou's finance minister, who is not popular among EU and IMF officials. New Democracy was not keen on Mr Papademos either; he wanted an open-ended term rather than stick to an agreed February 19th deadline for elections.
Mr Venizelos threw his hat into the ring at the last moment, after running a whispering campaign against Mr Papademos. An ambitious constitutional lawyer, he is keen to succeed Mr Papandreou as Pasok leader. But he needs a position from which to build his campaign.
Mr Papademos kept a dignified distance from the chaotic politicking of the last week. But he reportedly added two more conditions. He wants support from New Democracy, which was reluctant to take up more than a few cabinet posts in the new government. And in line with a European Commission demand, he insists that both party leaders should sign a letter of commitment to the new bail-out terms. 
Mr Papandreou is willing to sign up. But Mr Samaras caused consternation in Brussels by apparently refusing to do so following objections from his party (though a later statement left open the possibility).

Over the next few weeks Mr Papademos will struggle with the country's first coalition government in modern times. Left-wing parties rejected Mr Papandreou's call for national unity. They plan to take their opposition to the streets.","How not to form a government 
 IT TOOK several days of back - and - forth talks , missed deadlines and public and private outrage , but Greece finally has a new prime minister . On November 10th Lucas Papademos was named to replace George Papandreou , who had pledged to stand down four days earlier . The decision meant Greece had come full circle in less than a working week : on November 7th Lucas Papademos had looked like a shoo - in for the job before negotiations went sour . 
 It may have taken a while to reach , but the choice at least looks sensible . Lucas Papademos has the reputation to reassure Greece 's bail - out partners , and Lucas Papademos's financial expertise should prove useful when it comes to implementing the complexities of the looming 50 % haircut private holders of Greece 's bonds must suffer , under a deal struck in Brussels on October 26th . 
 The last casualty of this week 's wrangling was Philippos Petsalnikos , the speaker of parliament . A German - speaker skilled at keeping Greek lawmakers in order , he looked like a dead certainty to replace Mr Papandreou on the afternoon of November 9th . Mr Papandreou even delivered an emotional valedictory television address to the nation ( although he did not name Mr Petsalnikos as his successor ) . Yet later that day Mr Papandreou ( pictured , above , with President Karolos Papoulias ) was forced to withdraw Mr Petsalnikos 's candidacy amid a threatened rebellion by backbenchers in his Panhellenic Socialist Movement ( Pasok ) . They blamed Mr Petsalnikos for helping Mr Papandreou put together his ill - fated proposal for a referendum on Greece 's new EUR 130 billion ( $ 178 billion ) bail - out package . That plan had been shot down by euro - zone leaders at the G20 summit in Cannes , triggering Mr Papandreou 's decision on November 6th to step down ( see Charlemagne ) . 
 Lucas Papademos's "" first "" candidacy fell foul because he wanted to choose his own economic team . This proved unacceptable to Pasok , largely because it would probably not have included Evangelos Venizelos , Mr Papandreou 's finance minister , who is not popular among EU and IMF officials . New Democracy was not keen on Lucas Papademos either ; Lucas Papademos wanted an open - ended term rather than stick to an agreed February 19th deadline for elections . 
 Mr Venizelos threw his hat into the ring at the last moment , after running a whispering campaign against Lucas Papademos . An ambitious constitutional lawyer , he is keen to succeed Mr Papandreou as Pasok leader . But he needs a position from which to build his campaign . 
 Lucas Papademos kept a dignified distance from the chaotic politicking of the last week . But Lucas Papademos reportedly added two more conditions . Lucas Papademos wants support from New Democracy , which was reluctant to take up more than a few cabinet posts in the new government . And in line with a European Commission demand , Lucas Papademos insists that both party leaders should sign a letter of commitment to the new bail - out terms . 
 Mr Papandreou is willing to sign up . But Mr Samaras caused consternation in Brussels by apparently refusing to do so following objections from his party ( though a later statement left open the possibility ) . Mr Samaras annoyed Angela Merkel , the German chancellor , and other European conservatives by opposing Greece 's first bail - out . He says he supports the second one , but EU officials are still unconvinced .

THE designers of the good ship euro wanted to create the greatest liner of the age. But as everybody now knows, it was fit only for fair-weather sailing, with an anarchic crew and no lifeboat. Its rules of economic seamanship were rudimentary, and were broken anyway. When it struck a reef two years ago, the water flooded one compartment after another. 
""The situation is extremely serious, more so perhaps than at any point in the last 18 months,"" Jose Manuel Barroso, the European Commission president, said this week. He announced two last-ditch initiatives to avert doom. One is a ""green paper"" on options for joint Eurobonds. To balance this mutualisation of debt, he also proposed stronger monitoring of national budgets by Brussels, including the right to recommend changes before they are submitted to parliaments, and fiercer oversight of countries ""in severe difficulties"".
Renaming Eurobonds as stability bonds, the green paper is almost an act of insubordination against Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor. She is strongly against the idea and has also declared that only a treaty change can impose enough rules to ward off another disaster. Eurobonds and treaty change together just might make for a better vessel, but they would take years to put into effect. Why design a safer imaginary ship when the present real one is about to sink?
Mrs Merkel speaks often of the need to save the euro, but she acts as if there were no imminent danger. Germany has stayed dry. If other crew members are neck-deep in icy water, she thinks it serves them right; only the fear of God (and the bond markets) will teach them to be responsible. Yet there are clear dangers in this policy. One is that it provokes a mutiny against Germany. The second is that the Germans miscalculate. At some point a listing ship topples over, and Germany would plunge into the sea with everybody else. A German bondsale this week was alarmingly undersubscribed. A paper by Ulrike Guerot, of the European Council on Foreign Relations, a think-tank, expresses the fear that, rather like the Soviet Union, the European Union could go down quickly if the euro starts breaking up.
For now, there is a surreal atmosphere in Brussels. Like the band on the Titanic that played on to the end, the EU's bureaucracy keeps producing studies, policies and regulations. At one briefing this week, officials said ""this is a very good day, not just for European sharks, but for sharks worldwide."" This was no allusion to hated financial speculators. Instead, it was about a new ban on shark-finning, ie, the removal of fins from sharks caught in European waters or by European ships elsewhere.
European officials now recognise the folly of creating the euro without preparing for trouble. It would be wise to be planning now for what to do if it sinks. But officials have spent so long giving warnings of the horror of a Greek default, not to speak of its departure from the euro, that they cannot. ""I prefer not to think about it,"" says one. 
Below decks the chatter is of European fonctionnaires scrabbling around for ways to protect their savings. But as an institution, the EU fears that even a hint of defeatism may spread panic. ""If anybody wrote a paper on contingency planning for the break-up of the euro, it would leak out immediately,"" says one official. Even now, after decades of ""European construction"", many Eurocrats cannot conceive of the euro as a wreck. Those who have worked hardest to keep it afloat are exhausted and know it is not in their power to save it anyway.
Even national governments are not masters of their fate. Both Lucas Papademos and Mario Monti, the technocrats running Greece and Italy after their predecessors were cast overboard, came to Brussels this week to meet Mr Barroso and Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council (representing European leaders). Theirs looked like a council of the powerless. If not the market, what of Merkel and Mario?
Nothing that Brussels, Rome or Athens can do is likely to impress the markets. The issue is whether they can impress those with the money: Mrs Merkel and Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank? Many proposals to save the euro--issuing Eurobonds, getting the ECB to act as a lender of last resort to governments (and not just banks) or using the IMF-issued reserves known as Special Drawing Rights--have been rejected by Germany, for both legal and political reasons. The ECB has offered valuable but strictly limited help. It is keeping its distance for fear of dirtying itself by lending to governments and, perhaps, stoking inflation. Salvation must come from political leaders, says Mr Draghi; why have they not acted on their October decision to boost the European Financial Stability Facility? ""We should not be waiting any longer,"" he says.
In Brussels the belief (or perhaps just the hope) is that a show of reforming zeal by weaker members of the euro zone plus a determination by EU institutions to impose discipline could be enough to persuade Germany and the ECB to ease up. At some point, many argue, Germany must come to its senses. The situation is desperate. France may lose its AAA credit rating. Even the rigorous Finns and Dutch have seen bond spreads widen. 
But no single action can save the euro. This is not just because Germany wants others to feel the pain for a long time, but also because the damage from poor leadership and procrastination is so extensive. The euro will require a full redesign through new treaties, with Eurobonds and possibly much else besides. If this is to happen, though, it must first survive. It is time for Mrs Merkel to grasp that her country risks being caught up in the euro's catastrophic failure--and for Mr Draghi to admit that he risks finding himself without a job.","Denial and delusion in Brussels , as the single currency founders

BUILDERS are putting the finishing touches to a triumphal arch in Skopje, Macedonia's capital (above). Yet for most of this small, poor country's 20-year history there have been few triumphs.

But on December 5th judges at the International Court of Justice in The Hague at last gave the Macedonians a victory. 
In 1995 the United Nations brokered an accord under which, until the issue was resolved, Greece would not prevent Macedonia from joining international organisations so long as it went under the clunky label of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, or FYROM.

It is this claim that the ICJ has now upheld. 
Yet Macedonia's victory looks hollow, at least for now. The court refused to instruct Greece to refrain from similar conduct in the future, arguing that there was no reason to suppose it would behave this way again. And after the ruling Anders Fogh Rasmussen, NATO's secretary-general, said that in 2008 the alliance had decided not to invite Macedonia until the name issue was resolved; this, he made clear, had not changed. 
What about the European Union? Since 2009 Greece has blocked it from offering Macedonia a date for accession talks. Lucas Papademos, the new Greek prime minister, is preoccupied with the financial crisis and uncomfortable dealing with the name row.

But that looks naive. Spyros Economides, an academic at the London School of Economics, says that no pressure has been put on Greece to let Macedonia begin EU accession talks, and he does not expect any now. The euro crisis means that enlargement is hardly a priority for Europe. Indeed, many countries are quite happy to find any excuse not to pursue it.

THE news from Greece gets ever grimmer. GDP will shrink in 2012 for the fourth year in a row. Talk of a default and/or departure from the euro is growing. This week Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor, demanded urgent progress towards a deal imposing a ""haircut"" on private creditors (which may now have to be bigger than 50%), saying that Greece might otherwise not get its second European Union/IMF loan. And thieves have just stolen a Picasso painting from the national gallery, where only one guard was on duty. 
Yet most evenings Athens is buzzing. Around Syntagma Square, the scene of so many protests, the streets are crowded, with cheery music playing. In nearby Karytsi Square, bars and restaurants are packed with rowdy people; some are even jolly. The mojitos may have been replaced by cheap beer, but Athenians live for an evening out with friends. ""Staying home is not an option,"" says a classics student from Athens University. ""It's too depressing."" 
But when day follows night, the buzz gives way to bleakness. Sofokleous Street, home of the Athens Stock Exchange until 2007, is now the site of the city's main soup kitchen. It is a meeting-place for the homeless and for those too poor to afford food. To the east, on Kifissias Avenue, many small shops have gone bust, often to be replaced by gold dealers, pawnbrokers or seedy shops selling sexual paraphernalia. 
There has been a surge in crime. Police statistics show both petty theft and breaking and entering on the rise. In the first half of 2011 some 314 house burglaries were reported in Athens, over twice as many as in 2010. Crime has spread to places thought of as safe only a couple of years ago. 
Homelessness has also shot up. Klimaka, a charity, estimates that 20,000 people in Greece have no home, 25% more than in 2008. Before the crisis, the homeless were usually 35- to 50-year-old reclusive men from poor backgrounds. Now the streets are home to the young, struggling to find jobs, and the middle-aged, whose careers have been cut short. Many are educated; some are graduates. Most have lost their homes because of debts. Georgios Barkouris, a musician from a middle-class Athenian family, worked for two decades for the national radio station. When recession hit he found himself without a job--and, soon enough, without a home, too. One in five Greeks lives below the poverty line. ""Expecting homelessness to double this year"", says Mr Barkouris, ""is awfully optimistic."" 
Since Greece's first bail-out in May 2010, the government has imposed austerity, increasing taxes so much that people can barely manage. The unemployment rate is 19% and rising. GDP has contracted by 12.5% since 2008 and is expected to fall by another 3% this year. Even middle-class Greeks are being driven into poverty. Property prices and rents have plunged. But property taxes have tripled. 
The biggest blows have fallen on small family businesses (with 50 employees or fewer), which make up 99% of enterprises and employ three-quarters of the private-sector workforce. Many have closed or sacked most of their staff. Big businesses (such as banks or private hospitals) are suffering, too. Indeed, the entire private sector is haemorrhaging workers. Of the 470,000 who have lost their jobs since 2008, not one came from the public sector. The civil service has had a 13.5% pay cut and some reductions in benefits, but no net job losses. Already low, public-sector productivity has fallen further. This has led to deep resentment of the civil service, which has mushroomed in the past three decades and now employs almost a fifth of the workforce. 
Outside Athens the situation is a little better. Except for Thessaloniki, Greece's second city, the rest of the country has not seen the protests and social unrest of the capital. The cost of living and house prices are lower and family ties stronger. ""Everyone has a place to stay here,"" notes a teacher in Preveza, a coastal town in the north-west. Crime is lower. Figures from the Research Institute for Tourism show that in 2011, 64% of murders and 75% of robberies took place in the capital. 
The economy is also holding up better outside Athens. Tourism and agriculture have always counted for more in the countryside and on the coasts. The Association of Greek Tourism Enterprises reports that, in the first half of 2011, tourist arrivals increased by 13.9% (and revenues by 13.4%) over the same period in 2010. And farm exports have risen by 9.1%. A few city workers are even going back to the land. Outside Athens some in the public sector see their jobs as a sideline to earn pin money while their main occupation is farming. 
Many Greeks have chosen to move abroad in search of a better future. Successful academics, bankers and engineers have already fled for better pay and work conditions. Some have even gone without a job offer, usually to places such as Australia or Canada, where the Greek diaspora is large. The most destructive brain drain is of the young. Since 2008, ever more young people (mostly in their 20s) have gone, often to foreign universities. ""When I left to study abroad in 2006 I was the odd man out,"" says a young Greek lawyer. ""Now I thank my lucky stars."" Greece's archaic education system and strikes have held back those who pursued their education at home. Exams have been delayed or cancelled. Some students are a year or more behind in their studies. 
If they manage to graduate, the prospects are still poor. Youth unemployment is over 47% (and rising). Those lucky enough to find a job are underpaid, overtaxed and, often, overqualified. They, too, may drift abroad. Young doctors go to Sweden for specialist training; engineers move to Abu Dhabi; many others head for Berlin, where life is cheaper and more fun. All this hugely damages Greece's prospects, given an ageing population. Within a decade the workforce will be shrinking, although the number of pensioners will keep growing. Disenchanted on Syntagma Square 
Not surprisingly the popularity of politicians and political parties is at an all-time low. Some voters have warmed to a populist, anti-EU message. But they have not yet gathered enough traction to challenge Greece's pro-EU, pro-euro course. The chief feeling is of disenchantment, not with Brussels or Berlin, but with the two main parties whose corruption, nepotism and incompetence helped create such a terrible mess. Polls find 77% of Greeks wanting the unity government led by Lucas Papademos, a technocrat and former central banker, to take all necessary measures to keep Greece in the euro. For the time being, the consensus is that an exit would spell disaster. 
The preference for Mr Papademos reflects his apolitical credentials and financial expertise. His 66% approval rate is the highest among political leaders and over three times that of his Socialist predecessor, George Papandreou. Since he took over in November a measure of calm has returned. But that is now threatened by renewed crisis--and by a general election expected in April. The election may prove a risky distraction from the structural changes required for Greece to secure its next tranche of aid. The centre-right New Democracy is expected to trounce the Socialists, but voters could yet elect a parliament with seven or eight parties, forcing it into a coalition that might find it harder to push through reforms. 
For over 30 years Greeks lived lavishly as the public sector became bloated, EU money poured in and many people routinely tricked the system. During the past three years, Greeks have been asked to endure hardship and humiliation. It is no wonder that they have often taken to the streets, nor that they feel depressed. The question is how much more they can take. The election could prove to be a breaking-point, as Greece stumbles towards disorderly default. So far the Greek people have demonstrated extraordinary stoicism--but that may not last forever.
Caption: A Greek tricoteuse before the fall","Greece 's economic crisis is worsening -- as is life for ordinary Greeks 
 THE news from Greece gets ever grimmer . GDP will shrink in 2012 for the fourth year in a row . Talk of a default and/or departure from the euro is growing . This week Angela Merkel , Germany 's chancellor , demanded urgent progress towards a deal imposing a "" haircut "" on private creditors ( which may now have to be bigger than 50 % ) , saying that Greece might otherwise not get its second European Union / IMF loan . And thieves have just stolen a Picasso painting from the national gallery , where only one guard was on duty . 
 Yet most evenings Athens is buzzing . Around Syntagma Square , the scene of so many protests , the streets are crowded , with cheery music playing . In nearby Karytsi Square , bars and restaurants are packed with rowdy people ; some are even jolly . The mojitos may have been replaced by cheap beer , but Athenians live for an evening out with friends . "" Staying home is not an option , "" says a classics student from Athens University . "" It 's too depressing . "" 
 But when day follows night , the buzz gives way to bleakness . Sofokleous Street , home of the Athens Stock Exchange until 2007 , is now the site of the city 's main soup kitchen . It is a meeting - place for the homeless and for those too poor to afford food . To the east , on Kifissias Avenue , many small shops have gone bust , often to be replaced by gold dealers , pawnbrokers or seedy shops selling sexual paraphernalia . 
 There has been a surge in crime . Police statistics show both petty theft and breaking and entering on the rise . In the first half of 2011 some 314 house burglaries were reported in Athens , over twice as many as in 2010 . Crime has spread to places thought of as safe only a couple of years ago . 
 Homelessness has also shot up . Klimaka , a charity , estimates that 20,000 people in Greece have no home , 25 % more than in 2008 . Before the crisis , the homeless were usually 35- to 50 - year - old reclusive men from poor backgrounds . Now the streets are home to the young , struggling to find jobs , and the middle - aged , whose careers have been cut short . Many are educated ; some are graduates . Most have lost their homes because of debts . Georgios Barkouris , a musician from a middle - class Athenian family , worked for two decades for the national radio station . When recession hit he found himself without a job -- and , soon enough , without a home , too . One in five Greeks lives below the poverty line . "" Expecting homelessness to double this year "" , says Mr Barkouris , "" is awfully optimistic . "" 
 Since Greece 's first bail - out in May 2010 , the government has imposed austerity , increasing taxes so much that people can barely manage . The unemployment rate is 19 % and rising . GDP has contracted by 12.5 % since 2008 and is expected to fall by another 3 % this year . Even middle - class Greeks are being driven into poverty . Property prices and rents have plunged . But property taxes have tripled . 
 The biggest blows have fallen on small family businesses ( with 50 employees or fewer ) , which make up 99 % of enterprises and employ three - quarters of the private - sector workforce .

TAKING big decisions on Greece's future suggests high drama. But the delays, muddle and political posturing dogging efforts to win a EUR 130 billion ($170 billion) bail-out from its European Union partners could be from an old Athenian comedy. This week the three political leaders supporting a fractious government were arguing over the details of an austerity package with Lucas Papademos, the caretaker prime minister. Their meeting was repeatedly delayed as the ""troika"" (the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF) grappled with Evangelos Venizelos, the finance minister, over EUR 3 billion of spending cuts. 
Foot-dragging over reform is a big reason for Greece's sick state. The economy may shrink this year by around 3%, after 6% last year. Unemployment hit 19% in January. Almost one in two young Greeks is without a job. Given the outlook, investors have unsurprisingly shied away from new privatisations. Delays by finance-ministry officials have also infuriated the troika. Only after it had dismissed their latest proposals as ""unrealistic"" and ""farcical"" did Mr Venizelos cave in. A 20% reduction in the minimum wage, another round of pension cuts and 15,000 public-sector job cuts are among the measures the politicians are being asked to swallow in the next 15 days. 
Once the deal is done, Greece can arrange a ""voluntary"" debt swap, in which private owners of Greek bonds would write off 70% of their value, but could eventually recoup a chunk if the economy recovers. The debt would be reduced by EUR 100 billion (from EUR 350 billion) but would still be 120% of GDP in 2020 (from 160% now). Greece might one day be able to pay back the full amount, argue the project's backers, though many are sceptical that a full-scale default can be avoided. 
The politicians care only about the short term. As soon as the bond swap is approved, the EU and IMF will release fresh funding, a EUR 14.4 billion bond expiring on March 20th will be repaid and an election campaign can begin. Mr Papademos, a former ECB vice-president, will not run; he is expected to take an academic post in America. Antonis Samaras, leader of the conservative New Democracy party, has called for an election on April 8th. His party holds an unassailable lead in the opinion polls, yet not enough for an outright majority. New Democracy would win 33% of the vote, says a recent poll, ahead of the 18% for the Democratic Left, led by Fotis Kouvelis, a veteran left-winger. 
Greece needs political stability to turn the economy around. Yet there is no obvious coalition partner for Mr Samaras apart from the right-wing Laos (People's) party under George Karatzaferis, now enjoying its first taste of power as a junior partner in Mr Papademos's government. The once powerful Panhellenic Socialist Movement has plunged to 8%, a record low, say the polls. A leadership battle started after George Papandreou, who handed power to Mr Papademos only halfway through his four-year term, announced he would step down, though without saying when. He is unlikely to run again. Mr Venizelos, the front-runner to succeed him, may have to put in a longish spell in opposition. 
Voters brought up on Greece's ""relationship"" politics, in which party connections win public-sector jobs and perks, feel betrayed. A new popular movement, ""I won't vote"", may attract strong support. Smaller left-wing parties will make gains. So will the far-right, anti-immigrant Chryssi Avgi (Golden Dawn) group, which is close to reaching the 3% threshold for entry into parliament, according to recent polls. Greece's fragmented and increasingly polarised politics could become the real obstacle to reform.","Tough fiscal negotiations run into hard political reality

Greeks have grown used to street protests after consecutive years of economic decline, but they were still shocked by the damage on the night of February 12th. Criminals, not leftists, were to blame, some victims claimed. George Stergiakis, another cinema owner, said his property was firebombed after he refused a demand for protection money. Whoever was responsible, the arson attacks have reinforced fears that, as the economy deteriorates, social disruption will continue. 
Greek GDP shrank by almost 7% in 2011. It will fall again this year, by at least another 4%, according to the troika--the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF--in charge of Greece's bail-out. Greek politicians say they are determined to do better. The uneasy coalition between the socialists of Pasok and the conservatives from New Democracy (Laos, a small right-wing party has pulled out) under Lucas Papademos, a former central banker, has accepted EUR 3.3 billion ($4.3 billion) in spending cuts. The next step is to sign up to a new three-year reform programme in return for a fresh EUR 130 billion bail-out, which, with a big debt restructuring, is meant to avert a disorderly default next month. 
The latest measures are tougher than their predecessors. Revenue-raising plans were dashed by the depth of the recession, and by the finance ministry's failure to crack down on corrupt tax officials. Instead, wages and pensions are to be cut. So is spending on defence, health and local government, where officials had turned a blind eye to budget overruns. The troika's critics say these cuts will only increase the Greeks' misery. They claim that a 22% reduction in the minimum wage, aimed at boosting competitiveness, will shrink the economy by another 1.5% this year as cash-strapped workers consume less. 
Yet the politicians have set aside their populist instincts to follow their creditors' instructions. Parliament approved the austerity measures by a two-thirds majority (though 22 socialist and 21 conservative lawmakers voted against, and lost their party whips). Then George Papandreou, the former Pasok prime minister, and Antonis Samaras, New Democracy's leader, both sent letters to the troika pledging to implement the new programme no matter who wins the election expected in April. 
There was relief when Mr Samaras, who had opposed previous reforms, made his letter public. If New Democracy wins the election, he wants ""modifications"" (meaning extra spending aimed at promoting recovery). But he insists these would be made only in agreement with the troika. Opinion polls give the conservatives a strong lead, though it may be waning and is not enough to win an outright majority. Pasok is picking up support following the emergence of Evangelos Venizelos, the finance minister, as the likely next leader (Mr Papandreou will stand down). There is talk of a conservative-socialist coalition being formed after the election, which could provide enough stability for Greece to keep reforming. 
Yet the euro group of finance ministers is not convinced. It delayed approving the austerity package, and not just because Mr Venizelos at first failed to give details of an extra EUR 325m of cuts. The group will probably say yes on February 20th, but there is talk of holding back some bail-out money until after the election or of offering a bridging loan. The German, Dutch and Finnish finance ministers are impatient with Greece's poor record of reform. North Europeans suspect that Mr Samaras will be tempted to give up on austerity. 
To make the reforms stick, Wolfgang Schauble, the German finance minister, even suggested postponing the election and setting up a small technocratic cabinet like Italy's to run Greece for the next two years. Greeks are growing increasingly resentful at what they deem to be German high-handedness. The Greek president, Karolos Papoulias, demanded, ""Who is Mr Schauble to revile Greece? Who are the Dutch?

GREEK politicians have rarely been so unpopular. Back at home for the carnival holiday weekend, one lawmaker was thumped with a fake plastic club. Others were dubbed thieves, vagabonds and traitors by angry voters. Even backbenchers are blamed for the country's deepening economic woes, whether they come from the conservative New Democracy party, a reckless borrower when in power, or the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok), which failed to clean up the mess. 
Under Lucas Papademos, a former central banker serving as an unelected prime minister, most ND and Pasok legislators have backed further austerity measures in return for a new EUR 130 billion ($174 billion) bail-out by the European Union and the IMF. (Greece's fragmented left-wing parties voted against.) The government has done better than expected, so some leading Greek businessmen want Mr Papademos to stay on until its term runs out in October 2013. That is wishful thinking, given the urgency within Pasok over choosing a new leader to replace George Papandreou, the former prime minister, who is to step down this month. And Antonis Samaras, the ND leader, is growing ever more impatient to lead the country. 
Mr Papademos promises that an election will be held, implying soon. Many Greeks expect to go to the polls in late April or May, after the government completes its debt restructuring and draws the first instalment of the new loan. Voters are bitterly divided, say the polls, which show ND finishing first, with 25-30%, but well short of an overall majority. Mr Samaras is trying to win back right-wingers who opposed the bail-out. 
Pasok is doing worse, on 8-12%, behind three left-wing parties that were against the bail-out. Some Socialists have been talking up the Democratic Left, a catch-all party for the dissatisfied middle class led by Fotis Kouvelis, a veteran lawyer. With 15-18% of the vote, Mr Kouvelis's party is now second to ND, but he has little appetite for power-sharing. 
Pasok's leadership battle is one reason why its popularity has plunged. Half-a-dozen candidates are jostling to succeed Mr Papandreou. Evangelos Venizelos, the finance minister and front-runner, has been too preoccupied with the bail-out and debt restructuring to devote much time to campaigning. But by the time of the leadership contest on March 18th, he may have swept most rivals aside. He has few qualms about forming a coalition with Mr Samaras, continuing the present arrangement, though sceptics worry that having two populists in charge without the calming presence of Mr Papademos would be bad for the cause of reform. 
Some observers fret over an apparent explosion of support for small parties. Others say this is just a gesture of protest. At the election, the protesters may well abstain. Whichever parties come to power, Greece's commitment to cutting 150,000 public-sector jobs by 2015 will mean that lawmakers have trouble finding cosy positions for their supporters. If the politicians can no longer fulfil their side of a 150-year-old bargain, say the cynics, voters might just as well stay at home.

Even backbenchers are blamed for the country 's deepening economic woes , whether they come from the conservative New Democracy party , a reckless borrower when in power , or the Panhellenic Socialist Movement ( Pasok ) , which failed to clean up the mess . 
 Under Lucas Papademos , most ND and Pasok legislators have backed further austerity measures in return for a new EUR 130 billion ( $ 174 billion ) bail - out by the European Union and the IMF . ( Greece 's fragmented left - wing parties voted against . ) The government has done better than expected , so some leading Greek businessmen want Lucas Papademos to stay on until its term runs out in October 2013 . That is wishful thinking , given the urgency within Pasok over choosing a new leader to replace George Papandreou , the former prime minister , who is to step down this month . And Antonis Samaras , the ND leader , is growing ever more impatient to lead the country . 
 Lucas Papademos promises that an election will be held , implying soon . Many Greeks expect to go to the polls in late April or May , after the government completes its debt restructuring and draws the first instalment of the new loan . Voters are bitterly divided , say the polls , which show ND finishing first , with 25 - 30 % , but well short of an overall majority . Mr Samaras is trying to win back right - wingers who opposed the bail - out . 
 Pasok is doing worse , on 8 - 12 % , behind three left - wing parties that were against the bail - out . Some Socialists have been talking up the Democratic Left , a catch - all party for the dissatisfied middle class led by Fotis Kouvelis , a veteran lawyer . With 15 - 18 % of the vote , Mr Kouvelis 's party is now second to ND , but he has little appetite for power - sharing . 
 Pasok 's leadership battle is one reason why its popularity has plunged . Half - a - dozen candidates are jostling to succeed Mr Papandreou . Evangelos Venizelos , the finance minister and front - runner , has been too preoccupied with the bail - out and debt restructuring to devote much time to campaigning . But by the time of the leadership contest on March 18th , he may have swept most rivals aside . He has few qualms about forming a coalition with Mr Samaras , continuing the present arrangement , though sceptics worry that having two populists in charge without the calming presence of Lucas Papademos would be bad for the cause of reform . 
 Some observers fret over an apparent explosion of support for small parties . Others say this is just a gesture of protest . At the election , the protesters may well abstain . Whichever parties come to power , Greece 's commitment to cutting 150,000 public - sector jobs by 2015 will mean that lawmakers have trouble finding cosy positions for their supporters . If the politicians can no longer fulfil their side of a 150 - year - old bargain , say the cynics , voters might just as well stay at home .

A SHAKE-UP of Greece's cosy two-party political system would hardly be a surprise, given the economic and social upheaval caused by the country's worst recession in almost a century. Many voters are sick of the corruption and clientelism that has flourished under the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) and the conservative New Democracy party, which have alternated in power for 30-odd years. At Greece's general election, likely to be held on May 6th, polls suggest that many voters will back small anti-reform parties led by veteran political hacks. 
Scaremongers claim that three left-wing parties--unreconstructed communists (KKE), hardline radicals (Syriza) and spendthrift socialists (Democratic Left)--are fomenting social unrest that could undermine Greece's new bail-out, worth up to EUR 174 billion ($227 billion), and drive it out of the euro. Others worry about far-right parties like Golden Dawn, which for the first time is likely to beat the 3% threshold to enter parliament and Laos. Up to ten parties might win seats at the election. 
But will they count for much? The two big parties still look strong. New Democracy is far ahead in the polls. Pasok has been in fourth place in some, trailing Democratic Left and even the communists. Yet Evangelos Venizelos, the finance minister and sole candidate to become party leader, believes voters will flock back once he takes over. His first test comes on March 18th, when Pasok's ""friends and supporters"" are due to endorse him as leader by turning up at a polling station and paying EUR 2 for a ballot paper (to cover the cost of the election, supposedly). A turnout below 100,000 would be ""rather embarrassing"", admits one party official. 
Recently the two big parties have successfully cohabited under Lucas Papademos, a former vice-president of the European Central Bank who became prime minister in a back-room deal last November. Last week Mr Papademos's government oversaw a EUR 100 billion write-off of sovereign debt, giving Greece some breathing-space to get on with the overhaul of its economy. 
New Democracy is unlikely to win a majority. Although Antonis Samaras, its leader, is not tainted by the party's inglorious past (he took over after it lost power in 2009) his backing for the new bail-out, seen by many as a U-turn, has knocked four to five percentage points off its lead. 
Some politicians from Europe's creditor nations worry that elections will distract Greece from its tight reform timetable. Yet despite the rise of small parties, the outcome is unlikely to make a fundamental difference. Many observers believe that New Democracy, boosted by an extra 50 seats which a new election law hands the party that finishes first, will form a new coalition with Pasok. Such a pairing would enjoy a strong majority. Several senior cabinet ministers may keep their jobs. Mr Papademos might even be persuaded to stay, perhaps as Mr Samaras's deputy. That would reassure Europeans that Greece will keep plodding on.","Greece 's election may see more continuity than convulsion

IF GREECE'S creditors had their way, its politicians would be getting on with reforms and not wasting time and EUR 30m ($39m) on a snap general election. Opinion polls suggest that the May 6th vote is unlikely to produce a clear result. Yet the leaders of the PanHellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) and the conservative New Democracy (ND) party, fractious coalition partners for five months, are spoiling for a fight, even if their parties end up joining forces in government again. 
The voters are angry with ND over a public-spending spree that set Greece on the road to ruin, and with Pasok for failing to haul it back from the brink. ND has a modest but persistent poll lead. But Antonis Samaras, its leader, trails Evangelos Venizelos of Pasok by a small margin as the better choice as prime minister. Many Greeks plan to abstain. Others intend to protest by voting for one of ten small parties that oppose the harsh reforms imposed by the European Union and the IMF. 
The latest numbers from MRB, a usually reliable pollster, gives ND 25.4%, down a smidgen from a month ago. Pasok has risen a little, to 15.8%. The same poll also suggests that, despite being dissatisfied with the outgoing coalition, two-thirds of voters want another one to succeed it. 
Mr Samaras has been hit by the defection of Panos Kammenos, a wayward backbencher who wants Russia to replace the EU and IMF as Greece's lender of last resort. His Independent Greeks party could capture 10% of the vote. ND will also lose votes to four right-wing splinter groups. Yet Mr Samaras insists that he can become prime minister, banking on the 50 extra seats awarded to the front-runner under a new electoral law. He threatens to call another election within months if he fails to win an outright majority. 
Mr Venizelos, a former finance minister who took over Pasok's leadership from George Papandreou last month, is trying hard to win back left-of-centre voters. His speeches feature self-criticism and sympathy for impoverished Greeks. He has made overtures to Fotis Kouvelis, the soft-spoken leader of the Democratic Left party, a refuge for aggrieved socialists that is polling around 9%. Pasok's electoral list includes a respectable number of new faces and a record number of women. With a new-look Pasok behind him, Mr Venizelos aims to capture more than 20% of the vote (that is still less than half the 44% that Pasok won under Mr Papandreou in 2009). 
Whatever the outcome, Greece will be even harder to govern than usual. Mr Venizelos says he will not serve under Mr Samaras, though several moderately competent socialists would join a ND-led government. The conservatives are still casting around for a suitable technocrat for finance minister--a job that requires good English, a sound grasp of macroeconomics and a willingness to co-operate with the troika of the EU, IMF and European Central Bank that oversees reforms. Lucas Papademos, a former ECB vice-president who has been serving as a technocratic prime minister, has said he wants to go back to academic life in America. But he might perhaps be lobbied to stay on as deputy prime minister and finance minister. 
Greece is a long way from hitting its fiscal targets. By June the new government must agree another EUR 11 billion of spending cuts for 2013-14.

ALEXIS TSIPRAS, a left-wing upstart who first won a parliamentary seat less than three years ago, could be the man who takes Greece out of the euro. His Syriza (Left Coalition) party, which unites a handful of fractious radical groups, massively increased its vote in the general election on May 6th, mostly at the expense of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok). It has gone from the fringes of politics to being the second-largest party in the Greek parliament. 
The centre-right New Democracy was the largest party; Pasok, previously New Democracy's coalition partner, came in third place with just 13.2% of the vote, its worst election performance in over 30 years. Most important, parties which, like Syriza, are opposed to the austerity measures that Pasok and New Democracy had agreed to as the price of a EUR 130 billion ($169 billion) international bail-out earlier this year ended up with 70% of the vote. This, the recent fall of a budget-cutting Dutch government and the election on May 6th of a Socialist president in France are seen by some in Greece and elsewhere as a widespread challenge to Europe's politics of austerity. 
In a fissiparous display of national desperation the Greek electorate gave no party much support. New Democracy's 18.9% won it 108 seats, thanks to a rule that gives the front-running party an extra 50 seats; Syriza's 16.8% got it 52 seats, and Pasok got 41 seats. The other parties elected were the Communist Party; Independent Greeks, a right-wing splinter group; Democratic Left, a splinter from Syriza; and the neo-fascist Golden Dawn (see chart). 
The collapse of Pasok's vote deprived the pro-euro conservatives and Socialists of an overall majority in parliament, giving Mr Tsipras (pictured) a turn at playing kingmaker during this week's round of coalition negotiations. After New Democracy decided it could not put together a coalition, Mr Tsipras had a go, coming up on May 8th with a list of demands that seemed tailor-made for rejection by the two ""mainstream"" parties. Cheekily, he asked Antonis Samaras and Evangelos Venizelos, the conservative and Socialist leaders, to sign a ""letter of repentance"" reneging on a written pledge to Brussels that they would fully implement reforms. This and his other proposals were duly rejected. Another election now looms, probably on June 17th. It may also end in stalemate. That would surely lead to the terms of the bail-out being breached, and make an exit from the euro much more likely. 
Until that day of reckoning a caretaker government will run the country. Lucas Papademos, the technocrat prime minister, will stand down in favour of a senior state lawyer or judge. Mr Papademos pushed through enough reforms during his six-month tenure for Greece to receive most of its next EUR 5.2 billion loan tranche this week, ensuring that salaries and pensions will be paid until June. He made virtually no progress, though, on restoring business confidence or attracting investors from abroad. The economy is in its fifth year of recession. 
Mr Tsipras, who organised sit-ins and protest marches at high school, still enjoys stirring up the political establishment. He has demanded that Greece formally abandon the ""barbarous"" bail-out programme; place its banks under state control; and set up an international committee to audit the public debt before declaring a moratorium on repayments. Mr Tsipras argues that Greece can reject the bail-out and also stay in the euro; pro-reform politicians call this ""naive"". Any such idea is rejected outright in Berlin. 
Left-of-centre Greeks voted for Syriza both to punish Pasok for impoverishing the country and because Syriza opposes reforms that would open up closed-shop professions in a bid to make Greece more competitive. Syriza's idealistic economic programme calls for providing students with free meals and doling out pensions equal to final salaries. Mr Tsipras says the state should hire 100,000 more workers to help reduce unemployment, now running at 21%. 
One more chance 
The June election will hinge on whether Mr Samaras and Mr Venizelos can persuade the 70% of Greeks who say that they want to stay in the euro that they have had their protest, and that it is time to get serious again: they must choose between centre and fringe, between euro and drachma. 
As well as trying to sharpen up his own campaign, Mr Samaras has to fend off disappointed conservatives who think he should be replaced--not least because he insisted on holding the poll when Mr Papademos seemed to be muddling through. Mr Samaras's predecessor, Costas Karamanlis, a former prime minister, might now try to replace him, though he is not an obvious choice to lead New Democracy into the next election. Small centre-right parties may also have a role. If Dora Bakoyannis, a former foreign minister and leader of Democratic Alliance, can be persuaded to hook up with Stefanos Manos, a former finance minister and boss of Drasi, a pro-business party, they might get enough votes for a dozen seats. 
Mr Venizelos has problems of his own. If Pasok loses more votes the second time around, he will be challenged for the party leadership by Andreas Loverdos, the health minister. This means he cannot reject Mr Tsipras as stridently as Mr Samaras does, because he needs to win back voters who have been wooed away by Syriza if he is to survive. Hence his conciliatory tone--while all the time stressing that Greece cannot afford to be outside the euro zone, where Mr Tsipras would lead it.","In the first of three pieces on Europe 's future , we look at Greece 's enraged howl of an election , which makes its eventual departure from the euro zone more likely 
 ALEXIS TSIPRAS , a left - wing upstart who first won a parliamentary seat less than three years ago , could be the man who takes Greece out of the euro . His Syriza ( Left Coalition ) party , which unites a handful of fractious radical groups , massively increased its vote in the general election on May 6th , mostly at the expense of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement ( Pasok ) . It has gone from the fringes of politics to being the second - largest party in the Greek parliament . 
 The centre - right New Democracy was the largest party ; Pasok , previously New Democracy 's coalition partner , came in third place with just 13.2 % of the vote , its worst election performance in over 30 years . Most important , parties which , like Syriza , are opposed to the austerity measures that Pasok and New Democracy had agreed to as the price of a EUR 130 billion ( $ 169 billion ) international bail - out earlier this year ended up with 70 % of the vote . This , the recent fall of a budget - cutting Dutch government and the election on May 6th of a Socialist president in France are seen by some in Greece and elsewhere as a widespread challenge to Europe 's politics of austerity . 
 In a fissiparous display of national desperation the Greek electorate gave no party much support . New Democracy 's 18.9 % won it 108 seats , thanks to a rule that gives the front - running party an extra 50 seats ; Syriza 's 16.8 % got it 52 seats , and Pasok got 41 seats . The other parties elected were the Communist Party ; Independent Greeks , a right - wing splinter group ; Democratic Left , a splinter from Syriza ; and the neo - fascist Golden Dawn ( see chart ) . 
 The collapse of Pasok 's vote deprived the pro - euro conservatives and Socialists of an overall majority in parliament , giving Mr Tsipras ( pictured ) a turn at playing kingmaker during this week 's round of coalition negotiations . After New Democracy decided it could not put together a coalition , Mr Tsipras had a go , coming up on May 8th with a list of demands that seemed tailor - made for rejection by the two "" mainstream "" parties . Cheekily , he asked Antonis Samaras and Evangelos Venizelos , the conservative and Socialist leaders , to sign a "" letter of repentance "" reneging on a written pledge to Brussels that they would fully implement reforms . This and his other proposals were duly rejected . Another election now looms , probably on June 17th . It may also end in stalemate . That would surely lead to the terms of the bail - out being breached , and make an exit from the euro much more likely . 
 Until that day of reckoning a caretaker government will run the country . Lucas Papademos will stand down in favour of a senior state lawyer or judge . Lucas Papademos pushed through enough reforms during Lucas Papademos's six - month tenure for Greece to receive most of its next EUR 5.2 billion loan tranche this week , ensuring that salaries and pensions will be paid until June . Lucas Papademos made virtually no progress , though , on restoring business confidence or attracting investors from abroad . The economy is in its fifth year of recession . 
 Mr Tsipras , who organised sit - ins and protest marches at high school , still enjoys stirring up the political establishment . He has demanded that Greece formally abandon the "" barbarous "" bail - out programme ; place its banks under state control ; and set up an international committee to audit the public debt before declaring a moratorium on repayments . Mr Tsipras argues that Greece can reject the bail - out and also stay in the euro ; pro - reform politicians call this "" naive "" . Any such idea is rejected outright in Berlin . 
 Left - of - centre Greeks voted for Syriza both to punish Pasok for impoverishing the country and because Syriza opposes reforms that would open up closed - shop professions in a bid to make Greece more competitive . Syriza 's idealistic economic programme calls for providing students with free meals and doling out pensions equal to final salaries . Mr Tsipras says the state should hire 100,000 more workers to help reduce unemployment , now running at 21 % . 
 One more chance 
 The June election will hinge on whether Mr Samaras and Mr Venizelos can persuade the 70 % of Greeks who say that they want to stay in the euro that they have had their protest , and that it is time to get serious again : they must choose between centre and fringe , between euro and drachma . 
 As well as trying to sharpen up his own campaign , Mr Samaras has to fend off disappointed conservatives who think he should be replaced -- not least because he insisted on holding the poll when Lucas Papademos seemed to be muddling through . Mr Samaras 's predecessor , Costas Karamanlis , a former prime minister , might now try to replace him , though he is not an obvious choice to lead New Democracy into the next election . Small centre - right parties may also have a role . If Dora Bakoyannis , a former foreign minister and leader of Democratic Alliance , can be persuaded to hook up with Stefanos Manos , a former finance minister and boss of Drasi , a pro - business party , they might get enough votes for a dozen seats . 
 Mr Venizelos has problems of his own . If Pasok loses more votes the second time around , he will be challenged for the party leadership by Andreas Loverdos , the health minister . This means he can not reject Mr Tsipras as stridently as Mr Samaras does , because he needs to win back voters who have been wooed away by Syriza if he is to survive .

PITY Karolos Papoulias, the 82-year-old president who has been trying to persuade Greece's fractious political leaders to form a national-unity government after the election on May 6th failed to produce a clear winner. Mr Papoulias, a soft-spoken former foreign minister, struggled for nine days, handing out and receiving several mandates and even making a three-day effort of his own before giving up. 
Success would have given Greece a breathing-space, if only a short one, to pursue urgent reforms, such as recapitalising its banks and getting on with privatisation. That might have helped it to rebuild its shattered credibility with both its European Union partners and financial markets. Instead, another election will be held, on June 17th. A caretaker government under Panagiotis Pikrammenos, Greece's most senior judge, will run the country in the interim. Lucas Papademos, a former European central banker who led a coalition government for six months, overseeing a EUR 206 billion sovereign-debt restructuring, was not asked to stay on. 
The transcripts of Mr Papoulias's final three meetings, made public at the request of Alexis Tsipras, a rising political star and leader of Syriza, a hard-left coalition, reveal a disturbing lack of vision. Rather than tackle such serious questions as how to keep Greece in the euro, prickly political leaders shrugged off warnings that a run on Greek banks was imminent and swapped insults instead. Reading the texts makes voters still more frustrated. ""They're all irresponsible, none of them is capable of ending this crisis,"" said Aristomenes Antonopoulos, a lawyer. ""How to vote now?"" 
Support among Greeks for staying in the euro is stronger than ever: up from 70% to 80% in the past three months, say opinion polls. Yet fears that prolonged political instability could trigger a Greek exit are also increasing. Greek savers withdrew as much as EUR 2 billion from local banks (almost 2% of total deposits) as hopes of forming a coalition were collapsing. And this figure does not include a surge of investment in ""safe haven"" German and British government bonds since the election. 
Greece has seen a steady erosion of bank deposits over the past two years, yet few bankers were prepared for such a rapid acceleration of withdrawals. Deposits actually increased in March and April, thanks to the smooth handling of Greece's partial default. By the middle of the week, cash was still being taken away, but in orderly fashion. There were no queues outside bank branches in central Athens or its suburbs. Customers ordered cash by telephone and picked it up 24 hours later. Some went straight into safe deposit boxes at the same bank; some was stashed under mattresses in case Greece readopts the drachma. ""People are taking preventive measures...if you own a pile of euros, you'll feel rich in a drachma environment,"" said one veteran Greek banker. 
For all their enthusiasm to keep the euro, Greeks are also fed up with the austerity that German leaders are imposing as the price of continued membership. Syriza feeds on this inconsistency, arguing that Greece can stay in the euro but reject the terms of its EU/IMF bail-out. According to an opinion poll on May 13th, Syriza would win 20.5% of the vote and come first in the June 17th election, just ahead of the pro-euro New Democracy (19.4%). Even though that would give Syriza the winner's bonus of 50 extra seats, it would still fall well short of an overall majority. The Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok), which also supports the bail-out, would come a distant third, with 11.8%. 
Mr Tsipras is reorganising his party and renewing his campaign neighbourhood by neighbourhood, concentrating on Athens and other cities where Syriza came first on May 6th. His rhetoric is sharper than ever, yet his dream of forming a left-wing coalition government is no nearer reality than at the previous election. Potential left-wing partners have been unco-operative ever since Mr Tsipras bounced into second place behind New Democracy. 
Antonis Samaras, New Democracy's leader, will pull out all the stops. If he cannot form a government this time, his career may be over. A new alliance with a small liberal party led by Dora Bakoyannis, whom he defeated for the party leadership in 2009, may give him an extra couple of points. But Evangelos Venizelos, the Pasok leader and a potential coalition partner, will struggle to stop more voters leaving for Syriza. Even if New Democracy again came first (and took those extra 50 seats) the two big parties would still struggle to form a government. The long-suffering President Papoulias is likely to be back in action again on June 18th.","The president gives up and calls a new election--but it may yet again fail to yield a conclusive result

GREECE has given birth to its first proper coalition government in modern times. The three-party deal, routine by north European standards, emerged smoothly after just 48 hours of negotiations. Antonis Samaras, the centre-right New Democracy leader, was sworn in as prime minister pledging to ""give stability and hope"" to Greeks enduring the deepest recession in the country's modern history. It is a pledge he cannot fulfil without lots of help from the rest of Europe. 
That Greece has a government at all is due to New Democracy's better-than-expected performance in the June 17th election. It won 29.7% of the vote to 26.9% for Syriza, the radical left coalition led by 37-year-old Alexis Tsipras, a brash new political star whose claim that Greece could renegotiate its latest EUR 130 billion ($164 billion) bail-out yet stay in the euro appealed to many voters. The PanHellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) finished a distant third with 12.3%. 
With 129 seats, New Democracy is much the biggest party in the 300-member parliament (thanks to an electoral law that gives the front-runner an extra 50 seats). By teaming up with Pasok's 33 members and another 17 from Democratic Left, it will have a comfortable majority of 179 seats. Syriza has 71 seats in an otherwise fragmented house. Independent Greeks, the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn and the Greek communist party each have a handful of deputies. 
Many held their noses as they voted for New Democracy. Mr Samaras is a political veteran with a reputation for nationalism and poor judgment. He is widely blamed for insisting on a first, inconclusive election in May, rather than allowing Lucas Papademos, a technocratic prime minister, to govern for longer. But fear that Greece might be flung out of the euro caused voters to rally to New Democracy, including many who normally support other parties. 
To his credit, Mr Samaras was set to make two bold decisions ahead of a euro group meeting of finance ministers on June 21st. Vassilios Rapanos, a banker and public-finance specialist, will be finance minister. And Yannis Stournaras, the caretaker development minister, will stay on. Both men are technocrats with socialist connections; they were part of an efficient team that took Greece into the euro in 2002, an optimistic time marked by economic liberalisation and growth rates of more than 4% a year. Their appointment also signals a willingness to weaken Greece's clientilist political system. 
The make-up of the rest of the cabinet is unclear. So tough were the discussions between Mr Samaras's team and that of Evangelos Venizelos, the Pasok leader, that the first cabinet meeting was postponed. Fotis Kouvelis, boss of the Democratic Left, the junior coalition partner, said he would support New Democracy; his central committee has decided against seeking any cabinet posts. 
Once his government is in place, Mr Samaras must parley with Greece's paymasters in Brussels and Berlin. He will seek approval for a few tweaks such as a two-year delay until 2016 of EUR 11.7 billion of spending cuts and the sacking of 150,000 public-sector workers demanded by international lenders. Mr Samaras also wants to increase social spending to ease the pain of a deeper-than-expected recession. GDP is set to shrink this year by up to 7%, against earlier forecasts of 4.5%. 
But his room for manoeuvre is limited. Without its next slice of bail-out money, the new government would be unable to pay pensions and public-sector salaries at the end of July. And the Greek economy is desperate for a bit of stability. More than EUR 10 billion has been taken out of Greek banks since the May election; even profitable companies are denied loans because of a credit squeeze; and three international export-insurance agencies are refusing to provide cover for products sold to Greece. 
The coalition wants to govern for exactly 24 months, until the European Parliament elections in mid-2014. It might manage that. Mr Venizelos, a former finance minister who clashed with Greece's creditors, is reinventing himself as a pro-European statesman. He needs time to rebuild his party after two disastrous performances at the polls. Mr Kouvelis, the first leftist to play a big role in government, has little reason to shake things up. Another election might bring Mr Tsipras to power; Syriza might even gain the 35% of the vote needed for a parliamentary majority. That prospect should be enough to ensure the loyalty of Mr Samaras's partners. 
Mr Samaras's belief that two years will give him enough time to turn the economy around is more questionable. Funds to promote growth are already available: as much as EUR 14 billion from European Union structural funds for infrastructure and other big modernisation projects, and perhaps EUR 2 billion-3 billion from the European Investment Bank. The previous Pasok government could get only a trickle of funding from Brussels thanks to the inefficiency of its bureaucrats. Mr Rapanos and Mr Stournaras should do better, say their conservative backers. 
But the question hanging over Greece is not whether the government can unlock more official funding, but whether it can entice private capital. The big fear for foreign investors is a euro break-up, not just in Greece but elsewhere. Mr Samaras can hasten that outcome, but he cannot prevent it. Until a lasting solution is found to the euro crisis, Greece will be in limbo.","At last there is a Greek government, but it faces immense problems

Voters are now facing a harsh truth 
ALMOST half the world's population now lives in a democracy, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit, a sister organisation of this newspaper. And the number of democracies has increased pretty steadily since the second world war. But it is easy to forget that most nations have not been democratic for much of their history and that, for a long time, democracy was a dirty word among political philosophers. 
One reason was the fear that democratic rule would lead to ruin. Plato warned that democratic leaders would ""rob the rich, keep as much of the proceeds as they can for themselves and distribute the rest to the people"". James Madison, one of America's founding fathers, feared that democracy would lead to ""a rage for paper money, for an abolition of debts, for an equal division of property and for any other improper or wicked projects"". Similarly John Adams, the country's second president, worried that rule by the masses would lead to heavy taxes on the rich in the name of equality. As a consequence, ""the idle, the vicious, the intemperate would rush into the utmost extravagance of debauchery, sell and spend all their share, and then demand a new division of those who purchased from them."" 
Democracy may have its faults but alternative systems have proved no more fiscally prudent. Dictatorships may still feel the need to bribe their citizens (eg, via subsidised fuel prices) to ensure their acquiescence while simultaneously spending large amounts on the police and the military to shore up their power. The absolute monarchies of Spain and France suffered fiscal crises in the 17th and 18th centuries, and were challenged by Britain and the Netherlands which, though not yet democracies, had dispersed power more widely. Financial problems contributed to the collapse of the Soviet Union. 
Nevertheless, with much of the democratic world now in the throes of a debt crisis, it is tempting to ask whether the fears of Madison and Adams have come to pass. Given the rise in inequality in America and Britain over the past 30 years, it is hard to argue that democracies have led to the confiscation of private wealth. Quite the reverse: modern American politicians either need to be wealthy, or need the financial backing of the rich. 
But there is a broader problem. Modern governments play a much larger role in the economy than the ancient Greeks or the founding fathers could have imagined. This makes political leaders a huge source of patronage, in the form of business contracts, social benefits, jobs and tax breaks. As the late political scientist, Mancur Olson, pointed out, these goodies are highly valuable to the recipients but the cost to the average voter of any single perk will be small. So beneficiaries will have every incentive to lobby for the retention of their perks and taxpayers will have little reason to campaign against them. Over time the economy will be weighed down by all these costs, like a barnacle-encrusted ship. The Greek economy could be seen as a textbook example of these problems. 
One answer could be to take fiscal policy out of the hands of elected leaders, just as responsibility for monetary policy has been handed to independent central bankers. To some extent, that has been happening. Greece was briefly run by Lucas Papademos, an unelected former central banker, and Italy is still ruled by Mario Monti, a former EU commissioner. These technocrats are, it is assumed, more willing to take unpopular decisions. 
Another approach, with which America has occasionally flirted, is to pass decisions to a bipartisan commission. (This may be the best answer to the ""fiscal cliff"" that looms in 2013.) Since the decisions of such a commission, and indeed of technocrats in Greece and Italy, are still subject to a parliamentary vote, democracy is not completely abandoned. 
For a long time, there did not seem to be any limit to the amount democracies could borrow. Creditors have been more patient with democratic governments than with other regimes, probably because the risk of abrupt changes of policy (like the repudiation of Tsarist debts by Russia in 1917) are reduced. But this has postponed the crunch point, rather than eliminated it--and allowed stable democracies to accumulate higher debt, relative to their GDP, than many, more volatile countries ever achieved. Governments can, as Madison suggested, confiscate the wealth of domestic creditors via inflation, taxes or default. But however often they vote, democracies cannot make foreign lenders extend credit. That harsh truth is now being discovered.","Economist.com/blogs/buttonwood

Quite the reverse: modern American politicians either need to be wealthy, or need the financial backing of the rich. 
But there is a broader problem. Modern governments play a much larger role in the economy than the ancient Greeks or the founding fathers could have imagined. This makes political leaders a huge source of patronage, in the form of business contracts, social benefits, jobs and tax breaks. As the late political scientist, Mancur Olson, pointed out, these goodies are highly valuable to the recipients but the cost to the average voter of any single perk will be small. So beneficiaries will have every incentive to lobby for the retention of their perks and taxpayers will have little reason to campaign against them. Over time the economy will be weighed down by all these costs, like a barnacle-encrusted ship. The Greek economy could be seen as a textbook example of these problems. 
One answer could be to take fiscal policy out of the hands of elected leaders, just as responsibility for monetary policy has been handed to independent central bankers. To some extent, that has been happening. Greece was briefly run by Lucas Papademos, an unelected former central banker, and Italy is still ruled by Mario Monti, a former EU commissioner. These technocrats are, it is assumed, more willing to take unpopular decisions. 
Another approach, with which America has occasionally flirted, is to pass decisions to a bipartisan commission. (This may be the best answer to the ""fiscal cliff"" that looms in 2013.) Since the decisions of such a commission, and indeed of technocrats in Greece and Italy, are still subject to a parliamentary vote, democracy is not completely abandoned. 
For a long time, there did not seem to be any limit to the amount democracies could borrow. Creditors have been more patient with democratic governments than with other regimes, probably because the risk of abrupt changes of policy (like the repudiation of Tsarist debts by Russia in 1917) are reduced. But this has postponed the crunch point, rather than eliminated it--and allowed stable democracies to accumulate higher debt, relative to their GDP, than many, more volatile countries ever achieved. Governments can, as Madison suggested, confiscate the wealth of domestic creditors via inflation, taxes or default. But however often they vote, democracies cannot make foreign lenders extend credit. That harsh truth is now being discovered.",350,Greece,A30-95,,False,,0,True

EUROPE'S charge-sheet against Antonis Samaras has lengthened with each turn of the Greek crisis. As leader of the-then opposition New Democracy, his refusal to support the first bail-out was seen as crippling. Later on, when he backed the unity government of Lucas Papademos, Mr Samaras was evasive about the second rescue. And by forcing early elections this year, he was blamed for opening the door to extremists of all stripes. Would it not be better, some thought, if Greece just left the euro? 
These days, as prime minister, Mr Samaras has started to command a measure of respect. After a meeting of euro-zone finance ministers this week, their president, Jean-Claude Juncker, went out of his way to praise the Greek leader: ""I am impressed...The Greek government is behaving, I do think, in an admirable way."" The visit to Athens this week by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, is the clearest signal yet that ""Grexit"" is no longer on her mind. One reason for embracing Mr Samaras is that he is the lesser evil, given the alternative of Alexis Tsipras, the radical leftist. Another is that keeping Greece in the euro is less awful than the chaos of Grexit. A third factor is that Mr Samaras seems to embrace Europe's terms for assistance. 
Eurocrats detect a seriousness of purpose about him, not least in appointing a respected economist, Yannis Stournaras, as finance minister. Then there is the factor that nobody will admit to: the policy of demanding harsh, front-loaded austerity has done unnecessary harm. Greece's recession this year will, yet again, be much deeper than forecast in April, and so will next year's, according to the IMF's latest figures. The euro zone would never stoop to the mea culpa offered by the IMF in its latest World Economic Outlook, which admits to underestimating badly the effect of austerity in reducing economic output. The euro zone can, after all, always blame the indolence of earlier Greek governments. Still, when confronted with deeper-than-expected recessions, Spain and Portugal won an extra year to meet their target of bringing budget deficits below 3% of GDP. 
Backed by the IMF's boss, Christine Lagarde, Greece may well be granted the extra two years it wants to meet its objective of achieving a large primary budget balance (ie, before interest payments) in 2014. A deal is likely to be reached in November. But first Greece must overcome the political deficit among euro-zone states: they may no longer want to push Greece out, but neither do they want to lend it more billions to keep it in. 
The conundrum breaks down into three parts. First, Greece must find EUR 13.5 billion ($17.4 billion) worth of savings and taxes in 2013 and 2014 to fill a gap made worse by the paralysis of two general elections this spring. Though it claims such budget-cutting is too much, too soon, Greece seems close to agreement with the troika (the IMF, the European Commission and the European Central Bank). Second, granting Greece a two-year reprieve means finding another EUR 10 billion to EUR 20 billion. Greece contends, implausibly, that it requires no additional loans from the euro zone, yet at the very least it needs the benevolence of the ECB. The bank would have to let Greece issue more short-term bills (most will end up on the ECB's balance-sheet via Greek banks) and agree to roll over a big chunk of Greek debt it holds. The ECB says a rollover would amount to illegal monetary financing. The third, and most serious problem is that the economic outlook for Greece is so poor that it will probably miss by a long shot the target of bringing debt down to 120% of GDP by 2020--the level set to justify a big haircut on private bondholders this year, and at which the economy is deemed able to survive without outside help. 
Greece thinks confidence would make its economy rebound. So the IMF, though sceptical of the degree of austerity demanded by the lords of the euro zone, now finds itself cast as the pitiless enforcer because of its reluctance to make the numbers fit the euro zone's limits. It has quietly pushed the euro zone to write off some of Greece's debt. Unless America can convince the IMF to go soft by accepting a rosier forecast, the Europeans may have to lend Greece more money (difficult), forgive some of its debt (almost impossible), or both. As always, they will try to fudge, at least until Germany's general election. One idea is to bring forward loan disbursements to keep Greece going, with the promise to look at any shortfall later on. Another is to declare Greece's long-term outlook too uncertain even for economists to predict; the euro zone could then pledge to deal with Greece's long-term debt if growth disappoints. And if the IMF refuses to keep lending to Greece, the euro zone could take on the burden on its own, ignoring the IMF, as it once did for Latvia. 
It all began in Athens 
Fate decreed that the euro-zone crisis should start in Greece. Lies about its public finances instilled the belief, particularly in Germany, that the euro's problem was excessive debt, and the solution was tough spending cuts. Yet the woes of Spain show that even running a budget surplus is no insurance against economic meltdown. As well as worrying about excessive austerity, the IMF's report raises concern about ""policy uncertainty""--including fears about the break-up of the euro--which makes a recession deeper and recovery slower. The IMF sets out a sensible to-do list, such as creating a banking union that includes a single euro-zone supervisor. These issues will be the focus of a European summit on October 18th-19th. 
Greece may be right in thinking that the biggest boost to its economy would be to end the ""drachma drama"". But restoring confidence must also involve creditor countries, above all Germany. The euro's problem is not just dysfunctional states, like Greece, but also a dysfunctional currency zone.","But the euro zone is still struggling to find a way of keeping Greece afloat

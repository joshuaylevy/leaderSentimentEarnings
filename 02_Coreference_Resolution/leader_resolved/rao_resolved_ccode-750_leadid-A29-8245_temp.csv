Such was the outcome of the ""long march"" begun on February 11th by Amanullah Khan and the supporters of his Jammu & Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF). The aim was to go from Pakistani-controlled Azad (""Free"") Kashmir across the 1949 ceasefire line into the Indian state of Jammu & Kashmir. By the following day the aim had failed. As Pakistan's prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, said: ""We cannot let Amanullah Khan lead innocent people before the Indian firing squads."" So Pakistan's own soldiers thwarted the marchers, with road blocks, tear gas and bullets, before they could reach the Indians' land mines.
Cynics will not be surprised. They argue that this is the subcontinent's usual season for synthetic discontent. They may be right. Given the internal strife, economic and political, in both countries, the alleged threat from India is a glue that binds Pakistan together--and Pakistan's supposed threat does the same for India.
Even so, it would be unfair to accuse Mr Sharif and his Indian counterpart, Narasimha Rao, of stage-managing Kashmir's drama: too much seems to have gone out of their control. It began when Pakistan's high commissioner to Delhi, Abdus Sattar, told India's Pioneer newspaper on February 2nd that Pakistan had ""the right to uphold the struggle of the people of Kashmir for self-determination through all legal means--political, moral and diplomatic."" India, he charged, was engaged ""in an illegal and immoral repression in the state of Kashmir...Pakistan stands for self-determination for the people of Kashmir"" under the UN Resolutions of 1948. Since Mr Sharif and Mr Rao had recently been talking of the need to resolve problems through dialogue, the Indian foreign office called Mr Sattar in and roundly ticked him off.
However, on February 4th Mr Sharif announced that Pakistan would the next day observe a general strike in solidarity with the Kashmiris, just as it had in the two years since the Kashmiri revolt erupted in Srinagar at the end of 1989. The Indians reacted sharply and accused Pakistan of meddling in India's ""internal affairs"".
That is when Mr Amanullah Khan, a little-known leader of the JKLF based in Pakistan, said he would defy the Indians and lead unarmed thousands of Kashmiris from Muzaffarabad, the capital of Azad Kashmir, right through the border town of Chokhoti on February 11th. This was the anniversary of the execution by India in 1984 of Maqbool Butt, the founder of the JKLF. Mindful of a similar incident in 1990, when a few hundred unarmed Kashmiris from the Pakistan side tried to march across the border, leading to the shooting of six of them by the Indian army, India promptly reinforced its border forces.
It was at this point that India did the unexpected. On February 6th J.N. Dixit, a senior official of the foreign ministry in Delhi, summoned the ambassadors of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council and sought their good offices to prevent the threatened march. Since India, relying on the Simla agreement of 1972, has always said the Kashmir issue should be settled bilaterally with Pakistan, this was quite a departure. Pakistan must have been delighted, but contented itself with the self-satisfied comment that India had ""internationalised the issue unnecessarily.""
The real winner is Mr Amanullah Khan. Not only is the Kashmir issue internationalised, but he has demonstrated that the JKLF enjoys great popular support. Pakistan has always preferred Kashmiri groups, such as the fundamentalist-minded Hizb ul Mujahideen, which favour (at least in public) Kashmir's accession to Pakistan. It will now have to recognise that more and more Kashmiris favour the JKLF'S belief in an independent Kashmir.","A few Kashmiri militants killed ; scores arrested ; thousands left to survive another freezing night in the mountains .

On February 29th, in his second budget in eight months, Manmohan Singh, the finance minister in the Congress Party government, made the rupee partly convertible; abolished non-tariff curbs on most imports; cut import duties; legalised gold imports; encouraged foreign participation in oil and gas; and allowed foreign pension funds to invest in Indian shares. Nehru would have had a fit.
But will the world welcome India? The answer depends on India's willingness to stay on the liberalising path it took after last June's elections. Hence the importance of Mr Singh's budget. There may be quibbles that the ceiling on import duties, lowered from 150%, is still a daunting 110% (except for rates of 60% and 30% on some machinery), but Mr Singh's bravery is undeniable.
Take, for example, income tax, which Indian businessmen tend to evade with bribes and false accounts. Mr Singh, while abolishing many exemptions, is slashing the maximum rate from 50% to 40% and setting lower bands of 30% and 20%; he has also ended wealth tax on shares. Since matching cuts in company tax can be expected once an expert committee has submitted its recommendations, India could soon have tax rates to compete with neighbours which in economic terms have long outstripped it.
So far so good in theory. The reality is that lower tariffs will mean losing perhaps a tenth of customs revenues hitherto deemed essential. To recoup part of the loss, Mr Singh is raising duties on domestic output. More bravely, given India's tradition of socialism, he is cutting spending.
Under his agreement last year with the IMF, Mr Singh had already cut the budget deficit from 8.4% of GOP in the past fiscal year to 6.5% in the present one; now he is to cut it to 5% for 1992-93. This means a sharp drop in capital spending. It also means ending state monopolies and giving private business, including foreign companies, greater scope.
The difficulty is that under its reformist helmsman the economy is sailing into choppy waters. The liberal measures of Mr Singh's first budget have brought stagflation. Mr Singh had promised industrial growth of around 4% with inflation limited to 9%. Instead, manufacturing has shrunk and inflation is running at 12-16%, depending on which index you believe. Having gone virtually bust, India needs dynamic exports to reduce its dependence on foreign debt, but exports have fallen this year thanks largely to the collapse of the Soviet Union. Opponents of reform who had argued that an IMF-dictated adjustment programme would bring pain without gain gleefully claim vindication.
Mr Singh faces such critics within his own party. A leak to the press about the conditions attached to a structural-adjustment loan from the World Bank has raised a furore in Parliament. The opposition says India's sovereignty has been eroded because the budget was determined by the World Bank and the IMF.
In which case, Mr Singh is cast as a traitor, selling the country to foreign bankers. Happily, he continues to have the confidence of the prime minister, Narasimha Rao, and will probably ride out the storm provided he curbs inflation in the coming year. To do that he will have to be much sterner in budgetary discipline next year (the pledge to the IMF was met only by creative accounting). He therefore needs a recovery of the world economy to boost exports--and this is not yet in sight.
Meanwhile, the pace of reforms has been breathtaking. The Rao government has slashed red tape, liberalised trade, made exports attractive through devaluation, wooed foreign investment, loosened interest rates and encouraged private business to replace the public sector as the dynamo of the economy. It has built up its foreign-exchange reserves from almost nothing to more than $4 billion, mostly through amnesties to Indians with illegal hoards abroad. The rupee is to be fully convertible in three to five years.
But the government has yet to grasp two nasty nettles--the need to shed surplus labour and close sick industries, and the need to restructure the inefficient public sector. India's trade unions believe that jobs should be forever, that automation is a wicked device to cut employment, and that wage demands should be related to class war rather than productivity. Public employees have threatened to strike if there is privatisation. All political parties, including Mr Rao's Congress, have a strong trade-union wing.
Mr Rao has operated so far by consensus, which allows no open confrontation with trade unions. With the help of the World Bank, a fund is being created to give a golden handshake to surplus workers, but the unions recently refused even to look at a government proposal to give several years' pay as redundancy compensation.
Such obstinacy does not bode well for Messrs Rao and Singh. Nor does the weather. After four good monsoons in a row a drought might seem overdue, with its attendant inflation and unrest. If they come, the opposition parties, which have not wanted a fresh election so soon after the last one, may decide it is time to try to topple the government. They may not succeed, even though Congress and its allies are seven votes short of a majority in Parliament. But the uncertainty is one reason why commercial banks still do not regard India as creditworthy. They reckon that, though the Indian economy is eminently rescuable, its polity may not be.","After decades of shunning foreign trade and investment , India is welcoming the world .

They fear that P.V. Narasimha Rao's minority Congress government will not be able to push through his programme. They need to think again now that Mr Rao has won a decisive victory in a parliamentary motion on his economic reforms.
The main opposition groups waited until after the government's budget on February 29th to launch their first full-scale assault on Mr Rao. They failed badly--by 38 votes. (The majority was first announced as 52, but the ancient machine used for counting turned out to be faulty). After the vote, on March 9th, the opposition leader, L.K. Advani, of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), declared that Mr Rao's minority government clearly had a working majority. This is good news for foreign creditors and investors as well as for Indians. Political stability is essential for economic reform.
The BJP refused to support left-wing motions claiming that India had lost sovereignty by accepting humiliating conditions attached to loans from the World Bank and IMF. The BJP supports deregulation and a bigger role for private industry. It opposes the wooing of multinationals, preferring to take the route followed by Japan and South Korea. But there is enough common ground between the ruling and chief opposition parties to make the general thrust of reforms look irreversible.
Mr Rao is one to seven votes short of an absolute majority, depending on which small parties are regarded as reliable allies. The fact that he won so well on March 9th highlights the disarray among some of his opponents. For example, the Telegu Desam, a regional party of Andhra Pradesh, is supposedly a partner of the opposition's Janata Dal. But since Mr Rao himself comes from Andhra Pradesh, this party has never been keen on opposing him.
Mr Rao has kept various cabinet posts vacant as bait for defectors, among them the industry portfolio, and he may soon get a nibble or two. He does not feel comfortable depending on several tiny groups that want special favours and could abandon him at crucial moments. His big advantage at present is that nobody wants a general election so soon after last year's June election, but this asset will diminish with time. He has declared that he will continue with his consensual approach to politics, consulting the BJP and others, even if he garners an absolute majority through defections. This is in striking contrast to the abrasive style of the Gandhi family who ran the party until last year, and goes down well.
A notable side-effect of the parliamentary vote is that dissension within Congress has been quelled. Many in the ruling party are disturbed by the new turn of policy, with its pain of IMF-decreed austerity. They are unimpressed by Mr Rao's claims that he is implementing Nehru-type socialism by other means. Some had wanted to sacrifice the finance minister, Manmohan Singh.

It has 860m people who, though poor, save more than 20% of GDP, and some financial institutions that are probably the most sophisticated in the third world. What it did not have, until now, was an efficient way of channelling into productive uses the resources it was so good at raising. The economic reforms begun last July by the government of Narasimha Rao will, if carried through, change that. Financial services could well be India's fastest-growing business this decade.

Finance is already extremely profitable for the half-dozen foreign banks that have been in the country for a long time. These banks--which include Standard Chartered, Citibank, ANZ Grindlays and BankAmerica--together made pre-tax profits approaching 10 billion rupees ($400m) in India last year. Bhupen Dalal, who heads a well-established Bombay finance house called CIFCO, claims that more than 3% of BankAmerica's worldwide profits last year came from India (the bank itself will not confirm it).

The foreigners do well for a simple reason: they are not subject to the full range of lunatic restrictions that the Indian government and trade unions impose on Indian banks. Most Indian banks were nationalised in two waves, in 1969 and 1979-80. Until early this year they had to hold 38.5% of their net liabilities in government securities at artificially low yields; the 30% that they now must hold is still a heavy burden.

Indian banks have also been required to extend 40% of their loans, at controlled interest rates, to borrowers such as farmers and small businessmen whom the government considers worthy (as distinct from creditworthy). Gross overmanning is guaranteed by unions so militant that they refuse to let in new technology even when no jobs will be lost by doing so. It is hardly surprising that bank profits fell consistently in the two decades after 1969, ending in 1990 at 1% of capital employed.

Yet would-be private Indian bankers are keen to get into the business, and small wonder. Spreads between deposit and corporate lending rates are 8-12 percentage points. A huge amount of cash is emerging into the daylight as tax and regulatory changes reduce incentives to keep savings in the black market or idly tied up in gold. Most of it has been pouring into India's hyperactive bourses, but finance men see great opportunities in developing other instruments for savers, like mutual funds.

The trick for private finance houses is to find a way into banking. Last November a reform commission recommended that banking rules be relaxed, which would have included letting new private banks open their doors. The government has been too timid to adopt these reforms outright. Its vague policy, however, seems to be to let private finance houses grow to the point where they begin elbowing state banks aside in practice, if not formally.

One of the most enthusiastic elbowers is a young Bombay company called Kotak Mahindra Finance. Founded in 1985 by Uday Kotak, then 25, the firm began by discounting bills for merchants, one of the few financial activities that the state did not control or regulate. Kotak Mahindra's profits have doubled every year since its first, a progression that Mr Kotak expects to continue for at least the next couple of years; in the 1991-92 financial year gross profits were around $125m, after-tax profits nearly $80m. The firm is now the biggest bill discounter in India, and (after Citibank) the second-biggest car-finance company.

The company's return on shareholders' equity in 1991-92 was around 150%, a figure that will probably fall to a mere 100% this year. India's stockmarket is badly overheated, but the success of Kotak Mahindra's first public offering, of partly convertible debentures, was still remarkable. The price of the convertible part of each debenture was set in January, by government fiat, at 45 rupees; the first market trades, in early April, were at 1,250 rupees.

Mr Kotak is trying his hand at everything for now, because in a market starved of financial services almost all are profitable. In addition to bill discounting and consumer and lease financing, Kotak Mahindra does stockbroking, merchant banking and money management. It plans to set up a mutual fund (a line of business that has only just been opened to non-state companies); and, with the rupee now partly convertible, has its eye on foreign-exchange broking.

What will probably make or break Kotak Mahindra (and many another Indian finance house) is, however, its success at getting into commercial banking. Mr Kotak decided to do this indirectly, by acquiring a blocking stake in the private Bank of Madura (and four seats on its 11-man board). Around two dozen Indian banks escaped nationalisation because their profits were below the statutory threshold. It is still impossible for them to be taken over openly, but Mr Kotak's carefully structured acquisition of Madura in early April gives him what amounts to control.

The bank's 200 branches should offer a good platform for growth. The risk is that Madura's old habits, technology and excessive staff will make it a diving board instead of a launch pad. Mr Kotak reasons that no private banks will be allowed to start from scratch for years yet, and that it is better to begin now by refashioning an imperfect bank than to wait to build a perfect one.

Others disagree. Mr Dalal of CIFCO, for one, thinks that any existing bank has too many drawbacks to be worth acquiring; he is waiting until he can start his own. But there will be no shortage of competitors. Two ambitious state-owned finance companies want to get into banking, along with a few of India's biggest industrial companies and lots of upstarts like Mr Kotak. India is deregulating so quickly that even new foreigners cannot be counted out. There go the margins.","Improbable thought it sounds , India could be the setting for one of the biggest financial booms of the 1990s .

Founded in 1985 by Uday Kotak , then 25 , the firm began by discounting bills for merchants , one of the few financial activities that the state did not control or regulate . Kotak Mahindra 's profits have doubled every year since its first , a progression that Mr Kotak expects to continue for at least the next couple of years ; in the 1991 - 92 financial year gross profits were around $ 125 m , after - tax profits nearly $ 80 m. The firm is now the biggest bill discounter in India , and ( after Citibank ) the second - biggest car - finance company . 

 The company 's return on shareholders ' equity in 1991 - 92 was around 150 % , a figure that will probably fall to a mere 100 % this year . India 's stockmarket is badly overheated , but the success of Kotak Mahindra 's first public offering , of partly convertible debentures , was still remarkable . The price of the convertible part of each debenture was set in January , by government fiat , at 45 rupees ; the first market trades , in early April , were at 1,250 rupees . 

 Mr Kotak is trying his hand at everything for now , because in a market starved of financial services almost all are profitable . In addition to bill discounting and consumer and lease financing , Kotak Mahindra does stockbroking , merchant banking and money management . It plans to set up a mutual fund ( a line of business that has only just been opened to non - state companies ) ; and , with the rupee now partly convertible , has its eye on foreign - exchange broking . 

 What will probably make or break Kotak Mahindra ( and many another Indian finance house ) is , however , its success at getting into commercial banking . Mr Kotak decided to do this indirectly , by acquiring a blocking stake in the private Bank of Madura ( and four seats on its 11 - man board ) . Around two dozen Indian banks escaped nationalisation because their profits were below the statutory threshold . It is still impossible for them to be taken over openly , but Mr Kotak 's carefully structured acquisition of Madura in early April gives him what amounts to control . 

 The bank 's 200 branches should offer a good platform for growth . The risk is that Madura 's old habits , technology and excessive staff will make it a diving board instead of a launch pad . Mr Kotak reasons that no private banks will be allowed to start from scratch for years yet , and that it is better to begin now by refashioning an imperfect bank than to wait to build a perfect one . 

 Others disagree . Mr Dalal of CIFCO , for one , thinks that any existing bank has too many drawbacks to be worth acquiring ; he is waiting until he can start his own . But there will be no shortage of competitors . Two ambitious state - owned finance companies want to get into banking , along with a few of India 's biggest industrial companies and lots of upstarts like Mr Kotak . India is deregulating so quickly that even new foreigners can not be counted out . There go the margins .",750,India,A29-8245,IN TERM,True,the government of Narasimha Rao,5,True
1992-05-23,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224144289/fulltext/CAA2A8CE54E54E4BPQ/7?accountid=14657,"""What does South Korea have that India doesn't?"" The thinking behind the remark of Manmohan Singh, India's finance minister, is plain, though neither Mr. Singh nor any of his reformist colleagues in the government of P.V. Narasimha Rao will admit it. Their ambition is to raise India's economic performance not merely from dismal to respectable, but all the way to spectacular. At Korean rates of real GDP growth (9% a year), real incomes double in eight years and go up 13 times in 30 years. The difference is that, in India, the beneficiaries at the end of the day would number not 45m, as in South Korea now, but some 1-1/4 billion in 2020, nearly one-sixth of mankind. It can be done.
In less than a year India's prospects have been transformed. Last June the country was quivering from religious and caste violence and from Rajiv Gandhi's assassination at an election rally the month before. Economically, things were just as bad. The government's budget deficit stood at 9% of GDP. Economic growth had halted. Inflation, usually quite low, was in double figures. Foreign-exchange reserves had fallen to where they would cover only a few weeks' normal imports.
Little was expected of the 71-year-old Mr Rao when he took office. After the Congress party won the most seats (though not an overall majority) in the June election, it selected him as leader because he seemed both a Gandhi loyalist and an inoffensive time-server; a party hack who--with the added advantage of having had heart-bypass surgery--would be the perfect stop-gap for his ambitious colleagues.
Mr Rao surprised everyone by giving the economic portfolios to reformers. Finance went to Mr Singh, an economist who had been an ardent central planner in the 1970s but had since converted to the free-market cause. Commerce, which includes foreign trade, was given to P. Chidambaram, a young dynamo with a degree from Harvard Business School. Mr Rao then gave unqualified political backing to Mr Singh when the finance minister launched two waves of radical economic reforms.
India had the misfortune to achieve independence, in 1947, at a time when state intervention was seen by much of the world as the way both to economic justice and to economic growth. India needed both. Under Jawaharlal Nehru's guidance, it lumbered into this fashionable mire, got precious little of either, but has stayed bogged down there ever since. Mr Singh's reforms, which came first in a mini-budget last July, then in a full budget on February 29th, were the first real attempt to escape.
The reforms have given rise to hopes so high as to border dangerously on euphoria. The economy is, in fact, still in the dumps. Inflation is stuck at 12%, industrial output has fallen over the past year, unemployment is up. But the air of change is unmistakable. The slogans of religious hatred daubed on walls since last June have given way to ones chirping, ""Freed from fetters, forward we go."" Signs for Pepsi, a company kept out of India for years, are everywhere, offering ""the choice for a new generation.""
A more tangible sign of faith could be found in the Bombay stockmarket, which doubled last year, then madly redoubled in the first three months of 1992, though it has slumped sharply, amid cries of scandal, since then. A more solid sign is the state of the foreign-exchange reserves, which now are brimming. Toward the end of April, they had reached $6.5 billion. True, the IMF chipped in $2 billion or so last year. But most of the rest is from overseas Indians. They were the first to drain foreign exchange out of the country in the bad days of 1990-91. In the weeks after the February budget, an average of $50m of private money was pouring back each day.
There is a lot more where that came from. One investment banker in Bombay guesses that between $70 billion and $80 billion in flight capital is available for repatriation, if the reforms take root. For now, the government's problem is to keep the capital inflow from pushing the rupee up and ruining the export-boosting effect of recent devaluations.
OPENING UP
Last year's balance-of-payments crisis reflected a much worse chronic complaint. For nearly 40 years, India had one of the most inward-looking and heavily regulated economies in the world. Overseas trade was trivial. Inward investment was discouraged: in the late 1980s less than $100m a year in direct foreign investment was coming in, less than 2% of what was going at the time into China.
Much of industry was state-owned, inefficient and loss-making. The private sector did not perform much better, thanks to a comprehensive system if industrial licensing, which required a bureaucrat's permission before a factory could be set up or closed, and even before its capacity could be increased or shifted to other uses. Over the years 1950-80 India had one of the worst records of economic growth in Asia.
Already much has changed for the better. On the external side, the rupee has been devalued by about 30% since last May. Last July Mr Singh was talking about rupee convertibility in three to five years. In February he made the rupee partly convertible (60% of any exchange deal is at a market rate, 40% at a government-fixed rate). The guessing is that, provided India has a good harvest, the currency will be fully convertible before 1992 is out.
The government has been less bold with foreign trade. The quantitative import controls that used to keep almost everything out, unless a bureaucrat (often enough a bribed one) would let it in, have been done away with--except for consumer goods. Import tariffs have been lowered, but still have far to go: the top tariff rate has come down from 150% to 110%, the top rate for capital goods from 80% to 60%.
Foreign investors are no longer treated as evil exploiters. They can now own up to 51% of most local companies (in some cases more), use their brand names, buy property, open branch offices and accept deposits. They cannot yet invest directly in stockmarkets, but the government has promised that ""reputable"" foreigners such as pension funds will soon be allowed to do so.
Internally, the industrial-licensing system has been abolished, except for 18 industries, including (absurdly) cars, drugs and sugar. Only eight lines of business--compared with dozens before--are now reserved exclusively for government-owned companies. Steel prices have been decontrolled (though not steel distribution).
The official controller of capital issues, who had the magisterial power to tell issuers of securities what price their paper could be sold at, has been put out of business. Indian companies can, for the first time, issue paper on the Euromarkets, and four are about to do so. Privately owned mutual funds (though not foreign ones) can now be set up. The government is in principle willing to sell 49% of its shares in state-owned companies.
In sum, not a bonfire of controls, but still a healthy blaze. Belated maybe, but given India's political condition and its record since 1947, Messrs Rao and Singh deserve a place in history. What has been done so far is already enough, some reckon, to lift the country permanently to a GDP growth path of 5% a year. That would equal the growth of the 1980s, but on a far more solid footing: the economic spurt then was due partly to some modest reforms but also to a reckless and unsustainable expansion of the budget deficit.
The experience of the 1980s showed that poverty begins falling swiftly in India when the rate of growth reaches 5%. A sustained GDP growth rate of 9% a year would free most Indians from truly grinding poverty by 2000, and make 1 billion of them middle-class by 2020. That is not impossible. India has plenty of entrepreneurs--and plenty of savings. Yet the government may lack the will to seize its chance.
NOW FOR THE HARDER PART
However praiseworthy, everything done so far by Mr Singh has been politically easy--at least compared with the things that need to be done next. An intellectual conviction in favour of central planning and Fabian socialism has been overthrown. That is enormously important, but the people whose noses have thus been put out of joint are not a power in their own right. In contrast, none of the reforms has yet posed a big threat to the special-interest groups that are, and which dominate Indian politics. The changes that must be made if India is to take off will require the power of these interests to be broken. Will it happen?
The government has so far shrunk from four huge challenges: reform of the labour market, of the financial system, of agriculture and of its own finances.
* LABOUR. Most restrictions on setting up companies and on their production decisions have been abolished. But businesses need to close as well as open, and workers to be fired as well as hired. The licensing system dealt with these awkward facts by forbidding them to happen. It still does. Mr Rao and his colleagues cannot bring themselves to admit that their reforms will throw even a single Indian out of work.
Especially not if he works for the government. India's public sector in 1990 employed 18.7m people: not many in a national workforce of 325m, but still 71% of the jobs in the ""organised sector"", establishments with ten or more workers. Of the 18.7m, half worked in state industries or banks, the other half as civil servants (including teachers, doctors and nurses).
A job in the public sector, which is heavily unionised, has been thought of as a job for life. Mr Rao's government has done nothing to change that. The foreign-trade reforms have eliminated much of the work that the bureaucrats from export and import control used to do; tax reforms have significantly reduced the workload of tax collectors; one whole ministry has been abolished. Yet not one bureaucrat from any of those services has lost his job. Mr Singh says the government will rely on natural attrition to thin the ranks of civil servants.
The public enterprises, some owned by the central government and some by the governments of India's constituent states, present worse problems. Not only are they overmanned; their inefficiency is transmitted to the rest of the economy through high prices, bad products and poor services. One of the grossest examples is the electricity board of Uttar Pradesh, which employs 600,000 people and loses through pilferage 18% of the power that it generates. A survey of 233 of the better-run enterprises owned by the central government found that their return on equity in 1989-90 was just 0.9%.
The stronger the union in a state industry, the more precarious the business's finances. The railways employ 1.6m workers, at an average rate of pay 2-1/2 times the average Indian family income. It is little surprise that the government has to use its revenues to prop up these industries. Of the total allocated for capital investment by state-owned heavy industry in the 1991-92 budget, about 30% will have been financed by the taxpayer.
The need for a coherent bankruptcy policy is clear from the official figures for ""sick"" enterprises. In 1988 these numbered nearly 250,000, and they owed their banks 77 billion rupees ($2.7 billion). In theory, the privately owned firms on this list cannot close down without permission; in practice, about half of them have closed anyway. The government is loth to allow closures until a social safety net of some sort is in place. It is trying to create one through the National Renewal Fund, but the fund is growing much more slowly than the urgency of the industrial problem.
* THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM. The state-owned banks, nationalised in two waves in the late 1960s and late 1970s, are incapable of providing the services of a modern financial system. It is hard to know who milks the banks more, their employees or the government. State-owned banks employ 900,000 workers, whose average pay is four times India's average family income. The militant bank unions not only push up wages, but also stoutly resist anything that might raise productivity. After years of struggle, they were at last persuaded by the banks to allow computerisation--in no more than a single branch of each bank.
The government, for its part, requires the banks to hold low-yielding government debt in an amount equal to 30% of their net deposits (down from 38.5%, thanks to a concession in this year's budget). They are also required to give credit to government-favoured borrowers like farmers. A survey of 50 big banks showed that, of the credit they extended between 1977 and 1990, 41% went to favoured borrowers, 15% or so to public-sector companies and another 2% to government agencies. One foreign banker in Bombay reckons that at least 20% of the state banks' loans are bad, and that their balance sheets are an average of 15-20% in the red and in some cases 50%.
Late last year a reform commission recommended a gradual reduction in government-directed investments and credits by banks, and said that new private banks should be allowed to open. The government is still dawdling.
* FARMING. In a country where three-quarters of the people and four-fifths of the really poor live in the countryside, policies to push up rural economic growth and channel help to the most needy would make sense. The government has mostly done the opposite. It has starved the country-side of investment. It has encouraged the production of crops like oilseeds and sugarcane, in which India has a comparative disadvantage, and discouraged crops like rice, wheat and cotton in which India is competitive. In keeping down food prices, it has hugely subsidised the urban middle class.
In 1991-92 central-government subsidies came to 104 billion rupees, with state-government subsidies adding another 106 billion rupees--the combined total equalled 10.5% of all government spending. Almost 80% of the centre's subsidies went, one way or another, to agriculture: mainly for fertilisers, debt relief for farmers and consumption subsidies for city-dwellers. Most of the subsidies from state governments went to provide cheap electricity and water for the better-off sort of farmer. Mr Singh tried to cut the growth in the fertiliser subsidy by 40%, but parliamentary pressure obliged him to settle for a 30% cut.
* GOVERNMENT FINANCES. These subsidies weigh heavily on the budget. The budget deficit plainly must come down, for the sake of the anti-inflation fight, if nothing else. And the government is indeed committed to cutting it, from 9% of GDP in 1990-91 to 6.5% in 1991-92 and 5% this fiscal year. But, with defence spending apparently untouchable, there can be no serious reduction without an attack on the government wage bill, state-enterprise incompetence, the losses of state-owned banks and farming subsidies.
The difficulty is compounded by the structure of India's taxes. Direct taxes account for only 20% of the central government's tax take, the rest being split about equally between excise taxes and import tariffs. This is perilous. The excisemen are a menace to industrial efficiency. Factories have to keep records even of scrap metal, because it has an excisable value. Tariffs must be brought sharply down, for the sake of further trade reform. But how can that be done, when they provide so much of the government's revenue?
NEEDED: A SUBCONTINENTAL THATCHER
The government has no intention at the moment of mounting a frontal assault on these obstacles. The country, says Mr Singh, in a cliche of development economics, needs ""adjustment with a human face"". A pause in reform will persist until the autumn in any event. The government is worried about what a bad monsoon would do to inflation and the public mood.
Thereafter, might the precarious position of Mr Rao's government prevent him from taking on the unions and the subsidy-eaters? Despite its lack of an overall parliamentary majority, the government is not under much threat from other parties. The left has self-destructed, and the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party has little quarrel with Mr Rao's economic policy. But within Congress itself there could be trouble. It remains a nest of special-interest politics, influence-peddling, corruption and blind ambition. At the party congress last month, only a tenth of the delegates bothered to turn up for Mr Singh's speech on economic policy. The rest were in the corridors, hotly lobbying over the impending elections to the party's central committee.
On the other hand, an attack on the bureaucracy and the unions should have a strong populist appeal. The bureaucrats, bank workers and subsidised land-owners are among India's privileged (which is why they have so much clout in Delhi). The average voter would be delighted to see them cut down to size.
That is not the instinct of Mr Rao's government. Everyone recalls that one excuse given for Indira Gandhi's declaration of a state of emergency in 1977 was the prospect of a crippling strike by the railway unions. The Rao team would prefer to approach the questions of overmanning and inefficiency slowly and quietly. They cannot ""undo all the iniquities of history in a short period"", says Mr Singh. Though businessmen already report a more realistic attitude among some unions, he adds that ""we can't shout from the housetops"" that enterprises are closing and jobs being lost.
This cautious approach has its merits. The danger with it is that, lacking the crisp and simple explanations that gave the Reagan and Thatcher revolutions popular appeal, the Rao reforms will lose the support of the mass of Indians and the reforms themselves will simply peter out. It happened before, with the less sweeping reforms of the late 1970s and of 1984-85. It would be a tragedy if, having begun so well, Mr Rao and Mr Singh were to stop half-way.",""" What does South Korea have that India does n't ?

One foreign banker in Bombay reckons that at least 20 % of the state banks ' loans are bad , and that their balance sheets are an average of 15 - 20 % in the red and in some cases 50 % . 
 Late last year a reform commission recommended a gradual reduction in government - directed investments and credits by banks , and said that new private banks should be allowed to open . The government is still dawdling . 
 * FARMING . In a country where three - quarters of the people and four - fifths of the really poor live in the countryside , policies to push up rural economic growth and channel help to the most needy would make sense . The government has mostly done the opposite . It has starved the country - side of investment . It has encouraged the production of crops like oilseeds and sugarcane , in which India has a comparative disadvantage , and discouraged crops like rice , wheat and cotton in which India is competitive . In keeping down food prices , it has hugely subsidised the urban middle class . 
 In 1991 - 92 central - government subsidies came to 104 billion rupees , with state - government subsidies adding another 106 billion rupees -- the combined total equalled 10.5 % of all government spending . Almost 80 % of the centre 's subsidies went , one way or another , to agriculture : mainly for fertilisers , debt relief for farmers and consumption subsidies for city - dwellers . Most of the subsidies from state governments went to provide cheap electricity and water for the better - off sort of farmer . Mr Singh tried to cut the growth in the fertiliser subsidy by 40 % , but parliamentary pressure obliged him to settle for a 30 % cut . 
 * GOVERNMENT FINANCES . These subsidies weigh heavily on the budget . The budget deficit plainly must come down , for the sake of the anti - inflation fight , if nothing else . And the government is indeed committed to cutting it , from 9 % of GDP in 1990 - 91 to 6.5 % in 1991 - 92 and 5 % this fiscal year . But , with defence spending apparently untouchable , there can be no serious reduction without an attack on the government wage bill , state - enterprise incompetence , the losses of state - owned banks and farming subsidies . 
 The difficulty is compounded by the structure of India 's taxes . Direct taxes account for only 20 % of the central government 's tax take , the rest being split about equally between excise taxes and import tariffs . This is perilous . The excisemen are a menace to industrial efficiency . Factories have to keep records even of scrap metal , because it has an excisable value . Tariffs must be brought sharply down , for the sake of further trade reform . But how can that be done , when they provide so much of the government 's revenue ? 
 NEEDED : A SUBCONTINENTAL THATCHER 
 The government has no intention at the moment of mounting a frontal assault on these obstacles . The country , says Mr Singh , in a cliche of development economics , needs "" adjustment with a human face "" . A pause in reform will persist until the autumn in any event . The government is worried about what a bad monsoon would do to inflation and the public mood . 
 Thereafter , might the precarious position of Mr Rao 's government prevent him from taking on the unions and the subsidy - eaters ? Despite its lack of an overall parliamentary majority , the government is not under much threat from other parties . The left has self - destructed , and the Hindu - nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party has little quarrel with Mr Rao 's economic policy . But within Congress itself there could be trouble . It remains a nest of special - interest politics , influence - peddling , corruption and blind ambition . At the party congress last month , only a tenth of the delegates bothered to turn up for Mr Singh 's speech on economic policy . The rest were in the corridors , hotly lobbying over the impending elections to the party 's central committee . 
 On the other hand , an attack on the bureaucracy and the unions should have a strong populist appeal . The bureaucrats , bank workers and subsidised land - owners are among India 's privileged ( which is why they have so much clout in Delhi ) . The average voter would be delighted to see them cut down to size . 
 That is not the instinct of Mr Rao 's government . Everyone recalls that one excuse given for Indira Gandhi 's declaration of a state of emergency in 1977 was the prospect of a crippling strike by the railway unions . The Rao team would prefer to approach the questions of overmanning and inefficiency slowly and quietly . They can not "" undo all the iniquities of history in a short period "" , says Mr Singh . Though businessmen already report a more realistic attitude among some unions , he adds that "" we ca n't shout from the housetops "" that enterprises are closing and jobs being lost . 
 This cautious approach has its merits . The danger with it is that , lacking the crisp and simple explanations that gave the Reagan and Thatcher revolutions popular appeal , the Rao reforms will lose the support of the mass of Indians and the reforms themselves will simply peter out . It happened before , with the less sweeping reforms of the late 1970s and of 1984 - 85 . It would be a tragedy if , having begun so well , Narasimha Rao were to stop half - way .",750,India,A29-8245,IN TERM,True,his reformist colleagues in the government of P.V. Narasimha Rao,7,True

The army has strengthened patrols on the border, reducing the flow of arms from Pakistan to the militants.
Between 1987 and 1992 Punjab had no elected government and was ruled directly by Delhi.

Two months ago they ordered all village councillors to resign, and many did. But with Beant Singh seen to be waving the big stick, some councillors who resigned have got the courage to withdraw their resignations.
The problem with tough police is that, in their attempts to catch militants, they arrest and torture innocent villagers, and in the process probably create more militants than they put in jail. Many policemen misuse their powers and steal from villagers. However, the same indiscipline is now evident in separatist groups too. Many youths have taken to armed crime under the guise of being freedom fighters.
Villagers are tired of the breakdown of ordinary life. Four-fifths of Punjab's police are Sikhs, and the killing on both sides means that many Sikh families have suffered the loss of one or more members. Beant Singh hopes to exploit this weariness. But his party still carries the stigma of having sent the army into the Golden Temple, holy of holies for all Sikhs, in 1984.

Should Indians born into the less-favoured castes be compensated with promises of government jobs? Two years ago, when such job reservation was proposed by the then prime minister, V.P. Singh, dozens of upper-caste students burned themselves to death and more than 100 people were killed in riots. The ruling on November 16th by the Supreme Court that 27% of jobs in central and state government should be reserved for the intermediate castes has revived old anxieties. This week students blocked roads and set fire to buses in several cities.
In India's Hindu society, there are high castes, led by the Brahmins, who tend to have the top official jobs, and low ones such as the untouchables, who are guaranteed 22-1/2% of government jobs. Somewhere in between are the castes made up of peasants and labourers, around half the population. In a democracy numbers are power.
The plight of the intermediate castes came to the notice of a commission under B.P. Mandal in 1980. It produced a list of 3,743 intermediate castes and other backward groups which, it said, accounted for 52% of the population, yet held only 12.5% of central government jobs, and only 4.7% of jobs at officer level. It pointed out that administrative standards had not fallen in departments where jobs were reserved for untouchables. The commission suggested that 27% of jobs in government should be reserved for the intermediate castes (and for Christian and Muslim groups that were socially backward).
However, it was only in 1990 that V.P. Singh made the idea government policy, upsetting the upper castes. The Brahmins, a mere 5.5% of the population, have traditionally run government departments. The struggle for jobs in India is so intense that the upper-caste students who killed themselves in protest saw themselves as victims of injustice, not as historical oppressors.
But no political party dares oppose job reservation, given the voting clout of the intermediate castes. The prime minister, Narasimha Rao, is as committed to the policy as was V.P. Singh. Last year Mr Rao tried to ease tensions by reserving 10% of jobs for poor members of the upper castes, but the Supreme Court ruled this unconstitutional.
Opponents of reservation disagree with Mandal that the quality of administration does not suffer. The really backward do not benefit, they say, because reserved jobs get taken over by an elite that has emerged within a lowly caste. The Supreme Court agrees. It says that the number of government jobs for untouchables and tribesmen should not exceed the present 22-1/2%. Adding in the 27% for intermediate castes (but including Christians and Muslims in that figure) would bring the number of reserved jobs to just under half of the total. The court also says that governments should eliminate the cream of the intermediate castes from those eligible for reserved jobs.
At present some states in southern India have reserved far more than half their jobs. Many will have to be unreserved to meet the court ruling.

""It is no more a united nation than the Equator."" For the past 45 years the governments of independent India have done their best to prove Churchill wrong. Does the destruction by Hindu zealots on December 6th of a 16th-century mosque in the town of Ayodhya now mean those efforts have been in vain? Is secular India, ever proud to call itself the world's largest democracy, about to fragment along bloody lines drawn by race and creed?
Those are worrying questions--for Indians and, given the potential for regional unrest, for their neighbours, too. The Union of India is, by population, the world's biggest country after China. It is a confused mosaic of languages, races and religions which cannot be peacefully reassembled into neat patterns of homogeneity. When British India was partitioned to create secular India and Muslim Pakistan, more than 8m people were uprooted and perhaps 200,000 were killed.
Those dreadful memories have not lost their relevance. India's Muslim minority today numbers 120m--roughly the same as the population of Pakistan or Bangladesh--and is spread from Uttar Pradesh to Tamil Nadu, from Gujarat to West Bengal. So too are India's smaller minorities: Sikhs, Christians, Parsees, Jains, Buddhists and so on. Let sectarian conflict occur in one place and it will erupt in others. Witness the hundreds of killings from Calcutta to Karnataka that occurred within hours of the rubble-making in Ayodhya (see page 41). Witness, too, the violent anti-Hindu reaction in Pakistan, Bangladesh and as far away as Britain's Birmingham. Clearly, India will abandon secularism at everyone's peril.
Yet an abandonment of secularism is precisely the aim of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). India, it proclaims, is a Hindu nation, first by history and culture (Islam took root only with the Moghul emperors of the 16th century) and second by numbers: out of 870m Indians at least 640m are Hindus. The consequent BJP logic is that India should be officially Hindu just as England is Anglican, with India's minorities given legal safeguards just as Britain's are. Those who doubt the party's good intentions need only recall that Hinduism is a tolerant religion, never anxious to proselytise, always willing to accept the divine reality of other creeds.
The argument is shamelessly disingenuous. In the general election of 1984, the first it fought, the BJP won just two seats in the federal Parliament; in last year's election it won 119 of the 511 seats being contested and took one of every three Hindu votes. Today the party is the main opposition at the federal level. It forms the government in four of India's 25 states, including Uttar Pradesh, the state in which the Ayodhya mosque stood. Like the ruling Congress party, the BJP can now boast a truly nationwide following.
That startling rise from obscurity was achieved not by preaching religious harmony but by stirring sectarian sentiments. Two years ago the BJP'S leader, Lal Krishna Advani, led a march on Ayodhya, claiming that the town's Babri mosque desecrated the birthplace 5,000 years ago of the Hindu god Ram. At least 1,000 died in the ensuing riots between Hindus and Muslims, and the coalition government of Vishwanath Pratap Singh was bundled out of office. At the end of last year the BJP organised a march of ""union"" from India's southern tip to disputed Kashmir in the far north. Each step of the way was a taunt to non-Hindus, whether separatist-minded Sikhs in Punjab or Muslims in Kashmir.
True, the BJP has disclaimed responsibility for this week's horrors; indeed, the BJP'S chief minister in Uttar Pradesh, having promised to prevent the storming of the mosque, immediately resigned, while in Delhi Mr Advani stepped down as leader of the opposition (and was then arrested). But the disclaimer should not be taken at face value: the BJP came to power in Uttar Pradesh with a programme that pledged to construct a Hindu temple on the Ayodhya site, and Mr Advani and his ""moderate"" colleagues have done precious little to restrain the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (World Hindu Council) and the other extremists who breed on the BJP's fringe.
STRENGTH IN SECULARISM
Blaming the BJP for its own success will, however, do little to comfort India's minorities or restore peace. Hindu chauvinism has prospered not just through the efforts of the BJP but also through the inadequacies of the Congress establishment. Secularism is identified with India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, and the Congress party later dominated by his daughter, Indira Gandhi, and grandson Rajiv Gandhi. The more Congress was seen as a corrupt family firm, the more the BJP was likely to appeal, leaving secularism as the ideal of a westernised elite, irrelevant to the Hindu masses.
One cause for comfort is that Congress is no longer the property of the Nehru dynasty. That ended (at least until Priyanka, Mrs Gandhi's granddaughter, reaches the age of political consent) with the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi in May last year. The new leader of the Congress party, Narasimha Rao, heads a minority government with a brave programme of economic liberalisation. If that programme can accelerate India's development to the speed needed to enrich the masses, Congress will recover popularity at the expense of the BJP.
It is a big if. India's economic problems are huge and Mr Rao, by not being firm enough soon enough in the protracted Ayodhya affair, has squandered some of the authority needed to keep his party in line. The destruction of the mosque has now brought from the prime minister commendably forceful reactions, among them a welcome promise to rebuild the mosque. Yet some of the government's firmness--the arrest of Mr Advani, for example, and the banning of extremist organisations such as the Vishwa Hindu Parishad--runs the risk of inflaming Hindu passions still further.
Risk, however, is not the same as certainty. India's cracks are so many and manifest that its unifying resilience is sometimes overlooked. The truth is that Ayodhya's violence is the latest in a line of crises, including the storming of the Sikh temple in Amritsar and the assassinations of Mahatma Gandhi, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi. On each occasion India has stepped towards the brink of disintegration--and then stepped back.

The question is hardly new, but has become suddenly pressing. On December 6th in Ayodhya, in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, a mob of 200,000 Hindus reduced to rubble a mosque built over 400 years ago by the Moghul emperor Babur. In the riots that followed more than 700 were killed in the first four days.
For secular parties such as the ruling Congress party, the destruction of the Babri mosque is an ominous tragedy. But for many Hindus it is welcome revenge on the Muslim invaders who in their time demolished so many Hindu temples. The Babri mosque, erected on the supposed birthplace of the Hindu god Ram, is but one of the ancient mosques built by the Moghuls on the sites of demolished Hindu temples. If Hindu militants have their way, all these offending mosques will be pulled down.
But what is a fillip to the militants is a threat to the prime minister, Narasimha Rao. His Congress party and its allies have only a hair's-breadth majority in Parliament. One faction of Congress, led by the ambitious Arjun Singh, had long demanded much sterner action to protect the mosque than Mr Rao had been willing to contemplate. Although the party has for the time being closed ranks behind Mr Rao, he will now be a weaker prime minister, and so will find it more difficult to push ahead with his economic reforms.
Economic action will be only one of Mr Rao's difficulties. He says the Babri mosque will be rebuilt, with a Hindu temple alongside as proof of unbiased secularism. But that presumes that Hindu militants will allow it. Meanwhile foreign investors will wonder whether it is safe to invest in a country where religious passions threaten governments as well as mosques.
The chief opposition party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has so far been in the hands of moderates. But in the wake of the December 6th uproar the government has arrested all the top leaders of the BJP; banned (or threatened to ban) communal organisations, including those nurtured by the party; and put the state of Uttar Pradesh, which has a BJP government, under paramilitary rule.
Fair enough, perhaps. But an unlooked-for consequence is that the BJP's militants may now wrest the party from its moderates. Some militants have already declared in Parliament that they will demolish mosques at Mathura and Varanasi.
Mr Rao by instinct favours consensus, hence his attempts over the past year to let the courts deal with the Ayodhya dispute. Now many of his colleagues are telling him that the only way to solve the sectarian problem is to ban the BJP. But to ban the chief opposition party hardly seems democratic, and a ban on all communal parties would logically have to include the Sikhs' Akali Dal. That would end all chances of peace in strife-torn Punjab.
The ban would anyway be futile: proscribed groups would emerge under new names, and with an aura of martyrdom. Mr Rao can ban communal parties but not communalism.
The BJP and militant outfits such as the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (World Hindu Council) have been campaigning for years to shift the Babri mosque and replace it with a temple to Lord Ram. After a rally at Ayodhya in 1990 was bloodily repulsed by armed police, the militants claimed that Hinduism itself was under siege, and that nothing was being done to stop the destruction of Hindu temples by Muslims in Kashmir. With Hindu passions suitably aroused, the BJP emerged as the chief opposition party in the 1991 federal election. In the state elections it won four states, including Uttar Pradesh.
Mr Rao's softly-softly approach had its logic. He wanted to avoid any bloodshed that would strengthen the Hindu extremists. So too did the BJP's moderates, led by Lal Krishna Advani: they doubted that religious fervour alone could win the party a general election, and so wished it to be seen as a party of good governance. Any confrontation at Ayodhya could more profitably await the next general election, when the time would be ripe to convert Hindu passions into votes.
The BJP government in Uttar Pradesh therefore sought to acquire the property around the Ayodhya mosque legally, knowing this would be challenged in the courts. While the wrangle went on, Hindu volunteers in July began building a temple at a nearby site, claiming that the construction would in due course include the mosque. The Supreme Court ordered a halt to this construction. But the BJP was under pressure from its militants to restart construction on December 6th, in line with a schedule set by a group of religious leaders. As a compromise, the party decided that a rally would take place on that day but would be confined to religious music and discourse. Mr Rao was happy to go along: the court process would, he assumed, provide favourable verdicts and take so long that Hindus would tire of the issue. Both the BJP and the government wanted the December 6th rally to be mere theatre.
But history is rarely directed: it simply happens. The BJP was unable to control the impassioned hordes in Ayodhya. Ignoring exhortations from the moderates, the crowd soon reduced the mosque to rubble. The bricks were carted away as souvenirs, not unlike the Berlin Wall. The police contingent stood by helplessly: the BJP state government had instructed it not to fire at the crowd in any circumstances. Militant Hindus soon cleared a space in the rubble, built a makeshift shack and installed idols of Ram. They have threatened bloodshed if anybody attacks this new structure.
Mr Rao has sacked the state government and put Uttar Pradesh under direct rule from Delhi. Policemen have cleared the site of the angry hordes. But Hindus have already started worshipping at the shack, and they are not all militants. Indian newspapers have carried a telling photo of policemen, supposedly guarding the site, taking off their shoes and praying to the idols.
Polls show that, although there is enormous Hindu support for building a temple to Lord Ram at Ayodhya, only a minority want the mosque to go. That is why Mr Rao believes that he can solve the problem by building a mosque as well as a temple. But the truth is that among most Hindus the desire to build the temple is strong whereas the desire to protect the mosque is weak. The depth of beliefs matters as much as the width. When hundreds of thousands of people are willing to brave bullets for a cause, it is difficult in a democracy to stop them.
The foundations of any democracy rest on the assumption that its people agree on the fundamentals of governance. When India became independent, those fundamentals included a commitment to secularism. That has been challenged before, and the challenge seen off for a time, but it has plainly not been vanquished.","Can India survive as a secular democracy or will it degenerate into a theocratic Hindu state ? The question is hardly new , but has become suddenly pressing . On December 6th in Ayodhya , in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh , a mob of 200,000 Hindus reduced to rubble a mosque built over 400 years ago by the Moghul emperor Babur . In the riots that followed more than 700 were killed in the first four days . 
 For secular parties such as the ruling Congress party , the destruction of the Babri mosque is an ominous tragedy . But for many Hindus it is welcome revenge on the Muslim invaders who in their time demolished so many Hindu temples . The Babri mosque , erected on the supposed birthplace of the Hindu god Ram , is but one of the ancient mosques built by the Moghuls on the sites of demolished Hindu temples . If Hindu militants have their way , all these offending mosques will be pulled down . 
 But what is a fillip to the militants is a threat to Narasimha Rao . Narasimha Rao's Congress party and its allies have only a hair's - breadth majority in Parliament . One faction of Congress , led by the ambitious Arjun Singh , had long demanded much sterner action to protect the mosque than Narasimha Rao had been willing to contemplate . Although the party has for the time being closed ranks behind Narasimha Rao , Narasimha Rao will now be a weaker prime minister , and so will find it more difficult to push ahead with Narasimha Rao's economic reforms . 
 Economic action will be only one of Narasimha Rao's difficulties . Narasimha Rao says the Babri mosque will be rebuilt , with a Hindu temple alongside as proof of unbiased secularism . But that presumes that Hindu militants will allow it . Meanwhile foreign investors will wonder whether it is safe to invest in a country where religious passions threaten governments as well as mosques . 
 The chief opposition party , the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) , has so far been in the hands of moderates . But in the wake of the December 6th uproar the government has arrested all the top leaders of the BJP ; banned ( or threatened to ban ) communal organisations , including those nurtured by the party ; and put the state of Uttar Pradesh , which has a BJP government , under paramilitary rule .

Cynics say that Bombay's 12m people worship neither Allah nor Hinduism's Lord Ram. Their god is Mammon: the city's Hindus and Muslims trade goods, not blows; they leave religious strife to the zealots in the north of India.
Imagine, then, the shock for India now that Bombay, its business heart, has succumbed to bloody sectarianism. The murder, looting and arson that began on January 6th soon spread from the Muslim ghettos to the enclaves of the privileged. First the police were called in; then the paramilitary forces; and then, on January 9th, the army--and still the mayhem spread. This week the railway station was swamped with thousands of families trying to flee the city. At the airport fights broke out as the rich found flights had been curtailed by a pilots' strike.
On January 10th a group of Bombay businessmen, headed by the venerable J.R.D. Tata, the patriarch of India's biggest industrial organisation, declared that democracy had failed, and that the government should declare a state of emergency in Bombay to give the army a free hand to restore order. One of the group was Nani Palkhivala, a champion of civil rights who vociferously opposed the state of emergency imposed by Indira Gandhi in 1975-77. His participation spoke volumes for the despair that has grown among India's liberals in the weeks since Hindu fanatics on December 6th destroyed a 16th-century mosque at Ayodhya because it was allegedly built on the remains of a Hindu temple, and on the birthplace of the god Ram.
The fundamental issue, however, is of politics, not history. The Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has concluded that it can ride to political power by harping on about the Muslim invasion of India centuries ago, and by complaining that secular parties (such as the ruling Congress party) are giving Muslims special favours to buy votes. Opinion polls after the Ayodhya incident suggest that the BJP would win 170 seats in a fresh federal election, up from 119 in the 1991 election (though well short of the 272 seats needed for an absolute majority), and from just two in 1984.
Meanwhile, the appeal of zealotry grows with the demise of the state's moral authority. Politicians and the police are seen as venal and incompetent; the courts deliver little or no justice. The Congress party in Bombay, where it holds power, is as corrupt as elsewhere. Many of the city's politicians are hand in glove with smugglers; criminals have become political figures in their own right. Many are Muslim, linked to the smuggling of contraband from Dubai.
But at least as ugly as any Muslim gang are the Hindu ones allied to the Shiv Sena (Lord Shiva's Army). Whereas the BJP swears by democracy and even claims to be secular (it keeps a few Muslims in ornamental positions in the party), the leader of the Shiv Sena, Bal Thackeray, says plainly that India needs a Hindu dictatorship.
When, in the aftermath of Ayodhya, Muslim gangs ran riot in Bombay, Mr Thackeray saw his chance. Pointing out that during Friday prayers Muslims spill out of the mosques and so block the streets, Mr Thackeray urged Hindus at temple prayers to block roads in retaliation--hence one cause of this week's bloodshed. The Shiv Sena's hand is evident in the burning of Muslim shops and the lynching of individual Muslims. But there are other hands, too. Old scores of every sort are being settled: Tamil immigrants to the city are a favourite target, despite their profession of Hinduism. Amazingly, because the arms of the thugs are stronger than the arm of the law, some Muslims are actually urging the state government to go easy on the Shiv Sena lest it provoke more anti-Muslim violence.
But not all Muslims will be so appeasing. Guns are easily available in India; people in Muslim Pakistan have long supplied weapons to insurgents in Kashmir and Punjab; and the Muslim smugglers of Bombay can already hold their own in gun battles. Unless the state can restore sanity, there is a danger that Muslim terrorism will emerge as a counter to Hindu violence.
What, then, is the Congress party doing to combat sectarianism? Precious little. It has long ceased to be a grassroots party with cadres in every village, hence its decision to sway expediently with the Hindu wind. After the Ayodhya incident the prime minister, Narasimha Rao, reacted at first with tough talk of rebuilding the mosque; he banned communal organisations and sacked BJP governments in four states. But then his tune changed. Hindu mobs had installed idols of Ram and built a makeshift temple on the rubble of the demolished mosque. Mr Rao had no stomach for removing either idols or their worshippers. It is now certain that he will not rebuild the mosque at the original site, but choose a spot a discreet distance away.
Even that softer option rests on the government's proposals to create Hindu and Muslim trusts to build a temple and mosque respectively, and on its request to the Supreme Court to say whether a temple once existed at the mosque site. Since Muslims have said they will surrender the site if it is proved that the mosque was built by demolishing a temple, a court verdict could end the dispute.
But neither the BJP nor many prominent Muslim bodies are so far willing to accept Mr Rao's compromise. Nor is it certain that the Supreme Court will accept the task thrust on it, since the court may see no legal point at issue. Meanwhile, banned Hindu organisations operate almost openly, even in the four states whose BJP governments have been sacked. When BJP leaders were released from police custody on January 10th, they returned to Delhi as heroes. A leader of the banned Vishwa Hindu Parishad declared that his next target would be mosques at Mathura and Varanasi (Benares), one of Hinduism's most holy cities. Nobody talks of arresting him again, since so many others are saying the same thing.
In the past India has proved resilient: life has returned to normal within weeks of the most awful slaughter. This time could be different: the growth of the BJP and of Hinduism's extremist fringe suggests that a new India is emerging. It is hard to return to normal when so many gain from the abnormal.","FROM OUR INDIA CORRESPONDENT

Narasimha Rao, has done his best to show that he remains the boss of the ruling Congress party. Until he took this action, his leadership appeared to be faltering; the demolition of the Muslim mosque at Ayodhya on December 6th by a Hindu mob and the subsequent religious riots had dealt it a severe blow.
Mr Rao's rivals in the party, among them Arjun Singh, a government minister, had criticised Mr Rao for trusting the state government in Uttar Pradesh to protect the mosque at Ayodhya. The state was run by the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Mr Singh demanded the sacking of the Uttar Pradesh government and three other state governments ruled by the BJP, and said Mr Rao should promise to rebuild the mosque. This went against Mr Rao's non-confrontational style, but he decided it was politic to go along with his critics.
Reports from party officials all over north India, however, said that voters were solidly for the demolition of the mosque, and would be upset if it were rebuilt. The officials said the Congress party had lost support to the BJP, and could recover it only by adopting a soft Hindu line. This, they felt, was more important than wooing the Muslim vote.
Mr Rao, it seemed, had erred. Even Mr Singh decided that the hard secular line he had forced on Mr Rao was a mistake. This emboldened the prime minister to ask for the resignation of all cabinet ministers before the reshuffle, a move designed to show that he was in charge, even though his position had been weakened.

Until Narasimha Rao took this action , Narasimha Rao's leadership appeared to be faltering ; the demolition of the Muslim mosque at Ayodhya on December 6th by a Hindu mob and the subsequent religious riots had dealt it a severe blow . 
 Narasimha Rao's rivals in the party , among them Arjun Singh , a government minister , had criticised Narasimha Rao for trusting the state government in Uttar Pradesh to protect the mosque at Ayodhya . The state was run by the Hindu - nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) . Mr Singh demanded the sacking of the Uttar Pradesh government and three other state governments ruled by the BJP , and said Narasimha Rao should promise to rebuild the mosque . This went against Narasimha Rao's non - confrontational style , but Narasimha Rao decided it was politic to go along with Narasimha Rao's critics . 
 Reports from party officials all over north India , however , said that voters were solidly for the demolition of the mosque , and would be upset if it were rebuilt . The officials said the Congress party had lost support to the BJP , and could recover it only by adopting a soft Hindu line . This , they felt , was more important than wooing the Muslim vote . 
 Narasimha Rao , it seemed , had erred . Even Mr Singh decided that the hard secular line he had forced on Narasimha Rao was a mistake . This emboldened Narasimha Rao to ask for the resignation of all cabinet ministers before the reshuffle , a move designed to show that Narasimha Rao was in charge , even though Narasimha Rao's position had been weakened . Narasimha Rao let all Narasimha Rao's top ministers retain their jobs . But Narasimha Rao brought four new men into the cabinet , appointed 12 new junior ministers , and dropped 14 has - beens .

It knows much less about the Hindu upsurge that on December 6th led to the demolition of a mosque at Ayodhya by a mob of fanatics, followed by riots in which thousands of Indians, mostly Muslims, were killed. The upsurge could one day put the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which proclaims Hindu nationalism, in national power.
Unlike the militant mullahs of Islam, militant Hindus pose no threat to the world at large. Their target is the enemy within, secular Hindus and Indian Muslims. That threat is real enough. After independence in 1947, one founding principle of the Indian state, enshrined in its new constitution in 1950, was democracy. Another--closely related to it--was secularism, in the Indian sense of that word: not that society should be irreligious, but that it and the state should be neutral as between the country's many religions and tolerant of all. The new-found strength of Hindu militancy appalls many observers, who now see both these principles in danger. Could India, they ask fearfully, become, on a much greater and bloodier scale, another Bosnia?
Hindus constitute 83% of India's population, Muslims barely 11%. Yet that means 100m Muslims, not far short of the number in Pakistan (whither some militant Hindus think they should be packed off). Muslims are, on average, poorer and less literate than Hindus. Yet the BJP paints them as a privileged lot who must be brought to heel.
A SOCIETY, NOT A FAITH
What is a Hindu? The answer is surprisingly complex. Thousands of years ago, Aryans from Central Asia migrated to the Indian subcontinent, conquering the local tribes. The holy books of the Aryans, the Vedas, were a mixture of philosophy, prayers and stories about their many gods. As the Aryans mingled with the original inhabitants, many local beliefs and further gods joined the Vedic ones. This loose conglomerate of deities and beliefs came to be called Hinduism. The word originally referred merely to people living around the Indus river. It has always described a society rather than a faith, let alone a church.
Hinduism has no formal religious hierarchy. India is dotted with famous monasteries headed by revered sages, but none of these can lay down the law to any others, and any Hindu is free to ignore or contradict any or all of them. No Hindu need go to a temple or read the Vedas. Hindu philosophy is complete and elastic enough to include even schools of atheism. From it sprang the related, but quite distinct, religions of Buddhism and, later, Sikhism.
Belonging to a non-proselytising religion, Hindu kings were happy to accommodate early Christian, roastrian, Jewish and Muslim immigrants. The Hindu decline began in the 11th century, with the invasion of northern India by a succession of Muslim conquerors. The invaders enslaved and converted many Hindus, and destroyed thousands of Hindu temples. In time, Muslims came to rule most of India, until the British took it over in the 18th and 19th centuries.
When the British left in 1947, the sub-continent split. The main Muslim-majority areas broke away as agreed, but to the regret of many Indians--to form (the then two wings of) Pakistan. In what remained as India, Hindus were back in the saddle. There had been many Hindu-Muslim riots under British rule. In the bitterness of partition, millions of frightened people fled across the new frontiers in both directions, and maybe half a million were butchered. The new India could easily have been staunchly Hindu. In fact it was staunchly secular, thanks to the historical evolution of the Indian National Congress, which spearheaded the freedom movement and has held power almost continuously ever since
At the beginning of this century, there was a tussle between Hindu revivalists and westernised, secular liberals for control of Congress. By the 1920s the liberals had won control. Headed by M.K. (""Mahatma"") Gandhi, a devout but deeply tolerant Hindu, and Jawatarlal Nehru, far more attached to his political beliefs than his Hindu background, they kept it. Congress did not ultimately carry with it the main Muslim leaders and the Muslim-majority areas that became Pakistan. But it remained committed to secularism and democracy.
THE RISE OF THE HINDU VOTE
Many other parties tried to harness the Hindu vote, notably the Jan Sangh, which was reincarnated as the BJP in 1980. Gandhi was murdered by a militant Hindu. But despite several wars with Pakistan and occasional communal riots, Hindu unity failed to become a vote-catcher for four decades. Antagonism between different castes, races and regions ranked higher in voters' minds than Hindu unity. In the 1984 election the BJP was reduced to just two seats India uses a first-past-the-post electoral system, like Britain's--and despaired of a future.
Then the tide turned. The BJP's tally shot up to 88 seats in 1989 and 119 in 1991. Opinion polls suggest that it would win 170 seats if a fresh election were held today. That is still far short of the 273 needed for a parliamentary majority. But the party's momentum could one day carry it into power.
Why has India changed so much? Why has militant Hinduism, which for so long evoked yawns and amused smiles, suddenly started looking like an idea whose time has come?
One reason is the rise, notably in the past ten years, of Sikh militancy in Punjab and Muslim militancy in Kashmir. Sikh secessionists have killed thousands of Hindus in Punjab and forced many more to flee. In Kashmir up to 200,000 Hindus have fled and some temples have been damaged. Hindus suddenly feel insecure, and are reacting as a community under attack. The BJP'S call to them to unite no longer looks irrelevant. In this new atmosphere, the party has been able to revive old memories of subjugation by Muslim invaders, and to seek symbolic revenge.
This explains the extraordinary passion raised over the nondescript mosque at Ayodhya, a north Indian town revered by Hindus as the legendary birthplace of Lord Pam. The mosque was built in the 16th century by the Mughal emperor Babar, possibly (historians disagree) after the demolition of a Hindu temple. In 1949 some Hindus smuggled idols of Ram into the mosque, and then claimed this as a miracle which proved the legend true. Outraged Muslims appealed to the courts, which have yet to give a verdict. Meanwhile, various militant Hindu groups claimed it was a matter of Hindu pride to demolish the mosque and build a Ram temple on the site. They also threatened to demolish 3,000 other mosques supposedly built by Muslim invaders on the sites of razed temples.
It took four decades for this issue to capture the Hindu imagination. The BJP, after repeated electoral defeats, had earlier felt that it must opt for moderation and woo non-communal Hindus. It climbed on to the Ayodhya bandwagon only in 1989. In the new ambiance, this proved to be a huge vote-winner. The BJP won control of the state government concerned, that of Uttar Pradesh, the heart of northern India.
The new BJP state government hoped to get hold of the (disused) mosque through legal devices, reserving the option of force for use if these failed. But the Hindu fanatics whom it encouraged to demonstrate at Ayodhya ran out of its control. Last December passions peaked, and a mob of fanatics attacked the mosque and demolished it.
The nation's prime minister, P.V. Narasimha Rao, reacted angrily, getting all BJP state governments (there were three others) dismissed, and promising to rebuild the mosque. But so wrong was the reaction among Uttar Pradesh Hindus that Congress politicians persuaded him to change course. It is now certain that the Ram idols will remain at the spot, and that the mosque will be rebuilt (if at all) some distance away.
THE DECAY OF POLITICAL MORALITY
The BJP'S harping on historical injustices could not have led to the Hindu upsurge but for another factor: the steady deterioration of political morality and governance since independence.
In 1947 Congress was a party of national ideals, exemplifying sacrifice and patriotism. So great was its moral authority that Nehru could, and did, with impunity assault traditional Hindu practices. He brought in the concept of equality regardless of race, religion, caste or sex. Hindu personal law, which denied women property rights, sanctioned dowry, permitted multiple marriages for men and forbade widow remarriage, was scrapped. Muslim personal law was left alone, a sore point with the BJP.
With each year that passed, however, Congress rule became more corrupt and less efficient. Political meddling and pay-offs sapped the morale and effectiveness of civil administration, the police and the courts. Goondas--hoodlums began to be used to organise votes, then to seize control of voting booths. Some later became full-time politicians. Criminals in turn financed politicians, then entered politics themselves, and no policeman dared arrest them. This criminalisation of politics gathered momentum in the 19805, to the disgust of voters. Congress is the greatest culprit, though others are not far behind.
The police, says one former member of the Police Commission, now have four unwritten priorities: first, to harass opposition politicians; second, to protect crooks in the ruling party; third, to stem terrorist activity and protect VIPS; last, to combat simple crime. No influential criminal need have much fear of arrest. Things are worst in Bihar, where government has largely collapsed and private armies rule the countryside. But in every city large areas are falling under criminal control. Riots--witness the recent ones in Bombay--are switched on at will. State authorities find it increasingly hard to put them down. Sometimes they do not dare, or even wish, to try.
The decay of Congress and of the state has led to cynicism and the gradual disappearance of national ideals and goals. In their place, parochial aims of every kind, regional, ethnic and religious, have reared their head. Their promoters often advocate violence, but are no longer viewed with distaste as lawbreakers. On the contrary, they appear to many as heroic rebels against an unjust state. And just as the fall of national parties has been accompanied by the rise of sectarian militancy in Kashmir and Punjab, so, inevitably, it has brought rising support for Hindu militancy too.
THANKS TO THE RSS
A third actor behind the Hindu upsurge has been the steady grassroots work done to organise Hindus since 1925 by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. Dedicated to reviving the primacy of Hindus, its founders lamented that their fellows had acquired the mentality of a conquered race, and were weakened by divisions of caste and region. While resenting Islam, the RSS wanted to emulate Islam's ability to end internal divisions and unite under a religion-inspired vision of a great historic role.
For the RSS there were two enemies: Muslims and secular, westernised Hindus. It disliked Gandhi's non-violence, which it saw as an alien, Christian concept. It preferred the old warrior tradition of striking down the enemy; it was an RSS man who murdered Gandhi. In its indoctrination classes it drilled volunteers in the use of the lathi, a long staff, an ancient Hindu weapon. Rejecting the old Hindu philosophical stress on individual self-realisation, the RSS emphasised mass organisation, education and social service. Its activists were among the first to start relief camps after every flood or cyclone.
The RSS saw itself as a cultural, not a political, body. But in due course it presented the BJP with a ready-made cadre of highly motivated volunteers. These have played a key role in the latest Hindu upsurge.
MISCONCEPTIONS
Since the world knows so little about the Hindu upsurge, it suffers from several misconceptions.
* One is that the problem in India is a Hindu-Muslim one. In fact it is an argument between secular and communal Hindus over the treatment of Muslims. The Muslims are far too few to prevent India becoming a Hindu theocracy, if it so chooses. But all the national parties except the BJP denounce the mixing of religion and politics. The main critics of Hindu militancy, measured in numbers, are secular Hindus, not Muslims. Even after Ayodhya, opinion polls suggest no national majority for the BJP. The lower castes remain suspicious of the party, which, for all its talk of a casteless society, is dominated by Brahmins.
* Second, that the Hindu upsurge is a form of fundamentalism aiming to take India back to the Middle Ages. Not so. Historically, a fundamentally Hindu India would have to be a pretty tolerant one. But anyway that is not the BJP'S aim. It wants to transform Hinduism from an amorphous collection of quarrelsome groups into an organised society fit for the 21st century a unified Hinduism such as has never existed.
* Third, that the Hindu upsurge could split India. It will certainly lead to bloodshed. But India has no big Muslim-majority region except the Kashmir valley. And the Sikh separatists in Punjab needed no Hindu provocation to set out on their campaign. The BJP holds that Hindu nationalism is the best glue to bind India together. Many fissures exist between different sorts of Hindus; witness the terrorism in Assam and Tripura, in the far east of the country, and inter-caste conflict everywhere.
* Fourth, that the BJP wants to usher in a Hindu theocracy. Far from it, says the party, theocracy makes no sense for a decentralised faith lacking authority and hierarchy. The BJP wants to use holy men for its own purposes, but not to share power with them. BJP leaders have always emphasised cultural unity rather than religious purity. They say Muslims should embrace Hindu culture, citing the example of Indonesia. That country was Hindu until nearly all of it was converted to Islam many centuries ago. But unlike Indian Muslims, those in Indonesia still embrace the legend of Ram as an intrinsic part of their culture.
The BJP has always claimed to be secular. It even has some token Muslims in party posts. It says that, if elected to national power, it would abolish the special status given to Kashmir in the constitution; decree a uniform personal law for all; and set up a human-rights commission. These, it says, are secular goals which would merely correct concessions made to Muslims.
THE ESSENCE OF BJP
None of this should conceal the truth about the BJP. Whatever the kernel of fact in what it says, the party is really looking for respectable reasons to communalise society. To attain ostensibly secular goals, it adopts vicious communal means. The BJP has blood on its hands, and has little compunction about bloodying them further. Its call for Hindu unity takes the form of a hate campaign against Muslims, which has over the years led to riots and murder. In seminars in Delhi, its top leaders talk sweet reason. In the districts, its cadres denounce Muslims as invaders and traitors who should go to Pakistan. Old RSS texts tell Muslims to accept Hindu culture or else face second-class citizenship, even disfranchisement. That is not the official BJP line, but that, at best, would be the result.
Critics of the BJP liken it to the Nazi party in Germany in the dying days of the Weimar republic. Like Hitler's crowd, it extols Aryan virtues, uses street bullies and spreads hate against a minority. The analogy has obvious holes. The Nazis did not have even token Jews in party posts. All Indian parties have used street mobs to promote their interests, not just the BIP. The Marxists hardly carry conviction as democrats; Congress is the party whose then leader, Indira Gandhi, imposed a bogus state of emergency in 1975-77 to prolong her own grip on power. It is not obvious that the democratic credentials of the BJP are worse.
Indeed, it likes to portray itself as the one party that has not been criminalised, and hence as representing good government. It wants to raise Hindu passions from time to time, yet genuinely fears an excess of violence, which would damage its claims and alienate the middle class.
Maybe, but the BJP is changing. Its hardliners feel that the moderates are too squeamish, and that militancy will pay bigger dividends than appealing to broader sentiments. Sundry militant groups are coming up headed by sadhus--Hindu holy men--neither understand nor care for the law or democracy. There is no guarantee that BJP moderates will be able to control these militants, any more than they could at Ayodhya.
THE ROOT OF THE TROUBLE
Do not, though, simply blame the BJP. It did not invent the Hindu upsurge. That upsurge is a cause for real concern. But what it feeds on is something still more worrying, the decay of the state. The recent Bombay riots show that armed squads of Hindu and Muslim goondas are increasingly flexing their muscles, while government stands by, a helpless spectator. Indian democracy has proved resilient--to outsiders astonishingly resilient--since 1947. But history has many examples of internal violence and collapsing government that ended in autocracy. Hindu militancy is a symptom of the state's dangerous sickness, not the sickness itself.","The world is familiar with militant Islam .

It says that , if elected to national power , it would abolish the special status given to Kashmir in the constitution ; decree a uniform personal law for all ; and set up a human - rights commission . These , it says , are secular goals which would merely correct concessions made to Muslims . 
 THE ESSENCE OF BJP 
 None of this should conceal the truth about the BJP . Whatever the kernel of fact in what it says , the party is really looking for respectable reasons to communalise society . To attain ostensibly secular goals , it adopts vicious communal means . The BJP has blood on its hands , and has little compunction about bloodying them further . Its call for Hindu unity takes the form of a hate campaign against Muslims , which has over the years led to riots and murder . In seminars in Delhi , its top leaders talk sweet reason . In the districts , its cadres denounce Muslims as invaders and traitors who should go to Pakistan . Old RSS texts tell Muslims to accept Hindu culture or else face second - class citizenship , even disfranchisement . That is not the official BJP line , but that , at best , would be the result . 
 Critics of the BJP liken it to the Nazi party in Germany in the dying days of the Weimar republic . Like Hitler 's crowd , it extols Aryan virtues , uses street bullies and spreads hate against a minority . The analogy has obvious holes . The Nazis did not have even token Jews in party posts . All Indian parties have used street mobs to promote their interests , not just the BIP . The Marxists hardly carry conviction as democrats ; Congress is the party whose then leader , Indira Gandhi , imposed a bogus state of emergency in 1975 - 77 to prolong her own grip on power . It is not obvious that the democratic credentials of the BJP are worse . 
 Indeed , it likes to portray itself as the one party that has not been criminalised , and hence as representing good government . It wants to raise Hindu passions from time to time , yet genuinely fears an excess of violence , which would damage its claims and alienate the middle class . 
 Maybe , but the BJP is changing . Its hardliners feel that the moderates are too squeamish , and that militancy will pay bigger dividends than appealing to broader sentiments . Sundry militant groups are coming up headed by sadhus -- Hindu holy men -- neither understand nor care for the law or democracy . There is no guarantee that BJP moderates will be able to control these militants , any more than they could at Ayodhya . 
 THE ROOT OF THE TROUBLE 
 Do not , though , simply blame the BJP . It did not invent the Hindu upsurge . That upsurge is a cause for real concern . But what it feeds on is something still more worrying , the decay of the state . The recent Bombay riots show that armed squads of Hindu and Muslim goondas are increasingly flexing their muscles , while government stands by , a helpless spectator . Indian democracy has proved resilient -- to outsiders astonishingly resilient -- since 1947 . But history has many examples of internal violence and collapsing government that ended in autocracy . Hindu militancy is a symptom of the state 's dangerous sickness , not the sickness itself .",750,India,A29-8245,IN TERM,True,"The nation 's prime minister , P.V. Narasimha Rao",2,True

This vote of confidence means, paradoxically, that the big loan India is negotiating from the IMF is likely to be lower.
India renegotiated its debt of 9 billion roubles during Boris Yeltsin's visit at the end of January. The former Soviet Union provided credits to India in roubles but took repayment in rupees at a floating exchange rate linked to a basket of hard currencies. This rate today is 500 times higher than the value of the crippled rouble. Unfair, said India. As a result of the renegotiation, India's repayments to the ex-Soviet Union have come down by $500m a year. This is not quite the bonanza it sounds. Such repayments go into an account used by Russia to buy only Indian goods. So smaller repayments to Russia mean fewer exports.
India's total foreign debt is around $75 billion. The renegotiation of the rouble debt is not dramatic enough to cause Moody's to upgrade India's credit rating. But it will offset some of the damage to India's reputation caused by recent religious riots.

Despite decades of failure, the country's bureaucrats, comfortable in their sinecures and pseudo-Marxist ideology, were in no hurry to change, and faced little pressure to do so. Only a fool, therefore, would have predicted that by March 1993 the government would have substantially liberalised foreign trade and the domestic economy. That the rupee would by then be fully convertible (the clearest open-for-business sign that any once-closed economy can display) was simply out of the question.
The unthinkable has happened. The budget announced by the government of Narasimha Rao on February 27th significantly extends the programme of economic reform that began, in the midst of economic crisis, during the summer of 1991. India's economy is to be further deregulated, its foreign trade subject to lower tariffs and fewer restrictions. And all receipts of foreign exchange from trade in goods and services may now be sold at the free-market rate: the convertible rupee, in other words, is a fact.
India faces daunting economic and political difficulties. But the government's new approach, which seems increasingly secure, has greatly improved the likelihood that the country can overcome them. An economy whose immense potential has been squandered for decades is at last on the move.
THE IMPOSSIBLE TAKES LONGER
When Mr Rao first embarked on his reforms, Indians and foreigners alike were startled--and rightly cautious. His policies, it was possible to argue, were merely a response to economic crisis. With a huge balance-of-payments deficit, and reserves of foreign exchange running out, the government had no choice in 1991 but to embark on a stabilisation programme endorsed by the International Monetary Fund. Once the crisis passed, this argument went, India would revert to its old ways. It was a plausible view, even though that first stage of reform went well beyond the narrow fiscal measures typically required by an IMF plan, and substantially liberalised the economy. Now, however, the immediate economic pressure is over. On top of that, fighting between Hindus and Muslims has, you might have thought, turned the political climate against economic reform. Thus equipped with two good excuses for backsliding, the government has chosen to press on.
The new budget offers an astute combination of measures to promote trade and attract votes (see page 33). Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, has cut many tariffs; that will make imported goods cheaper for consumers, which should win votes, and it will lower costs for producers, which will spur exports. He has offered a five-year tax holiday for new power projects, many of which have been proposed in recent months by foreign investors; more reliable supplies of electricity are one of India's most pressing needs. To offer further encouragement to foreign investment, Mr Singh has also cut the short-term capital-gains tax levied on foreigners' portfolio investments.
The changes in tariffs and excise duties are expected to reduce government revenues by roughly 45 billion rupees ($1-1/2 billion), a bigger cut than in any previous budget. At the same time Mr Singh announced increases in public investment in infrastructure, which India badly needs. To curb the effect of these measures on the budget deficit, which Mr Singh still expects to fall (from 5% of GDP in the current fiscal year to 4-1/2% in 1993-94), cheap government loans to public enterprises will be greatly reduced. Instead, the companies will be encouraged to tap the capital markets directly. If this becomes a programme of privatisation by stealth (as some ministers privately hope), so much the better.
Time will tell whether Mr Singh's fiscal sums add up. So far, they have. Over the past two years he has tightened fiscal policy sufficiently to reduce inflation from 17%, at its peak in the summer of 1991, to less than 7% now. Since Indians hate inflation, this success is a valuable political asset; the government will not wish to put it in danger. The greatest risks to the reforms are not in the failure of its macroeconomic strategy, but in its timidity over farming and the labour market, two of the most politically sensitive areas of economic policy.
One of the spurs for India's reforms is the extraordinary economic growth of China--a miracle that began with agricultural reforms and a breathless expansion in farm output. India needs to do the same, because rising farm incomes would win broader political support for the government's programme. Indian farming has lagged behind the rest of Asia. It is suffocated by massively distorted prices (which have the effect of reducing farmers' real incomes), by under-investment and by state-monopoly marketing boards which severely limit private trade. Courageous in so many areas, the government has not yet dared to liberalise agriculture.
The government has also failed to develop a policy towards unsuccessful firms. At a recent count, India had more than 250,000 ""sick enterprises"". Officially, these are forbidden to close; they are expected to carry on, making losses for ever at taxpayers' expense. India's reforms will work only if they promote a radical alteration in the economy's structure. If failed firms are kept going, this change cannot take place: the government, in effect, will be forbidding its reforms to succeed.
India has already changed more than any informed observer dared hope. So there is no need to assume that policies towards agriculture and sick enterprises are ""unreformable"". The point, rather, is that India's bold government cannot afford to relax. If it keeps up its good work, the Indian economy can astonish the world.","Two years ago India was one of the most mismanaged and inward - looking economies in the world -- and looked set to stay that way .

After 18 months of IMF-induced austerity and two months of Hindu-Muslim rioting, many a sceptic--Indian and foreigner alike--had begun to doubt the commitment of Narasimha Rao and his minority Congress party government to the cause of economic liberalism. Was India, they feared, about to revert to the old, corrupting patterns of state control?
How the doubters have been confounded. On February 27th Mr Rao's finance minister, Manmohan Singh, revealed a budget for the year beginning on April 1st that presses on with reform--but also cuts taxes, raises essential spending and yet slashes the budget deficit. Other finance ministers might say this is possible only through witchcraft or fraud. Mr Singh shows otherwise.
He has given away 45 billion rupees ($1.5 billion) in cuts in customs and excise duties, which will please buyers of almost everything from textiles and cosmetics to cars and televisions, and which will also help revive several recession-hit industries. He has cut the maximum customs duty from 110% to 80%, and the duty on most machinery from 55% to 35%. The list of goodies goes on: a five-year tax holiday for new power plants (which should help clinch more than $1 billion-worth of projects proposed by foreign investors in recent months); and a cut from 65% to 30% in the short-term capital-gains tax on foreign punters in India's stockmarkets.
Most important of all, Mr Singh has made the rupee fully convertible. This does away in one sweep with a host of distortions and regulations--proof enough of Mr Rao's determination to take on India's multifarious vested interests (although, witness the absence of an ""exit policy"" for surplus workers, not yet the unions).
That determination shown as long ago as Mr Singh's first budget in July 1991, is getting easier to maintain. Conventional wisdom in India had long held that accepting the conditions needed to get an IMF loan was political suicide because of the pain those conditions inflicted on the electorate. Sure enough, the first 18 months of reforms were marked by recession and cuts in social spending. Gloomy critics predicted that India, like Latin America, would lose a whole decade of development.
They will surely be wrong. Mr Singh's first two budgets were tough enough to restore macroeconomic balance. Inflation has fallen from a peak of 17% in August 1991 to an annual rate now of less than 7%. The government therefore feels it can cut taxes, to spur both consumer spending and fresh investment. Meanwhile, spending can be increased on anti-poverty programmes, health and education to refute the allegation that the burden of the reforms is being borne by the poor. Mr Singh proposes that public investment will go up by as much as 32%, with an emphasis on badly needed infrastructure.
But if taxes are cut and public investment is raised, how can the budget deficit be trimmed? Part of the answer is the spillover effect of spending cuts in Mr Singh's previous two budgets, but most of the answer is the slashing of cheap loans to government companies. These will now have to fend for themselves in the capital market. The best will find this an advantage, since they will not have to keep petitioning the finance ministry for cash; the worst are likely eventually to be wound up. In the process government spending can be shifted from public-sector manufacturing to social welfare, even as the budget deficit is reduced. This is not fiscal voodoo, just good economics.
Hence the parliamentary amazement as Mr Singh reeled off one tax cut after another. For decades, Indian politicians have been used to the idea that taxation is the appropriate way to finance new public investment, and voters have got used to the idea that every budget bring a fresh round of taxes. Most had assumed that IMF-induced austerity would mean more taxes than ever. When the finance minister proved the contrary, his party colleagues were jubilant and his opponents stunned.
Indeed, some opposition parties suspect that Mr Singh has produced a giveaway budget to prepare for an early general election. They are probably mistaken. The prime minister has no reason to risk a fresh federal election when he still has three years of office to go.
On the other hand, the budget may well mean early elections in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh, the four states that were run by the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata party until their governments were dismissed after a Hindu mob in December destroyed an ancient Muslim mosque in the northern Indian town of Ayodhya. Fresh state elections are due in June, but the government has the legal option of postponing them to December. Given the wave of Hindu feeling in support of the mosque's demolition, Mr Rao originally wanted to wait a full year to let passions cool before holding the elections. But with the budget currying popular favour, he might yet hold the state elections in June itself.
If so, the rain gods may be as persuasive as the finance minister. An excellent monsoon has sent the price of many foods plummeting, so why wait for the next monsoon, which could well turn out to be a vote-losing drought?
Whatever the timing, Congress will almost certainly lose in Uttar Pradesh, where the Ayodhya mosque once stood. Indeed, the BJP is likely to increase its majority there. However, the BJP looks weaker in the other three states, and might conceivably be beaten if Mr Rao can get his act together within his own party. A big if: the prime minister remains undecided between those in Congress who advocate tough secularism and those who want to steal the BJP's Hindu clothes. So he does nothing, either to rebuild the Ayodhya mosque or to set up a Hindu temple there on what is said to be Lord Ram's birthplace. Perhaps he is right. He believes that Hindus are fundamentally secular, and will eventually simmer down. To some this inaction looks masterly; others think it dangerous procrastination.
Either way, the BJP which is developing a taste for mob politics, is not going to sit idle while Congress reaps the reward of Mr Singh's budget. If early state elections are declared, it will try to inflame Hindu passions once more-and unless Mr Rao comes up with a better strategy than sitting tight, he could lose all four states. The budget and the fall in inflation have helped him, but there comes a point when not even good economics can save poor politics.","Good economics , it seems , can be good politics too . After 18 months of IMF - induced austerity and two months of Hindu - Muslim rioting , many a sceptic -- Indian and foreigner alike -- had begun to doubt the commitment of Narasimha Rao and Narasimha Rao's minority Congress party government to the cause of economic liberalism . Was India , they feared , about to revert to the old , corrupting patterns of state control ? 
 How the doubters have been confounded . On February 27th Narasimha Rao's finance minister , Manmohan Singh , revealed a budget for the year beginning on April 1st that presses on with reform -- but also cuts taxes , raises essential spending and yet slashes the budget deficit . Other finance ministers might say this is possible only through witchcraft or fraud . Mr Singh shows otherwise . 
 He has given away 45 billion rupees ( $ 1.5 billion ) in cuts in customs and excise duties , which will please buyers of almost everything from textiles and cosmetics to cars and televisions , and which will also help revive several recession - hit industries . He has cut the maximum customs duty from 110 % to 80 % , and the duty on most machinery from 55 % to 35 % . The list of goodies goes on : a five - year tax holiday for new power plants ( which should help clinch more than $ 1 billion - worth of projects proposed by foreign investors in recent months ) ; and a cut from 65 % to 30 % in the short - term capital - gains tax on foreign punters in India 's stockmarkets . 
 Most important of all , Mr Singh has made the rupee fully convertible . This does away in one sweep with a host of distortions and regulations -- proof enough of Narasimha Rao's determination to take on India 's multifarious vested interests ( although , witness the absence of an "" exit policy "" for surplus workers , not yet the unions ) . 
 That determination shown as long ago as Mr Singh 's first budget in July 1991 , is getting easier to maintain . Conventional wisdom in India had long held that accepting the conditions needed to get an IMF loan was political suicide because of the pain those conditions inflicted on the electorate . Sure enough , the first 18 months of reforms were marked by recession and cuts in social spending . Gloomy critics predicted that India , like Latin America , would lose a whole decade of development . 
 They will surely be wrong . Mr Singh 's first two budgets were tough enough to restore macroeconomic balance . Inflation has fallen from a peak of 17 % in August 1991 to an annual rate now of less than 7 % . The government therefore feels it can cut taxes , to spur both consumer spending and fresh investment . Meanwhile , spending can be increased on anti - poverty programmes , health and education to refute the allegation that the burden of the reforms is being borne by the poor . Mr Singh proposes that public investment will go up by as much as 32 % , with an emphasis on badly needed infrastructure . 
 But if taxes are cut and public investment is raised , how can the budget deficit be trimmed ? Part of the answer is the spillover effect of spending cuts in Mr Singh 's previous two budgets , but most of the answer is the slashing of cheap loans to government companies . These will now have to fend for themselves in the capital market . The best will find this an advantage , since they will not have to keep petitioning the finance ministry for cash ; the worst are likely eventually to be wound up . In the process government spending can be shifted from public - sector manufacturing to social welfare , even as the budget deficit is reduced . This is not fiscal voodoo , just good economics . 
 Hence the parliamentary amazement as Mr Singh reeled off one tax cut after another . For decades , Indian politicians have been used to the idea that taxation is the appropriate way to finance new public investment , and voters have got used to the idea that every budget bring a fresh round of taxes . Most had assumed that IMF - induced austerity would mean more taxes than ever . When the finance minister proved the contrary , his party colleagues were jubilant and his opponents stunned . 
 Indeed , some opposition parties suspect that Mr Singh has produced a giveaway budget to prepare for an early general election . They are probably mistaken . The prime minister has no reason to risk a fresh federal election when he still has three years of office to go . 
 On the other hand , the budget may well mean early elections in Uttar Pradesh , Madhya Pradesh , Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh , the four states that were run by the Hindu - nationalist Bharatiya Janata party until their governments were dismissed after a Hindu mob in December destroyed an ancient Muslim mosque in the northern Indian town of Ayodhya . Fresh state elections are due in June , but the government has the legal option of postponing them to December . Given the wave of Hindu feeling in support of the mosque 's demolition , Narasimha Rao originally wanted to wait a full year to let passions cool before holding the elections . But with the budget currying popular favour , Narasimha Rao might yet hold the state elections in June itself . 
 If so , the rain gods may be as persuasive as the finance minister . An excellent monsoon has sent the price of many foods plummeting , so why wait for the next monsoon , which could well turn out to be a vote - losing drought ? 
 Whatever the timing , Congress will almost certainly lose in Uttar Pradesh , where the Ayodhya mosque once stood . Indeed , the BJP is likely to increase its majority there . However , the BJP looks weaker in the other three states , and might conceivably be beaten if Narasimha Rao can get Narasimha Rao's act together within Narasimha Rao's own party . A big if : Narasimha Rao remains undecided between those in Congress who advocate tough secularism and those who want to steal the BJP 's Hindu clothes . So Narasimha Rao does nothing , either to rebuild the Ayodhya mosque or to set up a Hindu temple there on what is said to be Lord Ram 's birthplace . Perhaps Narasimha Rao is right . Narasimha Rao believes that Hindus are fundamentally secular , and will eventually simmer down . To some this inaction looks masterly ; others think it dangerous procrastination . 
 Either way , the BJP which is developing a taste for mob politics , is not going to sit idle while Congress reaps the reward of Mr Singh 's budget . If early state elections are declared , it will try to inflame Hindu passions once more - and unless Narasimha Rao comes up with a better strategy than sitting tight , Narasimha Rao could lose all four states . The budget and the fall in inflation have helped Narasimha Rao , but there comes a point when not even good economics can save poor politics .",750,India,A29-8245,IN TERM,True,Narasimha Rao,16,True

That is the slender hope for the people of Kashmir after three years of civil war between a myriad of separatist groups, their civilian sympathisers and 250,000 Indian security forces.
On March 19th a new governor, General K.V. Rao, was appointed Jammu & Kashmir, as the Indian state is known. That sent a mixed message to the people of the Kashmir valley. As governor of the state in 1989, he bears some responsibility for the drift towards Kashmiri militancy during that time. On the other hand, General Rao's background as a professional soldier should help instil more discipline among the security forces. An Asia Watch report last month on torture by the security forces has worried the government in Delhi. Restoring a modicum of faith among ordinary Kashmiris in the discipline of the Indian army--the reputation of the security forces is beyond redemption--is a prerequisite to the political life which, in principle, Delhi is now keen to restore to the valley.
To that end, Rajesh Pilot, India's internal-security minister, is aiming to bring Kashmir, in a favourite Indian phrase, ""back into the political mainstream"".

Mr Pilot's advisers have begun saying that the government is ""almost"" at a stage where it is willing to talk to almost anyone.

Most of them were released from jail only last year and have been ignored by the government ever since.
The government is also to give Kashmir aid worth about $283m. The state has got into debt through paying for the security forces. If properly used, the money should help to provide jobs for some of Kashmir's young men, many of whom took to the gun because of the lack of any other work.
But Mr Pilot's plan to talk to the alienated Kashmiris through the former chief minister, Farooq Abdullah--a Brighton-based doctor now on an extended visit to the state-cannot work. Despite his distinguished Kashmiri lineage, Mr Farooq is regarded as no more than Delhi's agent. Nor will anyone find it easy to talk to the militants. Although there is a widespread feeling in the valley that the armed insurgency cannot succeed, the separatist movement is too splintered to make it safe for any one group to be seen talking to the government.

Dissidents in the party had attacked the prime minister, P.V. Narasimha Rao, for failing to stop the rise of the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party. Mr Rao's economic liberalisation was also criticised and--a deeper thrust of the dagger--the dissidents called for a return of Jawaharlal Nehru's rule that no politician could occupy two posts at the same time. This was a barely veiled reference to Mr Rao, who is both party president and prime minister, a practice started by Indira Gandhi.
At first it seemed that the dissidents would et nowhere. Mr Rao commands a comfortable majority in all party forums. Then they received the support of Mr Arjun Singh, the employment minister, who is Mr Rao's chief rival in the party. He declared, ""Any office in a democratic set-up cannot be adorned. There has to be clear proof that the office is being used as an effective instrument to protect the interest of the country or the party.""
To accuse Mr Rao of being a mere adornment in at least one of his jobs was open revolt. His supporters demanded Mr Arjun Singh's expulsion. The party's top decision-making body, the Congress Working Committee, met for ten hours. Almost all members criticised Mr Arjun Singh for his divisive tactics at a time when the bomb blasts in Bombay and communal riots made it more important than ever to present a united face to the world. But he stuck to his political guns and the meeting ended with a compromise. Those wanting to expel Mr Arjun Singh were told to hold their fire, while the troublemaker agreed to issue a statement saying that his attack was not aimed at any individual--which no one believes.
Why has Mr Arjun Singh escaped so lightly? Mr Rao tries to co-opt rather than keel-haul his critics. Congress still regrets expelling Vishwanath Pratap Singh in 1989. He then formed the Janata Party and beat Congress in the general election that year. The Congress party now has 251 seats out of 536 in parliament, and has remained in power only with the support of minor parties. Expelling Mr Arjun Singh and his supporters would make the party's parliamentary position precarious.
Some of Mr Arjun Singh's supporters are urging him to form a separate party anyway. But if he and his supporters split away from Congress, they will lose their seats in parliament under the anti-defection law. It seems more likely, therefore, that Mr Singh will bide his time and strike only if events weaken Mr Rao.
In recent weeks, two incidents have been unhelpful to the prime minister. First, it came to light that one of his sons was a director of a company that had obtained a loan of 20m rupees ($640,000) from a stock.. broker indicted last year. Mr Rao denies that his son knew of the loan, or that any favours were given to the stockbroker. Secondly, a court has ordered Mr Rao's land owning family to hand over 33 hectares (83 acres) deemed to be above the amount allowed under law.
However, these are not issues that will determine Mr Rao's political future. The central question is whether he will be able to defeat the Bharatiya National Party in at least some of the four states that are due to hold elections this year. If he loses all four, Mr Arjun Singh will rejoin the battle.","The ruling Congress party in India seemed about to split on March 22nd but then , characteristically , pulled back . Dissidents in the party had attacked Narasimha Rao , for failing to stop the rise of the Hindu - nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party . Narasimha Rao's economic liberalisation was also criticised and -- a deeper thrust of the dagger -- the dissidents called for a return of Jawaharlal Nehru 's rule that no politician could occupy two posts at the same time . This was a barely veiled reference to Mr Rao , who is both party president and prime minister , a practice started by Indira Gandhi . 
 At first it seemed that the dissidents would et nowhere . Narasimha Rao commands a comfortable majority in all party forums . Then they received the support of Mr Arjun Singh , the employment minister , who is Narasimha Rao's chief rival in the party . He declared , "" Any office in a democratic set - up can not be adorned . There has to be clear proof that the office is being used as an effective instrument to protect the interest of the country or the party . "" 
 To accuse Narasimha Rao of being a mere adornment in at least one of Narasimha Rao's jobs was open revolt . Narasimha Rao's supporters demanded Mr Arjun Singh 's expulsion . The party 's top decision - making body , the Congress Working Committee , met for ten hours . Almost all members criticised Mr Arjun Singh for his divisive tactics at a time when the bomb blasts in Bombay and communal riots made it more important than ever to present a united face to the world . But he stuck to his political guns and the meeting ended with a compromise . Those wanting to expel Mr Arjun Singh were told to hold their fire , while the troublemaker agreed to issue a statement saying that his attack was not aimed at any individual -- which no one believes . 
 Why has Mr Arjun Singh escaped so lightly ? Narasimha Rao tries to co - opt rather than keel - haul Narasimha Rao's critics . Congress still regrets expelling Vishwanath Pratap Singh in 1989 . He then formed the Janata Party and beat Congress in the general election that year . The Congress party now has 251 seats out of 536 in parliament , and has remained in power only with the support of minor parties . Expelling Mr Arjun Singh and his supporters would make the party 's parliamentary position precarious . 
 Some of Mr Arjun Singh 's supporters are urging him to form a separate party anyway . But if he and his supporters split away from Congress , they will lose their seats in parliament under the anti - defection law . It seems more likely , therefore , that Mr Singh will bide his time and strike only if events weaken Narasimha Rao . 
 In recent weeks , two incidents have been unhelpful to Narasimha Rao . First , it came to light that one of Narasimha Rao's sons was a director of a company that had obtained a loan of 20 m rupees ( $ 640,000 ) from a stock .. broker indicted last year . Narasimha Rao denies that Narasimha Rao's son knew of the loan , or that any favours were given to the stockbroker . Secondly , a court has ordered Narasimha Rao's land owning family to hand over 33 hectares ( 83 acres ) deemed to be above the amount allowed under law . 
 However , these are not issues that will determine Narasimha Rao's political future . The central question is whether Narasimha Rao will be able to defeat the Bharatiya National Party in at least some of the four states that are due to hold elections this year . If Narasimha Rao loses all four , Mr Arjun Singh will rejoin the battle .",750,India,A29-8245,IN TERM,True,"the prime minister , P.V. Narasimha Rao",18,True

India's Bharatiya Janata Party, the main parliamentary opposition to the Congress Party government of P.V. Narasimha Rao, has risen near the top of Indian politics by pushing a militant Hindu-nationalist line. In December the militancy got out of hand. Demonstrations led by the BJP at Ayodhya, a town in northern India that some Hindus celebrate as the birthplace of their god, Ram, were hijacked by a Hindu mob that then demolished a disused mosque there. Some 1,200 people died in the Hindu-Muslim riots that followed.
This spring the BJP is trying to portray itself differently. Never before interested in the nuts and bolts of public policy, the BJP has set up study groups to define the party's position on such communally uncharged questions as water supply and the (for Hindus, low-caste) leather trade. At the annual meeting of the Confederation of Indian Industry in April, L.K. Advani, a BJP bigwig who is the prime minister presumptive should the party come to power, gave a speech in which he flayed Mr Rao's government for not moving fast enough on economic reform. The BJP is the true believer in liberalisation, Mr Advani claimed.
There is less here than meets the eye. The BJP knows that it is still unfit to govern. The party has been the spearhead of what is essentially a protest movement against more than 40 years of mostly uninterrupted Congress domination of Indian politics. The spearhead is dangerous because it has been dipped into the poison of communal rivalry between the 80%-plus of India that is Hindu and the 11% that is Muslim. Both the Congress Party and India's constitution have kept the rivalry in check by standing firmly for a secular India in which the state is impartial between religions.
But Congress is in deep disrepute in India. The past two years of economic reform have won Mr Rao and his finance minister, Manmohan Singh, much praise from foreigners and from Indian businessmen. And the policy is bearing fruit: India's economy will probably expand by more than 5% this year and inflation is down to 7%. Yet Congress seems to be getting little thanks for this from the voters.
Politics-watchers guess that, had Rajiv Gandhi not been assassinated at the end of the general-election campaign two years ago, the BJP would have won roughly as many seats as Congress. The ruling party may be in a worse state now. Opinion polls suggest that Congress is just ahead of the BJP but allegations of corruption, nepotism and incompetence in the Rao government are rowing. Indian journalists are busily burrowing into the business affairs of the prime minister's family, and there are signs they might find something embarrassing. The terrorist bombs and politically linked gang violence in Bombay in March have made Congress seem incapable of preserving law and order.
All of which explains why the BJP is scrambling to make itself presentable as a possible government. Elections have to be held this autumn in several states whose BJP-led governments were dismissed by the central government after the Ayodhya riots. If the BJP does well, the pressure for an early general election will become intense.
The party aims to win by portraying itself as a pro-free-market, pro-Hindu and anti-corruption alternative to Congress. The soothing message Mr Advani presents to India's industrialists is one aspect of this campaign. But the mood of the BJP's national executive meeting, held in Calcutta in April, showed a different side. The meeting was inflamed with Hindu-nationalist emotion.
The party clearly intends to take its next populist stand on the issue of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants in India (of whom, after 20 years, there may now be more than 10m). Of course, there are immigrants and immigrants. A BJP vice-president said India had a ""historical responsibility"" to welcome Bangladeshi Hindus, whereas ""some of the Muslim migrants are part of the larger design of Bangladesh against India's stability"". The resolution passed by the executive called for the immediate expulsion of illegal Banladeshi Muslims.
The party has been remarkably successful at convincing many urban Hindu intellectuals and professionals that the real BJP is the reasonable-sounding one that praises economic liberalisation and is beginning to draft policy position-papers.

A court has ended the ban on the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), one of a number of militant groups outlawed by the Indian government after the riot in Ayodhya on December 6th, in which a mosque was destroyed and 1,200 people died. The RSS's leaders form the core of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the main threat to the ruling Congress party.
The ban on the militants was imposed in a hurry without paying heed to legal niceties, and insufficient hard evidence was presented to support the government's case that the RSS had advocated violence. But it is also true that judges tend to move with the times. They may be reflecting the changes in society that have led to the popularity of the BJP. Even as the ban on the RSS was lifted by the High Court in Uttar Pradesh, another court upheld the ban on its Muslim equivalent, the Islamic Sevak Sangh.
At the time of the ban on the RSS, the prime minister, P.V. Narasimha Rao, sacked the state governments of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, all ruled by the BJP, saying they could not be trusted to implement the ban. The BJP has demanded the restoration of the four governments. Mr Rao plans instead to hold fresh state elections in December, and hopes to wrest at least one of the four states from the BJP.
He may be excessively optimistic. The bomb blasts in Bombay in March, blamed on Islamic terrorists, have fuelled Hindu fears and BJP hopes. In the past fortnight a BJP politician and one belonging to the Shiv Sena, a militant Hindu party, have been shot dead, possibly by terrorists.
The Congress party has traditionally won most of the Muslim vote, but, frightened by the BJP's success, it is now playing to the Hindus. Mr Rao had promised to rebuild the Ayodhya mosque and build a Ram temple nearby. But Uttar Pradesh, where Ayodhya is sited, is India's largest state, and the movement for replacing the mosque with a temple is popular. Mr Rao has put to one side the rebuilding of the mosque, and is seeking support from Hindu holy men to build the temple.
One of Mr Rao's cronies is a guru called Chandra Swami, whose disciples have included an arms dealer, Adnan Khashoggi, an actress, Elizabeth Taylor, and a ruler, the Sultan of Brunei. On June 6th and 7th, Chandra Swami held a Hindu ceremony at Ayodhya on a barely disguised pro-Congress platform. He forecast attendance of 300,000, but only 2,500 came, dwindling to 300 by the end. However, Mr Rao has demonstrated that not all Hindu holy men are behind the BJP.
Mr Rao expects to keep the votes of the Muslims, assuming that they have nobody else to turn to. But he may lose Muslims without winning over BJP supporters.

The growth of the 1980s was financed by a borrowing spree which led to a huge increase in foreign debt and record budget deficits. The party came to an end in 1990-91 when high oil prices and capital flight emptied India's foreign-exchange reserves. The prime minister, Narasimha Rao, aided by his finance minister, Manmohan Sinh, used devaluation and deflation to avoid defaulting on the foreign debt. This austerity programme was combined with reforms to open up the economy. The combination is beginning to work.
Since Mr Rao came to power in June 1991, the budget deficit has shrunk from 8.3% of GDP to a projected 4.7% this year. This, along with a good monsoon, has helped bring the inflation rate down from a peak of almost 17% in August 1991 to just 6.1%. New outward-looking policies have attracted foreign-investment proposals worth $2.2 billion, a rivulet compared with the $4.4 billion China achieved in 1991, but a flood compared with the $150m a year that, on average, India attracted in the 1980s. GDP growth rose from 1.2% in 1991-92 to a respectable 4.2% in 1992-93. Industrial growth recovered modestly to 2.9% in 1992-93, and is expected to touch 6% this year.
In this year's budget, customs duties were cut by $1.5 billion to revive the economy, though the IMF complained about the likely effect on the budget deficit. Exports grew by a depressing 3.6% last year, mainly because of the collapse of trade with the former Soviet Union. But after Mr Singh made the rupee convertible for settling trade accounts, exports soared (by 28.9% in April, producing an unexpected surplus).
Mr Rao has abolished industrial licensing for all but 15 industries, and pruned the list of industries reserved for the public sector from 17 to six. Quotas have been abolished on all imports save consumer goods, and the maximum import duty has been slashed from over 200% to 85%. The rupee has become convertible for trade, though not for capital transactions. Foreign institutional investors have been allowed to invest in the stockmarkets. Subsidies to the public sector have been slashed, and up to 20% of the shares of several government companies have been sold to private investors, bringing in nearly $2 billion.
By India's slow standards, that adds up to a revolution. But by the standards of South-East Asia, it leaves a lot of unfinished business. Red tape is still a problem in the lower levels of the bureaucracy, as also in state governments. Though it is now much easier to put up a factory, it remains hard to close one: laws prohibit retrenchment or closure without state government permission, which is rarely given. The result is that companies often walk away from loss-making plants. Political pressures for raising subsidies remain strong, and the government has partially restored subsidies on phosphate fertilisers that were abolished less than a year ago.
Yet the achievement is impressive, and recovery appears swift. Few countries have seen such happy results from an IMF-supervised reform programme so quickly. Yet Mr Rao cannot expect much gratitude from the voters. Many are inclined to blame him, rather than the binge of the 1980s, for the squeeze of the 1990s. Most voters regard politicians of all parties as liars and scoundrels, and are sceptical both of Congress-party claims that the reforms will lead to paradise and of opposition claims that they will lead to hell.
Besides, Indian politics today is dominated by issues of religion, caste and region. These move people to riot and kill, whereas economic pronouncements make them yawn. Yet the concentration on religion and caste may have helped the economic reformers: they have persuaded Mr Rao that he cannot beat the Bharatiya Janata Party at the religious game, and must therefore excel at the economic one before the next election. Riots have also preoccupied everybody, so left-wing criticism of the reforms has been drowned in the clamour for blood.
On the other hand, religious strife has periodically paralysed economic activity in several states, Frightened foreign investors and reduced tax revenue. It leads to constant speculation about the stability of Mr Rao's government. Despite India's notable economic recovery, international rating agencies like Moody's and Standard and Poor's have yet to increase the credit rating of Indian debt to investment grade, largely because of all the uncertainty on the political front.
This uncertainty has been worsened by the claim of Harshad Mehta, a stockbroker who faces charges arising from the $1.6 billion bank-securities racket of 1992, that he gave 10m rupees ($390,000) in cash to Mr Rao at his residence on November 4th 1991 to gain political patronage. Mr Rao has denied taking the money, and says he was at his office at the time Mr Mehta claims to have made the payment. The ruling party's reputation is so bad that many are more inclined to believe Mr Mehta than the prime minister. Adding to the government's troubles is Mr Mehta's lawyer, Ram Jethmalani: he is a formidable combatant who threw mud at Rajiv Gandhi over the scandal surrounding dealings with Bofors, a Swedish arms company, that helped lose the government the 1989 election. Opposition parties hope that history will now repeat itself.","In 1988 Indian economic growth hit 10 % a year . Now it is running at under 5 % . Beneath these misleading figures lies an impressive story of economic management . 
 The growth of the 1980s was financed by a borrowing spree which led to a huge increase in foreign debt and record budget deficits . The party came to an end in 1990 - 91 when high oil prices and capital flight emptied India 's foreign - exchange reserves . Narasimha Rao , aided by Narasimha Rao's finance minister , Manmohan Sinh , used devaluation and deflation to avoid defaulting on the foreign debt . This austerity programme was combined with reforms to open up the economy . The combination is beginning to work . 
 Since Narasimha Rao came to power in June 1991 , the budget deficit has shrunk from 8.3 % of GDP to a projected 4.7 % this year . This , along with a good monsoon , has helped bring the inflation rate down from a peak of almost 17 % in August 1991 to just 6.1 % . New outward - looking policies have attracted foreign - investment proposals worth $ 2.2 billion , a rivulet compared with the $ 4.4 billion China achieved in 1991 , but a flood compared with the $ 150 m a year that , on average , India attracted in the 1980s . GDP growth rose from 1.2 % in 1991 - 92 to a respectable 4.2 % in 1992 - 93 . Industrial growth recovered modestly to 2.9 % in 1992 - 93 , and is expected to touch 6 % this year . 
 In this year 's budget , customs duties were cut by $ 1.5 billion to revive the economy , though the IMF complained about the likely effect on the budget deficit . Exports grew by a depressing 3.6 % last year , mainly because of the collapse of trade with the former Soviet Union . But after Mr Singh made the rupee convertible for settling trade accounts , exports soared ( by 28.9 % in April , producing an unexpected surplus ) .

For two weeks India has been preoccupied by the claims of Harshad Mehta, a stockbroker charged with involvement in a $1.6 billion bank-securities racket, that he gave 10m rupees ($390,000) in cash to the prime minister, P.V. Narasimha Rao, in November 1991. Mr Rao denies it. A parliamentary committee which questioned Mr Mehta on June 30th divided along party lines on the question of whether or not it should require Mr Rao to answer the charges. The public seems just as doubtful of Mr Rao's word: a recent poll showed that 43% believed what Mr Mehta said.
Why, foreigners ask, do so many Indians treat this allegation as seriously as the prime minister's denials? One reason is that they believe that all politicians, and notably those of the ruling Congress party, are corrupt. Politicians of all parties have destroyed the integrity of the police in order to protect their own tribe, and the lethargic, corrupt courts take up to a decade to deliver verdicts. So, in the court of public opinion, politicians accused of corruption are guilty until proved otherwise. In passing sentence, people ask only for plausibility, not proof beyond reasonable doubt.
Mr Mehta says that his meeting with Mr Rao in 1991 was arranged by a businessman,' Sunil Mittal, whose father was a Congress member of Parliament. Mr Mittal has denied the story. But on June 28th Mr Mehta released a tape-recording of what he says is a telephone conversation with Mr Mittal, which made reference to the meeting and the handing over of the cash. Mr Mehta also says that he told the police long ago that he had made political pay-offs; but that the police withheld the information from a parliamentary committee investigating the bank racket.
Mr Rao has denied taking any money from Mr Mehta. According to the government, the prime minister's office records show that when Mr Mehta claims to have handed the money over at Mr Rao's residence, Mr Rao was meeting a Pakistani delegation at his office and later met the former governor of Kashmir. One of the Pakistanis says he met Mr Rao around the time that the government claims. However, the former governor of Kashmir denies having met Mr Rao, and says his signature was forged. And there are discrepancies between the hand-written police logs and the computer print-out put out by the government.
The Congress party has rallied round Mr Rao, who, on the basis of the current evidence, looks in no immediate danger. The main threat to him within the party, Arjun Sinh, is tainted by earlier scandals, and can hardly pose as a moral alternative. But if Mr Mehta can produce harder evidence, a time may come when Mr Rao is seen as a liability to the party.
Cynics say that Mr Mehta will never be able to prove anything conclusively, and that in a country bedeviled by riots and other agitations, voters will forget about Mr Mehta's story long before the next general election, due in 1996. However, Mr Rao's reputation has been dented, and he has been weakened politically. He may feel less confident about taking on the trade unions and farmers and other powerful groups that must be tackled if his economic reforms are to be taken to their conclusion.
The prime minister's discomfiture has been compounded by a joint parliamentary committee finding a possible link between his son and the bank racket. One of the brokers involved in the racket lent 20m rupees to a company of which Mr Rao's son is a director. There is no proof that Mr Rao benefited from the loan or had any direct interest in the company.

Narasimha Rao has proved his success; but the Indian prime minister's cumulative political failures are threatening his future. The latest opinion poll shows that, if an election were held now, his Congress party would et only 198 seats out of 542. In June 1991 he won 231 seats. Murmuring has begun in the party that unless Mr Rao, who is now halfway through his five-year term, sharpens up his political skills it might be advisable to replace him before the next election, which is due in 1996.
The first complaint against Mr Rao is that he has failed to combat the militant Hinduism of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). When it proposed a big rally at the disputed mosque in Ayodhya last December, many of Mr Rao's colleagues pleaded with him to stop it taking place. But Mr Rao trusted the state government, ruled by the BJP to keep order, a trust that turned out to be woefully misplaced when a Hindu mob demolished the mosque. This vandalism shocked secular Indians, but sent the stock of the BJP soaring in northern India.
Since independence, the Congress party has stood for secularism, and thus appealed to Muslims. After Ayodhya, many in Congress wanted Mr Rao to take a tough secular line and rebuild the mosque. Instead, he is aiming to win back the communal Hindu vote even at the cost of secular support. He has set up a government trust to build a temple at Ayodhya, because he wants to deprive a rival BJP trust of the credit for the job. He has formed a cynical alliance with the Shiv Sena, a militant Hindu party strong in western India which was responsible for arson and murders in Bombay in January. He hopes thus to deprive the BJP of Hindu support in western India.
This tactic looks as though it may have lost him Muslim votes without winning him Hindu ones. The latest opinion poll shows the BJP taking 166 seats in a snap election. In 1991 it won 119 seats.
The second complaint concerns corruption. Mr Rao's earlier reputation as a clean leader of a corrupt party suffered when a stockbroker accused of being involved in a securities racket claimed to have paid the prime minister 10m rupees ($390,000). He has denied taking the money, but has had trouble persuading the voters of his innocence; corruption is so common in Politics that they are cynical.
The third grouse is that he dithers. This failing is said to extend even to making cabinet appointments: more than a dozen places remain unfilled. To be fair, when Mr Rao became prime minister he was hailed as a man of consensus. It is hard to be con: sensual and decisive at the same time; and the results of his attempts to appeal to a broad range of views are visible in his parliamentary strength, which he has built up from 231 to 257 by attracting defectors from minor parties.
In some areas he has certainly not dithered. He has broken with decades of tradition and established full diplomatic relations with Israel. He is transforming India from an inward-looking government-dominated country to an outward-looking market-friendly one. The economic programme has been executed by his finance minister, Manmohan Sinh, but without Mr Rao's support he would not have got far.
However, macroeconomic success does not automatically translate into votes. Austerity has helped to cut inflation from 17% in August 1991 to 5.8% now. Capital flight has ended and, despite a liberalisation of imports, the trade gap has almost vanished. But austerity has also meant slow economic growth and recession in several industries. The voters are sour.
If the economic reforms stay on course, incomes and employment should take off in the next two years. But if Mr Rao continues to mishandle the politics, somebody else may get the reward.","As an economic manager , Narasimha Rao has proved Narasimha Rao's success ; but Narasimha Rao's cumulative political failures are threatening Narasimha Rao's future .

In the past, these encounters have been rare--only three between 1954 and 1992--and forgettable. But on September 6th P.V. Narasimha Rao, India's prime minister, bean a four-day visit to China that might actually turn out to have accomplished something. It certainly went to show how much the end of the cold war has changed the calculations of Asia's two biggest powers.
A fair amount of tension between these continent-sized neighbours is inevitable. In 1962 China won a brief war, killing 40,000 Indian soldiers in the process. China claims most of India's eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh; and, in the north, India claims a territory called Aksai Chin that China captured in 1962 and incorporated in its Xinjian region, next to Kashmir (see map). Not counting reserve troops, India has around 150,000 men camped on the Chinese border, mostly in the east. The Indians claim that China deploys twice as many in Tibet alone.
Talks to settle the dispute have been held sporadically since 1981. They produced nothing until this week, when the two sides signed an agreement ""to maintain peace and tranquility"" along the border. Further talks are to be held on troop reductions and on a final demarcation of the border. The two sides agreed to respect the ""line of actual control""--the status quo-pending a definitive border settlement. This was a clear signal that such a settlement is likely to leave the disputed territories in the hands they have been in since 1962.
Why, after 12 years of failure, does this simple solution seem so near? Mostly because, with the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the old balance-of-power game between India and China lost its logic.
In the 1970s and the pre-Gorbachev 1980S, a tidy set of alliances in the middle of Asia reflected the giants' security preoccupations. China, fearful above all of the Soviet Union. informally teamed up with America against the Russians, helped out Pakistan, America's stout friend in Central Asia, and jostled the Indians. India, for its part, was intent on securing an overwhelming advantage against Pakistan, with which it has one to war three times since 1947. The Indians built close military links with the Soviet Union; supported the Soviet-backed government of Afghanistan, which Pakistan and America were undermining; and sparred with China.
The end of the cold war has not turned India and China into natural allies, but it has shown them that their common interests are likely to outweigh their differences over the next decade. Like most Asians, Indians fret about the security implications of a rich and powerful China in the next century. For now, however, China has been telling everyone that it wants peace abroad so that it can concentrate on economic development at home.
Now that India, too, has started down the road of economic liberalisation, its agenda is similar to China's: economic growth, and foreign trade and investment are at the top. Thoughtful Indians are fairly relaxed about their country's military balance with Pakistan, whose army they reckon could be seen off quickly in a conventional war. Even China's sale of M-11 ballistic-missile technology to Pakistan, which so exercised the Americans that they imposed trade sanctions on the buyer and seller last month, seems to worry India (the presumed target of such missiles) less.
With security questions no loner paramount, China and India have a lot to offer one another. Almost uniquely in Asia, India's defence budget is being reduced in real terms. The 1.2m-strong Indian armed forces are to be squeezed to produce a higher-tech and lower-manned force; detente with China will make the transition easier. Much of both countries' weaponry is of Russian origin or design. Some sharing of spare parts and technology could make sense.
In purely economic terms, China and India can complement each other even as they compete for foreign investment. Some sharing of agricultural technology has begun, and India is already sampling Chinese smelting and diesel-engine technology. For this to make headway, both sides will have to make some political concessions. India, which plays host to the Dalai Lama and 100,000 Tibetans, is likely to press him and them to consider China's point of view more sympathetically. China is likely to become less friendly to Pakistan.
Among the third parties affected by all this, Pakistan may feel the most disquiet. In the absence of American military aid, cut off because of America's worries about Pakistan's nuclear ambitions, Pakistan depends primarily on China for its defence needs. Apart from the M-11S and nuclear know-how, the Chinese have supplied Pakistan with dozens of fighter aircraft and are helping it to build tanks. Pakistani officials try to reassure themselves that China will continue to want to expand its regional influence, and so is not going to junk Pakistan.
The American angle on any Chinese-Indian warming is the most interesting one. Relations between China and the United States are worsening by the week. Last month's M-11 sanctions (which America is hoping to back away from) have been followed by a fight this month over China's quota for textile exports. In Beijing this week the Chinese prime minister, Li Peng, fulminated to Mr Rao about American ""hegemonism and power politics"". The Chinese delighted in rubbing in the failure of an independent inspection by Saudi Arabia to find any trace of illicit chemicals for use in weapons on board a Chinese ship that America had stopped in the Gulf on her way to Iran.
India does not air its quarrels with the United States so publicly, but it is angry that America recently blocked its purchase of Russian rocket enginesmerely for a commercial satellite launcher, India says--on non-proliferation grounds. It would be interesting to know if anyone in the Clinton administration, which has yet to appoint ambassadors to China or India, is thinking about what this new-found friendship might mean.","Talk about a summit : when they meet , China 's and India 's leaders between them speak for two - fifths of the world 's people ( and much of the world 's real summit , the Himalayas ) .

 The end of the cold war has not turned India and China into natural allies , but it has shown them that their common interests are likely to outweigh their differences over the next decade . Like most Asians , Indians fret about the security implications of a rich and powerful China in the next century . For now , however , China has been telling everyone that it wants peace abroad so that it can concentrate on economic development at home . 
 Now that India , too , has started down the road of economic liberalisation , its agenda is similar to China 's : economic growth , and foreign trade and investment are at the top . Thoughtful Indians are fairly relaxed about their country 's military balance with Pakistan , whose army they reckon could be seen off quickly in a conventional war . Even China 's sale of M-11 ballistic - missile technology to Pakistan , which so exercised the Americans that they imposed trade sanctions on the buyer and seller last month , seems to worry India ( the presumed target of such missiles ) less . 
 With security questions no loner paramount , China and India have a lot to offer one another . Almost uniquely in Asia , India 's defence budget is being reduced in real terms . The 1.2m - strong Indian armed forces are to be squeezed to produce a higher - tech and lower - manned force ; detente with China will make the transition easier . Much of both countries ' weaponry is of Russian origin or design . Some sharing of spare parts and technology could make sense . 
 In purely economic terms , China and India can complement each other even as they compete for foreign investment . Some sharing of agricultural technology has begun , and India is already sampling Chinese smelting and diesel - engine technology . For this to make headway , both sides will have to make some political concessions . India , which plays host to the Dalai Lama and 100,000 Tibetans , is likely to press him and them to consider China 's point of view more sympathetically . China is likely to become less friendly to Pakistan . 
 Among the third parties affected by all this , Pakistan may feel the most disquiet . In the absence of American military aid , cut off because of America 's worries about Pakistan 's nuclear ambitions , Pakistan depends primarily on China for its defence needs . Apart from the M-11S and nuclear know - how , the Chinese have supplied Pakistan with dozens of fighter aircraft and are helping it to build tanks . Pakistani officials try to reassure themselves that China will continue to want to expand its regional influence , and so is not going to junk Pakistan . 
 The American angle on any Chinese - Indian warming is the most interesting one . Relations between China and the United States are worsening by the week . Last month 's M-11 sanctions ( which America is hoping to back away from ) have been followed by a fight this month over China 's quota for textile exports . In Beijing this week the Chinese prime minister , Li Peng , fulminated to Narasimha Rao about American "" hegemonism and power politics "" . The Chinese delighted in rubbing in the failure of an independent inspection by Saudi Arabia to find any trace of illicit chemicals for use in weapons on board a Chinese ship that America had stopped in the Gulf on her way to Iran . 
 India does not air its quarrels with the United States so publicly , but it is angry that America recently blocked its purchase of Russian rocket enginesmerely for a commercial satellite launcher , India says -- on non - proliferation grounds . It would be interesting to know if anyone in the Clinton administration , which has yet to appoint ambassadors to China or India , is thinking about what this new - found friendship might mean .",750,India,A29-8245,IN TERM,True,Mr Rao,2,True

But infuriated Muslims are not willing to be bought in this way.

""We have proved"", he said, ""that by following Gandhi's method of concerted, non-violent people's action, it is possible to defeat the combined power of the multinationals and the government.""
Mr Fernandes is an embarrassment to the Indian government, but he is not alone in his views. Economic isolationism, one of the cornerstones of India's post-independence economic policy, is enjoying a revival as opposition to the two-year-old liberalisation policy grows.
The reforms, which started in July 1991, have achieved much and left much undone. The industrial licensing system has been largely unwound; foreign companies can invest freely; the rupee is now partially convertible; previously controlled prices have been freed; the budget deficit is lower. But privatisation has barely started; the banks remain nationalised and inefficient; tariffs, although lower than they were, remain high (up to 110%); laws still prevent companies from redeploying or sacking workers, and from closing factories.
Since February's budget, no significant new measures have been put in place. That may be because the government has some tough state elections coming up in November, and is sitting tight until then. But the opposition to reform will not evaporate even when those elections are out of the way.
Gloomy economic conditions help explain the rowing anti-reform sentiment. The economy grew at around 4% in 1992-93, but most observers think it is unlikely to grow by much more than 3% in 1993-94. Most of that will be thanks to a good monsoon: industry is stagnant.
So liberalisation has not delivered the instant rewards that some impatient Indians were expecting. At the same time, the rise in foreign-exchange reserves, now standing at more than $6 billion, has eased the balance-of-payments pressure that first drove the prime minister, P.V. Narasimha Rao, to the IMF and reform.
Having pushed through the easier bits of reform, the government is finding it difficult to drive the programme home. Mr Rao's vulnerability is a problem. His government has been shaken by financial scandal. There are fears for his political future if the main opposition group, the Bharatiya Janata Party, sweeps the November state-government elections. His weakness encourages the opposition to snap at his heels.
The BJP now determines the political agenda in India. Its success is built on the conflict between Hindus and Muslims that culminated in the destruction of a mosque at Ayodhya, in Uttar Pradesh, last December. But the public appears to be tiring of the Ayodhya issue, and the BJP is scratching around for something else to talk about.
That is where economic isolationism comes in. The BJP has revived the call for swadeshi, one of Mahatma Gandhi's most powerful slogans, which he translated as ""the use of all home-made things to the exclusion of foreign things"". Its anti-foreigner slant fits neatly with the BJP nationalism, and appeals to the strong residual sense among Indians that self-sufficiency is best. Awkwardly, the BJPS main backing comes from the commercial middle classes, where support for both domestic and external liberalisation is strongest. L.K. Advani, the party's leader, is not a notable supporter of the swadeshi movement, and was absent from a pro-swadeshi rally organised last month by the BJP'S hard core.
But the movement has won support from others--not just left-wing politicians, but also from some businessmen. Foreign goods have been beginning to make holes in previously captive markets, and foreign investment has been starting to oust Indians from control of local companies. Unilever's local subsidiary has bought Tata Oil Mills, a detergents-and-soaps company from an old business house, Tata. Coca-Cola, driven out of India in 1977, has bought Parle, which has 60% of the Indian soft-drinks market; and the first bottle of CocaCola, a powerful symbol of the effects of liberalisation, is due to appear on the streets at any time.
Some businessmen are fairly happy about all this, confident that they can take on the world. Dhirubhai Ambani, for instance, chairman of Reliance, a big textile company, is seen as a determined supporter of liberalisation. But his company is relatively young and specialised. Most of India's big family-owned companies, established under the Raj, are sprawling empires whose inefficiencies are being shown up by foreign competition.
Last month there was a much-talked-of ""secret"" meeting of businessmen in Bombay, attended by big names like Rahul Bajaj and Hari Shankar Sinhania, to discuss problems with the reforms. Among powerful business associations such as the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, complaints are increasingly common, and financial support from big business to the BJP is said to be rising.
One reform that businessmen would support--but that the powerful, politicised trade unions oppose-is an ""exit policy"": laws to allow factories to close. At present, businessmen are not allowed to sack workers or close down a factory. They must refer the matter to the state government and enter into years-long negotiations.
In practice, owners get their way, expensively: they bribe workers to resign, then tell the state government that, since the workers have one home, they are obliged to shut up shop. But the public sector does not do this, and is stuck with thousands of loss-making units. S.L. Rao, director of the National Council for Applied Economic Research, calculates that the government gets a 2.6% return on its 1,350 billion rupee ($42 billion) investment in public-sector industry, while it pays 6% interest on its debt.
Probably India's reforms will start up again, maybe under another government. But in the meantime, other, hungrier countries will be forging ahead in the Asian economic league. Indians might stop to ponder this irony: if nationalistic pride leads to a hiatus in the reforms, then it will be responsible for weakening India against its ever-stronger neighbours.","When Cargill , an American multinational , pulled out of a $ 30 m project to build a salt - works in the Indian state of Gujarat last month , George Fernandes , the MP who organised the opposition to the project , was triumphant .

According to the constitution, judges are appointed by the president on the advice of the government, after consultation with the chief justice. As prime minister, Indira Gandhi treated such consultation as a formality, and during the emergency of 1975-77 transferred 16 inconvenient judges to irrelevant posts to frighten the judiciary into submission. Later she amended the rules to convert some judicial appointments into political patronage.
The Supreme Court has now decided, by seven to two, to end this. It says the chief justice, in consultation with two senior colleagues, will decide future appointments, and the scope for the government to disagree is extremely limited.
Similar changes are happening else where in India. The constitution allows the central government to dismiss state governments in exceptional circumstances. This power has been misused repeatedly by the government in Delhi to get rid of opposition state governments. P.V. Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, dismissed four state governments ruled by the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party last December.
In the past, the courts have always upheld such dismissals. But this summer the Madhya Pradesh High Court struck down the dismissal of its state government. The central government has appealed to the Supreme Court, which has yet to rule.
The chief election commissioner, T.N. Seshan, is also fed up with politicians. In state after state it is now common for polling booths to be taken over by thugs with the connivance of local officials, the police siding with one party or another in inter-party clashes. People are prevented from voting and government machinery is misused to promote the prospects of the ruling party.
Previous chief election commissioners have depended on state governments to make election arrangements, but Mr Seshan says he must have more power to ensure fair elections. He wants to decide which security forces are deployed where during an election. He also wants to reduce the use of local police (who are hopes lessly politicised), and employ mainly paramilitary forces.
State governments provide officials to man polling booths and counting stations. Mr Seshan wants them under his control, not the state government's, to ensure impartiality. In the elections to six state assemblies next month, he has rejected the government's offer to provide 160 officers to act as observers, and demanded 400. In Assam he has angered the local branch of the ruling Congress party by striking off the roll many Muslim immigrants from Bangladesh (traditionally Congress supporters).
Few will disagree with Mr Seshan's aims, but many are surprised by his tactics. He refused to let an upper-house election take place in Bihar on flimsy grounds and at one point threatened to suspend all elections indefinitely until his demands were met.
Last month the government appointed two more election commissioners to reduce Mr Seshan to a minority within the commission.

In state elections last month, the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was knocked sideways (see page 35). The ruling Congress party did not do brilliantly; but because its main opponent, whose policies had threatened to split India on Hindu-Muslim lines, was rebuked, the results look like a victory for the prime minister, P.V. Narasimha Rao.
Mr Rao badly needed a tonic. Weakened by scandal and the BJP, this once-brave prime minister had become cautious and dithering. He had allowed his economic-reform programme, whose daring amazed the country during the government's first two years, to slip. With it went not only India's chance of emulating East Asia's successes, but also the government's sense of purpose. Mr Rao now has a fresh chance to push ahead with reform, and so give his government a new lease of life.
For decades, India matched China in poverty and potential. But over the past ten years the two countries have taken separate paths, as China has begun to realise its potential and India has not. From 1983 to 1993, India's economy grew at an average of 5.3% a year, China's at 9.4%. India is still enmeshed in an economic system designed after independence in 1947 to combine a little private enterprise with a lot of state control. It is a system that has delivered both sluggishness and inequality.
The reforms that Mr Rao began in June 1991 took India part-way to a sensibly run economy. The ""licence raj"" has been abolished. Prices have been freed, tariffs reduced and the currency made partly convertible. Liberalisation has been broadly popular with a public fed up with having to buy low-quality goods at high prices. But the government has run into predictable opposition from certain groups, notably businessmen threatened by competition and trade unions fearful of privatisation. Earlier this year Mr Rao, weakened by his other troubles, slumped into inaction. Indians explained that they were doomed by democracy: whereas China's government could decree radical reform and shoot its opponents, India was condemned to stagnation by the niceties of electoral politics.
Mr Rao is now well-placed to prove the pessimists wrong. First, he needs to deal with his anti-reform opponents. That means giving ground in a few places: businessmen are right that, for some goods, a combination of high excise duties and reduced import duties imposes a bigger tax burden on home-made goods than on imported ones. But in general it means pressing ahead regardless of the pleas of special interests.
Next Mr Rao must attend to the public finances. The public-sector deficit is growing once more, fuelling inflation. The way to reduce the deficit is to cut subsidies, overhaul the tax system and get rid of the public-sector businesses that drain so much money from the treasury.
JOBS MEAN VOTES
All manner of Indian businesses are owned by the state; their capital is put at 1.2 trillion rupees ($38 billion). Yet so far the government has sold a mere 40 billion rupees' worth of equity in such firms. It should now flog the possibly-profitable outfits--such as the oil and steel companies--while sorting out the thousands of enterprises touchingly known as ""sick"". Then, to encourage private industry to restructure, Mr Rao needs to wipe off the statute books the legislation that makes it technically illegal to close a factory or sack a worker. Once businessmen have those freedoms, they will be readier to take the risk of expanding into growing markets and hiring more workers.
Particular attention needs to be paid to reform of the banking system. Laws require--and politicians influence--banks to make loans to favoured borrowers without regard to creditworthiness, thus raising the cost of capital for everybody else. If the banks can first be distanced from government (the plans to allow the banks to raise money on the capital markets are a step in the right direction) and then privatised, money will become cheaper and business will warm to reform.
The benefits of the first reforms may be starting to come through. Economic growth is still slack, but exports are rising smartly and industry, which shrank last year as imports advanced, is now picking up. Another round of reform will bring bigger economic rewards, in due course providing Mr Rao with an offering to present to the grumpy gods of Indian democracy.","While other countries divide and bicker among themselves along lines of tribe and religion , it is heartening to think that India , that most fissile of nations , may be going the other way .

From 1983 to 1993 , India 's economy grew at an average of 5.3 % a year , China 's at 9.4 % . India is still enmeshed in an economic system designed after independence in 1947 to combine a little private enterprise with a lot of state control . It is a system that has delivered both sluggishness and inequality . 
 The reforms that Narasimha Rao began in June 1991 took India part - way to a sensibly run economy . The "" licence raj "" has been abolished . Prices have been freed , tariffs reduced and the currency made partly convertible . Liberalisation has been broadly popular with a public fed up with having to buy low - quality goods at high prices . But the government has run into predictable opposition from certain groups , notably businessmen threatened by competition and trade unions fearful of privatisation . Earlier this year Narasimha Rao , weakened by Narasimha Rao's other troubles , slumped into inaction . Indians explained that they were doomed by democracy : whereas China 's government could decree radical reform and shoot its opponents , India was condemned to stagnation by the niceties of electoral politics . 
 Narasimha Rao is now well - placed to prove the pessimists wrong . First , Narasimha Rao needs to deal with Narasimha Rao's anti - reform opponents . That means giving ground in a few places : businessmen are right that , for some goods , a combination of high excise duties and reduced import duties imposes a bigger tax burden on home - made goods than on imported ones . But in general it means pressing ahead regardless of the pleas of special interests . 
 Next Narasimha Rao must attend to the public finances . The public - sector deficit is growing once more , fuelling inflation . The way to reduce the deficit is to cut subsidies , overhaul the tax system and get rid of the public - sector businesses that drain so much money from the treasury . 
 JOBS MEAN VOTES 
 All manner of Indian businesses are owned by the state ; their capital is put at 1.2 trillion rupees ( $ 38 billion ) . Yet so far the government has sold a mere 40 billion rupees ' worth of equity in such firms . It should now flog the possibly - profitable outfits -- such as the oil and steel companies -- while sorting out the thousands of enterprises touchingly known as "" sick "" . Then , to encourage private industry to restructure , Narasimha Rao needs to wipe off the statute books the legislation that makes it technically illegal to close a factory or sack a worker . Once businessmen have those freedoms , they will be readier to take the risk of expanding into growing markets and hiring more workers . 
 Particular attention needs to be paid to reform of the banking system . Laws require -- and politicians influence -- banks to make loans to favoured borrowers without regard to creditworthiness , thus raising the cost of capital for everybody else . If the banks can first be distanced from government ( the plans to allow the banks to raise money on the capital markets are a step in the right direction ) and then privatised , money will become cheaper and business will warm to reform . 
 The benefits of the first reforms may be starting to come through . Economic growth is still slack , but exports are rising smartly and industry , which shrank last year as imports advanced , is now picking up . Another round of reform will bring bigger economic rewards , in due course providing Narasimha Rao with an offering to present to the grumpy gods of Indian democracy .",750,India,A29-8245,IN TERM,True,"the prime minister , P.V.

Advani, is a compelling speaker who has been voluble in recent times. But since the results of elections in four states and in the capital, Delhi, were announced on November 28th and December 1st, he has been silent. His shock is understandable. In the past five years the BJP has risen on a wave of Hindu nationalism to challenge the ruling Congress party's hold on Indian politics. Its ambitions for national power and its dream of uniting Hindus across caste divisions have just suffered their first severe blow.
The polls were a sort of mini-general-election. A third of India's 500m electors voted. Four of the five states were in the northern Hindi-speaking heartland, which generally takes the lead in Indian politics. The BJP had expected to win at least three of those. Pundits and pollsters agreed.
The BJP had brought about the elections in the first place. Its militant members tore down the mosque at Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh last December; this led to riots, bombings and a fear that India was heading for social chaos. Blaming the BJP, the prime minister, P.V. Narasimha Rao, dismissed BJP governments in the four states it ruled. A year on, fresh elections had to be held.
The BJP saw these elections as an opportunity to confirm its popularity, further undermine the government and push itself nearer the leadership of India. Holding up the demolition of the mosque as part of a promise fulfilled, its campaign tacitly proposed to fulfil the rest: to build a Hindu temple on what is now a cordoned-off mound of rubble. Its workers believed that a campaign that had transformed the BJP into the dominant national opposition party could not fail in the state elections.
It did. Of the four states the BJP had controlled before, it held on only to Rajasthan. In Delhi it won an absolute majority, though for different reasons (see box on next page). In seat numbers it did not do so badly: in the four states it was 147 seats down on the 1,083 it took last time, in 1991. In its share of the vote it may have held its own (the figures are not yet clear). But even so, with the loss of administrations in three states, the BJP will find it harder to make headway in the next general election.
Part of the BJP's trouble was that it peaked too soon. Once the mosque had been destroyed, most Hindus took the building of a temple as a foregone conclusion. The BJP was therefore left without a programme. And the party's record frightens many Indians. The riots and bomb blasts after the mosque's destruction killed innocent people, burnt homes and shut down businesses. A lot of voters feared that the BJP promised a future of social disorder. As it got more powerful, so smaller parties got together to keep it out.
Congress, despite a limp campaign and an uninspiring leader, has performed beyond its wildest dreams. It got absolute majorities in Madhya Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh. But the most surprising result came from Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, with 150m people, which has produced seven of India's nine prime ministers since 1947 and is at the centre of the storm that has dominated politics for the past year.
In Uttar Pradesh an alliance of two small regional parties, the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), is set to form the new government. The Samajwadi Party is led by Mulayam Singh Yadav, a former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh reputed to have unsavoury connections. He did his sums and put together a coalition of small groups, made up mostly of people who used to vote for Congress. He courted the Muslims, who had turned away from Congress after watching Mr Rao pander to Hindu nationalism. He won the ""backward castes"", from which he comes, by promising to campaign for jobs to be reserved for them. He teamed up with Kanshi Ram of the BSP, who brought in the votes of the untouchables, the people at the bottom of the caste heap.
This alliance of the poor undermines the BJP's big idea: pan-Hinduism. The BJP reckoned that most Hindus would think that being a Hindu was more important than the divisions of caste and economic interest. Mr Yadav and Mr Ram, by dividing the poor from the better-off Hindus, have shown that the lower castes put the hope of jobs above the call of religion. That poses a different danger, for the issue of job reservation that has divided Indian society on caste lines before could now raise its head again. But at least the threat of a religious conflagration has, for the moment, been reduced.
The voters have done Mr Rao a service, for he looks a stronger man. The mutterings about a challenge to his position have abruptly died away. Although two of Mr Rao's party rivals, Madhavrao Scindia and Arjun Singh, are both Madhya Pradesh men and were largely responsible for the party's victory in that state, Mr Rao will take the credit. Scandals and other unchartable storms aside, Mr Rao has a clear view from now until the next general election, in 1996.
But will he use the time thus won to good effect? Optimists point to remarks made by his finance minister, Manmohan Singh, to businessmen over the past few days. The minister insisted that the government would push ahead with a radical economic-reform programme; the previous reforms had lost momentum as the BJP gained ground. But Mr Rao's performance in the past year has been slack.

Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first prime minister, nudged his daughter Indira Gandhi into political life and she, in turn, groomed her son Rajiv as her political heir. The world's most populous democracy has sometimes looked suspiciously like a family business.
Although the Nehru dynasty is at present out of power, nepotism continues to thrive. In the state elections in November, candidates of the ruling Congress party contained an inordinately high proportion of wives, sons, daughters, sons-in-law, nephews and nieces of ministers and other political bigwigs. In Rajasthan the party's 200 candidates included 27 who were related to politicians. Among them were the wives of two ministers in the national government and two nephews of a politician heading a parliamentary investigation into a stock-exchange scandal. Delhi's 70 Congress candidates included 18 related to established politicians.
Every name had been approved by the prime minister, P.V. Narasimha Rao, who is chairman of the party's selection committee. But for many Indian voters enough is enough. All the family candidates lost in Rajasthan, and nearly all did in Delhi. The family business turned sticky in the middle of campaign. The governor of Himachal Pradesh (technically a non-political appointee) was obliged to resign when he was found to be lending a helping hand in his son's constituency in Madhya Pradesh.
Many in the Congress party are uneasy about nepotism. Mr Rao's promising young minister for parliamentary affairs, Rangarajan Kumaramangalam, wrote to him complaining, among other things, about the way party leaders had distributed nominations to their relations, friends and courtiers. He repeated his complaint on television. Mr Rao was not pleased, and Mr Kumaramangalam is a minister no longer.
Flushed by the Congress victory in two of the four northern states, the prime minister, in sacking his critic, was sending a warning to possible future dissenters. He also had a personal interest in the issue. His son, P.V. Ranga Rao, has been fighting elections for a decade in Andhra Pradesh, where the Raos come from and where he is a minister in the state government.

Madmen in authority, who hear voices in the air, are distilling their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years back."" Like many Keynesian aphorisms, Keynes's general theory of gurus needs to be modified. These days businessmen--the most practical of practical men--are suckers for seminars. Even madmen in authority like to claim to be in touch with the latest thinking.
This surging demand for prophecy and instruction has created gurus of many types. Academics jostle with elder statesmen who compete with novelists and pop psychologists. Many are heading for the lecture circuit, where even clapped-out politicians can be paid extravagantly in return for a few banalities. But we start our survey with someone too rich to bother with lecturing.
George Soros made $1 billion speculating against sterling before it was ejected from Europe's exchange-rate mechanism in 1992. A guru was born. His reputation as the ""man who broke the Bank of England"" has put Mr Soros in the position that all guns aspire to: his prophecies are now self-fulfilling. Announcements over the past year that Mr Soros was buying old and property provoked rallies in the markets for those assets and further enhanced his reputation for sagacity.
The ability to make huge quantities of money is undoubtedly the foundation of the Soros mystique. But to be a real guru you need a little more than that. Mr Soros's interest in philosophy, expressed in a Mitteleuropa accent which aspirin gurus would do well to imitate, has given him a reputation for intellectual depth as well as financial shrewdness.
Mr Soros claims that his financial strategy is based on an insight into that old philosophical chestnut: the distinction between appearance and reality. His investment vehicle, the Quantum fund, seems to have been named in tribute to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. Mr Soros's argument that beliefs about reality alter reality, which in turn alter beliefs, is not a terribly novel insight. Most investors know that sentiment as much as fundamentals drives markets. But dressed up in the language of philosophy and backed by massive financial success, Mr Soros's musings have helped to make him the most influential investment guru of his day.

Tom Peters is probably the most famous management guru in the world, and certainly one of the richest. His ability to command lecture fees of up to $50,000 owes much to his stagecraft. Striding urgently back and forth, bellowing and bantering, he nearly achieves the difficult feat of making management seem exciting. His revivalist style is captured by the title of his latest tome: ""Liberation Management"".
A veteran of both the Vietnam war and McKinsey, a management consultancy, Mr Peters made his breakthrough with a book entitled ""In Search of Excellence"", which he co-wrote with Robert Waterman, another McKinseyite. ""Excellence"", as devotees refer to it, has sold more than 5m copies. This makes it easily the best-selling management book ever.
Messrs Peters and Waterman chose 43 successful companies and identified common characteristics which made them succeed. Sadly, several of the excellent companies highlighted went into decline after the appearance of the book. They include such famous corporate lemons as ""People's Express"", a defunct airline, and Wang, a struggling computer company.
Perhaps it was this chastening experience that persuaded Mr Peters to devote his next work to the need for businesses to keep pace with the times. ""Thriving on Chaos"" certainly lives up to its title. It is without doubt one of the world's worst organised books, but nonetheless proved to be another great success.
Brevity is not one of Mr Peters's gifts. ""Chaos"" identifies no fewer than 45 precepts for managers to follow. Some seem strikingly alike. Precept four urges, ""Achieve total customer responsiveness"". Number seven insists that managers ""Listen to customers""; number ten suggests that they become ""customer-obsessed"". Other Peters precepts seem a touch obvious, like the demand to reduce paperwork. Yet the apparently commonplace nature of some of the Peters principles--the need to reduce layers of management and invest in training, for example--may actually be a tribute to their author's influence.

Japan, a country in which the sensei, or teacher, is revered, should be fertile ground for would-be gurus. In Fad management experts are thin on the round, which may help to account for the remarkable success of Japanese managers. Many of those doing the rounds on the lecture circuit are foreigners talking about Japan, while Japan's one homegrown guru has made his reputation interpreting his country to westerners.
Kenichi Ohmae (Ken to Americans) is head of McKinsey's office in Japan. His most celebrated work ""The Mind of the Strategist"" (subtitled ""The Art of Japanese Business"") was published in 1982, just as the West was groping to understand the secret of Japan's economic success. Mr Ohmae pointed out that much western analysis of Japanese business practices concentrated on the superficial--company songs and all that--and he argued that the real secret lay in Japanese strategic thinking. This, he claimed, was ""basically creative and intuitive rather than rational"". Readers might be tempted to give up at that point but, as luck would have it, Mr Ohmae claims that the required creativity can be cultivated. He lards his book with useful tips.
Of late Mr Ohmae has become steadily more ambitious in the subjects he has tackled. He has founded a well-publicised pressure-group to press for political and economic reform within Japan. His recent books and articles have proclaimed the death of the nation state and the rise of the ""borderless world"". His latest project is aimed at redesigning the United Nations. Even his fans are beginning to murmur about incipient mealomania.

The pretensions of management science might be regarded with greater respect if the subject's leading lights were not routinely called ""gurus"". Peter Drucker, who virtually invented the serious study of management, seems to have realised this and has always resisted the tag. But although Mr Drucker is a sober-suited octogenarian, rather than a bearded mystic, the ""management guru"" label is stuck to him like a piece of adhesive tape. That is a touch unfair since Mr Drucker's work has gone well beyond how-to guides for insecure bureaucrats and has strayed productively into philosophy, history and sociology.
Like George Soros, Mr Drucker hails originally from central Europe and came to America after a stint working in Britain. In the 1930s he was one of the first to identify management as an important and complex social activity, worthy of serious study. His first book appeared in 1939 and new works have been appearing ever since. There is no Druckerist philosophy. Mr Drucker is a producer of insights, rather than a system builder. But many of the management fads of today can be traced to a dusty Drucker tome. ""Managing by objectives"" is a Druckerism and privatisation was advocated by Mr Drucker in the 1960s.
Mr Drucker is not shy about reminding people of his contribution to management studies and some find him a touch dogmatic. His efforts to make his work lively and comprehensible have also antagonised some more prolix rivals, who dismiss him as a populist. Others see him as a relic of a bygone age, when the big corporation ruled the business world (he wrote a study of General Motors). In fact Mr Drucker has long advocated corporate decentralisation, and has become increasingly preoccupied with managing information rather than armies of workers. In a field packed with egomaniacs and snake-oil merchants, he remains a genuinely original thinker.

Together with Peter Drucker and Tom Peters, Michael Porter completes the dominant troika of management guns. While Mr Drucker is celebrated for his originality and great age and Mr Peters is noted for his energy, Porterites say their man is the most academically rigorous of the three. Mr Porter has attempted to apply economics to the study of management. His first book was a study of ""competitive strategies"" for particular industries. In his next he moved on to the search for ""competitive advantage"" for entire countries. This has added a new dimension to his consulting work. Mr Porter's Monitor group in Boston has been engaged by several governments to divine their country's ""competitive advantage"". The African National Congress in South Africa is one of the company's newest clients.
By using the phrase ""competitive advantage""--rather than the economist's favourite concept of ""comparative advantage""--Mr Porter claimed a theoretical departure. He agues that lobalisation and technological change have made traditional ways of gauging comparative advantage, such as the costs of labour and raw material, less important. What matters now, he says, are the abilities to innovate and to develop clusters of competitive companies in particular industries.
Mr Porter's critics find his work too schematic and say that an obsession with developing ""strategies"" can get in the way of common sense and pragmatism. Others say his books are just ""loads of tables"". But Mr Porter has plenty of fans. Like Tom Peters he is a compulsive and highly paid lecturer. And while Mr Porter's approach to management is distinctive, he shares some of Mr Peters's characteristics--especially a talent for self-promotion, and acute logorrhoea. ""The Competitive Advantage of Nations"" is a fact-packed mega-work. Readers would be unwise to drop it on their foot.

Just now America's most influential guru is not much interested in management or finance. The country's chief political sage is a proud son of Cape Girardeau, Missouri, ""a quintessential mid-western small town"". There Rush Limbaugh learned to appreciate the virtues of enterprise, self-reliance, family, law-and-order and white-male bonding that are the meat of his hugely successful shows. He also learned, from his days as a DJ of the pop charts in the 1960s, how influential the lowly radio can be.
Mr Limbaugh's radio talk-show is reckoned to have about 20m listeners a week; his syndicated television show reaches 99% of the national market. His first book ""The Way Things Ought to Be"", stayed at the top of the New York Times best-seller list for more than 25 weeks; his second, ""See, I Told You So"" reached the top in November.
With his thinning hair, ample waistline and Ordinary Joe philosophy, Mr Limbo is easily under-estimated. He is intelligent, does his homework and gets his facts straight. He presents himself as an independent, or an anti-liberal, rather than a Republican, which should allow him to stay in business even when his nemesis, Bill Clinton, is no loner in the White House. Mr Limbaugh's audiences seem to enjoy especially his tirades against environmentalists, ""feminazis"" and political correctness.
As far as Mr Limbaugh is concerned, he is not an original. He is merely expressing the deep wisdom of the ages, as it is understood in any crossroads diner in any American small town. His followers (whom he calls ""dittoheads"") may swarm after him, but he takes his cue from them--and from several more elevated souls. ""See, I Told You So"" opens with a series of quotations from Voltaire, Samuel Butler, Thomas Paine and Virgil (""They can conquer who believe they can""). Mr Limbaugh adds: ""Isn't it amazing that these guys knew all this...without having to listen to me?""

Jeffrey Sachs, the advocate of economic ""shock therapy"" in Poland and Russia, is the pre-eminent example of a new breed of academic entrepreneur thrown up by the turmoil in Eastern Europe. Unlike Keynes or Milton Friedman (see below), both of whom also acted as advisers to various governments, Mr Sachs is not credited with any great theoretical insights. Taken one by one, his prescriptions--control inflation, slash subsidies to state industries, let prices find their market level--are what one would expect from a neoclassical economist. Mr Sachs's trademark is his emphasis on rapid and radical reform--shock therapy. For countries suffering from economic chaos and hyperinflation, calling for Mr Sachs has become the equivalent of dialling for the fire brigade.
The Bolivian government was first to pluck Mr Sachs from the obscurity of the economics department at Harvard University. Bolivia was suffering from inflation of 24,000% a year in the mid-1980s. Mr Sachs's confidence that this could be quickly remedied led to an advisory role. The relative success of the Bolivian experiment then encouraged the Polish government to draft Mr Sachs. After that, Russia and many others followed. In Moscow Mr Sachs and his team of ""Sachsniks"", a mixture of fellow academics and bright American graduate students, are playing an active part in Russian politics. As the beleaguered Russian finance ministry has battled its foes in the central bank, the Sachsniks have drafted proposals and decrees, which have been swiftly translated into Russian and presented to Boris Yeltsin.
Mr Sachs speaks his mind, which many find disconcerting Also, he takes sides. Officials (and journalists) who find themselves on the receiving end of his displeasure rarely enjoy the experience. Unsurprisingly he is a controversial figure. Criticisms include the substantive, the trivial and the plain nasty. Academic foes say that the social costs of shock therapy are too great and point to the recent victory of former communists in the Polish elections. Others, on safer ground, mock Mr Sachs's obsession with fax machines. Russian and Polish nationalists have noticed that Mr Sachs is Jewish. The recent triumph of the Yeltsinites suggest that Mr Sachs and his Sachsniks are only just starting.

Science is poor ground for gurus. Scientific knowledge, in principle at least, is wrested direct from nature, not learnt at the feet of a master. But some scientists, through eminence, personality or achievement, influence the world far beyond the laboratory, sometimes in the most unscientific ways. It helps if the science you practise holds the fate of the world in its hands.
Edward Teller did not create the hydrogen bomb single-handed--it was the work of many men. But after it was born, he convinced America to create a new weapons laboratory so that he could help in its upbringing. As the ruler of Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, though only briefly its director, he influenced defence policy and gathered the followers every guru needs.
After the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956 his views were fixedly anti-communist. Many of his wartime peers never forgave him for testifying against Robert Oppenheimer, but the bright young men at Livermore regarded him with awed respect. He provides his acolytes with only one foot at which to learn--the other was lost to a Budapest tram, and an alpenstock almost as tall as the man provides the support it cannot.
He still delights in solving puzzles with the broad, order-of-magnitude approach at which physicists excel. His solutions tend all to be measured in meatonnes, but the sheer variety of uses he has thought up for bombs is impressive. His judgment has not always matched his ideas. He has worked best when others have been there to weed his fertile mind.

To many, especially in Britain, Milton Friedman is the father of ""monetarism"". That was a small claim even before politicians conspired to render the term meaningless. But this view of Mr Friedman has always been a travesty: there is far more to the man than his work on monetary policy, let alone ""monetarism"". He is probably the greatest economist of the 20th century--and, except for Keynes, its most influential.
His work in many branches of economic theory, micro and macro, was path-breaking. Unlike other theorists, he also believed that economics must be empirical, and took the trouble to test his ideas against the facts. But it takes more than this to be a gun. Mr Friedman had it. A neat little man with a charming grin, at his best he was devastating debate--chopping the most formidable --seeming opponent into small pieces, with pitiless courtesy throughout. The same skill at marshalling fact and argument, differently directed, made him one of the subject's finest teachers-not just of fellow economists and full-time students, but also, through popular books, journalism and broadcasting, of the interested layman.
Now 81, Mr Friedman remains a champion of free enterprise. ""Capitalism and Freedom"" (first published in 1962) and the best-selling ""Free to Choose"" make it plain what economics is for, and why it matters. The influence of these ideas, never better expressed, peaked in the industrial countries in the 1980s. In much of the third world, where Mr Friedman is in great demand, he is still winning converts.

Since his retirement as Singapore's prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew has become the guru of choice for autocrats and their apologists throughout Asia. His argument that economic development and political freedom are often incompatible is music to the ears of many regional leaders. In recent months Mr Lee has lambasted Chris Patten's attempts to introduce democratic reforms into Hong Kong urged America not to put pressure on the Chinese leadership and told Filipinos that they need more discipline and less democracy.
Although Mr Lee spent many of his early years in Singapore lodging up communists, he has been lionised in China and invited to serve as an adviser to the Vietnamese government. Singapore's extraordinary economic success and Mr Lee's undoubted intellect have lent respectability to arguments that western liberals are inclined to dismiss as self-serving.
The West may find it difficult to stomach some of Mr Lee's strictures on democracy, but his views on welfarism are likely to receive an increasingly respectful hearing. The obsessionally meritocratic Mr Lee believes that the welfare state has sapped the economic vitality of the West. He has encouraged Singapore to emphasise competition and self-reliance in every sphere of economic and social life. Western businessmen appreciate Singaporean efficiency and have flocked to the city-state. But middle-class Singaporeans seem to be rowing increasingly restive: a surprising number are voting for Singapore's much-harried political opposition.

Vaclav Havel is one of the few politicians who has managed to become a guru without having to retire first. When the Czech revolution brought him to power in 1989, Mr Havel was hailed as a modern philosopher. prince. Not only was he a dissident with the moral courage to withstand years of imprisonment, he was also an absurdist playwright with an attractively rumpled appearance and a liking for mingling with ageing western rock stars. At last Bohemia was overturned by a Bohemian.
Inevitably, political imperatives have diffused the romance surrounding Mr Havel. Those who hoped that the hero of the Czech revolution would articulate a new, humanistic approach to politics have been somewhat disappointed. Mr Havel has pleased his fans abroad with essays in the New York Review of Books. He has confirmed that it is possible to be both a politician and a decent human being. But his domestic political statements have been cautious appeals to coalitions of interests.
Oddly for a playwright, his actions rather than his words have provided the chief inspiration for those who choose to regard Mr Havel as a guru. While much of the rest of Eastern Europe has succumbed to crude nationalism, Mr Havel's handling of the ""velvet divorce"" between the Czech and Slovak republics enhanced his reputation for calm and decency.

Octavio Paz, a Mexican poet and intellectual who turns 80 in 1994, is another man to achieve the difficult feat of contributing to both politics and literature. In his writing Mr Paz has drawn inspiration from an eclectic variety of sources ranging from surrealism to Tantric Buddhism and the poetry of Dante. The resulting mix was sufficiently inspired to earn him a Nobel prize for literature in 1990. But poetic flights of fancy have not prevented Mr Paz from taking part in Latin American politics. He has long been a champion of liberalism and individual freedom in a region known for its political oppression (by repressive regimes) and intellectual suffocation (by left-wing elites).
Mr Paz first endeared himself to the Latin left when he resigned his comfortable post as ambassador to India in 1968 in protest at a bloody crackdown on student protesters in Mexico city. But this affection faded quickly during the 1970s, when he broke with the pack to denounce Fidel Castro, the darling of Latin socialists. Despite the scorn heaped upon him, Mr Paz remained steadfast. He further antagonised his former comrades during the 1980s, when he criticised the Sandinists in Nicaragua. As a result Mr Paz, who considers himself ""disillusioned leftist"", can count few friends among the left in Latin America. For much of the past two decades he has been a leading (and often solitary) intellectual in Latin America challenging the generation which grew up worshipping Che Guevara to reconsider their faith.

Octavio Paz and Vaclav Havel may lend credence to the saw that poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world, but literary critics seem to be trying to displace mere authors. Nobody has done as much to elevate critic over writer and to spread the tentacles of literary theory into political life (or ""discourse"", as he would certainly put it) as Jacques Derrida, a French academic.
The father of deconstruction has an army of acolytes in universities throughout Europe and America. The language of deconstruction, and thus of Mr Derrida, has become a vital part of the vocabulary of politically-correct America. By attacking the notion of a hierarchy of ""great books"", Mr Derrida has provided ammunition for those seeking to revise university curriculums and ""empower"" minorities. The intricacy of Mr Derrida's arguments and the complexity of his language are a magnet for the pretentious. And deconstruction's claim to lay bare the hidden meanings and contradictions in everything from Shakespeare to soap operas seems appealingly radical.
Yet the formidably learned Mr Derrida has also opened the door to a new form of Philistinism. If texts have no fixed meanings, then all arguments (including those of Mr Derrida and his followers) threaten to become unintelligible. If all forms of expression are equally worthy of study and comment, there is little point in struggling to understand complex works.
Deconstruction's tendency to undermine itself, along with everything else, has led David Lode, a novelist, to compare it to ""sawing off the branch on which you are sitting"". Deconstruction's followers say this only adds to the fun. But, of late, Mr Derrida seems to be having his doubts. In a recent interview he startled some of his admirers by declaring that he was a ""lover of tradition"" who believed that all students should have a rounding in the ""great texts"".

Noam Choms is a celebrated professor of linguistics. But it is his political beliefs that have made him house-guru to America's conspiracy-theorising left. Mr Chomsky thinks that the world is run for the benefit of a few giant corporations; American foreign policy is murderously imperialist; American democracy is empty of content, a process of ""elite decision-making and periodic public ratification"". The working masses are duped into voting against their interests by the media, which are part of the elite's propaganda machine.
Mr Choms's heyday was the Vietnam war. His complaints have a slightly dated air these days. At his best Mr Chomsky is capable of asking sharp and disconcerting questions about American government and the role of intellectuals in defining debate. At his worst he can seem completely detached from reality. Nonetheless he still has followers, particularly among disgruntled graduate students. To them Mr Chomsky is ""America's leading dissident"", a radical voice in the wilderness who has divined the true nature of the powers-that-be. Mr Chomsky often describes himself as a ""libertarian socialist"" and seems to be hoping for the advent of an anarchist utopia.
Like most acts of Edith, Mr Chomsky's theories are diligently circular. Inconvenient facts are inherently suspect, since they have been mediated by a press which is in the pay of big business. So what if the American media seem to be more liberal than the American population at large? That only proves the fiendish subtlety of the American establishment's system for ""manufacturing consent"". Presumably the fact that Mr Chomsky himself is a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a bastion of the American establishment, can be explained in the same way.

Whereas Noam Chomsky, a libertarian leftie, believes that multinationals control the world, Ayn Rand--the heroine of America's libertarian right--argued that big business was ""America's persecuted minority"". Rand died in 1982. Her philosophy thrives and her books still sell half a million copies a year, thanks to a plethora of outfits designed acquaint the world with her thoughts. The Ayn Rand Institute, based in Los Angeles and founded in 1985, aims ""to overturn the hostility toward reason, individualism and capitalism on the par of today's writers and thinkers"". Second Renaissance Books, in Oceanside, California, sells leatherbound editions of ""Atlas Shrugged"" as well as tapes of her lectures. Conferences devoted to Rand's principles are held regularly: when the organisers advertised the summer conference of 1992, they promised that the gathering would be ""the most rational place on earth.""
Rand labelled her philosophy objectivism and described it as ""the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute"". The Reagan presidency provided opportunities for a few objectivists to try their hand at their most hated institution: government. The most celebrated Randist even survived the passing of the Reagan years. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, was an acolyte of Rand's in the 1960s. Presumably he no longer believes Rand's argument that ""every government interference in the economy consists of giving an unearned benefit, extorted by force, to some men at the expense of others.""

If one of the characteristics proper to gurus is charisma, it is perhaps no surprise that they are rare in the world of high technology --a place where even the most rudimentary social skills (grammatical conversation, eating with utensils) are in short supply. Nicholas Negroponte, the founder and director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media Lab, fills that gap in the market nicely. For a nerd he is unusually dapper; better still, he talks about some of the most futuristic research imaginable in language the Media Lab's corporate sponsors (and journalists) can comprehend.
The eight-year-old research centre dedicated to ""inventing the future"" is Mr Negroponte's life work. Shorn of pretensions, this means devising smart technologies that let users interact more intuitively with information. ""Personalisation"" is the Media Lab's guiding theme: its projects include an electronic newspaper that ""knows"" which stories you want to read (the Daily Me).
Mr Negroponte's guruviness rests on his ideas about digital technology and its role in the convergence of telephony, TV, computing and publishing. When he first talked about this two decades ago, he was considered a borderline nut-case; a proposal he submitted to the government in 1975 called ""multimedia computing"" was accepted on condition that the first word be removed because it sounded silly. Now companies are betting billions on the multimedia age.
Such prescience has done nothing for Mr Negroponte's modesty. Of one of the world's leading researchers on high-definition television he says: ""A very nice man-pity he knows absolutely nothing about TV."" A related defect is that Mr Negroponte often seems to assume that everyone is as focused and clever as he is, and hence to have a rather too optimistic view of how quickly people will go from couch potatoes to couch commandos. Still, he has been right more often than wrong--which is more than can Is be said for a far more famous media-technology guru, the late Marshall McLuhan.

And finally, the real thing India invented the word ""guru"". Its most colourful living example is Sathya Sai Baba (true and holy father), denounced by many as a shaman but revered by millions as a saint.
Other Indian gurus, such as Bhagwan Rajneesh (deported by American immigration authorities before his death in 1991) and Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, went abroad to test new markets. Sai Baba stayed home and succeeded splendidly. His message of peace and love, like his beatific smile, has not changed since he was a child prodigy. Now he is more popular than ever-so much so that his hometown of Puttaparthi, a couple of hours' drive from Hyderabad, boasts a new airstrip. Disciples say he is richer than the pope--and, you may therefore feel, a better guide through life.
His 65th birthday celebrations in 1990 were attended by a former president of India. The new one is also a devotee. So are Narasimha Rao, the prime minister; Bettino Craxi, formerly prime minister of Italy; and J. R Jayewardene, former president of Sri Lanka. After an assassination attempt in the summer a senior minister flew from Delhi to oversee the investigation in person.
He has survived many such difficulties, starting with a scorpion bite when he was eight. After that his hands ban to drip ash and he was declared the incarnation of a holy figure who had lived earlier in the century. Many more miracles followed. Over the years dozens of implacable rationalists and other mischief-makers have tried to discredit him, but never successfully. Sai Baba has ignored, outlived or outpaced them all.
These days, miracle-wise, he concentrates on holy ash. But he is also a philanthropist, running more than 100 colleges, schools and an enormous hospital for the poor. Judges, politicians, bureaucrats and film stars cringe and crave an audience. Tom Peters, eat your heart out.

Madmen in authority, who hear voices in the air, are distilling their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years back."" Like many Keynesian aphorisms, Keynes's general theory of gurus needs to be modified. These days businessmen--the most practical of practical men--are suckers for seminars. Even madmen in authority like to claim to be in touch with the latest thinking.
This surging demand for prophecy and instruction has created gurus of many types. Academics jostle with elder statesmen who compete with novelists and pop psychologists. Many are heading for the lecture circuit, where even clapped-out politicians can be paid extravagantly in return for a few banalities. But we start our survey with someone too rich to bother with lecturing.
George Soros made $1 billion speculating against sterling before it was ejected from Europe's exchange-rate mechanism in 1992. A guru was born. His reputation as the ""man who broke the Bank of England"" has put Mr Soros in the position that all guns aspire to: his prophecies are now self-fulfilling. Announcements over the past year that Mr Soros was buying old and property provoked rallies in the markets for those assets and further enhanced his reputation for sagacity.
The ability to make huge quantities of money is undoubtedly the foundation of the Soros mystique. But to be a real guru you need a little more than that. Mr Soros's interest in philosophy, expressed in a Mitteleuropa accent which aspirin gurus would do well to imitate, has given him a reputation for intellectual depth as well as financial shrewdness.
Mr Soros claims that his financial strategy is based on an insight into that old philosophical chestnut: the distinction between appearance and reality. His investment vehicle, the Quantum fund, seems to have been named in tribute to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. Mr Soros's argument that beliefs about reality alter reality, which in turn alter beliefs, is not a terribly novel insight. Most investors know that sentiment as much as fundamentals drives markets. But dressed up in the language of philosophy and backed by massive financial success, Mr Soros's musings have helped to make him the most influential investment guru of his day.

Tom Peters is probably the most famous management guru in the world, and certainly one of the richest. His ability to command lecture fees of up to $50,000 owes much to his stagecraft. Striding urgently back and forth, bellowing and bantering, he nearly achieves the difficult feat of making management seem exciting. His revivalist style is captured by the title of his latest tome: ""Liberation Management"".
A veteran of both the Vietnam war and McKinsey, a management consultancy, Mr Peters made his breakthrough with a book entitled ""In Search of Excellence"", which he co-wrote with Robert Waterman, another McKinseyite. ""Excellence"", as devotees refer to it, has sold more than 5m copies. This makes it easily the best-selling management book ever.
Messrs Peters and Waterman chose 43 successful companies and identified common characteristics which made them succeed. Sadly, several of the excellent companies highlighted went into decline after the appearance of the book. They include such famous corporate lemons as ""People's Express"", a defunct airline, and Wang, a struggling computer company.
Perhaps it was this chastening experience that persuaded Mr Peters to devote his next work to the need for businesses to keep pace with the times. ""Thriving on Chaos"" certainly lives up to its title. It is without doubt one of the world's worst organised books, but nonetheless proved to be another great success.
Brevity is not one of Mr Peters's gifts. ""Chaos"" identifies no fewer than 45 precepts for managers to follow. Some seem strikingly alike. Precept four urges, ""Achieve total customer responsiveness"". Number seven insists that managers ""Listen to customers""; number ten suggests that they become ""customer-obsessed"". Other Peters precepts seem a touch obvious, like the demand to reduce paperwork. Yet the apparently commonplace nature of some of the Peters principles--the need to reduce layers of management and invest in training, for example--may actually be a tribute to their author's influence.

Japan, a country in which the sensei, or teacher, is revered, should be fertile ground for would-be gurus. In Fad management experts are thin on the round, which may help to account for the remarkable success of Japanese managers. Many of those doing the rounds on the lecture circuit are foreigners talking about Japan, while Japan's one homegrown guru has made his reputation interpreting his country to westerners.
Kenichi Ohmae (Ken to Americans) is head of McKinsey's office in Japan. His most celebrated work ""The Mind of the Strategist"" (subtitled ""The Art of Japanese Business"") was published in 1982, just as the West was groping to understand the secret of Japan's economic success. Mr Ohmae pointed out that much western analysis of Japanese business practices concentrated on the superficial--company songs and all that--and he argued that the real secret lay in Japanese strategic thinking. This, he claimed, was ""basically creative and intuitive rather than rational"". Readers might be tempted to give up at that point but, as luck would have it, Mr Ohmae claims that the required creativity can be cultivated. He lards his book with useful tips.
Of late Mr Ohmae has become steadily more ambitious in the subjects he has tackled. He has founded a well-publicised pressure-group to press for political and economic reform within Japan. His recent books and articles have proclaimed the death of the nation state and the rise of the ""borderless world"". His latest project is aimed at redesigning the United Nations.

The pretensions of management science might be regarded with greater respect if the subject's leading lights were not routinely called ""gurus"". Peter Drucker, who virtually invented the serious study of management, seems to have realised this and has always resisted the tag. But although Mr Drucker is a sober-suited octogenarian, rather than a bearded mystic, the ""management guru"" label is stuck to him like a piece of adhesive tape. That is a touch unfair since Mr Drucker's work has gone well beyond how-to guides for insecure bureaucrats and has strayed productively into philosophy, history and sociology.
Like George Soros, Mr Drucker hails originally from central Europe and came to America after a stint working in Britain. In the 1930s he was one of the first to identify management as an important and complex social activity, worthy of serious study. His first book appeared in 1939 and new works have been appearing ever since. There is no Druckerist philosophy. Mr Drucker is a producer of insights, rather than a system builder. But many of the management fads of today can be traced to a dusty Drucker tome. ""Managing by objectives"" is a Druckerism and privatisation was advocated by Mr Drucker in the 1960s.
Mr Drucker is not shy about reminding people of his contribution to management studies and some find him a touch dogmatic. His efforts to make his work lively and comprehensible have also antagonised some more prolix rivals, who dismiss him as a populist. Others see him as a relic of a bygone age, when the big corporation ruled the business world (he wrote a study of General Motors). In fact Mr Drucker has long advocated corporate decentralisation, and has become increasingly preoccupied with managing information rather than armies of workers. In a field packed with egomaniacs and snake-oil merchants, he remains a genuinely original thinker.

Together with Peter Drucker and Tom Peters, Michael Porter completes the dominant troika of management guns. While Mr Drucker is celebrated for his originality and great age and Mr Peters is noted for his energy, Porterites say their man is the most academically rigorous of the three. Mr Porter has attempted to apply economics to the study of management. His first book was a study of ""competitive strategies"" for particular industries. In his next he moved on to the search for ""competitive advantage"" for entire countries. This has added a new dimension to his consulting work. Mr Porter's Monitor group in Boston has been engaged by several governments to divine their country's ""competitive advantage"". The African National Congress in South Africa is one of the company's newest clients.
By using the phrase ""competitive advantage""--rather than the economist's favourite concept of ""comparative advantage""--Mr Porter claimed a theoretical departure. He agues that lobalisation and technological change have made traditional ways of gauging comparative advantage, such as the costs of labour and raw material, less important. What matters now, he says, are the abilities to innovate and to develop clusters of competitive companies in particular industries.
Mr Porter's critics find his work too schematic and say that an obsession with developing ""strategies"" can get in the way of common sense and pragmatism. Others say his books are just ""loads of tables"". But Mr Porter has plenty of fans. Like Tom Peters he is a compulsive and highly paid lecturer. And while Mr Porter's approach to management is distinctive, he shares some of Mr Peters's characteristics--especially a talent for self-promotion, and acute logorrhoea. ""The Competitive Advantage of Nations"" is a fact-packed mega-work. Readers would be unwise to drop it on their foot.

Just now America's most influential guru is not much interested in management or finance. The country's chief political sage is a proud son of Cape Girardeau, Missouri, ""a quintessential mid-western small town"". There Rush Limbaugh learned to appreciate the virtues of enterprise, self-reliance, family, law-and-order and white-male bonding that are the meat of his hugely successful shows. He also learned, from his days as a DJ of the pop charts in the 1960s, how influential the lowly radio can be.
Mr Limbaugh's radio talk-show is reckoned to have about 20m listeners a week; his syndicated television show reaches 99% of the national market. His first book ""The Way Things Ought to Be"", stayed at the top of the New York Times best-seller list for more than 25 weeks; his second, ""See, I Told You So"" reached the top in November.
With his thinning hair, ample waistline and Ordinary Joe philosophy, Mr Limbo is easily under-estimated. He is intelligent, does his homework and gets his facts straight. He presents himself as an independent, or an anti-liberal, rather than a Republican, which should allow him to stay in business even when his nemesis, Bill Clinton, is no loner in the White House.

As far as Mr Limbaugh is concerned, he is not an original. He is merely expressing the deep wisdom of the ages, as it is understood in any crossroads diner in any American small town. His followers (whom he calls ""dittoheads"") may swarm after him, but he takes his cue from them--and from several more elevated souls. ""See, I Told You So"" opens with a series of quotations from Voltaire, Samuel Butler, Thomas Paine and Virgil (""They can conquer who believe they can"").

Jeffrey Sachs, the advocate of economic ""shock therapy"" in Poland and Russia, is the pre-eminent example of a new breed of academic entrepreneur thrown up by the turmoil in Eastern Europe. Unlike Keynes or Milton Friedman (see below), both of whom also acted as advisers to various governments, Mr Sachs is not credited with any great theoretical insights. Taken one by one, his prescriptions--control inflation, slash subsidies to state industries, let prices find their market level--are what one would expect from a neoclassical economist. Mr Sachs's trademark is his emphasis on rapid and radical reform--shock therapy. For countries suffering from economic chaos and hyperinflation, calling for Mr Sachs has become the equivalent of dialling for the fire brigade.
The Bolivian government was first to pluck Mr Sachs from the obscurity of the economics department at Harvard University. Bolivia was suffering from inflation of 24,000% a year in the mid-1980s. Mr Sachs's confidence that this could be quickly remedied led to an advisory role. The relative success of the Bolivian experiment then encouraged the Polish government to draft Mr Sachs. After that, Russia and many others followed. In Moscow Mr Sachs and his team of ""Sachsniks"", a mixture of fellow academics and bright American graduate students, are playing an active part in Russian politics. As the beleaguered Russian finance ministry has battled its foes in the central bank, the Sachsniks have drafted proposals and decrees, which have been swiftly translated into Russian and presented to Boris Yeltsin.
Mr Sachs speaks his mind, which many find disconcerting Also, he takes sides. Officials (and journalists) who find themselves on the receiving end of his displeasure rarely enjoy the experience. Unsurprisingly he is a controversial figure. Criticisms include the substantive, the trivial and the plain nasty. Academic foes say that the social costs of shock therapy are too great and point to the recent victory of former communists in the Polish elections. Others, on safer ground, mock Mr Sachs's obsession with fax machines. Russian and Polish nationalists have noticed that Mr Sachs is Jewish. The recent triumph of the Yeltsinites suggest that Mr Sachs and his Sachsniks are only just starting.

It helps if the science you practise holds the fate of the world in its hands.

But this view of Mr Friedman has always been a travesty: there is far more to the man than his work on monetary policy, let alone ""monetarism"". He is probably the greatest economist of the 20th century--and, except for Keynes, its most influential.

Unlike other theorists, he also believed that economics must be empirical, and took the trouble to test his ideas against the facts. But it takes more than this to be a gun. Mr Friedman had it.

Now 81, Mr Friedman remains a champion of free enterprise. ""Capitalism and Freedom"" (first published in 1962) and the best-selling ""Free to Choose"" make it plain what economics is for, and why it matters. The influence of these ideas, never better expressed, peaked in the industrial countries in the 1980s. In much of the third world, where Mr Friedman is in great demand, he is still winning converts.

Vaclav Havel is one of the few politicians who has managed to become a guru without having to retire first. When the Czech revolution brought him to power in 1989, Mr Havel was hailed as a modern philosopher. prince. Not only was he a dissident with the moral courage to withstand years of imprisonment, he was also an absurdist playwright with an attractively rumpled appearance and a liking for mingling with ageing western rock stars. At last Bohemia was overturned by a Bohemian.
Inevitably, political imperatives have diffused the romance surrounding Mr Havel. Those who hoped that the hero of the Czech revolution would articulate a new, humanistic approach to politics have been somewhat disappointed. Mr Havel has pleased his fans abroad with essays in the New York Review of Books. He has confirmed that it is possible to be both a politician and a decent human being. But his domestic political statements have been cautious appeals to coalitions of interests.
Oddly for a playwright, his actions rather than his words have provided the chief inspiration for those who choose to regard Mr Havel as a guru. While much of the rest of Eastern Europe has succumbed to crude nationalism, Mr Havel's handling of the ""velvet divorce"" between the Czech and Slovak republics enhanced his reputation for calm and decency.

Octavio Paz, a Mexican poet and intellectual who turns 80 in 1994, is another man to achieve the difficult feat of contributing to both politics and literature. In his writing Mr Paz has drawn inspiration from an eclectic variety of sources ranging from surrealism to Tantric Buddhism and the poetry of Dante. The resulting mix was sufficiently inspired to earn him a Nobel prize for literature in 1990. But poetic flights of fancy have not prevented Mr Paz from taking part in Latin American politics. He has long been a champion of liberalism and individual freedom in a region known for its political oppression (by repressive regimes) and intellectual suffocation (by left-wing elites).
Mr Paz first endeared himself to the Latin left when he resigned his comfortable post as ambassador to India in 1968 in protest at a bloody crackdown on student protesters in Mexico city. But this affection faded quickly during the 1970s, when he broke with the pack to denounce Fidel Castro, the darling of Latin socialists. Despite the scorn heaped upon him, Mr Paz remained steadfast. He further antagonised his former comrades during the 1980s, when he criticised the Sandinists in Nicaragua. As a result Mr Paz, who considers himself ""disillusioned leftist"", can count few friends among the left in Latin America. For much of the past two decades he has been a leading (and often solitary) intellectual in Latin America challenging the generation which grew up worshipping Che Guevara to reconsider their faith.

Octavio Paz and Vaclav Havel may lend credence to the saw that poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world, but literary critics seem to be trying to displace mere authors. Nobody has done as much to elevate critic over writer and to spread the tentacles of literary theory into political life (or ""discourse"", as he would certainly put it) as Jacques Derrida, a French academic.
The father of deconstruction has an army of acolytes in universities throughout Europe and America. The language of deconstruction, and thus of Mr Derrida, has become a vital part of the vocabulary of politically-correct America. By attacking the notion of a hierarchy of ""great books"", Mr Derrida has provided ammunition for those seeking to revise university curriculums and ""empower"" minorities. The intricacy of Mr Derrida's arguments and the complexity of his language are a magnet for the pretentious. And deconstruction's claim to lay bare the hidden meanings and contradictions in everything from Shakespeare to soap operas seems appealingly radical.
Yet the formidably learned Mr Derrida has also opened the door to a new form of Philistinism. If texts have no fixed meanings, then all arguments (including those of Mr Derrida and his followers) threaten to become unintelligible. If all forms of expression are equally worthy of study and comment, there is little point in struggling to understand complex works.
Deconstruction's tendency to undermine itself, along with everything else, has led David Lode, a novelist, to compare it to ""sawing off the branch on which you are sitting"". Deconstruction's followers say this only adds to the fun. But, of late, Mr Derrida seems to be having his doubts. In a recent interview he startled some of his admirers by declaring that he was a ""lover of tradition"" who believed that all students should have a rounding in the ""great texts"".

Noam Choms is a celebrated professor of linguistics. But it is his political beliefs that have made him house-guru to America's conspiracy-theorising left. Mr Chomsky thinks that the world is run for the benefit of a few giant corporations; American foreign policy is murderously imperialist; American democracy is empty of content, a process of ""elite decision-making and periodic public ratification"". The working masses are duped into voting against their interests by the media, which are part of the elite's propaganda machine.
Mr Choms's heyday was the Vietnam war. His complaints have a slightly dated air these days. At his best Mr Chomsky is capable of asking sharp and disconcerting questions about American government and the role of intellectuals in defining debate. At his worst he can seem completely detached from reality. Nonetheless he still has followers, particularly among disgruntled graduate students. To them Mr Chomsky is ""America's leading dissident"", a radical voice in the wilderness who has divined the true nature of the powers-that-be. Mr Chomsky often describes himself as a ""libertarian socialist"" and seems to be hoping for the advent of an anarchist utopia.
Like most acts of Edith, Mr Chomsky's theories are diligently circular. Inconvenient facts are inherently suspect, since they have been mediated by a press which is in the pay of big business. So what if the American media seem to be more liberal than the American population at large? That only proves the fiendish subtlety of the American establishment's system for ""manufacturing consent"". Presumably the fact that Mr Chomsky himself is a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a bastion of the American establishment, can be explained in the same way.

Whereas Noam Chomsky, a libertarian leftie, believes that multinationals control the world, Ayn Rand--the heroine of America's libertarian right--argued that big business was ""America's persecuted minority"". Rand died in 1982. Her philosophy thrives and her books still sell half a million copies a year, thanks to a plethora of outfits designed acquaint the world with her thoughts. The Ayn Rand Institute, based in Los Angeles and founded in 1985, aims ""to overturn the hostility toward reason, individualism and capitalism on the par of today's writers and thinkers"". Second Renaissance Books, in Oceanside, California, sells leatherbound editions of ""Atlas Shrugged"" as well as tapes of her lectures. Conferences devoted to Rand's principles are held regularly: when the organisers advertised the summer conference of 1992, they promised that the gathering would be ""the most rational place on earth.""
Rand labelled her philosophy objectivism and described it as ""the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute"". The Reagan presidency provided opportunities for a few objectivists to try their hand at their most hated institution: government. The most celebrated Randist even survived the passing of the Reagan years. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, was an acolyte of Rand's in the 1960s. Presumably he no longer believes Rand's argument that ""every government interference in the economy consists of giving an unearned benefit, extorted by force, to some men at the expense of others.""

If one of the characteristics proper to gurus is charisma, it is perhaps no surprise that they are rare in the world of high technology --a place where even the most rudimentary social skills (grammatical conversation, eating with utensils) are in short supply. Nicholas Negroponte, the founder and director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media Lab, fills that gap in the market nicely. For a nerd he is unusually dapper; better still, he talks about some of the most futuristic research imaginable in language the Media Lab's corporate sponsors (and journalists) can comprehend.
The eight-year-old research centre dedicated to ""inventing the future"" is Mr Negroponte's life work. Shorn of pretensions, this means devising smart technologies that let users interact more intuitively with information. ""Personalisation"" is the Media Lab's guiding theme: its projects include an electronic newspaper that ""knows"" which stories you want to read (the Daily Me).
Mr Negroponte's guruviness rests on his ideas about digital technology and its role in the convergence of telephony, TV, computing and publishing. When he first talked about this two decades ago, he was considered a borderline nut-case; a proposal he submitted to the government in 1975 called ""multimedia computing"" was accepted on condition that the first word be removed because it sounded silly. Now companies are betting billions on the multimedia age.
Such prescience has done nothing for Mr Negroponte's modesty. Of one of the world's leading researchers on high-definition television he says: ""A very nice man-pity he knows absolutely nothing about TV."" A related defect is that Mr Negroponte often seems to assume that everyone is as focused and clever as he is, and hence to have a rather too optimistic view of how quickly people will go from couch potatoes to couch commandos. Still, he has been right more often than wrong--which is more than can Is be said for a far more famous media-technology guru, the late Marshall McLuhan.

And finally, the real thing India invented the word ""guru"". Its most colourful living example is Sathya Sai Baba (true and holy father), denounced by many as a shaman but revered by millions as a saint.
Other Indian gurus, such as Bhagwan Rajneesh (deported by American immigration authorities before his death in 1991) and Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, went abroad to test new markets. Sai Baba stayed home and succeeded splendidly. His message of peace and love, like his beatific smile, has not changed since he was a child prodigy. Now he is more popular than ever-so much so that his hometown of Puttaparthi, a couple of hours' drive from Hyderabad, boasts a new airstrip. Disciples say he is richer than the pope--and, you may therefore feel, a better guide through life.
His 65th birthday celebrations in 1990 were attended by a former president of India. The new one is also a devotee. So are Narasimha Rao, the prime minister; Bettino Craxi, formerly prime minister of Italy; and J. R Jayewardene, former president of Sri Lanka. After an assassination attempt in the summer a senior minister flew from Delhi to oversee the investigation in person.
He has survived many such difficulties, starting with a scorpion bite when he was eight. After that his hands ban to drip ash and he was declared the incarnation of a holy figure who had lived earlier in the century. Many more miracles followed. Over the years dozens of implacable rationalists and other mischief-makers have tried to discredit him, but never successfully. Sai Baba has ignored, outlived or outpaced them all.
These days, miracle-wise, he concentrates on holy ash. But he is also a philanthropist, running more than 100 colleges, schools and an enormous hospital for the poor. Judges, politicians, bureaucrats and film stars cringe and crave an audience. Tom Peters, eat your heart out.

And things are now looking good for his second half, for after a deftly resolved political crisis he has bounced back strongly enough to restart economic reform in next month's budget.
Mr Rao's bad patch began on December 21st, when an all-party committee produced a report on a two-year-old banking scandal. The report heavily criticised two members of the government--the health minister, B. Shankaranand, and the rural-development minister, Rameshwar Thakur--along with the finance ministry. The finance minister, Manmohan Singh, architect of the government's reforms, was not picked on personally, but was held to be ultimately responsible for officials' mistakes.
The government's opponents saw the publication of the report as a fine opportunity to further their various ends. The left demanded Mr Singh's resignation in the hope of putting a stop to free-marketry. The right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party, in disarray after a poor performance in state elections in November, attacked Mr Singh as a way of getting at Mr Rao. Within the Congress party, MPS who dislike liberalisation because it undermines their power muttered against the finance minister.
Mr Singh, in keeping with his reputation as a man of honour, offered his resignation. For a week Mr Rao made no response. Some Indians said this was just what one would expect of a man regarded as a ditherer. Others argued that there was method in his procrastination. Whether by chance or by design, nothing turned out to be the right thing to do, for the news that Mr Singh had offered to resign was followed by a spontaneous surge of support for the finance minister and his policies.
The criticism that had bogged the reforms down for most of the past year suddenly dissipated. Businessmen realised that if they lost Mr Singh they risked political instability, a loss of the international credibility that Mr Singh had won India, and the possibility of something worse than an over-enthusiastic liberaliser. Many of those in the "" Bombay club"" of critics, who in the past had spoken against the spread of foreign ownership and foreign goods, came out for Mr Singh. So did the press, much of which had earlier accused Mr Singh of handing over control of the Indian economy to the World Bank and the IMF.
When on December 31st Mr Rao said he was not accepting Mr Singh's resignation, there was general relief. Rahul Bajaj, chairman of Bajaj Auto and the most dynamic of the Bombay clubbers, said ""this is great news. The country needs Manmohan Singh. If we have every honest person like him resigning, we will end up having only crooks running the country."" So Mr Singh has emerged from his trial with honour, and with many former critics on side.
The day before Mr Singh's future was settled, the government got another seasonal gift: an overall majority. Since coming to power, Mr Rao's minority government has survived by grabbing temporary support from opposition splinter groups. On December 30th ten MPS from the remains of the Janata Dal threw in their lot with the Congress party. Mr Rao now has 266 MPS in the 528-member lower house. A cabinet reshuffle is expected, partly because Mr Rao has not had one for a year and partly because Congress's new friends will have to be rewarded. Mr Singh, however, is not expected to take a different job.
Mr Singh's boost is neatly timed to get him through an awkward budget. The economy is not behaving as the government had hoped. Industrial production is at last picking up, but only slowly. The forecast for economic growth in 1993-94 remains unimpressive. The government's finances are therefore out of kilter. The budget deficit, which shrank for two years, is now growing again. In 1992-93 it was 5.7% of GDP; the target for this fiscal year is 4.7%, but the figure is likely to be above 6%. Inflation, which seemed to be under control, is now rising again.
Mr Singh will need to raise government revenues, and is expected to do so through a value-added tax. He is also likely to try to sort out the system of customs and excise duties. For a range of goods, high customs duties on imported components, along with high excise duties on domestic products, impose a bigger overall tax on homemade goods than on imported finished products.
Other budgetary benefits for business are expected. Interest rates are likely to come down, as part of the slow process of reforming the state-owned banking system. High interest rates for business currently subsidise cheap money for the government. The government has gone some way towards getting rid of that distortion, and the minimum commercial lending rate came down in three steps in 1993 from 18% to 15%.
Cutting interest rates will make Mr Singh no enemies, but he may take a shot at a tougher task: rewriting labour legislation. At present, any company with more than 100 employees must get permission from the state or central government to cut its labour force. Permission is almost never given. The unions will resist any change, probably violently. Yet such rules discourage businessmen from taking on new people; and new jobs are what the economy will need most as privatisation starts to shake underemployed workers out of inefficient state industries.
India's unions are strong, and closely linked to its politicians; so labour law will be hard for the government to reform. Yet Mr Rao is now in a better position to show resolve than since he first came to power. Next month's budget will demonstrate whether he plans to use the second half of his term usefully.","Surviving half a parliamentary term does not sound like much of an achievement , but Indian politics spits out leaders so often that Narasimha Rao has become the only Indian prime minister outside the Nehru - Gandhi dynasty to have made it that far .

India is benefiting from the emerging market mania that has swept up investors around the world. Economic reforms since 1991 have restored macroeconomic balance in the country and slashed red tape. But IMF-induced austerity is not always a recipe for rapid growth, and India looks more a tortoise than a tiger.

When it submitted its report in December, the committee castiated Mr Singh for neglience, prompting his resignation. Mr Rao refused to accept it; and share prices went through the roof.
Although foreign financial institutions approved by the Reserve Bank of India have been permitted to invest in Indian stockmarkets since late 1992, political uncertainty deterred most of them from buying much until the middle of 1993. The Sensex then began to rise. Because trading in Indian stockmarkets is thin (daily turnover rarely exceeds $170m), a little money can make prices jump. Besides, the six-monthly results of companies showed a sharp increase in profits, sugesting that austerity was at last giving way to growth. Gung-ho investors have pushed the p/e ratios of some blue-chip companies to more than 100, though many smaller ones are still selling at less than ten times earnings.

For once, a national leader was being modest about his country's attractiveness. In the past year India's foreign exchange reserves have just about doubled to $11 billion, and are still rising by $30m a day. The reformist budget for 1994-95, to be presented to parliament on February 28th, could make India even more attractive. Yet the government is nervous rather than joyful. It thought earlier that it would need special financing from the International Monetary Fund until 1996, but is now looking for ways of discouraging the inflow of dollars.
There are three main reasons for the flood. First, India's trade gap has fallen to almost zero (from $3.6 billion last year). Exports will have moved ahead by 20% in the financial year ending in March, while imports have declined. The effects of IMF-induced austerity are still evident in India.
Second, partial convertibility of the rupee has resulted in the virtual disappearance of a black-market premium on the dollar. So Indian labourers in the Gulf are sending remittances home to relatives through official channels instead of the black market. This could swell reserves by an additional $1 billion this financial year.
Third, and most important, foreign investors (including overseas Indians) are rushing to buy Indian shares. In the Bombay exchange this week there was a hectic buying spree in anticipation of next week's budget. Foreign institutional investors will have bought some $1.2 billion of shares in the financial year 1993-94, and would have bought more but for problems in dealing with all the paperwork India requires. Indian companies find they have ready takers for equity and convertible bonds in Europe, and hope to raise more than $2 billion before the end of the financial year. Another 100 or so companies have applied for clearance to the finance ministry, which is deliberately going slow, to prevent a bunching of Indian issues that could depress the market in Europe. It is also discouraging Indian companies from raising money overseas, which adds to India's debt.
The ministry fears that portfolio investment can flood out as fast as it is flooding in. And foreign direct investment (ie, spending on factories and offices rather than shares) has also surged recently (see chart). (Chart omitted) Besides, the inflow of foreign money increases the money supply, stoking inflation (which has one up from a trough of 696 last summer to nearly 9%). And it tends to make the rupee appreciate, something that could make exports less competitive. India's reforms hinge critically on raising the share of exports in GNP. So the Reserve Bank of India has sold more than $6.5 billion worth of rupees to prevent the currency from strengthening. The Reserve Bank is also encouraging Indian companies to refinance high-interest foreign loans they had taken earlier. And it has lowered the interest rate on foreign currency deposits in India to just 0.5% above LIBOR, discouraging inflows of hot money.
Nobody believes the flood of dollars will continue for ever. Stockmarket prices already look forbiddingly high. And the huge capital issues by Indian companies abroad and at home should soon translate into an investment boom, which should suck in imports. Indian exporters are looking forward to that: they badly need a depreciating rupee to offset the impact of rising inflation.
While the government is nervous about its economic success, some opposition members of parliament are disgusted. President Sharma's speech was boycotted by some left-wing members, who said the economic reforms had been dictated by the World Bank and the IMF and had hit the poor with higher prices. The nationalist Hindu BJP, the main opposition, also walked out, but not before Mr Sharma had finished.
The prime minister, P.V. Narasimha Rao, should be able to get his government's budget approved without too much difficulty. In the past he has had some close calls over economic reforms and other issues, but his Congress party now has a majority as a result of defections from small opposition groups.","The Indian president , Shankar Dayal Sharma , told parliament this week that overseas investors were showing "" growing confidence "" in the country . For once , a national leader was being modest about his country 's attractiveness . In the past year India 's foreign exchange reserves have just about doubled to $ 11 billion , and are still rising by $ 30 m a day . The reformist budget for 1994 - 95 , to be presented to parliament on February 28th , could make India even more attractive . Yet the government is nervous rather than joyful . It thought earlier that it would need special financing from the International Monetary Fund until 1996 , but is now looking for ways of discouraging the inflow of dollars . 
 There are three main reasons for the flood . First , India 's trade gap has fallen to almost zero ( from $ 3.6 billion last year ) . Exports will have moved ahead by 20 % in the financial year ending in March , while imports have declined . The effects of IMF - induced austerity are still evident in India . 
 Second , partial convertibility of the rupee has resulted in the virtual disappearance of a black - market premium on the dollar . So Indian labourers in the Gulf are sending remittances home to relatives through official channels instead of the black market . This could swell reserves by an additional $ 1 billion this financial year . 
 Third , and most important , foreign investors ( including overseas Indians ) are rushing to buy Indian shares . In the Bombay exchange this week there was a hectic buying spree in anticipation of next week 's budget . Foreign institutional investors will have bought some $ 1.2 billion of shares in the financial year 1993 - 94 , and would have bought more but for problems in dealing with all the paperwork India requires .

China started its market reforms in 1978, and has since been haring along. India, after small spurts of reform in the early and middle years of the 1980s, started again in earnest only in 1991. Its GDP growth has been lumbering behind at an average of 3.1% a year since then (compared with China's average over the same period of 10.9%). Still, as all children know, the tortoise won in the end. As the economic and political risks in China become ever more evident, India's steadiness is looking increasingly attractive to investors. That makes the Indian budget announced on February 28th especially worrying (see page 37), for it suggests that the government is prepared to risk stability for a burst of speed.
The flow of foreign money into India demonstrates investors' new interest. Some $1 billion poured into Indian stock-markets in 1993, most of it in the second half of the year. In January, Morgan Stanley launched the first Indian mutual fund: hoping for $100m, it pulled in $300m within three days. New foreign direct investment, into factories rather than equities, reached $900m last year, compared with $200m in 1992. Of course, China is in a different league: in 1993, it attracted $15 billion-worth of direct investment.
Yet sentiment is shifting. This year, investors are sounding warier about China. India's political virtues were brought into sharp focus last month at the Chinese new year, when 89-year-old Den Xiaoping was, literally, held up in front of the cameras. China's government meant to reassure the world that he was still active; instead, it reminded foreigners how feeble are the shoulders on which China's political order rests and how uncertain the future once the battle for succession is joined. By contrast, India's Narasimha Rao looks a solid sort of fellow. More important, his survival matters less to India than Mr Den's does to China, for India settled the question of political succession in 1947. Religious riots and sporadic secessionism notwithstanding, India's democratic system is secure.
Foreign businessmen are also attracted by the institutional depth which India has and China does not. India has a well-developed legal system and courts that enforce it with reasonable objectivity. It has something like a modern financial system, with stockmarkets on which over 6,000 firms are listed, and a regulatory system that, prodded by recent scandals, is developing into one foreign investors feel they can trust. For its part, China lacks an independent legal system, a code of private-property rights, an effective central bank, developed financial markets, a banking system and bankruptcy laws.
India's institutional maturity provides the government with the tools for economic management. In 1991 it set out to use them to stabilise the economy. Within two years it had shrunk the budget deficit from 8.4% of GDP to 5.2%. By contrast, when overheating began to worry China's government last year, Zhu Rongji, the country's new economic supremo, threatened to ""chop off the heads"" of officials who defied his orders to stem the flow of credit into the economy. Inflation is showing little sign of responding to this subtle signal: in December 1993 it was running at 17.6%, compared with 6.7% a year earlier.
India is solid, but has yet fully to unleash its entrepreneurial potential; China is more exciting but also more dangerous. Both countries are trying to change. At the Communist Party plenum last November, China announced a programme to create a properly functioning central bank, foster an independent banking system, develop commercial law and sort out the tax system. These changes cannot be made quickly, or easily: there is currently a row between Beijing and the provinces over a proposed new value-added tax; confusion over a new capital-gains tax is depressing China's fledgling markets; and the commission trying to draw up a law to regulate financial markets is struggling with a seventh draft. Meanwhile, however, India is trying to throw away its solidity without being able to match China's vigour.
GROWTH OR BUST
The Indian government's priority is growth: while China is struggling to hold its growth rate down to 9% in 1994, India's looks like ending up at 3.8% in the fiscal year that ends this month. Hence this dangerous budget. While continuing to liberalise the economy, the government seems to be ignoring the need for fiscal responsibility. The target for the budget deficit for 1993-94 was 4.7% of GDP; the out-turn is likely to be 73%. There is no suggestion of how the gap might be filled. The government has done nothing either to cut expenditure or to reduce its vast public sector. Inflation is already running at 8.6%, up from 4.5% in the middle of last year.
The finance minister, Manmohan Singh, is hoping that growth will produce the revenues to fill this budgetary gap. Optimists point to the 21%X rise in exports in the first ten months of 1993-94. Yet exports, which make up a tiny proportion of India's GDP, say little about the big picture. Industrial production as a whole has grown by less than 2% for the past two years: good weather accounts for most of the recent growth in GDP.
India's impatience is understandable: it has been frustrating to watch its great rival pull ahead. But if inflation and government finances et out of control, the country could lose its reputation for steadiness. Asia's success stories argue that macroeconomic stability is a necessary condition for long-term prosperity. The tortoise did not win by pretending to be a hare.","Over the past decade , there has been no serious contest between Asia 's two giants .

A YEAR ago it seemed that militant Hinduism of the kind espoused by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was an idea whose time had come. But a Supreme Court judgment on March 11th suggests that its time may now have one: religious militants may never again be able to come to power, at either state or national level.
After Hindu fanatics demolished the mosque at Ayodhya in December 1992, Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, dismissed BJP governments in four states and imposed direct rule from the centre. The legality of these actions was questioned, and the High Court in one state struck down the government's dismissal. The Supreme Court has now reversed that ruling, holding that secularism is a basic feature of the Indian constitution, and that any state government breaking the principle of secularism can be sacked by the central government.
This could change the contours of Indian politics. In state elections last autumn, the BJP toned down its strident Hinduism, and lost three of the four states. Hardliners in the party have since been arguing that the BJP needs to revive the religious issue if it is to regain its momentum in the two years before an election is due. The Supreme Court ruling has put paid to that idea.
Moderates within the BJP, including L.K. Advani, the party president, have been strengthened by the court verdict. They will still seek to use Hindu nationalism as a vote-getter, but without launching campaigns explicitly directed against Muslims. There is a good chance, then, that Indian politics will become more peaceable than it has been in the past few years.
Yet some confusion about the judgment remains. How secular is secular? Can the rulers in Delhi sack any state government which insists that religion and politics are inseparable? That might include the Sikh party, the Akali Dal, which has often run Punjab in the past; whoever wins any future election in the Muslim-majority state of Kashmir; and the Indian Union Muslim League, which has. often been part of ruling coalitions in Kerala.
At the same time as bolstering secularism, the Supreme Court has greatly reduced the power of the central government to sack state governments at will. This power has been used more than 100 times since 1947. The Supreme Court has decided that such dismissals are subject to judicial review, and has declared invalid the central rule declared in Nagaland in 1988, Karnatak in 1989 and Meghalaya in 1991.
In future the central government will need a recommendation from the governor of the state and the agreement of both houses of Parliament to dismiss a state government, and the courts will be able to revive dissolved assemblies. So the verdict is sobering not only for the BJP but also for the Congress party, which usually runs central government and has misused its power there for decades. For other Indians it should be encouraging, for it constrains the politicians whose excesses have pushed India towards violence and disorder.","DELHI

The forthcoming GATT ministerial meeting to ratify the Uruguay round has succeeded in rousing enough passion.
Even though India will gain from the opening of markets for its manufactures, and despite the brilliant performance of its ambassador to GATT, Balkrishan Zutshi, who is reckoned to have out-negotiated the Americans, many Indians persist in believing that the whole exercise is a foreign conspiracy to exploit the third world. In a two-day parliamentary debate this week, all the opposition parties tore into the government, saying it had sacrificed the country's sovereignty to GATT. Left-wing parties are planning a huge demonstration in Delhi on April 5th. A farmers' protest is gaining strength in the southern state of Karnatka. And the chief ministers of four opposition-run states say they will ask the courts to stop the government ratifying the agreement.
They will probably fail, but there may be other hurdles ahead. Although the government does not need parliamentary approval to sin the Uruguay round, there are several provisions on intellectual property in the agreement that will require legislation on plant breeders' rights, drug patents, copyright and integrated circuits.
Narasimha Rao, India's prime minister, came to power in 1991 as head of a minority government, and has managed to hang on by playing off the opposition on the left against that on the right. Defections have n now given him a small majority in the lower house, but he remains in a minority in the upper house. So, if his opponents stay united, he will find it hard to push through the legislation that the Uruguay round entails. If Mr Rao were forced by a united opposition to opt out of GATT, his entire economic-reform programme would be imperilled. However, the Uruguay round gives signatories plenty of time to change their laws, and Mr Rao is hoping that the political mood will shift in due course. Some of the opposition to GATT is based on myth, some on reality. The main criticisms are:
* A new copyright law will raise the prices of seed, and farmers will be forbidden to sell patented seed. True, but seed constitutes a tiny part of the cost of farming. And since going to law is slow and expensive, and Indian farms are generally small, no plant breeder will find it worthwhile to sue farmers for their modest seed sales.
* GATT will force the government to cut subsidies for farmers' fertilisers, water and power. This not true. GATT does set an upper limit for such subsidies, but India's fall below it. The government has begun cutting subsidies, but if any international bodies are responsible they are the World Bank and the IMF, which have been advising the government on economic reforms.
* GATT will raise the price of drugs. Currently, Indian patents depend not on the design of a drug but on the process by which it is made, so companies have devised alternative processes to manufacture drugs still under patent internationally. These drugs sell in India for as little as one-tenth of the world price. GATT will oblige India in future to give patents for the drugs themselves, not the manufacturing process, and to extend patent life from seven years to 20. This will raise the price in India of around 10-15% of drugs sold.
* GATT will force India to abandon its subsidised ration shops for grain and other basic goods. This criticism is simply false: subsidies to farmers may be limited by GATT, but not subsidies to consumers.
In a country where 73% of the population is rural and half is illiterate, many villagers are nonetheless scared that they will be hit by the impact on seed sales of new rules on intellectual-property rights. Farmers' groups in north and south India have opposed the Uruguay round. Only in western India do farm groups see a net advantage in the new export opportunities provided by GATT.
Besides, there is a deep xenophobic streak in India. Indians are instinctively suspicious of a new agreement which binds them to what are seen as western rules for agriculture, medicine, investment, trade and services. The fact that India's economic reforms were financed by the IWF adds to the belief that the country is bowing to foreign pressure. Mr Rao badly needs a booming economy to prove that India will be a net gainer from the new outward turn. Unfortunately, industrial production and investment remain slack, a legacy of austerity induced by the IMF.","Since India 's quarrelsome opposition parties range from the religious right to the far left , it takes strong emotions to unite them .

CRUDE DISGUISES AND FLYING PIGS
Some complaints of social dumping hardly deserve to be taken seriously. Those who reard it as ""unfair"" for Chinese workers, say, to be paid less than American ones, and who call for tariffs to redress the balance, are in truth opposed to all trade between rich and poor countries. This is extreme protectionism in the crudest possible disuise. When its advocates claim as well to have the best interests of developin4country workers in mind, they are surely hypocrites too. Countries cannot pay their workers more merely by deciding to do so. They must first produce more, and the best way to spur growth is to trade.
What oes for waes applies as well to other labour costs. To insist on a levelling of ""working conditions""--closer equality in hours worked each week, standards of health and safety in the workplace, entitlements to holidays, health care, sick-pay, pensions and so forth--would be in every case to insist on a standard of living that poor countries, being poor, cannot afford. Leal rihts over such terms of employment may exist in most industrial countries, but rihts under the law (which are freely modified as circum'stances dictate) should not be confused with more basic human rihts (which are not).
Other concerns, however, cannot be so easily dismissed. Slavery, which is wicked, is still practised in some developing countries. Children should be educated, not sat at looms or made to cany bricks all day. Workers should have the rihts of assembly and free speech--which, in some developing countries, they are denied. In cases such as these, basic freedoms are at stake. You do not need to be rich to outlaw slavely or grant the rihts of free speech and assembly; education is costly, but curbing the cruellest sorts of child labour is widely affordable. Therefore, is it not riht to put pressure on offending third-world overnments to chane their ways? If there is a reasonable chance that the pressure will work, and ifit does not put other interests at risk, the answer is Yes.
Granting that pressure may sometimes bejustified, why not let trade policybe the means? Free-traders, such as this newspaper, would like to answer that pressuref this kind never works. In fact, it often does. ainst lalge countries and small, America has often ot its way by threatening trade restrictions. The case aainst such a policy is not that it cannot achieve its narrow objective, but that it puts other interests--America's own, as well as those of the rest of the world--in jeopardy.
The difficulty can be stated simply enouh: overnments cannot be tnsted with trade policy. If, as trade-policy activists implicitly assume, governments were competent and dedicated to the public good, there would be less to wony about. The case for trade policy in pursuit of basic human rihts would be more persuasive (thouh low-flying Pis would be a terrible nuisance). The institutions that liberal democracies use to rule themselves are needed precisely because overnments in the real world are often incompetent and always subject to demands from narrow, oranised interests. The GATT is one of these needed institutions--an especially necessary one, because trade policy is an area in which overnments, left to themselves, are especially unreliable. The GATT was created in the first place because its founders understood that the pressure to protect producers is intense; without an occasional exchane of multilateral trade concessions, governments would find liberal trade impossible to achieve.
They were rihT: only consider how close the Unuay round was to collapsing last year, or the ferocity of opposition to the North American Free-Trade A9reement, or the sharp rise during the 1980s of new forms of non-tariffprotection, Liberal trade is uner perpetual attack. To beat it back, overnments need to strenthen the GATT and at evely opportunity undermine its enemies.
If industrial countries insist on bringing labour-related rihts into the multilateral trade talks, theywill do the opposite. The GATT will be weakened because its agreement-by-consensus approach cannot accommodate such controversial issues. At the same time the GATT'S foes will be strenthened by each new admissible round for trade restrictions. For instance, a trade rule on child labour miht keep countries in which that practice is common (whether or not leal) out of the WTO; On the other hand, ifa countryjoined the WTO after signing up for the rule, but was then unable to enforce it, it would be prey to wely species of rich-countty protectionist, henceforth equipped with new grounds to seek trade sanctions. In the battle between liberal trade on one side and the protectionism that helps to keep poor countries poor on the other, the balance would have shifted decisively in the wrong direction.
Those who truly seek to advance the cause of human rihts in the third world should weih this carefully--and reluctantly conclude that the costs of pressing for new links between trade and basic human rights outweih the likely benefits. They should call for diplomatic pressure instead;and tell rich-country consumers about human-rihts abuses, then let them make up their own minds about whose oods to buy. That is bound to strike many as inadequate. But in reality most lobbyists seek to use human rihts asjust another way to raise old-fashioned barriers aainst poor countries' exports, caring little for human rights, caring nothing for the pliht of the third world's poor, caring nothing for the freedoms of industrial-country consumers.

Now it seems that next week's gathering of world trade ministers in Marrakesh, Morocco, may be a darker affair. They are meeting to sign the areement hammered out during the seven-year Uruuay round of world trade talks. But the prospects for world trade have become clouded since the final negotiating session in Geneva in December. This cloud, no biger yet than a man's hand, is growing fast.
In recent weeks America and France have been pressing for an addition to the declaration from Marrakesh.

They are developing new software for western companies such as Reebok and Nestle. Thanks to a satellite link built by the government, their terminals are hooked to a network that keeps them wired to their customers in America and Europe. The workers, all graduates of India's seven institutes of technology, earn around 30,000 rupees ($960) a month--about one-eighth of their counterparts' salaries in America.
Their employer, Infosys, which now has international sales of $10m and a market capitalisation of $70m, was started by a group of Indian software workers in 1980. But not all of ""the new India"" has such recent roots. Down the road, also attached to the same satellite network, is Wipro Infotech, the software subsidiary of Wipro, a family-owned trading group which was once known best for its vegetable oils but which the younger generation of the family is trying to focus on technology. Over 80% of Wipro Infotech's sales of $80m come from exports to American high-tech clients such as AT&T, Intel and Sun Microsystems.
With a climate as dry as California's and a wealth of local technical talent, Bangalore is India's Silicon Valley. Foreign multinationals such as IBM, Texas Instruments, Digital Equipment Corporation, Hewlett Packard, Motorola and 3M have set up local operations. And the city will soon have a $150m science park on its doorstep.
Bangalore has become a symbol of India's business potential. Until July 1991, that potential was limited by the government's command-and-control economic policy. This smothered local businesses in endless regulations and protected them from foreign competition with tariffs and import bans. Since then a policy of liberalisation has slashed tariffs and hacked away many petty regulation's. The stockmarket has soared 195%, with foreigners rushing to invest. To its boosters from Bombay to Wall Street, India looks like a politically safe alternative to China: an entrepreneurial treasure trove, with British laws, fairish elections, an emerging middle class-and factory wages of barely $100 a month.
Pessimists see Bangalore in a different light: as a glamorous exception. Bangalore's 5,000 computer professionals are easy to lose in a country of some 890m people, two-thirds of whom live of the land. Bangalore's software exports of $220m a year are a tenth of its exports of gems and jewellry. India's GDP of $250 billion is half China's. And its number of jobless people, officially underestimated at 30m, is as high as that of the whole OECD. More important, while Bangalore is looking forward, much of Indian business is stuck in the past.
Despite reform, laws still prevent managers from closing loss-making plants without government permission. Policies and laws welcoming foreign investors at the national level have not always been so warmly embraced by state governments. Years of protection have done nothing for design, quality or service.
Indeed, the heart of Indian business--the monsters created by the ""licence raj"" and tariff walls--has reacted grumpily to liberalisation. India's sprawling conglomerates, such as the Tata, Birla and Thapar groups (which tether account for about 14% of the Bombay Stock Exchange) are now swarming with western management consultants bearing rationalisation plans. Tata has already started disposals-selling its soap business to Unilever and quitting a soft-drinks joint venture with PepsiCo.
Last autumn a group of Indian business men met in a hotel in Bombay to discuss their woes. Pressure from the ""Bombay Club"", as it is now known, helped persuade the government to give industry tax-breaks worth over $1 billion last month. Caught between business, public-sector unions, farmers and state governments, the national government is nervous about proceeding with further reforms, such as making it easier to fire workers. How much has Indian business really changed?
A DIFFERENT SORT OF INDIA
""Liberalisation is irresistible,"" claims Dr S.L. Rao, head of India's National Council for Applied Economic Research (NCAER). Import duties, which reached 300% in 1991, are falling again this year--from 85% to an average of 65%. They should be down to 25% by 1998. The government has also loosened currency controls, making the rupee fully convertible for trade purposes. Foreign companies can now own majority stakes in Indian businesses, and Indian firms can raise capital abroad. Capital-gains tax has been cut from 40% to 30%; corporate taxes were reduced this year from 50% to 40%.
Some of the reddest tape, such as licences needed to extend production, have gone. ""It's like a breath of fresh air,"" says P.M. Sinha, chairman of Pepsi Foods India. Overseas Indians have returned, scenting money. For example, the Hinduja trading group, based in London, now controls the Indian Ashok Leyland company, which will soon produce 60,000 Ford Cargo vans a year in Hosur in southern India. Its president, Gopichand Hinduja, says each van costs $13,000 to make. That is half what it used to cost to make them in England.
However, for many local businessmen the effects of liberalisation have been uneven. While India's software business is booming, its tiny computer-assembly business is in disarray. Managers blame a three-tiered system of import duties. This is meant to charge low duties for raw materials and higher ones for completed imports. However, some components, such as disk-drives, now carry an 80% import duty--against 50% for finished computers. Even successful firms are feeling the pinch. TVs Electronics, India's leading computer-peripherals firm, reckons its sales will row at least 40% this year; but, as trade barriers come down, the company is also setting up as an importer to ensure its survival.
Another group of Indian companies was caught out by the speed with which tariffs were cut. Many had invested heavily in machinery and equipment, imported while the duties were high. Titan Watches, a Tata company, spent around $50m turning a greenfield site in Tamil Nadu into a modern watch factory stuffed with imported Swiss machinery. Titan's new watches have been a runaway success, but its managing director, Xerxes Desai, still favours a layer of duties specifically to protect companies that invested in plant before duties came down.
Such grumbles may rise to a clamour when the government eventually removes its ban on imported consumer goods. An end to the ban would free Indian consumers to buy better or cheaper goods than those made locally. Yet the impact on local manufacturers might be softer than expected. For one thing, food imports will be subject to tariffs. And foreign firms, such as Procter & Gamble and Unilever, already have joint ventures in India; they will not undermine their local operations immediately.
Rahul Bajaj, the Bombay Club's spokesman, says he is not opposed to liberalisation, provided that its scope is limited. ""If the bottom 10% or 20% of firms is taken over or Forced to close, that is inevitable and acceptable,"" he says. ""But if the top ten are also threatened then we will have to ask the government to deal with it."" The Club's biggest concern appears to be stopping foreign investors from taking over family-controlled public companies.
Bombay Clubmen also rail against constraints on local managers. Indian companies are forced to seek permission from the state government before they can close a factory or a business. According to Mr Bajaj, permission has never been granted since the law was introduced in 1976. Instead, factories close by refusing to pay their electricity bills, and so having the power cut off. Every time industrialists ask the government to bring in ""an exit policy"" (as freedom to hire and fire is known), Delhi shuffles its feet and does nothing.
However uneven, India's business revolution seems set to continue. One reason has to do with economic policy. Since reform started, inflation has fallen from 15.7% to 9.1%, and the economy is growing at around 4% a year. Exports last year rose almost 20% in dollar terms. Foreign direct and portfolio investment has swollen from a trickle to around $3 billion in the past year. ""India is one of the few countries undertaking an economic revolution where economic conditions have improved almost from day one,"" says D.R Pendse, an economic consultant in Bombay.
The other reason is India's emerging middle class. More than 150m Indians belong to well-educated families with salaries worth more than $4,000 a year in local purchasing power. McKinsey, a management consultancy, reckons that a sustained taste for foreign consumer durables begins at an income of only $2,000 a year.
WINNERS AND LOSERS
The Confederation of Indian Industry has commissioned a study to assess which Indian industrial sectors will be competitive as tariffs come down. Its results are not published yet, but losers will probably include steel, computer hardware and mechanical engineering goods. Other sectors--notably bicycles and motorcycles, heavy lorries and parts of the chemical industry--are likely to be able to hold their own. Industries such as software, textiles, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, leather goods, gems and jewellery may be able to export more.
Two types of company look particularly vulnerable. The first is the state-owned sector of 237 firms, which accounts for about 9% of GDP. Losses at around half these firms totalled $1.5 billion last year. Hopeless cases include Hindustan Fertilisers, India Iron and Steel Co and Heavy Engineering Corporation. Even with a 50% duty still in place, imported steel coils cost 700 rupees a tonne less than those sold by India's state-owned steel industry, though other steel products are competitive.
The other vulnerable group comprises the sprawling companies produced by the licence raj. India's biggest industrial empire, the Tata family group, is a $5 billion industrial network of businesses with loose shareholding links. Built by the legendary J.R.D. Tata, who died last year, it employs 78,000 workers, with activities ranging from steel, chemicals and tea to cars, lorries, hotels and wrist watches.
Such companies may not last in their present form. ""Those firms which are run by chromosomes, not competence, won't survive,"" argues Dr Rao at the NCAER. Even Tata managers admit that some of their kind will go under as tariff walls come down, undermining the old defences of paternalism, politics and protectionism. Younger groups, such as Ruia, Dhoot and the Ambani family's Reliance Chemical empire (see box on previous page), may find it easier to change.
ENTER THE FOREIGNER
Like everything else in India's liberalisation, the entrance of foreign firms has been a messy affair. Six months ago Ramesh Chauhan, boss of Parle, a soft-drinks firm with 60% of India's market, sold his soft-drink brands to Coca-Cola for over $60m. In 1977, Coca-Cola quit India, when the government, influenced by Mr Chauhan, asked the firm to hand over both its secret formula and control of its Indian subsidiary. Mr Chauhan also organised a political campaign (in which some 5,000 parliamentary questions were asked) to delay PepsiCo's return.
Pepsi was finally allowed back in 1989. Since then, it has bought out its Indian partners and seems bent on expansion. It is spending $40m brining its Pizza Hut and Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants into the country. Pepsi Foods India says that each of these companies will employ 15,000 people directly and generate hundreds of thousands more jobs around the country in restaurants and their suppliers. McDonald's may follow--if it can do without beefburgers in the land of the sacred cow.
In the motor industry, America's General Motors has teamed up with Hindustan Motor, par of the Birla family group, to start producing Opel Astra cars. Germany's Mercedes-Benz has said its partnership with Telco (part of Tata) will being assembling its E-class cars in a new factory in Poona. Ford and Volkswagen are also said to have plans for India. Suzuki of Japan now owns half of Maruti, originally a 100% state-owned car firm which has productivity as good as many plants in Europe or America.
Since liberalisation started three years ago, approval has been given for some $5 billion of foreign projects--over half in the past year alone. Two electrical groups, GE of America and Asea Brown Boveri of Europe, have proclaimed their intention to have sales of $1 billion in India by the end of the decade. Enron, a Texas gas company, has won permission to build India's first private power plant to meet its chronic shortage of electricity. Foreign companies are behind bids to introduce mobile phone services in four big cities. Even Mr Bajaj welcomes foreign investment in such infrastructure projects.
It is, of course, easy to find weaknesses in the way India's businessmen have reacted to the reforms. Too many of them squeal about the protective tariffs that have been cut, instead of counting themselves lucky for the whopping duties that remain. Too few even pay lip-service to the idea that in any open economy--such as India now considers itself--some ownership will pass into foreign hands. For suppliers of an economy growing at 4% a year, India's businessmen are a surprisingly miserable bunch.
Compared with the way they were, however, managers are changing. Groups such as Reliance and the small companies like the TVs group around Bangalore are measuring themselves by global yardsticks. Even among those most afraid of foreign competition, there is a widespread acceptance that liberalisation will continue. There may be setbacks--if, for instance, government spending fails to come under control and inflation undermines the early progress--but not even the most grumpy businessmen want to return to the licence raj.
This consensus matters. Pessimists will say that it rules out an economic miracle as explosive as China's. Yet china's businessmen live on the edge of a political volcano. Though India's messy march to prosperity may look less exciting, it may also prove more consistent.","In an office block in the centre of Bangalore, 500 young men and women sit in several large open rooms, grouped in twos and threes around computer work stations.

The Club's biggest concern appears to be stopping foreign investors from taking over family-controlled public companies.
Bombay Clubmen also rail against constraints on local managers. Indian companies are forced to seek permission from the state government before they can close a factory or a business. According to Mr Bajaj, permission has never been granted since the law was introduced in 1976. Instead, factories close by refusing to pay their electricity bills, and so having the power cut off. Every time industrialists ask the government to bring in ""an exit policy"" (as freedom to hire and fire is known), Delhi shuffles its feet and does nothing.
However uneven, India's business revolution seems set to continue. One reason has to do with economic policy. Since reform started, inflation has fallen from 15.7% to 9.1%, and the economy is growing at around 4% a year. Exports last year rose almost 20% in dollar terms. Foreign direct and portfolio investment has swollen from a trickle to around $3 billion in the past year. ""India is one of the few countries undertaking an economic revolution where economic conditions have improved almost from day one,"" says D.R Pendse, an economic consultant in Bombay.
The other reason is India's emerging middle class. More than 150m Indians belong to well-educated families with salaries worth more than $4,000 a year in local purchasing power. McKinsey, a management consultancy, reckons that a sustained taste for foreign consumer durables begins at an income of only $2,000 a year.
WINNERS AND LOSERS
The Confederation of Indian Industry has commissioned a study to assess which Indian industrial sectors will be competitive as tariffs come down. Its results are not published yet, but losers will probably include steel, computer hardware and mechanical engineering goods. Other sectors--notably bicycles and motorcycles, heavy lorries and parts of the chemical industry--are likely to be able to hold their own. Industries such as software, textiles, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, leather goods, gems and jewellery may be able to export more.
Two types of company look particularly vulnerable. The first is the state-owned sector of 237 firms, which accounts for about 9% of GDP. Losses at around half these firms totalled $1.5 billion last year. Hopeless cases include Hindustan Fertilisers, India Iron and Steel Co and Heavy Engineering Corporation. Even with a 50% duty still in place, imported steel coils cost 700 rupees a tonne less than those sold by India's state-owned steel industry, though other steel products are competitive.
The other vulnerable group comprises the sprawling companies produced by the licence raj. India's biggest industrial empire, the Tata family group, is a $5 billion industrial network of businesses with loose shareholding links. Built by the legendary J.R.D. Tata, who died last year, it employs 78,000 workers, with activities ranging from steel, chemicals and tea to cars, lorries, hotels and wrist watches.
Such companies may not last in their present form. ""Those firms which are run by chromosomes, not competence, won't survive,"" argues Dr Rao at the NCAER. Even Tata managers admit that some of their kind will go under as tariff walls come down, undermining the old defences of paternalism, politics and protectionism. Younger groups, such as Ruia, Dhoot and the Ambani family's Reliance Chemical empire (see box on previous page), may find it easier to change.
ENTER THE FOREIGNER
Like everything else in India's liberalisation, the entrance of foreign firms has been a messy affair. Six months ago Ramesh Chauhan, boss of Parle, a soft-drinks firm with 60% of India's market, sold his soft-drink brands to Coca-Cola for over $60m. In 1977, Coca-Cola quit India, when the government, influenced by Mr Chauhan, asked the firm to hand over both its secret formula and control of its Indian subsidiary. Mr Chauhan also organised a political campaign (in which some 5,000 parliamentary questions were asked) to delay PepsiCo's return.
Pepsi was finally allowed back in 1989. Since then, it has bought out its Indian partners and seems bent on expansion. It is spending $40m brining its Pizza Hut and Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants into the country. Pepsi Foods India says that each of these companies will employ 15,000 people directly and generate hundreds of thousands more jobs around the country in restaurants and their suppliers. McDonald's may follow--if it can do without beefburgers in the land of the sacred cow.
In the motor industry, America's General Motors has teamed up with Hindustan Motor, par of the Birla family group, to start producing Opel Astra cars. Germany's Mercedes-Benz has said its partnership with Telco (part of Tata) will being assembling its E-class cars in a new factory in Poona. Ford and Volkswagen are also said to have plans for India. Suzuki of Japan now owns half of Maruti, originally a 100% state-owned car firm which has productivity as good as many plants in Europe or America.
Since liberalisation started three years ago, approval has been given for some $5 billion of foreign projects--over half in the past year alone. Two electrical groups, GE of America and Asea Brown Boveri of Europe, have proclaimed their intention to have sales of $1 billion in India by the end of the decade. Enron, a Texas gas company, has won permission to build India's first private power plant to meet its chronic shortage of electricity. Foreign companies are behind bids to introduce mobile phone services in four big cities. Even Mr Bajaj welcomes foreign investment in such infrastructure projects.
It is, of course, easy to find weaknesses in the way India's businessmen have reacted to the reforms. Too many of them squeal about the protective tariffs that have been cut, instead of counting themselves lucky for the whopping duties that remain. Too few even pay lip-service to the idea that in any open economy--such as India now considers itself--some ownership will pass into foreign hands. For suppliers of an economy growing at 4% a year, India's businessmen are a surprisingly miserable bunch.
Compared with the way they were, however, managers are changing. Groups such as Reliance and the small companies like the TVs group around Bangalore are measuring themselves by global yardsticks. Even among those most afraid of foreign competition, there is a widespread acceptance that liberalisation will continue. There may be setbacks--if, for instance, government spending fails to come under control and inflation undermines the early progress--but not even the most grumpy businessmen want to return to the licence raj.
This consensus matters. Pessimists will say that it rules out an economic miracle as explosive as China's. Yet china's businessmen live on the edge of a political volcano. Though India's messy march to prosperity may look less exciting, it may also prove more consistent.",750,India,A29-8245,,False,,0,True

The Indian government reckoned its shares (known as ""global depository receipts"") were each worth 1,400 rupees ($44.63). But Kleinwort Benson and Salomon Brothers, the two investment banks handling the deal, thought that the price would be nearer 1,100-1,200 rupees, because investors had been unnerved by the country's ailing stockmarket.
The Indian government may have had a legitimate reason to delay the sale. Sushil Wadhwani, an economist at Goldman Sachs, another investment bank, expects Indian share prices to rise in the second half of this year. VSNL shares might fetch more then than they would today. But there are more worrying aspects to the decision. The 1,400 rupee price was set by the government at a time when the Bombay market was clearly over-valued. Narasimha Rao, India's prime minister, was reluctant to accept the more realistic, lower price for fear that he would be accused of selling state assets to foreigners at bargain prices.
Mr Rao was encouraged to halt the sale by Sukh Ram, the minister for telecoms, who wants to keep foreign investors out of the industry. Naarajan Vittal, the chairman of the Telecom Commission, which oversees the sector, was keen for the VSNL deal to go ahead and persuaded the company's board to support him against Mr Ram's scepticism. Mr Ram outflanked him, however, by asking Mr Rao to approve the new price. That the prime minister refused to do so raises serious questions about the government's willingness to stick with its ambitious plans to privatise.
The episode also holds important lessons for investment bankers touting for business in emerging markets. Competition has been so stiff that it may have blinded some banks to the risks involved.

Permission is rarely granted. Of all the old economic policies that still survive in India, this is the one that most discourages foreign investors, and the government has been muttering constantly about changing it. The prospects for change, however, seem to be receding.
Of course, companies can always get around the law. Workers who are given enough money--the going rate is a couple of years' wages--leave voluntarily. Government permission does not then need to be sought. But this means expense, inconvenience and absurdities: factories that have not operated for decades remain legally open, because they have not been given permission to shut, so the assets cannot be sold to meet the claims of creditors.
Trade unions oppose a change in the law, fearing it would result in mass closures; and every political party in India has a vociferous trade-union win. Yet when the economic reforms began in 1991, many committees examined the possibility of amending the labour legislation, knowing that a change would boost confidence in the economy. The government even got as far as producing a draft law.
Now, however, this uncomfortable issue has been put aside. Since $5 billion of foreign money poured into India in 1993-94, raisin the country's foreign-exchange reserves to $15 billion, many politicians are saying that the crisis is over, and there is no need to embark on risky reforms that could turn the unions nasty and lead to street violence. Elections are due in ten states within the next 18 months, and a general election by 1996. Besides, the prime minister. P.V. Narasimha Rao, is short of a majority in the upper house of Parliament, and so will find it hard to push through new labour laws. Fear of unemployment has also prevented a promised restructuring of the public sector. Although 58 public-sector enterprises are chronically ill, not one has been shut down, and their workers still get paid. In 1991 Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, promised to stop these subsidies within three years. That deadline has passed, and the budetary support continues.
The banking unions are the most powerful of all, since they can paralyse the financial system. In theory all the state-owned banks are now free to close their hundreds of loss-making branches, but not a single branch has actually been closed. An agreement with the bank unions, made in 1993, provides that banks with fewer than 500 branches will introduce computers at the rate of 1% per year, and those with more than 500 branches at 0.5% per year. In other words, the big banks will take 200 years to be fully computerised, by which time computers will doubtless be obsolete and so, perhaps, will the banks.
To reassure the unions, the government has promised not to privatise any profitable public companies. It has tried to find a buyer for Indian Iron and Steel, a hopeless case, but says the buyer must not get rid of any of the 30,000 workers, nor sell any of the company's assets.

Narasimha Rao, is being accused of half-hearted reforms yielding only half-baked results. The IMF's annual report on the country, released last week, warns India against complacency. But though the pace of central-government reform has slowed to a crawl, there are signs that economic growth is picking up.
When Mr Rao came to power in 1991, in the middle of a financial crisis, his minority government looked unlikely to last. Not having much to lose, he shed his reputation for being a cautious old crab and turned into a radical reformer--aiming for the history books as the man who transformed India, rather than struggling for short-term survival.
Now, however, he has attracted enough defectors to gain a majority in parliament and so to last a full term. Besides, the financial crisis he inherited is long since over, and a series of good monsoons has kept GDP growing at a reasonable rate. These days he seems less interested in making history than in making it back into office after the next general election, in 1996.
Since no party is likely to win an overall majority in the election, Mr Rao is reluctant to offend any group of voters. He therefore seems to have abandoned privatisation, on the ground that it infuriates public-sector workers. He has also shelved plans to reform labour and company laws which make it impossible to wind up companies, sell sick companies' assets or sack workers, because the unions hate the idea. He has done nothing to cut heavy subsidies to farmers for water and power, for fear of angering them too.
In consequence, India's economy is not much more efficient after three years of reform. Certainly, unravelling the old licensing system has made the private sector freer and more dynamic. But the government still owns about 75% of industrial assets. The public sector is demoralised, as its good managers leave to join the private sector. It is also short of cash, because of financial austerity, and bedevilled by bureaucratic and political interference.
When Mr Rao assumed power, India's foreign-exchange reserves had almost disappeared, the debt-service ratio exceeded 30% and inflation was an uneasy 16%. Today the reserves stand at a record $17 billion. Exports in 1993-94 boomed by 21% and the trade gap shrank to $1 billion. Foreign investment in 1993-94 touched $4.5 billion. The debt-service ratio declined to 25%.
The aim of the reforms is not just to stave off bankruptcy, but also to create a dynamic economy. This has not yet been done. During the first two years of reform, the austerity necessary to restore macroeconomic stability squashed industrial growth. Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, shifted his foot from the brake to the accelerator in 1993-94, but industrial growth stuck at barely 3%. Investment was below pre-reform levels, since the fiscal crisis reduced public investment, and private investment did not rise rapidly enough to compensate. Real agricultural wages fell by 3% in the first two years of reform--so, with spending on anti-poverty schemes also shrinking, the poor suffered.
Slack industrial growth meant less excise and customs revenue than budgeted, so the fiscal deficit in 1993-94 hit 7.3% of GDP, way above the budgeted 4.7%. Inflation rose in consequence and now hovers around 11%, a level that has driven voters to revolt against the government in the past. No wonder the ruling Congress Party is less than euphoric about the reforms.
And yet thing may be getting better. Customs and excise revenues rose sharply in the second quarter of this year, suggesting an industrial revival. Oil imports have surged at an annual rate of 25% since January, something which would once have caused alarm, but is now hailed with relief. The fiscal deficit has been contained, and should be held to 6% of GDP, as planned. Industrial investment seems to be rising, and for the first time Mr Rao is getting hints that there maybe an industrial boom by the time of the 1996 general election.
And so Mr Rao is tempted to sit back. Reform has not ceased altogether: moves are afoot to let foreign companies into basic telephone services, though the pace of progress is painfully slow. A recent court verdict has cleared the way for Indian and foreign companies to start cellular telephone services in the main cities. Long-delayed foreign proposals for power plants look like overcoming their last hurdles, despite accusations of kickbacks. But, in Delhi, the urgency has gone.
Elsewhere in India, however, a panic has set in similar to that which drove central government to start reforming three years ago. State governments are now bust, largely because they are getting less cash from Delhi, and bankruptcy is now driving radical change. Since the states control agriculture, irrigation, power, road transport, health and education, which together account for more than half of GDP, their conversion matters.
Uttar Pradesh, India's largest state, has raised power tariffs sharply, put 28 sugar mills up for sale and outlined plans to privatise power generation and distribution. The chief minister of Madhya Pradesh proposes to sack 28,000 workers. Several other states are privatising loss-making companies and cutting payrolls.
So, in a messy, haphazard fashion, reform is continuing. But it needs another push at the centre. There is little sign of that happening. With a good monsoon so far this year and a satisfactory outlook for the economy, Mr Rao may feel able to doze in comfort until the next election.","Half - way through Narasimha Rao's term , India 's prime minister , P.V.

But though the pace of central - government reform has slowed to a crawl , there are signs that economic growth is picking up . 
 When Narasimha Rao came to power in 1991 , in the middle of a financial crisis , Narasimha Rao's minority government looked unlikely to last . Not having much to lose , Narasimha Rao shed Narasimha Rao's reputation for being a cautious old crab and turned into a radical reformer -- aiming for the history books as the man who transformed India , rather than struggling for short - term survival . 
 Now , however , Narasimha Rao has attracted enough defectors to gain a majority in parliament and so to last a full term . Besides , the financial crisis Narasimha Rao inherited is long since over , and a series of good monsoons has kept GDP growing at a reasonable rate . These days Narasimha Rao seems less interested in making history than in making it back into office after the next general election , in 1996 . 
 Since no party is likely to win an overall majority in the election , Narasimha Rao is reluctant to offend any group of voters . Narasimha Rao therefore seems to have abandoned privatisation , on the ground that it infuriates public - sector workers . Narasimha Rao has also shelved plans to reform labour and company laws which make it impossible to wind up companies , sell sick companies ' assets or sack workers , because the unions hate the idea . Narasimha Rao has done nothing to cut heavy subsidies to farmers for water and power , for fear of angering them too . 
 In consequence , India 's economy is not much more efficient after three years of reform . Certainly , unravelling the old licensing system has made the private sector freer and more dynamic . But the government still owns about 75 % of industrial assets . The public sector is demoralised , as its good managers leave to join the private sector . It is also short of cash , because of financial austerity , and bedevilled by bureaucratic and political interference . 
 When Narasimha Rao assumed power , India 's foreign - exchange reserves had almost disappeared , the debt - service ratio exceeded 30 % and inflation was an uneasy 16 % . Today the reserves stand at a record $ 17 billion . Exports in 1993 - 94 boomed by 21 % and the trade gap shrank to $ 1 billion . Foreign investment in 1993 - 94 touched $ 4.5 billion . The debt - service ratio declined to 25 % . 
 The aim of the reforms is not just to stave off bankruptcy , but also to create a dynamic economy . This has not yet been done . During the first two years of reform , the austerity necessary to restore macroeconomic stability squashed industrial growth . Manmohan Singh , the finance minister , shifted his foot from the brake to the accelerator in 1993 - 94 , but industrial growth stuck at barely 3 % . Investment was below pre - reform levels , since the fiscal crisis reduced public investment , and private investment did not rise rapidly enough to compensate . Real agricultural wages fell by 3 % in the first two years of reform -- so , with spending on anti - poverty schemes also shrinking , the poor suffered . 
 Slack industrial growth meant less excise and customs revenue than budgeted , so the fiscal deficit in 1993 - 94 hit 7.3 % of GDP , way above the budgeted 4.7 % . Inflation rose in consequence and now hovers around 11 % , a level that has driven voters to revolt against the government in the past . No wonder the ruling Congress Party is less than euphoric about the reforms . 
 And yet thing may be getting better . Customs and excise revenues rose sharply in the second quarter of this year , suggesting an industrial revival . Oil imports have surged at an annual rate of 25 % since January , something which would once have caused alarm , but is now hailed with relief . The fiscal deficit has been contained , and should be held to 6 % of GDP , as planned . Industrial investment seems to be rising , and for the first time Narasimha Rao is getting hints that there maybe an industrial boom by the time of the 1996 general election . 
 And so Narasimha Rao is tempted to sit back . Reform has not ceased altogether : moves are afoot to let foreign companies into basic telephone services , though the pace of progress is painfully slow . A recent court verdict has cleared the way for Indian and foreign companies to start cellular telephone services in the main cities . Long - delayed foreign proposals for power plants look like overcoming their last hurdles , despite accusations of kickbacks . But , in Delhi , the urgency has gone . 
 Elsewhere in India , however , a panic has set in similar to that which drove central government to start reforming three years ago . State governments are now bust , largely because they are getting less cash from Delhi , and bankruptcy is now driving radical change . Since the states control agriculture , irrigation , power , road transport , health and education , which together account for more than half of GDP , their conversion matters . 
 Uttar Pradesh , India 's largest state , has raised power tariffs sharply , put 28 sugar mills up for sale and outlined plans to privatise power generation and distribution . The chief minister of Madhya Pradesh proposes to sack 28,000 workers . Several other states are privatising loss - making companies and cutting payrolls . 
 So , in a messy , haphazard fashion , reform is continuing . But it needs another push at the centre . There is little sign of that happening . With a good monsoon so far this year and a satisfactory outlook for the economy , Narasimha Rao may feel able to doze in comfort until the next election .",750,India,A29-8245,IN TERM,True,Mr Rao,16,True

He has long cast Britain as Goliath to Malaysia's David, and has provided an appreciative Malaysian audience with regular scraps with the old colonial power. He took on his country's ancient rulers, the sultans, who represent aristocratic decadence at odds with the puritanical, meritocratic spirit of Malaysia's new middle class, and stripped them of their legal privileges, Yet his latest target, a group of Islamists who do not appear to pose a threat to the country or to the government, is a riskier choice. For some months now, Malaysia's government has been running a campaign against Al Arqam, an Islamic group that runs schools and a business empire. It has been tying to pin a range of crimes on the group and its followers--including the charge that a suicide squad sponsored by Al Arqam was being trained in Thailand, and accusation that he government had to withdraw. But even though the mud has failed to stick, the government had Al Arqam's leader, Ashaari Muhammed, picked up in Thailand, shipped back to Malaysia and arrested. The group itself has been banned (see page 35.) Perhaps Dr Mahathir genuinely fears that Al Arqam's boasts of its conversions among politicians and civil servants signal an ambition to mount a threat to the state. However, beyond holding some peculiar view about the role of women, the group has shown no sign of wanting to do anybody any harm. It seems more likely that Dr Mahathir is preparing himself for the next election by creating a fundamentalist bogey in order of frighten Malaysians into voting for him.
He may succeed. On the other hand, he may find that many of Mr Ashaari's fellow Muslims dislike his picking on an apparently blameless group of devout, if eccentric, people. Malaysia may have a diluted sort of democracy, with a press that writes little the government disapproves of and a ruling coalition that has sucked most of the opposition into its orbit; but its growing middle class has an appetite for political freedoms. Dr Mahathir may also discover that there is more at stake that a bit of extra political support. Politicians are often tempted to use religion for political ends, because it offers a motivating force far stronger than simple self-interest. Sometimes, they successfully combine religion with other ingredients to bind their supporters in--as Dr Mahathir has done with his mix of capitalism, Malay nationalism and conservative Islam. But mobilising religious feeling for cynical ends can also release forces which, once out, are hand to control. UNCORKING THE BOTTLE In the Muslim world, stirring up Mahathir-style fear of fundamentalism is a standard ploy. Tunisia's determinedly secular government has long threatened its people with the prospect that a fundamentalist movement could destabilise the county. This seems to have helped it both sore up its power and justify cracking down hard on anything that looks like opposition. Yet when this tactic goes wrong, the results can be disastrous. In Algeria, scare-mongering and outright repression encouraged the growth of a hard-line Islamists movement; the result has been at least 4,000 deaths. In supposedly-secular India, Hindu politicians have done the country a great disservice by stirring up antipathy towards the Muslim minority. The tension between these two religious groups now dominates politics and explodes sporadically into violence. India's prime minister, Narasimha Rao, looks suspiciously as though he is trying to deepen this schism with his new plan to set up something like an established Hindu church (see page 36). Governments that manipulate religion for political ends are often those that have little else of substance to offer their people. It seems odd, then, that Dr Mahathir, who in his particular way has done a great deal for his country's self-esteem and prosperity, should resort to a brand of politics that looks both weak and dangerous.","PLAYING POLITICS WITH RELIGION IS NOT SMART The prime minister of Malaysia , Mahathir Mohamad , has always picked his enemies shrewdly .

India's prime minister, P.V. Narasimha Rao, has persuaded the four to preside over a new religious trust to build a temple to the warrior god Ram at Ayodhya, at the site of the disputed mosque that was demolished by Hindu fanatics in December 1992.
By doing so he aims to outdo the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which campaigned for years for the demolition of the mosque, saying it was built on the birthplace of Ram. The BJP has its own trust to build the temple, and is furious about the new trust. But it dare not criticise the shankaracharya.
When the mosque was demolished, Mr Rao said it would be rebuilt. But such was the tide of Hindu sentiment against rebuilding the mosque that he decided to swim with it. In the process he lost the Muslim vote in Uttar Pradesh, India's largest state, reducing his Congress party to fourth position in the state's election in 1993. But he feels compensated by seemingly depriving the BJP of its Ayodhya platform, on which it had hoped to ride to power.
However, some newspapers are already pointing out that Mr Rao may, unwittingly, be creating a new religious monster. One reason why India has managed to remain (officially) a secular state is that Hinduism is non-hierarchical. Priests and sages, no matter how revered, have no right to give orders to other Hindus. Sages have traditionally had no political authority, and are supposed to be detached From the desires of normal humans--and normal politicians.
Yet things are changing. The BJP has become the chief opposition party by binding together once-divided Hindus through a powerful mixture of religion and politics. Mr Rao is responding by using the same ingredients. True, the shankaracharya have said that the trust must be apolitical, not sponsored by the Congress party, and Mr Rao has promised this will be the case. But once the sages get together to build the temple, they will constitute a unified Hindu council for the first time in history, and may just be tempted to exercise their new authority in other directions. To begin with they may simply give Hinduism a more organised shape, but in due course this would tend to become a potent political force. Such a force would constitute what one newspaper has called the churchification of Hinduism, and could change Indian politics and society.
Nobody expects that the shankaracharya will turn into a new Roman church within a few years, let alone a Christian Democratic Party. But the fact remains that Hindus are becoming organised in novel ways because of modern communications and transport. The Ram temple agitation saw Hindus from all over India bearing bricks in procession to Ayodhya. Hindus are increasingly coming together for celebrations. Ganesh Chaturthi, once a relatively minor festival, has become the biggest Hindu event in Bombay, with millions joining processions to immerse statues of the god Ganesh in the sea. Every politician envies the enormous people-power represented by the crowds.
Indian voters are fed up with corrupt politicians. The moral authority of the state is weak. The only institutions still widely respected are the army and Hindu sages.

Since 1956, India has prohibited foreigners from owning newspapers or magazines.

Others in the queue include the International Herald Tribune, Elle and Rupert Murdoch's TV Guide.
A cabinet committee has been pondering a change in policy for several months.

Since the about-turn was evidently ordered by Mr Rao, a formal change of policy is likely to come soon.
The committee is expected to set three conditions for foreigners' entry into the market: 51% of the equity of such ventures must be owned by Indians, the editor should be an Indian, and a majority on the board should be Indian. The foreign journals in the queue have all proposed holding a majority stake in their Indian ventures. If the guidelines are as expected, they will have to recast their proposals to conform to them.
Opponents on the left, the right, in Congress and the media have denounced this as a sell-out. They point out that the safeguards can easily be evaded. Any company can be controlled with a 49% stake, if the balance is spread over thousands of small investors; an Indian editor can be a front, while the real work is done by white expatriates; and the Indian majority on any board may consist of sleeping directors.
Critics argue that foreign journals, which could include Pakistani ones, may be used to brainwash Indians and erode the country's security. They also claim that, whereas India may benefit from a free market in, say, consumer products, newspapers express fundamental cultural values.
Liberalisers counter that precisely because journals are cultural products, foreigners will never be able to win more than a small slice of the market. Only 3% of Indians speak English (though that still adds up to 27m customers), and foreigners will be unable to run newspapers in Indian languages.

The hill districts of Uttar Pradesh, India's largest state, have been paralysed by a battle between upper and lower castes that resulted this week in the deaths of a dozen people, attacks on police stations, and a curfew in nine towns. It now looks as though the row could split Uttar Pradesh.
The state government has reserved 27% of government jobs and college seats for backward castes, a form of reverse discrimination sanctioned by the Supreme Court. In India as a whole, these castes account for nearly half the population, but in the hill districts of Uttar Pradesh the proportion is much tinier, only 2-3%. The result is that many local people want to reverse the reverse discrimination.
The state is ruled by a coalition of two caste-based parties, the Samajwadi Party (an alliance of backward castes and Muslims) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (representing untouchables, the lowest of the low). This is the first time that an openly caste-based combination has attained power, and suggests that the national parties may increasingly have to worry about caste-based rivals. Neighbouring Bihar is ruled by the Janata Party, a national party. But its chief minister has made it clear that his main plank (some say his only plank) is promoting the interests of backward castes.
In many states, the chief minister would have resigned after the violence that exploded in the hills of Uttar Pradesh. It will not happen there, since the ruling coalition is based on caste politics. The local Congress Party has urged India's prime minister, Narasimha Rao, to impose central rule on Uttar Pradesh and to hold another election in the state.
Mr Rao is not inclined to do so, since a fresh election might be won by the right-wing Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party--a much greater disaster, From his point of view, than a few caste riots. Instead, he is wondering whether to create a hill council to give greater autonomy to the hill districts.
The backward castes, untouchables and tribesmen account for around 70% of India's people. Muslims account for another 11%, and several states (including Uttar Pradesh) have started including Muslim groups in the ""backward"" category eligible for reservations. So reverse discrimination benefits the vast majority of the population, not a minority as in the case of American blacks, and national parties are wary of antagonising such a majority.
The Supreme Court has held that reservations should not exceed 50%, to protect candidates of real merit. The constitution provides a 23% reservation for untouchables and tribesmen, so the court ruling implies a ceiling of 27% for the backward castes and Muslims. But many southern states have long had reservations above that limit. Last year the Tamil Nadu government passed a law setting reservations at 69%, in defiance of the Supreme Court ruling.
Not a single national party dared oppose Tamil Nadu's reservation policy. On the contrary, they all got together and amended the constitution in the latest session of parliament to place this law beyond judicial scrutiny.
The state government in Karnataka has now proposed a bill increasing reservations to 75%, and wants a constitutional amendment like the one Tamil Nadu got. It may get one; but legal experts suspect that the Supreme Court may strike these amendments down.
Many Indians fear that the politics of caste will open yet another fissure in a society already divided by region and religion. Others find some cause for comfort in caste. For the country's Muslims, Sikhs and Christians, a divided Hindu population may be less frightening than a monolithic one.","Caste and unemployment make a dangerous mixture .

The local Congress Party has urged Narasimha Rao's to impose central rule on Uttar Pradesh and to hold another election in the state . 
 Narasimha Rao is not inclined to do so , since a fresh election might be won by the right - wing Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party -- a much greater disaster , From Narasimha Rao's point of view , than a few caste riots . Instead , Narasimha Rao is wondering whether to create a hill council to give greater autonomy to the hill districts . 
 The backward castes , untouchables and tribesmen account for around 70 % of India 's people . Muslims account for another 11 % , and several states ( including Uttar Pradesh ) have started including Muslim groups in the "" backward "" category eligible for reservations . So reverse discrimination benefits the vast majority of the population , not a minority as in the case of American blacks , and national parties are wary of antagonising such a majority . 
 The Supreme Court has held that reservations should not exceed 50 % , to protect candidates of real merit . The constitution provides a 23 % reservation for untouchables and tribesmen , so the court ruling implies a ceiling of 27 % for the backward castes and Muslims . But many southern states have long had reservations above that limit . Last year the Tamil Nadu government passed a law setting reservations at 69 % , in defiance of the Supreme Court ruling . 
 Not a single national party dared oppose Tamil Nadu 's reservation policy . On the contrary , they all got together and amended the constitution in the latest session of parliament to place this law beyond judicial scrutiny . 
 The state government in Karnataka has now proposed a bill increasing reservations to 75 % , and wants a constitutional amendment like the one Tamil Nadu got . It may get one ; but legal experts suspect that the Supreme Court may strike these amendments down . 
 Many Indians fear that the politics of caste will open yet another fissure in a society already divided by region and religion . Others find some cause for comfort in caste . For the country 's Muslims , Sikhs and Christians , a divided Hindu population may be less frightening than a monolithic one .",750,India,A29-8245,IN TERM,True,"India 's prime minister , Narasimha Rao ,",4,True

Explaining why economic reform is going so slowly, politicians blame the troublesome business of having to answer to voters at the polls, and the constraints this imposes on the government. A little economic vice, they imply, is the price of their political virtue.
The results of four state elections held this month are being taken as evidence to support this view. The poor showing of Narasimha Rao's party is being attributed to voters' hostility to his economic reforms, making it harder for him to push ahead with more. Not so: economic reform and elections have little to do with each other in India.
The half-finished programme to promote growth by freeing the economy did not feature in election debates because, even though economic reform is the government's main achievement, the ruling party's politicians avoid the subject. The changes have been carried out almost covertly. The prime minister has made no attempt to explain to the voters how the reforms are intended to benefit the country, nor has anybody in government appealed to them for support in pursuing the reform programme;
Perhaps the government fears that voters would take against the reforms; certainly, few politicians seem to believe in them. Having been through neither a Soviet-style economic collapse nor a Latin-American hyperinflation, India's politicians have never genuinely espoused the need for change. Reform is being pushed not by the whole government, but by the finance minister and a small group of civil servants. Even the prime minister, who started the process, seems ambivalent at times. Still, it is hard to see why Indian voters should support an economic system that has served them so badly in the past.
The only clear verdict on economic policy that Indian voters have ever given--and it was unambiguous in this month's elections--is their hostility to inflation. But India's rising inflation is a sign not of economic reforms carried through, but of problems left untackled. The government still wastes money sustaining loss-making public-sector industries. As a result, it has too little to spend on things people want--such as education and health-and a large, inflation-creating deficit.
India's huge public sector earns a return of only 2% on the capital it employs. The government has, in the past, tried and failed to sharpen its management, and is currently selling shares in the more profitable businesses. But the only way to make its enterprises work more efficiently is to take control away from government. Unfortunately, the politicians, including the prime minister, sturdily reject privatisation.
A similar dilemma concerns another vital bit of reform left undone: allowing private companies to o bust and sack workers. Private industry would have a better future if the government would change the law to allow restructuring, but the politicians are hightened of the workers' reaction to the threat of job losses. If, they suggest, the reforms carried out so far produce fast growth and plenty of new jobs, then it may be possible to let private companies reorganise themselves or go bankrupt. But the chances of growth speeding up are inevitably reduced so long as India's private industry remains shackled.
""That's democracy,"" say the politicians, shrugging their shoulders. But the failure to confront these issues is unrelated to democracy. In a population of 900m or so, about 10m people work in publicly-owned industries and about 6m in the unionised bit of the private sector. The government's reluctance to offend this tiny minority has nothing to do with responding to their demands as voters. It has everything to do with protecting unions affiliated to the congress Party--ie, with retaining control over cash and patronage.
The Santa Klaus solution
Talk to some of the other 884m Indians, and few seem to believe that unions need protecting or that the government should keep control of its companies. Indians feel so abused by corruption in the public sector and especially among politicians (a big issue in the state elections) that they would probably warm to any proposal to reform inefficient industries by taking them out of the government's control.
After the voters' rebuke, Mr Rao will be looking for something to help him before the general election due in 1996. His best bet would be to imitate Vaclav Klaus, the Czech prime minister. Mr Klaus never stops explaining his reform policies in the newspapers and on television. His people have embraced reform.

The chances of the Indian prime minister having the courage to push on with his half-finished economic reforms look slimmer after his Congress party received a drubbing in four state elections on December 1st and 8th and his cabinet then started to fall apart.
Congress did badly everywhere. In the two states that mattered most, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, Congress had won in 1989 with handsome majorities. This time in Andhra Pradesh, Mr Rao's home state, Congress won only 25 out of 292 seats, against 218 for the regional Telegu Desam. In Karnataka Congress won 35 of 224 seats, and slipped to a humiliating third place behind the Janata Dal, which took 116, and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which got 40.
One view attributes Congress's failure to the voters' anger at corruption. Congress has a filthy reputation, which it tries to sidestep by arguing that its rascals are better than the other parties'. Certainly, the voters' disgust with politicians is not confined to members of the Congress party; they are usually ready to throw out whoever is in power. Last year that helped Congress oust the BJP in state elections in the north; this year its own governments have suffered. Four government ministers whose names have been connected with scandals have offered to resin this week; but that will do little to improve Congress's image.
A second theory attributes Congress's troubles to shifts in voting blocks. Muslims and untouchables, traditional Congress supporters, have now deserted it. Muslims blame Mr Rao for taking a soft line on Hindu chauvinism, and a new party, the Bahujan Samaj, is devoted to promoting the untouchables' interests. In Karnataka some lower castes seem to have defected in the state election from Congress to the Janata Dal because of its vigorous support for positive discrimination in their favour.
A third theory holds that the government's economic reforms have hurt the poor, who have therefore struck back. The Congress party, which in the days of Indira Gandhi swept the country with the slogan garibi hatao--abolish poverty--believes it has been hurt by opposition parties' claims that it favors the rich. Although the main reforms, liberalising trade and industry, will not have directly hurt or helped the 77% of people who live in the countryside, austerity in the programme's first two years hit some anti-poverty schemes. However, the allocation for rural employment was raised from 25 billion rupees ($950m) in 1992-93 to 51 billion rupees this fiscal year. Much of the increase went to the poorest districts, which also got extra handouts of subsidised food.
But a better anti-poverty programme is low inflation, which is also the economic indicator Indian voters really mind about. Last year, when Congress did well in northern state elections, inflation in the countryside was running at an annual rate of only 2% in the eight months before the elections. So far this year it has been running at 12%. If Mr Rao is to win the general election in 1996, he needs to hold down prices.
In Andhra Pradesh the winning Telegu Desam promised to enforce prohibition (which women have long demanded) and to slash the price of rice at ration shops by almost half to two rupees a kilo (three American cents a pound). These measures are certain to bankrupt the exchequer, but have helped the party win a resounding victory. Elections are due in five more states in February. In one of them, Orissa, the Janata Dal government has already announced a cheap rice scheme. Others will follow suit. This leaves Congress in a quandary. Should it join the competition for bankruptcy or project itself as a responsible party?
It now looks more unlikely than ever that Mr Rao can win a majority in the general election due in 1996. He has lost repeatedly in the north, and has now lost two big southern states too. But things may not be as bad as they seem. People do not vote the same way in regional elections as in national ones, and opinion polls suggest that, even though Andhra Pradesh went for the Telegu Desam in the state-assembly polls, its voters will back Congress in a general election. In Karnataka Congress won nearly as many votes as the Janata Dal, though it got many fewer seats.
Even so, Mr Rao may well find it hard towing more than 200 out of parliament's 544 seats. In that case, he would have to lean on several small parties to survive. He would probably do that by placating lobbies with subsidies, endangering macroeconomic management. The main check on such excesses would be the voters' hostility to inflation.
It is possible that a fiscal mess might bring some benefits: bankruptcy might just persuade the central and state governments to privatise some of their inefficient public-sector industries. The danger in the states is that essential public services like roads, education and health will be neglected for want of money. But whatever happens to macroeconomic management, the measures in place to set private industry free are unlikely to be reversed.

Having shunned Indian shares in the first half of 1993, they went on a spending spree in the second, buying $1 billion-worth. The spree continued this year. While many other Asian markets have fallen sharply, foreign cash helped the Sensitive Index (Sensex), which tracks the performance of the top 30 stocks on the Bombay Stock Exchange, Asia's oldest, to rise from 3,450 at the beginning of the year to 4,600 by September.
There were good reasons for foreigners' appetite. For a start, there is no shortage of Indian shares to buy. Some 6,700 shares are listed on Indian exchanges, most of them in Bombay. True, only about 2,000 are actively traded; but that is still far more than on any other emerging market. But the bigger reason for investing in India was that the sleeping giant seemed at last to be waking. India's economy has long been too heavily regulated. But a financial collapse in 1991 forced the government to call in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and to start liberalising.
Investors' faith in the durability of these reforms is now being tested. Stockmarket jitters began when opinion polls forecast that the ruling Congress Party would lose state assembly elections in Karnataka and in Andhra Pradesh (the home state of Narasimha Rao, India's prime minister). When the party did even worse than feared in early December, the Sensex slumped. By December 13th it had fallen back to 3,830, although it picked up a bit the following day.
Congress's defeat in the two southern states, which may be followed by further losses next spring, make it less likely to win a majority in the general election in 1996, even though it should still be the biggest party. That prospect alarms investors, who fear that further economic reforms could grind to halt as a result.
From flood to trickle
Politics is not the market's only worry. Rising interest rates in America have made domestic assets more appealing for American investors than they were. As a result, they have stopped pouring money into India. Some are even selling Indian shares--if they can. The hassle of share dealing has soured the experience for many investors. Few banks offer custodial services and registering share transfers can take months.
Decreased demand matters when the market is fretting over the prospect of increased supply. Indian companies raised over 284 billion rupees ($9 billion) on the stockmarket last year; they look set to raise another 310 billion this year (see chart). (Chart omitted) Shares worth 124 billion rupees are expected to be issued in the first quarter of next year alone. Foreign and domestic investors are selling their existing shares to raise cash to buy them. Their enthusiasm is understandable. Many new issues are underpriced, so stags (who buy and sell quickly) have typically made an instant profit of up to 30%.
Yet fears that the stockmarket is bound to slide may be overdone. India's local elections were dominated by local issues. Exit polls showed that 65% of voters approved Mr Rao's national policies. No wonder. Although the dose of IMF-prescribed austerity at first resulted in paltry growth, industrial production has shot up 10% in the year to July. The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, a research outfit, reckons that GDP will grow by 4.5% this year and perhaps 4% next year. Moody's, an American rating agency, has just upgraded Indian government debt to investment grade.
Company profits have also been helped by lower borrowing costs. Indian businesses used to suffer from a lack of capital because firms were forced to issue equity at substantial discounts, interest rates on bonds were around 18% and bank lending rates were even higher. Bank loan rates have recently been deregulated, so bigger firms can negotiate better terms with their bankers. Firms have also been able to tap foreign investors by issuing equity and convertible bonds. Indian firms raised $2.5 billion in foreign markets in the last financial year; the country's finance ministry is expected to approve about $4 billion-worth of issues this year, which ends next March.
Many brokers expect corporate earnings to grow by 40% in the current financial year. It may turn out to be more. According to a study of 800 companies by the Economic Times, an Indian newspaper, corporate profits shot up by 102% in the first half of this financial year--although this was partly thanks to a change in the rules that companies use to depreciate their assets.
Heady growth in corporate earnings has pushed down equity valuations. At one point last year, euphoria at the prospect of further reforms pushed price-earning (p/e) ratios of companies in the Sensex to 50. Now, however, Baring Securities, a British stockbroker which has recently set up an India investment fund, reckons that, based on next year's results, the p/e ratio has dropped to 21.
But fast growth has its costs. Inflation, always a problem in India, looks set to become a bigger one. It has picked up from a low this year of 9% to around 11.2% now. Increases in commodity prices are partly to blame. But so, too, is foreign money. Although investors seem to have assuaged their appetite for Indian shares (at least for the time being), foreign direct investment and an inflow of funds borrowed by domestic firms in other markets means that foreign currency continues to pour in at a fair rate.
This inflow, much of which has gone to increase India's foreign-exchange reserves, has boosted its money supply. The government has tried a number of measures to counter the inflationary pressure, without much success. While the rupee is tied, albeit loosely, to the dollar, inflation threatens exporters' profits since the real exchange rate may appreciate. But ""foreign"" investors may not care much. One fund manager guesses that up to half the money in dedicated India funds is flight capital returning home. It will take more than a few knocks to corporate profits to reverse that.","IT SEEMED an obvious emerging - market bet for footloose foreign investors . Having shunned Indian shares in the first half of 1993 , they went on a spending spree in the second , buying $ 1 billion - worth . The spree continued this year . While many other Asian markets have fallen sharply , foreign cash helped the Sensitive Index ( Sensex ) , which tracks the performance of the top 30 stocks on the Bombay Stock Exchange , Asia 's oldest , to rise from 3,450 at the beginning of the year to 4,600 by September . 
 There were good reasons for foreigners ' appetite . For a start , there is no shortage of Indian shares to buy . Some 6,700 shares are listed on Indian exchanges , most of them in Bombay . True , only about 2,000 are actively traded ; but that is still far more than on any other emerging market . But the bigger reason for investing in India was that the sleeping giant seemed at last to be waking . India 's economy has long been too heavily regulated . But a financial collapse in 1991 forced the government to call in the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) and to start liberalising . 
 Investors ' faith in the durability of these reforms is now being tested . Stockmarket jitters began when opinion polls forecast that the ruling Congress Party would lose state assembly elections in Karnataka and in Andhra Pradesh ( the home state of Narasimha Rao's ) . When the party did even worse than feared in early December , the Sensex slumped . By December 13th it had fallen back to 3,830 , although it picked up a bit the following day . 
 Congress 's defeat in the two southern states , which may be followed by further losses next spring , make it less likely to win a majority in the general election in 1996 , even though it should still be the biggest party . That prospect alarms investors , who fear that further economic reforms could grind to halt as a result . 
 From flood to trickle 
 Politics is not the market 's only worry . Rising interest rates in America have made domestic assets more appealing for American investors than they were . As a result , they have stopped pouring money into India . Some are even selling Indian shares -- if they can . The hassle of share dealing has soured the experience for many investors . Few banks offer custodial services and registering share transfers can take months . 
 Decreased demand matters when the market is fretting over the prospect of increased supply . Indian companies raised over 284 billion rupees ( $ 9 billion ) on the stockmarket last year ; they look set to raise another 310 billion this year ( see chart ) . ( Chart omitted ) Shares worth 124 billion rupees are expected to be issued in the first quarter of next year alone . Foreign and domestic investors are selling their existing shares to raise cash to buy them . Their enthusiasm is understandable . Many new issues are underpriced , so stags ( who buy and sell quickly ) have typically made an instant profit of up to 30 % . 
 Yet fears that the stockmarket is bound to slide may be overdone . India 's local elections were dominated by local issues . Exit polls showed that 65 % of voters approved Narasimha Rao's national policies . No wonder . Although the dose of IMF - prescribed austerity at first resulted in paltry growth , industrial production has shot up 10 % in the year to July . The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy , a research outfit , reckons that GDP will grow by 4.5 % this year and perhaps 4 % next year . Moody 's , an American rating agency , has just upgraded Indian government debt to investment grade . 
 Company profits have also been helped by lower borrowing costs . Indian businesses used to suffer from a lack of capital because firms were forced to issue equity at substantial discounts , interest rates on bonds were around 18 % and bank lending rates were even higher . Bank loan rates have recently been deregulated , so bigger firms can negotiate better terms with their bankers . Firms have also been able to tap foreign investors by issuing equity and convertible bonds . Indian firms raised $ 2.5 billion in foreign markets in the last financial year ; the country 's finance ministry is expected to approve about $ 4 billion - worth of issues this year , which ends next March . 
 Many brokers expect corporate earnings to grow by 40 % in the current financial year . It may turn out to be more . According to a study of 800 companies by the Economic Times , an Indian newspaper , corporate profits shot up by 102 % in the first half of this financial year -- although this was partly thanks to a change in the rules that companies use to depreciate their assets . 
 Heady growth in corporate earnings has pushed down equity valuations . At one point last year , euphoria at the prospect of further reforms pushed price - earning ( p / e ) ratios of companies in the Sensex to 50 . Now , however , Baring Securities , a British stockbroker which has recently set up an India investment fund , reckons that , based on next year 's results , the p / e ratio has dropped to 21 . 
 But fast growth has its costs . Inflation , always a problem in India , looks set to become a bigger one . It has picked up from a low this year of 9 % to around 11.2 % now . Increases in commodity prices are partly to blame . But so , too , is foreign money . Although investors seem to have assuaged their appetite for Indian shares ( at least for the time being ) , foreign direct investment and an inflow of funds borrowed by domestic firms in other markets means that foreign currency continues to pour in at a fair rate . 
 This inflow , much of which has gone to increase India 's foreign - exchange reserves , has boosted its money supply . The government has tried a number of measures to counter the inflationary pressure , without much success . While the rupee is tied , albeit loosely , to the dollar , inflation threatens exporters ' profits since the real exchange rate may appreciate . But "" foreign "" investors may not care much . One fund manager guesses that up to half the money in dedicated India funds is flight capital returning home .

After a thrashing in Four state assembly elections in December, he faces a revolt within his party. This one may be especially dangerous, because there are signs that it has the support of Rajiv Gandhi's widow, Sonia.
Until Rajiv Gandhi's assassination in 1991, the ruling Congress party had been run almost continuously since independence by a member of the Nehru-Gandhi family. Rajiv's children, Rahul and Priyanka, were then still at school; his widow was a possible candidate, despite her Italian ancestry, but refused to enter a profession that had killed her husband and mother-in-law. So the party settled for Mr Rao, who looked like a safe pair of hands.
Since leadership has generally been inherited, the Congress party has no tradition of changing leaders. This has so far worked to Mr Rao's advantage. But many partymen are dismayed by his lack of charisma, especially after the debacle in the recent state elections, and feel that only a member of the Gandhi family, who still have an almost real authority, can sway enough millions to win the next general election. Any of the surviving Gandhis would also have the great advantage of political innocence: Indians are in a mood to reject anybody whose hands have been dirtied by power.
Mr Rao's chief party rival, Arjun Singh, resigned from the cabinet on December 24th. He published a 17-page letter, complaining that the party has a corrupt image; that its policy of economic liberalisation is seen as pro-rich; that Mr Rao has emphasised his home region of south India at the expense of the north; that he has abandoned the party's traditional secularism in the dispute over the mosque at Ayodhya and instead accommodated Hindu militants; that he has failed to promote democracy within the party; and that he has hampered official inquiries into Rajiv Gandhi's death (an obvious attempt to curry favour with his widow, this).
A few days after his resignation, Mr Singh was appointed to a trust run by Mrs Gandhi, suggesting that she approved of his revolt. Earlier, after the state election defeat, Mr Rao had called on Mrs Gandhi, and a story was leaked claiming that she had given him her blessing. She promptly denied it, to Mr Rao's discomfiture.
Mrs Gandhi does not seem interested in politics right now. But although she stays in the background, she casts a long shadow across the party. She receives a stream of political visitors, rather suggesting that she is keeping her options open either to back one of her children or to become politically active herself. Were she to do so, it would not be unusual: six of the current political leaders in South Asia are the widows or daughters of prime ministers or presidents.
Mrs Gandhi's immediate priority seems to be to have those who murdered her husband identified and convicted. That gives her cause for complaint against Mr Rao: a judicial commission is inquiring into the conspiracy, but has been denied access to key intelligence reports, and the trial of some conspirators has been paralysed by procedural wrangles. Mrs Gandhi is said to suspect Mr Rao of being unhelpful.
Mr Rao, for his part, has kept alive the investigation into the Bofors arms deal, in which Rajiv was alleged to have received kickbacks from the Swedish gunmaker. Some see this as a threat to Mrs Gandhi not to push the prime minister too far.
Aside from the hints from Mrs Gandhi, Mr Singh has won little support. The party chief in Uttar Pradesh, India's largest state, has resigned, and the state Congress party in Tamil Nadu is threatening to turn against Mr Rao. But for the Sonia factor, it is unlikely that Mr Singh would have risked a revolt. His chances anyway look slim. If Mr Rao fares well in the state assembly elections in February and March, Mr Singh will be finished. Even if Mr Rao does badly, he will probably keep his job until the general election due in 1996.
Some partymen have been urging Mr Rao to backtrack on liberalisation, restore subsidies and revive the socialist slogans of Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi. But he seems unpersuaded. In a speech to businessmen on January 4th, he said that he was committed to pursuing reform. The audience cheered: corporate profits were up 102% in the first half of the current fiscal year and businessmen are more confident of their ability to compete in a more liberal trade regime. Mr Rao also stressed--perhaps for Mrs Gandhi's benefit--that liberalisation was not his invention, but part of the election manifesto Rajiv drafted in 1991.
Watching for indications of the durability of reform, businessmen have drawn some encouragement from the statements of the new chief ministers of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, where Congress was recently thrashed. Both favour liberalisation. Karnataka has set up a new board to promote foreign investment.
But less encouraging was the tendency, visible during the state elections, for politicians of all parties to promise handouts bound to bankrupt governments. A second worry is the decision of the new government in Andhra Pradesh, now run by Telegu Desam, a regional party, to cancel letters of intent to two companies for a giant power project at Krishnapatam. When the contract was awarded by the previous Congress state government, there were allegations of kickbacks. The High Court refused to intervene. Teleu Desam has thus struck at the principle that governments must honour their predecessors' commitments unless criminality is proven. Political point-scoring of this sort will do no good to investors' confidence in India.","TRADITIONAL Hindus regard widows as symbols of bad luck , and Narasimha Rao's , may agree .

Elsewhere in Asia, trade often means conflict. But India's exports are too small to worry America much. Security, on the other hand, inevitably raises uncomfortable questions of nuclear bombs and Kashmiri human rights. So the shift in the balance has made relations easier between the two.
A year ago America was pressing India to fall into line against nuclear and missile proliferation; pushing for a regional summit on nuclear disarmament that India did not want; and complaining about the alleged brutality of the Indian security forces in Kashmir. At the same time America was complaining about India's slowness to protect intellectual property rights.
Last week Messrs Perry and Brown played down such concerns. Mr Perry did not ask India to sign the Nuclear NonProliferation Treaty, and merely emphasised the need to avoid escalating nuclear and missile competition on the subcontinent. He did not want India to deploy its indigenous short-range missile, Prithvi, even if production had started. Nor did he want further development of Agni, India's medium-range ballistic missile. Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, gave no such commitment, but India has not yet deployed Prithvi or started a new series of tests for Agni. For now, then, there is harmony, though India has kept its options open.
Mr Perry said he brought with him no solution for the Kashmiri dispute. That was a relief to the Indians: they want to be left to sort out Kashmir themselves. Mr Perry said America was happy with the improvement in human rights in Kashmir: some Kashmiri politicians have been released from jail and given permission to travel abroad. He signed an agreement providing for two bilateral groups, one to discuss strategic issues and the other to discuss co-operation in arms technology and production. They will not achieve much, since neither country is keen on transferring defence technology in a big way. Still, the gesture at least is nice.
Mr Brown's visit to New Delhi and several state capitals was a more ambitious operation. He brought with him a team of American businessmen who signed memoranda for new projects worth $4 billion. These were mainly in telecoms, power generation and oil refineries, though there was also interest in marrying American technology to cheap Indian labour to flood the world's markets with women's underwear. Not all these memoranda will become actual investments; and most are projects that have long been under negotiation. Their bunching reflects delays on the Indian side rather than sudden American interest. Still, Mr Brown signed what is grandly termed the Indo-US Commercial Alliance, providing for various sorts of American help for private business deals.
Mr Brown asked for greater access to India's financial markets, while the Indian side wanted better access to American markets for its textiles. The talks were warmer than previous wrangles over GATT, largely because India's government is increasingly aware of the advantages to be gained from more open trade. It also sees, observing the growing influence of countries like China and Malaysia, that trade and investment can lead to foreign-policy clout.
Still, not everybody approves.

Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, has at least one of the attributes of a statesman: he thinks about how to win in the long run as well as more immediately.
Mr Rao is a rather ambiguous figure. Nobody expected him to launch economic reform: he was seen, before he became prime minister, as a standard Congress party operator with the usual lack of vision and integrity. He is a scholar, an old-style brahmin pundit, but he never flaunts his learning. He is an exceedingly clever man--James Manor, a shrewd observer of Indian politics at Sussex University, reckons that he is the cleverest prime minister India has had--who seems to go out of his way to conceal the fact. Asis Nandy, a political scientist at India's Centre for the Study of Developing Societies, says that he ""has that quality which is essential for political survival in South Asia: to look stupider than you actually are.""
Nobody expected Mr Rao to last as long as he has. He was never supposed to come to power in the first place: he took over as a safe pair of hands when Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated during the 1991 election campaign, and won without gaining an overall majority. The Bharatiya Janata Party was riding a wave of right-wing Hinduism; and the conflict between Hindus and Muslims over the holy site at Ayodhya was coming to a head. His government seemed bound to collapse.
But Mr Rao survived, and the BJP lost. In subsequent state elections, Congress did well and the BJP disastrously. No doubt the BJP in part brought about its own decline, both through its internal divisions and because it presented Indians with a vision of social disruption that many reject. But Mr Rao is also a cunning political operator, who knows how to choose the right candidates for the right constituencies, how to make a patchwork of alliances, and how to lie low at the right time.
Lying low is Mr Rao's most characteristic game. At moments of crisis, he often disappears. His principal aim seems to be to lower the volume in Indian politics. In an excitable country, where only a decade ago 3,000 Sikhs were murdered in Delhi in a couple of days, that is an attractive ambition. Yet Mr Rao's unwillingness to face conflict makes him cautious; and caution does not suit a statesman. That is the contradiction in his administration: he has the vision to recognise the ends, but not the courage to will the means.
One of his long-term aims was to clean up the Congress party. To that end, he announced that in 1991, after a 19-year gap, there would be party elections. They were an embarrassing failure, rife with violence and rigging, exposing to the country the nature of the party. The venture was aborted. Mr Rao said he was going to persist; but has not done so. His own behaviour has not been impeccable, either: doubtless fearing threats to his position, he is both party president and prime minister. Nobody else is allowed to have both a party and a government post.
Perhaps Mr Rao has given up his aim of cleaning up Indian politics. It may seem too long a shot. Economic reform, however, he has not abandoned; but right now he seems to lack the courage to do the hard bits. ""It comes in such small doses,"" says Mr Chidambaram, his former commerce minister, ""that one sometimes despairs.""
Mr Rao may believe that the reforms made so far will buoy up the economy enough to make these hard bits easier. Job losses in the private organised sector, the public sector and among the central government's 4m civil servants would be easier to sell if the rest of the private sector were generating more employment. But the economy will not really flourish as long as the next stage of reform remains undone. The burden of publicly owned industry means that taxes have to be higher than they should be, that the government does not spend on things it should do, or that it ends up running a dangerously inflationary economic policy. The missing ""exit policy"" means that businesses find it hard to improve their efficiency by restructuring.
Mr Rao's caution is, in a way, curious. It is not as though large numbers of voters would suffer from such measures. He seems to be perpetuating what Mr Reddy at the commerce ministry calls ""the tyranny of the 10%""--the proportion of the labour force who, because they are in the private organised sector, the public sector or the civil service, might be affected by measures necessary to get the economy working properly. There are only 26m of them, out of a population of 950m. Those who belong to Congress-affiliated unions expect special treatment; even more could make life difficult if they decided to go on long, disruptive strikes. But a prime minister who combined courage with vision would tackle them. ""We are a democracy,"" Mr Rao's apologists explain, when asked why he has failed on this front.
In that case, Mr Rao might turn for support to another group, whose interests do not coincide with this powerful minority: the other 924m Indians. The government has made almost no attempt, so far, to gather political support for the grand task it is attempting. Reform has been carried out almost surreptitiously, as though it were something to be ashamed of. Perhaps Mr Rao feels overshadowed by the rhetoric of Gandhi and Nehru. Salman Khurshid, minister of state for foreign affairs, suggests that this is a problem: ""We have not,"" he says, ""found the right vocabulary."" If that is so, Mr Rao might take a lesson from Margaret Thatcher, a woman he probably does not admire, but with whom he has a lot in common. She took on vested interests by appealing over their heads to lower-middle-class voters, promising them freedom and opportunities that they had been denied. This argument is stronger in India, whose economic system has reinforced a social-class structure built on a religion that sanctions inequality.
Or perhaps Mr Rao is more comfortable with traditional Indian politics--the politics of division. India's politicians have usually eschewed ideology in favour of building alliances from caste and religious groups. Congress's traditional constituency, now breaking down, was built from the untouchables at the bottom of the pile, the Brahmins at the top and the Muslims on the side. Other parties of the left and right made do with the castes in between.
Caste is at the centre of the liveliest current political issue, the argument over reserving jobs and college places for particular castes. The original intention was to help untouchables who in a brahmin-dominated society had few hopes of a university place or a government job. But the politicians soon realised that handing out these goodies was an easy way to buy votes, so the number of jobs and places reserved for ""backward castes"" escalated. The ""backward castes"" make up around half of the population; it is a sad comment on Indian democracy that half the country's people reckon they need to rig the system to make it work for them. The issue has become so fraught in places--particularly the poorer parts of the north, where job opportunities outside government are limited and violence anyway comes easily--that questions about how to create more opportunities by building a prosperous economy do not get a hearing.
A braver leader than Mr Rao might have the courage to try a new sort of politics, one based on conviction not on division. It is possible that one might emerge if Mr Rao's reversals in state elections in December 1994 are compounded by a bad performance in more state elections early this year. Since Congress has no mechanism for getting rid of a leader, it seems likelier that Mr Rao will simply cling on until the general election in 1996.
Congress is unlikely then to win an overall majority. The small left-wing parties that have gained some round recently might form a coalition, which would fall to pieces as swiftly as previous Indian coalitions have; or Congress could form another weak administration, preoccupied with offending nobody. And Mr Rao's friends would still be saying ""We are a democracy, of course,"" when asked why difficult things had not been done.","POLITICIANS often have an interest in keeping things the way they are ; yet it was Narasimha Rao who started all this change .

Yet Narasimha Rao's unwillingness to face conflict makes Narasimha Rao cautious ; and caution does not suit a statesman . That is the contradiction in Narasimha Rao's administration : Narasimha Rao has the vision to recognise the ends , but not the courage to will the means . 
 One of Narasimha Rao's long - term aims was to clean up the Congress party . To that end , Narasimha Rao announced that in 1991 , after a 19 - year gap , there would be party elections . They were an embarrassing failure , rife with violence and rigging , exposing to the country the nature of the party . The venture was aborted . Narasimha Rao said Narasimha Rao was going to persist ; but has not done so . Narasimha Rao's own behaviour has not been impeccable , either : doubtless fearing threats to Narasimha Rao's position , Narasimha Rao is both party president and prime minister . Nobody else is allowed to have both a party and a government post . 
 Perhaps Narasimha Rao has given up Narasimha Rao's aim of cleaning up Indian politics . It may seem too long a shot . Economic reform , however , Narasimha Rao has not abandoned ; but right now Narasimha Rao seems to lack the courage to do the hard bits . "" It comes in such small doses , "" says Mr Chidambaram , Narasimha Rao's former commerce minister , "" that one sometimes despairs . "" 
 Narasimha Rao may believe that the reforms made so far will buoy up the economy enough to make these hard bits easier . Job losses in the private organised sector , the public sector and among the central government 's 4 m civil servants would be easier to sell if the rest of the private sector were generating more employment . But the economy will not really flourish as long as the next stage of reform remains undone . The burden of publicly owned industry means that taxes have to be higher than they should be , that the government does not spend on things it should do , or that it ends up running a dangerously inflationary economic policy . The missing "" exit policy "" means that businesses find it hard to improve their efficiency by restructuring . 
 Narasimha Rao's caution is , in a way , curious . It is not as though large numbers of voters would suffer from such measures . Narasimha Rao seems to be perpetuating what Mr Reddy at the commerce ministry calls "" the tyranny of the 10%""--the proportion of the labour force who , because they are in the private organised sector , the public sector or the civil service , might be affected by measures necessary to get the economy working properly . There are only 26 m of them , out of a population of 950 m. Those who belong to Congress - affiliated unions expect special treatment ; even more could make life difficult if they decided to go on long , disruptive strikes . But a prime minister who combined courage with vision would tackle them . "" We are a democracy , "" Narasimha Rao's apologists explain , when asked why Narasimha Rao has failed on this front . 
 In that case , Narasimha Rao might turn for support to another group , whose interests do not coincide with this powerful minority : the other 924 m Indians . The government has made almost no attempt , so far , to gather political support for the grand task it is attempting . Reform has been carried out almost surreptitiously , as though it were something to be ashamed of . Perhaps Narasimha Rao feels overshadowed by the rhetoric of Gandhi and Nehru . Salman Khurshid , minister of state for foreign affairs , suggests that this is a problem : "" We have not , "" he says , "" found the right vocabulary . "" If that is so , Narasimha Rao might take a lesson from Margaret Thatcher , a woman Narasimha Rao probably does not admire , but with whom Narasimha Rao has a lot in common . She took on vested interests by appealing over their heads to lower - middle - class voters , promising them freedom and opportunities that they had been denied . This argument is stronger in India , whose economic system has reinforced a social - class structure built on a religion that sanctions inequality . 
 Or perhaps Narasimha Rao is more comfortable with traditional Indian politics -- the politics of division . India 's politicians have usually eschewed ideology in favour of building alliances from caste and religious groups . Congress 's traditional constituency , now breaking down , was built from the untouchables at the bottom of the pile , the Brahmins at the top and the Muslims on the side . Other parties of the left and right made do with the castes in between . 
 Caste is at the centre of the liveliest current political issue , the argument over reserving jobs and college places for particular castes . The original intention was to help untouchables who in a brahmin - dominated society had few hopes of a university place or a government job . But the politicians soon realised that handing out these goodies was an easy way to buy votes , so the number of jobs and places reserved for "" backward castes "" escalated . The "" backward castes "" make up around half of the population ; it is a sad comment on Indian democracy that half the country 's people reckon they need to rig the system to make it work for them . The issue has become so fraught in places -- particularly the poorer parts of the north , where job opportunities outside government are limited and violence anyway comes easily -- that questions about how to create more opportunities by building a prosperous economy do not get a hearing . 
 A braver leader than Narasimha Rao might have the courage to try a new sort of politics , one based on conviction not on division . It is possible that one might emerge if Narasimha Rao's reversals in state elections in December 1994 are compounded by a bad performance in more state elections early this year . Since Congress has no mechanism for getting rid of a leader , it seems likelier that Narasimha Rao will simply cling on until the general election in 1996 . 
 Congress is unlikely then to win an overall majority . The small left - wing parties that have gained some round recently might form a coalition , which would fall to pieces as swiftly as previous Indian coalitions have ; or Congress could form another weak administration , preoccupied with offending nobody . And Narasimha Rao's friends would still be saying "" We are a democracy , of course , "" when asked why difficult things had not been done .",750,India,A29-8245,IN TERM,True,"Narasimha Rao , the prime minister",55,True

That refrain is heard less often these days, however. Not only are India's economic failures more obvious, as the rest of Asia streaks ahead; so are the flaws in its political system. Shame and anger at the way politics works have overtaken pride.
Thanks to India's free and increasingly hard-nosed press, everybody knows which ministers are said to be taking cuts from which contract; who is good friends with which underworld king; or who has taken more trouble to fix the results of a state election. People say--as they always do--that it has all got worse. Maybe it is just that journalism has got better and that more people can read; or that these days Indians expect better treatment from their leaders.
But if things are getting worse, there is a plausible explanation. Indira Gandhi corrupted politics by using gangs as enforcers for the politicians; and the enforcers slowly came to realise that they could do both jobs themselves. In Bombay, where six politicians have died in an warfare in the past two years, the connection between politics and the underworld is notorious. Elsewhere too, violence is so commonly used in politics that a newspaper story claiming that ""an opposition Telegu Deasm worker was killed in a bomb attack, carried out allegedly by Congress activists"" during the Andhra Pradesh state election got only two paragraphs on the inside page of a newspaper.
""The political class,"" says a veteran politician with passion, ""is so venal, so corrupt."" A top civil servant, on first meeting, launches into a diatribe against the morality of India's rulers, arguing that the only positive sign in Indian politics was the beginning of a popular revolt against the politicians. In the vanguard of that revolt is an unlikely character: the chief election commissioner, T.N. Seshan. Cabinet secretary in the 1980s, he was given the election commission job by Mr Rao, who probably now regrets it.
Mr Seshan produces sheaves of documents off his shelves, detailing the abuses of the electoral system. This ""Voter's 20-point programme"" has 200 items under the ""what goes wrong"" heading, such as: ""musclemen are used to capture booths, criminal elements are nominated as candidates, politically motivated officers actively assist in electioneering, forthright officers are sidelined, electoral rolls are rigged in favour of political parties"", and so on. He leaps upon all manner of election abuses: during the state election campaign in late 1994, he indicted two central government ministers for trying to bribe voters with promises of cheap sugar and reserved jobs for Muslims.
Mr Seshan has had countless run-ins with the government, but the government has always lost because the Supreme Court has taken Mr Seshan's side. At one point it called a special session of parliament (""a Seshan session,"" says Mr Seshan, chortling) to amend his constitutional powers. The public response has been extraordinary. There are Seshan fan clubs all over the country. He gets 100-200 letters a day and has 1,000 pending invitations to speak. ""I'm just fighting what the ordinary man in the street thinks is his fight against a corrupt political system,"" he says with uncharacteristic modesty.
But if the ordinary man in the street wants a decent political system, why does he not vote for one? Probably the explanation is something to do, once again, with the divisions that criss-cross Indian society. When Indians are so easily divided on caste, regional and religious rounds, it is hard for a political party to unite them on an ideological issue. That is the secret of the Congress party, which has ruled India for 43 out of the 48 years since independence.
Twice in the past ten years, Congress has faced a serious challenge from parties that marketed themselves as promising a cleaner, better future. That is what brought V.P. Singh to power with the Janata Dal party in 1989 after he broke away from Congress. The right-wing BJP swept polls in the early 1990s with a promise of renewal and regeneration before it took up the insidious cause of Hindu fundamentalism and thus, fortunately, sunk itself. Both attempts failed not because the platform lost its appeal, but because the movements dissipated in division and disagreement.
Perhaps there is something to be said for India's divisiveness. Had the BJP, with its appeal to Hindu fundamentalism, spoken to a united mass of Hindus, it might have swept the country; as it was, the differences between higher and lower castes, and between moderates and extremists, kept it from hanging together as a coherent force.
Yet if India's divisiveness helps defend it against dangerous enthusiasms, it also makes it harder for anything good to happen in the country. For conviction and vision find it hard to make themselves heard against the noise of a multitude of different squabbles. That is why Indian politics fails to grapple with such important matters as education or, right now, whether to pursue an economic reform programme that at last gives the country a chance to fulfil its potential.
Perhaps good will come out of Indians' growing anger at the way their country is run. V.S. Naipaul, an Indian by descent but not by upbringing or nationality, touches on this possibility in his latest book on India. He wrote two books on the country in the 1960s and 1970s: short, harsh books about a place sunk deep in post-colonial shame. His new one is long, rambling, more ambivalent and compassionate: a worse book, but truer to India's ambiguities. ""The idea of freedom,"" he writes, ""has one everywhere in India...People everywhere have ideas now of who they are and what they owe themselves...The liberation of spirit that has come to India could not come as release alone. In India, with its layer below layer of distress and cruelty, it had to come as disturbance. It had to come as rage and revolt. India was now a country of a million little mutinies.""
India is an ambitious country these days: there is more hope, but there is more frustration too. If Indians can stop turning their anger on each other, and use it instead to demand the kind of government they need, they will be on the way to getting a healthier, better-educated country with cleaner politics and an economic system that works.

But recently it has come to look as though the most visible divide in the next general election will be an economic one, slicing down the middle of the country.
Until the end of last year, it seemed that the next election would be a two-horse race between the ruling Congress party and the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party. But state elections in December gave a boost to a third contender, a group of leftist and regional parties. After the victories of the Janata Dal in Karnataka and the Telugu Desam in Andhra Pradesh, parties belonging to this loose, rather motley group now rule six states which between them contain more than half the seats in Parliament (Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka). The regional parties of Tamil Nadu, Assam and Punjab may also join the front.
Most of the leftish states are on the poorer, eastern side of the country. The east has trailed behind the west for decades. Its problems stem from its natural wealth: since it was rich in iron and coal, the government set up heavy, state-owned industries there. The west, with its lighter industries, became the home of private enterprise. Despite subsidies, the state sector stagnated. These days the west is richer and more literate, and has more roads, electricity, telephones and almost anything that can be taken as an indicator of development.
Liberalisation is sharpening this divide. Now that most government controls on private-sector investment have one, businessmen can choose where to put their factories; they generally choose to go where they can find roads, electricity and markets. The west, therefore, is benefiting from the current revival of manufacturing. And since the government is cutting its subsidies to public-sector industry and its assistance to the poorer states, the east looks like falling further behind.
Not that the emerging political divide matches this economic divide perfectly. Punjab, in the north, is one of India's richest states; Karnataka, in the south-west, may still be poor, but it is home to India's flourishing computer industry. The parties of this third force are brought together by a range of resentments against the Congress-run central government: And since liberalisation has forced state governments to compete with each other for private investment, even leftish parties boast of their liberal attitudes towards investment and privatisation. Jyoti Basu, the Communist chief minister of West Bengal, is the neatest example of this trend: a convert to private enterprise, he has been traipsing the world to attract international capital to West Bengal.
Some see the rise of the third force as merely a repetition of a familiar pattern in Indian politics. An ill-assorted group unites for just long enough to threaten Congress--even to oust it, as in 1977 and 1989--and is then destroyed by its own divisions. Indeed, the third force first got together before the 1991 general election. Its constituent parties agreed not to field candidates against each other. It managed to win about a fifth of the seats in the lower house--but then fell apart in a series of quarrels. Many of the MPS elected from its parties defected to Congress, giving the prime minister, Narasimha Rao, an absolute majority.
At the moment, however, Mr Rao is battling to hold his own party together, in the face of a growing split caused by the resignation from the cabinet of Mr Rao's chief rival for the top job, Arjun Singh. Since Congress has no mechanism for switching leaders, a split is more likely than a change.
The sight of Congress's support slipping so badly in the south has brought new strength to the third-force parties. They have enough cohesion to join hands in most, if not all, constituencies in the next general election; some people in the new grouping talk of winning an absolute majority of seats. That is no longer inconceivable.
Who would lead a third-force government? V.P. Singh, who was prime minister in the Janata Dal minority government in 1989 and 1990, is the new alliance's only national figure, But he was a disaster last time, and has many enemies. The name of Biju Patnaik, chief minister of Orissa, has cropped up, but Mr Patnaik himself scoffs at the notion. A long shot could be West Bengal's Jyoti Basu. Five times chief minister of that state, he would win on seniority, brains and sophistication. However, his party is one of the junior partners of the Janata Dal, and lacks leverage.
A third-force government would be unlikely to reverse economic liberalisation. But it might limit foreign investment in consumer goods (regarded by the left as wasteful, and benefiting only the rich). It would probably want to spend more money on helping the poor. And since its many parties and factions would fight for subsidies for interest groups, fiscal discipline would probably decay.
To counter the threat from the left, Mr Rao must seek pacts with other small or regional parties. In Tamil Nadu, for instance, Congress has long had a deal with the main regional party, the AIADMK; the deal delivers the state government to the regional party in return for its support for Congress at the national level. Now that the AIADMK is being wooed by the third force, Mr Rao is expected to fight for the alliance as if his career depended on it--which it may.
The prime minister may be looking for similar deals in Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh. Some members of his party worry that he is prepared to let Congress lose power in the states in order to retain it in Delhi. Mr Singh and his band of dissidents are capitalising on these fears. If Mr Rao fares badly in a number of state elections which take place this month and in March, the dissidents will gather strength. All of which gives succour to the third force.","INDIA divides in many ways : by caste , religion , language , region .

 Most of the leftish states are on the poorer , eastern side of the country . The east has trailed behind the west for decades . Its problems stem from its natural wealth : since it was rich in iron and coal , the government set up heavy , state - owned industries there . The west , with its lighter industries , became the home of private enterprise . Despite subsidies , the state sector stagnated . These days the west is richer and more literate , and has more roads , electricity , telephones and almost anything that can be taken as an indicator of development . 
 Liberalisation is sharpening this divide . Now that most government controls on private - sector investment have one , businessmen can choose where to put their factories ; they generally choose to go where they can find roads , electricity and markets . The west , therefore , is benefiting from the current revival of manufacturing . And since the government is cutting its subsidies to public - sector industry and its assistance to the poorer states , the east looks like falling further behind . 
 Not that the emerging political divide matches this economic divide perfectly . Punjab , in the north , is one of India 's richest states ; Karnataka , in the south - west , may still be poor , but it is home to India 's flourishing computer industry . The parties of this third force are brought together by a range of resentments against the Congress - run central government : And since liberalisation has forced state governments to compete with each other for private investment , even leftish parties boast of their liberal attitudes towards investment and privatisation . Jyoti Basu , the Communist chief minister of West Bengal , is the neatest example of this trend : a convert to private enterprise , he has been traipsing the world to attract international capital to West Bengal . 
 Some see the rise of the third force as merely a repetition of a familiar pattern in Indian politics . An ill - assorted group unites for just long enough to threaten Congress -- even to oust it , as in 1977 and 1989 - -and is then destroyed by its own divisions . Indeed , the third force first got together before the 1991 general election . Its constituent parties agreed not to field candidates against each other . It managed to win about a fifth of the seats in the lower house -- but then fell apart in a series of quarrels . Many of the MPS elected from its parties defected to Congress , giving Narasimha Rao an absolute majority . 
 At the moment , however , Narasimha Rao is battling to hold Narasimha Rao's own party together , in the face of a growing split caused by the resignation from the cabinet of Narasimha Rao's chief rival for the top job , Arjun Singh . Since Congress has no mechanism for switching leaders , a split is more likely than a change . 
 The sight of Congress 's support slipping so badly in the south has brought new strength to the third - force parties . They have enough cohesion to join hands in most , if not all , constituencies in the next general election ; some people in the new grouping talk of winning an absolute majority of seats . That is no longer inconceivable . 
 Who would lead a third - force government ? V.P. Singh , who was prime minister in the Janata Dal minority government in 1989 and 1990 , is the new alliance 's only national figure , But he was a disaster last time , and has many enemies . The name of Biju Patnaik , chief minister of Orissa , has cropped up , but Mr Patnaik himself scoffs at the notion . A long shot could be West Bengal 's Jyoti Basu . Five times chief minister of that state , he would win on seniority , brains and sophistication . However , his party is one of the junior partners of the Janata Dal , and lacks leverage . 
 A third - force government would be unlikely to reverse economic liberalisation . But it might limit foreign investment in consumer goods ( regarded by the left as wasteful , and benefiting only the rich ) . It would probably want to spend more money on helping the poor . And since its many parties and factions would fight for subsidies for interest groups , fiscal discipline would probably decay . 
 To counter the threat from the left , Narasimha Rao must seek pacts with other small or regional parties . In Tamil Nadu , for instance , Congress has long had a deal with the main regional party , the AIADMK ; the deal delivers the state government to the regional party in return for its support for Congress at the national level . Now that the AIADMK is being wooed by the third force , Narasimha Rao is expected to fight for the alliance as if Narasimha Rao's career depended on it -- which it may . 
 Narasimha Rao may be looking for similar deals in Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh . Some members of Narasimha Rao's party worry that Narasimha Rao is prepared to let Congress lose power in the states in order to retain it in Delhi . Mr Singh and his band of dissidents are capitalising on these fears . If Narasimha Rao fares badly in a number of state elections which take place this month and in March , the dissidents will gather strength . All of which gives succour to the third force .",750,India,A29-8245,IN TERM,True,"the prime minister , Narasimha Rao ,",11,True

In power for 43 out of 48 years since independence, it has provided continuity through dangerous times. Recently, it has even been pursuing sensible policies. Its leader, Narasimha Rao, has gone a long way towards unravelling state control and allowing the economy the freedom to grow. Yet the push for reform is foundering. If it is to revive, Congress itself will have to change--probably under a new leader.
Congress is in trouble. Heavy losses in state elections in December look like being repeated in six more states which go to the polls in the next few weeks. The party is not just unpopular, it is crumbling. One of Mr Rao's main rivals, Arjun Singh, a former cabinet minister, resigned from the government and was expelled from the party on February 7th. Another potential rival, Sharad Pawar, the tough chief minister of Maharashtra, may became a declared one if he wins his state election. For a party that scraped to power as a minority government in 1991, the outlook for 1996 is poor.
In the short run, bad news for Congress is bad news for India. While Mr Rao is preoccupied with defending his position, he will have little time for the secondary business of governing. That might not matter if India were trouble-free and had no need of reform. Unfortunately, there is plenty to be done. In particular, economic reform has a long way to go.
In its current state, Congress looks incapable of taking reform into its next, more difficult stage. That would mean hurting the people who have an interest in preserving the privileges of unionised labour and retaining state-owned industry--people who are powerfully represented inside Congress. It may take time, and quite an upheaval, to deal with their resistance. Nonetheless, such an upheaval is possible.
India's politics has much in common with Japan's. Both countries have been run for most of five decades by a single party whose dominance has stifled the growth of alternatives. True, Congress was thrown out by the voters in 1977 and 1989, but by alliances so fissile that they broke up almost at once. Both systems deprived the voters of any real political choice, while allowing the ruling parties to grow fat on corruption. And both sets of voters, in consequence, became deeply disillusioned with their politicians.
In Japan, this led to the defeat of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party in 1993. That started a still-unfinished process which seems to be invigorating Japanese democracy. Politicians are now divided into two alliances with real policy differences--the internationalist modernisers in the New Frontier party and the traditionalists in the LDP-Socialist group.
Pawar politics?
Indian voters are in a filthy mood, too. Mr Rao's problems stem from their contempt for anybody in power; since Congress holds sway at the centre and in 13 out of 25 states, it is the butt of their anger. But their disgruntlement will not be put to constructive use unless they are offered a choice: India needs to make up its mind whether to pursue reform or to retain the old structures of state control.
Mr Singh's revolt is not likely to offer them that choice. He and his allies are vision-free opportunists whose political programme consists of kicking Mr Rao in his more sensitive areas. His instincts seem to direct him towards the ground now occupied by an assortment of leftish and regional parties that may emerge as the strongest challengers to Congress in 1996.
The no-nonsense Mr Pawar might offer a more hopeful prospect, if he survives the state election and makes a bid for national power. His state government has pushed liberalisation much further than the central government has. He is hardly an unblemished hero: he is dogged by allegations about his dodgy connections. But he does at least see that Indians need to be liberated from the state. Once upon a time, Congress was the party of freedom.

The scheme is restricted to families with annual incomes below 11,000 rupees and with no more than two children.
Already, more women in India are getting educated and going to work. If this new scheme persuades parents that girls are an asset rather than a liability, it could hasten the trend.

The Congress party, which holds sway over the federal government, lost the country's industrial heartland the states of Maharashtra and Gujarat, though it wrested back Orissa and held Arunachal Pradesh. The states now ruled by Congress account for barely a quarter of the population.
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which promotes Hindu nationalism, used to be seen as a party of north India but has now established itself in the west. It won two-thirds of the seats in Gujarat and combined with a local outfit, the Shiv Sena, in Maharashtra to win 138 of 288 Seats, enough to form a government with the help of independents.
The BJP is market-friendly but says Indian businessmen must be treated preferentially over foreign investors, and wants to keep foreigners out of consumer-goods manufacture. Since the bulk of foreign investment is flowing into the two western states, there is some uncertainty about the future there. However, many people think the BJP will bark at rather than bite foreign investors. At most it may reject future proposals to make such frivolities as fizzy drinks and biscuits. It favours foreign investment in high-tech industries such as energy and telecoms.
The BJP is the party that abetted the demolition of a mosque in Ayodhya in 1992. Its partner in Maharashtra, the Shiv Sena, is an even more rabid Hindu group, which has fomented major Hindu-Muslim riots in Bombay. However, communal tempers have cooled since 1992, and the two parties won the state elections without spreading anti-Muslim hate as they did in the previous election. Within the BJP, this victory will strengthen moderates who argue that voters want prosperity rather than militancy, and that the demolition of other mosques (favoured by the party's hardliners) would antagonise the majority that wants peace.
The head of the Shiv Sena, Bal Thackeray, is a former cartoonist who at times is anything but funny. He castigates democracy and argues for a benevolent dictatorship in India. Muslims dislike him even more than they do the BJP, and fear that the police will be one-sided in any future communal clashes.
Congress lost two southern states last November. Now that it has lost two western ones as well, party dissidents (led by a former government minister, Arjun Sinh) want their leader's head. However, the prime minister, Narasimha Rao, points to his victory in Orissa to show he can revive the party's fortunes. Orissa, he argues, shows that the poor are not against him, as claimed by the left.
Indeed, it is strange that the two western states, which have gained most from his pro-market policies, have dumped him. The best single explanation for the election results is that voters are fed up with the corruption and callousness of all parties, and so voted against the incumbents almost everywhere. Incumbent parties have lost in 25 of India's past 27 state elections. The large number of independents who won in Maharashtra--44 out of a total of 288 seats--also suggest growing disgust with national parties. Mr Rao's camp explains his defeat in the west as part of a general anti-establishment vote.
What, then, does this imply for his own chances in the general election next year? This question is being raised by his party rivals such as Mr Singh. However, Mr Sinh is as much an establishment figure as Mr Rao, and can hardly claim the party would fare better under his leadership. Indeed, Mr Rao's supporters have produced a neat twist to the anti-establishment theory. They point out that opposition parties now rule almost three-quarters of the population, and argue that an anti-establishment vote in the states they control will result in a Congress victory in 1996.
Whatever the logic of this, Mr Rao may take more comfort from India's continued economic growth. The annual economic survey heralding this week's budget reported growth of 5.3% for 1994-95, India's strongest performance in four years. The budget itself was considered anti-protectionist and anti-inflationary, cutting tariffs and excise duties. Mr Rao called it a budget for growth, but industrialists grumbled that there had been no cut in corporate taxes.
There is more money for welfare, but the finance minister, Manmohan Singh, apologised that ""the fruits of growth"" would take time to reach ""the poorest and the weakest"". He criticised opposition politicians who had demanded cheap rice and other subsides. There were no short cuts to prosperity, he said.","THE political map of India has been redrawn after the results of several state elections that were announced on March 13th . The Congress party , which holds sway over the federal government , lost the country 's industrial heartland the states of Maharashtra and Gujarat , though it wrested back Orissa and held Arunachal Pradesh . The states now ruled by Congress account for barely a quarter of the population . 
 The Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) , which promotes Hindu nationalism , used to be seen as a party of north India but has now established itself in the west . It won two - thirds of the seats in Gujarat and combined with a local outfit , the Shiv Sena , in Maharashtra to win 138 of 288 Seats , enough to form a government with the help of independents .

Mr Rao, who has only 91 of the 240 seats in the Rajya Sabha, struggled to persuade minor parties to support a bill to amend the Patents Act, which would have changed India's laws on intellectual property rights in accordance with WTO rules. He failed and withdrew the bill.
The constitution permits the government to make laws by presidential decree, but they must be ratified by parliament within six weeks of its next session. The period is now up, so the amended Patents Act has lapsed. The WTO will give India some time to conform, as it has some other countries which have yet to ratify membership. But if the Rajya Sabha remains adamant, India's membership of WTO will be at risk, and so will investor confidence.
Indian opposition parties are happy with tough rules on copyright (India is a major exporter of software and films), but they oppose changes in regulations on patents and plant-variety protection. India's existing laws give patents only for processes, not products, and drugs patents last for only seven years. So, through reverse engineering, Indian companies have been able to make drug still on patent internationally, and to sell them at a tenth of the international price or less. WTO rules will stop this practice and so lead to higher drug prices. Seeds will also become costlier, because of stricter plant-variety protection.
The fiasco in the Rajya Sabha drives home the lesson that India is, for many purposes, in an era of coalition politics. All legislation except the budget needs the approval of both houses of parliament. The Rajya Sabha is elected by members of state assemblies, and Mr Rao has recently suffered major reversals in assembly elections in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. A third of the members of the Rajya Sabha retire every two years and fresh elections are held to fill their place. When this happens, Mr Rao's strength in the Rajya Sabha will decline further.
The prime minister has exasperated many liberalisers by refusing to reform some parts of the economy even while changing others radically. His weakness in the Rajya Sabha in part accounts for this failure. He has been radical in abolishing most industrial and import licensing, since that does not require fresh legislation. Changes in India's rigid labour rules would, however, need legislation. Mr Rao has prevailed on other parties to pass laws promoted by the government; but he conserves his political capital carefully.
In the case of the Patents Act, Mr Rao will need to use all the resources at his command, and may fail even then. A general election is due next year, and so opposition parties will seek every opportunity to embarrass him. Indeed, it is conceivable that a coalition of parties excluding Mr Rao's Congress party will form the next government.

THE lower orders in India are reaching for power. The result of the latest state-assembly election, in the northern state of Bihar, confirms a trend that fills the ruling Congress party with fear: that people are voting, increasingly, on caste lines, and therefore that whoever represents the big lower castes is likely to win.
In Bihar, the Janata Dal, which is dedicated to advancing the lower castes by reserving for them government jobs and college places, increased its tally from 121 to 163 out of 320 seats. Its allies won another 34. Neighbouring Uttar Pradesh, India's largest state, is already ruled by a coalition of two parties, one representing lower castes and one representing untouchables. Both are committed to using job-reservation and patronage networks to improve their voters' prospects. So in these two states, accounting for a quarter of India's population, the main electoral divide is not left against right, or communalism against secularism, but upper against lower castes.
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) took 40 seats in Bihar. The Congress party, which had 71 seats in the outgoing assembly, limped in third with 28 seats. Even this was better than its performance in Uttar Pradesh in the 1993 state election, when it came fourth. Congress has almost ceased to matter in the Hindi-speaking north that used to be its heartland.
During the independence movement, Congress brought together all sections of society, making itself into a national force that no other party could match. After independence it had, for decades, a virtual political monopoly. It drew strength from the divisions between other parties. The Janata Dal, which was born out of a coalition of anti-Congress groups, won power, at times, in state elections and briefly, twice, at the centre. But the coalition always fell apart, leading congress to believe it was the natural party of government.
These days, though, there are new, stronger-looking forces around. Hindu nationalism, represented by the BJP, is one such. The recent round of state elections has consolidated its hold on the rich west of the country. In the north, caste has provided the Janata Dal with a stronger identity than its old opposition to Congress. The prime minister, Narasimha Rao, has given Congress a new direction with his economic reforms. However, there is now a general consensus among parties that what he has done so far was right; and state governments of all colours are busy privatising and inviting in foreign investors. Business interests and the middle class therefore have no reason to favour Congress, which now seems unlikely to win even 200 out of the 544 seats in next year's general election.
Bihar is not the sort of place in which an incumbent could naturally expect to be returned to power. Law and order broke down more than a decade ago, and private armies prowl the land. There are many illegal gun factories. The state is bankrupt. Government employees go weeks and even months without pay. Yet the Janata Dal chief minister, Laloo Prasad Yadav, has been returned with an increased majority--largely because the majority of Biharis are Yadavs or members of other lower castes.
The three top castes--brahmins (priest-scholars), kshatriyas (warrior landowners) and vaishyas (businessmen)--account for only 22% of India's Hindu population, but have dominated Hindu society for millennia. The labouring castes account for half the Hindu population but have only 4-6% of government jobs.
The lower castes now want their people in power, and as many jobs and college places reserved for them as possible. They are not impressed by arguments about merit and good government. Since the upper castes have had power for so long, they say this is no more than common justice.
Mr Yadav has been doing as his supporters want: single-mindedly inducting lower-caste people into schools, the bureaucracy, the police. Uttar Pradesh sacked its chief secretary because he happened to be a brahmin. Candidates from lower castes have been given extra marks in exams for entry into the civil service. Copying in exams has been a big issue in Uttar Pradesh: the politicians representing the lower castes repealed penalties against it, on the ground that real exams gave the better-educated upper castes an unfair advantage.
Caste politics bodes ill for India's future. Yet it has had one good side-effect. The lower-caste parties strongly oppose militant Hinduism, which they see as a plot by brahmins to take power. Muslims, who used to vote Congress but were outraged by the prime minister's behaviour during the crisis over the Ayodhya mosque in 1992, have turned instead to the Janata Dal and others like it. With pro-Muslim parties in power, bridges are being built between Muslims and Hindus in the area where the worst disputes between them took place not long ago.","DELHI

And here is the current, cold reality, as observed during the campaign for councils in England and Wales outside London, where voting takes place on May 4th. More and more would-be councillors campaign under party labels on narrow party manifestos. More and more of them see local office simply as a stepping stone to national office. More and more of the campaigning is done nationally, with senior Westminster politicians issuing mendacious claim and counter-claim to bored and fractious London-based journalists. More and more, the result does not matter a fig locally, since council budgets are dictated by Whitehall. More and more, the only story that matters is what the results tell us about the state of national politics.
If the Tories suffer the expected drubbing, you will read very little about the effects of the Tory disappearance, pro tem, as an active force in local government. You will read nothing at all about the likely result: many councils in which the Lib Dems and Labour are in a majority for the first time, experimenting in practice with coalition politics while it remains anathema in national politics. Instead comment--including here--will concentrate on what the result implies for John Major's chances of remaining prime minister. As for local democracy, who cares?
Before you despair, the warm-beer version deserves a rather more sceptical look. That honest burgher was not always what he seemed. For one thing, he (and it was invariably a ""he"") was often elected unopposed. As national parties have taken an ever more active role in local elections--a process which accelerated after 1974 when local government was reorganised into bigger units--the proportion of uncontested seats has fallen from 40% to under 10%, according to Chris Game and Steve Leach, academics writing for the independent Commission for Local Democracy.
Nor were all these councillors the selfless souls that the mythology implies. In fact, warm beer was used liberally to bribe the electorate. Later, an alarmingly high proportion of councillors were estate agents or builders or contractors to the local authority. Of course, they were supposed to declare an interest when they had one. But competition, for example for membership of the council planning committee, was suspiciously intense. Tory authorities were riddled with members of the Masons. Labour authorities were sometimes directly corrupt.
Partisanship may have been less universal, but it was no less intense. Party discipline in those Labour authorities was awesome. And the parties adopted some narrow agendas. Herbert Morrison, as leader of the London County Council, famously tried to drive the Tories out of London with a massive housebuilding programme. Municipal fiefs were erected, where Labour councillors doled out council housing in return for which the grateful inhabitants doled out their votes. The current case against Westminster for allegedly flogging homes cheaply to Tory-voting owner-occupiers, when they should have been used to house the homeless, is a modern Tory reflection of an ancient Labour practice.
None of this stops some observers hankering after days past. Martin Easteal, chief executive of the Local Government Commission, argued recently that party domination of local government must be moderated if councils are to be seen as a credible alternative to quangos. ""Local elections are now dominated by party politics, and many people who care about the interests of their local community are put off from standing,"" he said.
Yet the evidence suggests otherwise. According to Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher, two more local-government academics, the average number of candidates per seat in shire counties has risen from 2.4 in 1973 to 3.1 in 1993. This is despite the fact that the average councillor spends 74 hours a month on council business.
One contribution has come from an increase in the numbers of women candidates. They now account for one in four councillors, according to a Rowntree Foundation survey by Ken Young and Mirmala Rao of Queen Mary and Westfield College.
Moreover, party politics have made local elections more meaningful, say Messrs Rallings and Thrasher. They enable electors to choose between competing local programmes. And, despite partisanship, local government is also, common consent, enormously more efficient than it used to be. So what has gone wrong?
The simple answer, as you might have guessed, is government policy. After winning power in 1979, Tories at Westminster wanted to cut public spending. They found it impossible to cut their own central-government budget, so they decided instead to cut local government's. They found ample pretext for this in the inanities of some urban Labour councils of the 1980s. Hence the capping of council budgets. Hence the nationalisation of business rates. Hence the reduction of local authorities' independent sources of financing. Then came the tragi-comedy of the abandoned poll tax, and the pure comedy of the current review of local-government structure.
The miracle today is not that local government is flawed, though it is. The miracle is that recognisably democratic, reasonably efficient and relatively uncorrupt local government has survived at all. It would be a fitting revenge for local government if the May 4th elections spelled the beginning of the end for a national government that has done its best to destroy it.","HERE is the warm-beer version of how local elections used to be: honest burghers, free from party label, earnestly seeking the support of their fellow citizens on a programme of doing their best for their communities for no pay and paltry expenses.

Then came the tragi-comedy of the abandoned poll tax, and the pure comedy of the current review of local-government structure.
The miracle today is not that local government is flawed, though it is. The miracle is that recognisably democratic, reasonably efficient and relatively uncorrupt local government has survived at all.

On coming to power, the Shiv Sena declared that Aurangabad, named after the Mogul emperor Aurangzeb, would be renamed Sambhajinagar, after the son of Shivaji; and Osmanabad, also named after a Muslim conqueror, would be renamed Dharashiv (river of Shiv). Thus the Shiv Sena's renaming campaign is an emotional attempt to avenge not merely the British conquest but, more to the point, earlier Muslim ones. The party thinks this is how to consolidate its hold on Hindu votes. The prospect appals not only Muslims but secular Hindus.

The two neighbours have already fouht three wars. Both now can make nuclear weapons. The destruction of the historic Charar-i-Sharif mosque in Kashmir on May 11th has set off a fresh round of warmongering on the subcontinent.
The territory known as Kashmir is composed of Indian Kashmir, formally called Jammu & Kashmir, and Pakistan's Azad (Free) Kashmir. The division, and the current dispute, go back to Britain's departure from the territory in 1947. Time has not proved a healer: the fate of Indian Kashmir, the country's only Muslim-majority state, has been a central issue in all three wars. After the Kashmir dispute last flared up, in 1989, America began quietly sponsoring ""confidence-building"" measures to calm things down. But a lot of confidence has gone up in smoke, along with the mosque.
The Indians blame Islamic militants, who had occupied the shrine, for the fire. The Indian government has accused Pakistan of stirring up trouble in Kashmir and one Indian minister has threatened war. The Pakistanis, and many Muslims in Kashmir, blame the Indian army for the fire. Pakistan has put its armed forces on alert and has declared May 19th a national day of mourning. The country's mood has become so aggressive that several right-wing commentators and Islamic groups have urged the government to test a nuclear device and make ready a bomb. Only two weeks ago India and Pakistan signed a new trade agreement. Now Pakistan is talking of banning all trade with India.
The first move to calm things down has come from India. Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister, has repudiated bellicose statements from some of his ministers. Pranab Mukherjee, the foreign minister, has offered to hold talks with Pakistan on all disputes, including Kashmir. But the Pakistanis have yet to be mollified.
Deep-rooted hostility and fear remain on both sides. The Pakisanis believe that India has never reconciled itself to the ""two-nation theory"" that led to the partition of the subcontinent in 1947. India, in turn, argues that Pakistan has not given up its dreams of wrenching away Kashmir by force. Both sides accuse each other of fomenting terrorism. Trade and travel between the two countries, which was cut off after the war of 1965, was resumed only in the late 1970s and remains insignificant.
The revolt in Kashmir in 1989 looked as though it might provoke another war. Worried, the Americans sent Robert Gates, a senior White House official (and later head of the CIA), to Islamabad and Delhi. His aim was to produce a more rational relationship between the two countries. One of his suggestions was to reduce the risk of war by opening lines of communication between the two armies; another was to promote an ""unofficial dialogue"" so that the two sides might know each other's minds better.
Some useful things have happened. Both sides now give notice of military manoeuvres and exercises; a hot-line between military commanders is in place; violations of air space have stopped; a treaty banning the manufacture and use of chemical weapons now exists and lists have been exchanged of nuclear facilities. Scores of unofficial meetings, involving a mix of worthies from both countries, have occurred in spaces as far apart as Austria and China.
But there are limits to the effects of all this. The rise of Hindu extremism in India is running parallel with the resurgence of Islamic passions in Pakistan, which makes rapprochement difficult. Pakistan remains opposed to the exchange of military delegations because, officials say, it would ""create a false sense of bonhomie"".
Nuclear weapons remain off the agenda. Pakistan says it wants to discuss a nuclear-weapons-free zone in South Asia and suggests that both sides sign the Nuclear NonProliferation Treaty (NPT). India rejects this, partly because of worries about China and partly because it considers the NPT to be ""globally iniquitous"". Some people think that if the Indians were ever to call the Pakistani bluff and accept the NPT proposals, Pakistan would back away quickly.
The certral problem, however, remains how and when to deal with Kashmir. Whereas the Indians want to get on with less contentious political and economic problems, the Pakistanis say that Kashmir must be solved first. Their suggestion of third-party mediation to settle the dispute has been rejected by India, which does not want to ""internationalise"" the issue.
More broadly, some people believe that the concept of confidence-building, which originated in Europe in the cold war, does not travel well to South Asia. The cold war was a struggle of ideologies. Historical experience, especially of communal conflict, remains at the root of the subcontinent's animosities. A premeditated war in Europe, some say, was never very likely. In the subcontinent, the evidence suggests that all the three Indo-Pakistani wars were planned.
The chances of further confrontation are increased by India's plans to hold a state election in Kashmir in July. If it is held, it may be a bloody affair. The militants' boycott means that turnout may be tiny in the almost entirely Muslim valley of Kashmir. The valley, however, accounts for no more than 46 of the 87 seats in the state assembly, and the poll would be more or less normal in the other two parts of the state, Hindu-majority Jammu and Buddhist-majority Ladakh. Pakistan says a legitimate election cannot be held with 500,000 Indian troops in the valley. It wants a referendum on the future of Kashmir instead.
The bellicosity continues to raise fears of another war. They may be misplaced. A war would cause immense damage, and might be unwinnable. Pakistan has more to gain by surreptitiously aiding the Muslim militants than by launching a frontal attack. And India probably realises that war with Pakistan cannot remove the causes of Kashmiri militancy.","WHEN India and Pakistan square up to each other , the world should get nervous .

She is now bitterly contemplating the ruins of her quest. Not only have the rebel Tamil Tigers rejected her peace feelers, but the military advantage has swung in the Tigers' favour.
The government was rattled by the sinking of two naval gunboats which marked the resumption of the civil war on April 19th; but its reaction ten days later to the shooting down of two military aircraft over Jaffna, where the Tigers are strong, was more like panic. Regular flights to the army's isolated bases in Tiger-controlled areas have not been resumed. Now that the air force has lost its confidence, a Tiger onslaught on the base of Poonareen, close to Jaffna, may be imminent.
Since the 100,000-strong security forces appear to be incapable of inflicting a decisive defeat on a rebel force a tenth of their size, the government has turned abroad for help. The defence attache of friendly countries in the region have been invited to Colombo for talks and the government has reversed its ban on arms purchases. It is planning to buy warships, aircraft and armoured vehicles from a number of countries, among them Israel, China and Russia.
But, even with new equipment, the government is not confident that it can defeat the Tigers alone. It particularly wants India to help cut the Tigers' life-line to Tamil Nadu, India's southern state. Supplies of weapons, fuel and other essentials are still smuggled across the Palk Strait to Jaffna. Wounded Tigers are looked after in private hospitals in Tamil Nadu. Tiger uniforms are made in the state. In addition to suppressing such services, Sri Lanka would like India to share intelligence with it, and to agree to a joint naval patrol of the strait.
What India is prepared to offer, however, is rather different. Both countries refuse to disclose the substance of discussions held during two visits to Delhi by Mrs Kumaratua: one just before the peace effort collapsed, the other after the Tigers fired their anti-aircraft missiles. But, according to unconfirmed reports, the Indian prime minister, Narasimha Rao, raised the possibility of a joint raid by Sri Lankan and Indian commandos to capture the Tiger leader, Velupillai Prabhakaran.
In an election year, arresting the man suspected of arranging the murder of Rajiv Gandhi, Mr Rao's predecessor, would help Mr Rao. Snatching Mr Prabhakaran from his jungle hideout would placate Rajiv loyalists in Congress and undercut Mr Rao's main rival, Arjun Singh, who looks to Rajiv's widow, Sonia, for support.
But beyond sending a snatch squad, the signs are that India will not help. Once only too eager to get involved in Sri Lanka, it is now wary of getting sucked back into the mess. Although a strike against Mr Prabhakaran himself might prove popular, co-ordinated action against the Tigers would be deeply resented in Tamil Nadu, where the main Tamil parties sympathise--either openly or covertly--with the Tigers. And memories are still fresh of 1987-90, when a 100,000-strong Indian peacekeeping force occupied the north and east of the island, but failed to tame the Tigers and suffered many casualties.

A split in the ruling Congress party, made more open by a meeting of the rebels on May 19th, may bring down his government. Even if he struggles on for now, Congress faces the prospect of an electoral drubbing in 1996.
The Congress dissidents led by Arjun Singh, a former government minister, are not a large band--they command at most 16 of Congress's 267 members of Parliament. But if the rebels simply abstain in Parliament, Mr Rao will be reduced to a minority, and would have to strike deals with minor parties to survive. That might work. But the main opposition parties, which co-operated with him when he came to power as a minority prime minister in 1991, may now see a chance to crush a divided Congress.
Even if the rebels, as a group, won only 4% of the vote in a general election--and they scored over 7% in two recent state elections--that could translate into a loss of 50 to 100 seats for Congress in India's first-past-the-post electoral system. Before the split, few pundits gave Congress more than 200 seats out of 544 in the 1996 election. In current circumstances, the party might get fewer than 150.
The Congress rebels hope to be much more than spoilers. They want to wrest control of the party from Mr Rao and then to reinvigorate it. The rebels claim, probably correctly, that Mr Rao is incapable of leading the party to victory in 1996. But a party led by Mr Singh would scarcely fare better. Congress is widely regarded as inefficient and corrupt and Mr Singh, who has been dogged by scandals throughout his career, is in no position to campaign as Mr Clean. Nor are the rebels likely to be much more successful than Mr Rao in winning back Muslim voters, who have traditionally been loyal to Congress.
So the rebels are gambling, somewhat desperately, on getting the backing of Rajiv Gandhi's widow, Sonia. Though Mrs Gandhi, who is Italian by birth, has no wish to lead the party, she meets and listens to different factions. In a party that deifies the Gandhi family, the mere ability to meet her improves the standing of any politician.
Mr Singh wants to exploit her unhappiness with Mr Rao for allegedly not proceeding enthusiastically enough with the official inquiry into her husband's assassination. But, despite her unhappiness on this score, Mrs Gandhi has called for unity in the party and shows no sign of favouring either side.
Mrs Gandhi may fear that if she backs Mr Singh, she could be dragged off her pedestal and into the mud of Indian politics. Her husband was accused of collecting kickbacks in an arms contract and the investigation is still winding its way through Swiss courts. Many of Mr Rao's colleagues believe that he has Swiss documents casting suspicion on the Gandhi family, and will release them should she turn against him. Opposition parties have also dug into the business affairs of Mrs Gandhi's family in Italy and will throw mud if she enters active politics. She may therefore prefer to stay in the background, keeping the family seat warm for her two children, Rahul and Priyanka, in case either should wish to enter politics.
Even without Mrs Gandhi on their side, the Congress rebels will badly damage Mr Rao's electoral hopes. Yet Congress may retain some power. The chances are India will get a coalition government, and Congress could be part of it. Both Congress and the left-wing parties dislike the Hindu-nationalist parties, the Bharatiya Janata Party and Shiv Sena; a united front to keep militant Hindus at bay is therefore a possibility.
Mr Rao's real difficulty is that, though his economic policies have been acclaimed by foreign bankers and businessmen, Indian voters are much less impressed. He came to power when India was on the verge of defaulting on its foreign debt, and stopped the rot with two years of austerity and a lifting of controls. But austerity does not win votes. Industrial growth slowed to a crawl in Mr Rao's first three years and rose sharply only in his fourth year. Liberalisation has hardly touched agriculture, and the 73% of voters living in the countryside neither know nor care much about India's burgeoning foreign-exchange reserves or industrial delicensing.
Mr Rao's political fate may ultimately depend less on international capital flows than on the weather. He is hoping for a normal monsoon for the seventh year in a row. In conjunction with the current industrial boom, this could lift GDP growth above 6%, the highest since he came to power, and put voters in a happier mood. But even the rain gods may desert Congress. The odds favour a poor monsoon.","DELHI -- THE threat to the government of Narasimha Rao is growing more ominous .

While the argument rolls on, the rain will being to rot unless something is done. About 25m tonnes is in proper storage. The rest is stacked in the open, covered only by plastic sheets. The monsoon will soon arrive, and damage seems inevitable. The government wants to export 4.5m tonnes but may not manage even half of that. India has rain-unloading machines in its ports, thanks to the old American food-aid programme, but the machines cannot be used for loading. So grain exports are lugged on board ship by physical labour, which makes shipping at least $20 a tonne dearer.
India needs to invest perhaps half a billion dollars in mechanical handling equipment, not only in its ports but also in the grain markets of the north-west and in fast trains to move the grain to the ports. Even then, quality will work against it. Indian rice has up to 30% of broken grain, well above the international norm. Most of the world wants hard (durum) wheat, but India produces soft wheat. And it angrily resents the subsidies paid by some of its rival producers, particularly the European Union.
But it will lose even more money if it stores the stuff. The government buys grain at previously announced support prices, and then distributes it through ration shops with a subsidy. In the past, procurement and sales were roughly balanced, given a lag or two. But in 1994 procurement was 25.9m tonnes and sales were only 14.1m tonnes. The imbalance could be even worse this year. The carrying cost of the food stock is 20% a year, so exporting it at a modest loss is cheaper than storing it.
Critics of the Indian prime minister, Narasimha Rao, say it is scandalous that grain should be exported at all when so many Indians still go hungry. The amount of grain available--production adjusted for changes in government stocks--peaked at 510 grammes a person a day in 1991, declined to 464 grammes in 1993 and went back only to 474 grammes in 1994. Grain production has been going up (see chart) but much of the increase has simply expanded the food mountain.(Chart omitted)
Among unskilled Indians, real wages dropped in the first 18 months of economic reform. Since then they have been rising, yet grain consumption has not picked up. The food subsidy is now offset by the higher carrying cost, so in some places the subsidised price in ration shops is no lower than the open-market price. The critics jeer that Mr Rao has globalised rain prices without globalising the income of the poor.
However, the sharpest increase of price has been in meat, eggs, vegetables and edible oil. Some economists believe that this represents a move by newly prosperous consumers to better sorts of food. Both theories could be true. Perhaps the poor are eating less while simultaneously better-off people shift from grain to meat and vegetables.
With a general election approaching, several states are proposing extra rain subsidies earmarked for the poor. Mr Rao himself is thinking of a bigger food subsidy for particularly hard-hit districts. But most economists doubt whether this will much increase the demand for rain. The quickest way of getting rid of that troublesome food mountain would be a drought. India has not had a drought since 1987. The meteorological office has just predicted the eighth normal monsoon in a row. But, as a farm minister once remarked, the success rate of meteorology in India is somewhat lower than that of astrology.","NOT many people know it , but India is sitting on a mountain of 30 m tonnes of grain ; it could increase to 36 m tonnes by the end of June , when the wheat harvest ends .

A BOOK called ""The Bear Trap"" is popular in the Indian army's barracks in Kashmir. Its author is a retired Pakistani brigadier, who gives a crackling account of the role he and the Pakistani intelligence services (the ISI) played in directing the guerrilla war in Afghanistan. Indian officers believe that Pakistan is now up to something similar in Kashmir.
Things are going badly for the Indians in the disputed province of Jammu & Kashmir. On May 11th fighting between the Indian army and Muslim rebels led to a fire destroying the historic Islamic shrine of Chrar-i-Sharif. Both sides blame each other for starting the fire deliberately. In any event, the subsequent increase in tensions has put paid to plans to hold elections in Kashmir next month. Since such elections underpinned India's hopes of restoring calm to the province, government policy is now at a dead end. The only other plan put forward by Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister, was to allow Kashmir greater autonomy. But since that idea was to be discussed with the newly elected government, it may also be shelved.
In place of the hordes of journalists who were expected in Srinagar to report on the first state elections in eight years, there are now soldiers on the alert at every corner. Shops are often closed because of strikes or curfews. Gunfire is regularly heard at night. With the political way forward blocked, the death toll continues to rise. According to official figures, the number of people killed--rebels, soldiers and civilians--is averaging around 50 a week. Over 150,000 Indian troops now occupy the Kashmir valley.
The Indians blame Pakistan for much of this. They say that the ISI has recently launched ""Operation Explosive"", a terrorist campaign modelled on the struggle against the Russian-backed government in Afghanistan. The recent discovery of bomb factories is put down to Pakistani training. To confirm their theories, the Indians present the testimony of Abu Jindal, a young fighter from Faisalabad in Pakistan. He was captured after the fighting at Charar-i-Sharif and has supplied graphic descriptions of his band of Islamic militants, and their alleged links to the ISI.
Many independent observers believe that Pakistan has been supporting the rebellion in Kashmir. But the Indians are deluding themselves if they think that Pakistan is the only cause of their problems in Kashmir. Indian attempts to rig an election lay behind the initial rebellion that broke out in 1989. Since then, there have been regular reports of acts of brutality committed by Indian troops stationed in Kashmir.
Nonetheless, the Indian army remains convinced that foreign fundamentalists, many of them hardened by experience in the Afghan war, are playing a crucial role in Kashmir.

The trips abroad are good for the egos of the ministers. What else they are good for is not yet clear. Frustrated industrialists might prefer it if the politicians stayed at home and forced through some industrial approvals instead. Foreign companies say that, although it can now be fairly easy to get top-level clearances for investments, there are still endless blockages (often linked to demands for bribes) lower down. Despite that, foreign investment in India is climbing rapidly; $700m came in during the first four months of this year. This year's total will be appreciably higher than last year's paltry $950m.
The competition that has been building up between Indian states for investment is one of the most promising by-products of the 1991 liberalisation programme. This cut back severely on centralised industrial controls, leaving the states free to deal directly with investors. State governments are now proving more self-confident, and marketing themselves more vigorously than India's national government has ever dared to do. A prominent industrialist who is being wooed by several states for an attractive project says: ""A year or two back, we'd have had to go to the chief minister's office and touch his knee. Now he's coming to Bombay to seek me out.""
Mr Basu's reign marketing trip has been supported by a promotional report on West Bengal by Price Waterhouse, a management consultancy firm. This picks out a range of agricultural, manufacturing and service industries for investment. The state is not an easy sell. Its chief city, Calcutta, is a byword for poverty. West Bengal has suffered decades of industrial decline and labour unrest and by the 1980s was one of India's least popular investment locations. But after liberalisation began Mr Basu, who had been chief minister since 1977, decided to woo investors. He has quelled industrial unrest with Thatcherite zeal. That has helped to restore the area's industrial traditions. In the past 30 months West Bengal has been running second only to Maharashtra for foreign-investment approvals.
Although there have been some mutterings in the grass roots about the abandonment of Marxist beliefs, Mr Basu and his aides neatly sidestep the problem. ""This is not a communist state--I wish it was! I am therefore a Communist working in a capitalist system,"" says Somnath Chatterjee, a 65-year-old Communist MP who is leading the investment drive as head of Bengal's Industrial Development Corporation and is tipped as a possible successor to Mr Basu. He is listed as being on the New York-London Concorde flight with Mr Basu, while the rest of the delegation fly sub-sonic.
Not all states, however, are as sure as the Marxists of West Bengal about their support for foreign investment. Mr Joshi has managed to sign an agreement in London for British and other firms to build a new airport for Bombay. But he is likely to have a hard time in America because his government is now finalising a controversial review of a $920m contract for a power station being built in Maharashtra, by Enron of Houston. His ambivalence about foreign investment also extends to consumer goods ventures which, he has suggested, should remain under the control of Indian companies. The slogan ""Microchips, Yes!

However, the Indian prime minister, Narasimha Rao, seems determined to go ahead with the elections. He would really have preferred a poll in May, but was dissuaded from holding it after a holy shrine at Charar was burned down, apparently by militants, although the army has been blamed by many local people.
The prospects for a successful election look unpromising. All local parties save one, the National Conference have said they will boycott the pall. A low turnout is probable, especially among Muslims. The National Conference was popular when headed by Sheikh Mohammed Abdullah, known as the Lion of Kashmir. He spent two decades in jail while the Congress party rigged and won four state elections from the 1950s onwards. When the sheikh was released, he won the first free election in the state in 1977 and it seemed then that Kashmiri resistance to Indian rule would ebb away. But when the sheikh died in 1983, his successor and son, Farooq Abdullah, became an ally of the Congress party, and the two rigged the 1987 state election. That convinced many Kashmiris that they could not hope for fairness under Indian rule. The insurrection began, aided by arms and training from Pakistan.
Mr Abdullah, the probable next leader of Kashmir, is viewed by most Kashmiri Muslims as a puppet of the Delhi government. But Mr Rao believes, rightly, that rule by any sort of Kashmiri will be more acceptable to locals than rule from Delhi.
India has been criticised in Europe and America for its brutality and disdain for human rights in the state. The criticism will diminish if an election is held, which is why local pro-independence parties (and militants) oppose a poll. Local parties hope that America will put pressure on India to grant the state independence. However, the American ambassador to India, Frank Wisner, met these parties recently and advised them to take part in the election. Support for human rights does not mean support for independence.
Mr Rao believes the American advice is a favourable development. Indeed, he hopes that some other local parties may contest the polls at the last minute. Such an outcome would bolster Mr Rao's own prospects in next year's general election. He hopes that promises of greater autonomy will satisfy the pro-independence groups, who will then help to quell the militants. However, this process could take years. An election can be only a first step.
It is a step that may leave hundreds dead, and for this reason the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party has joined those who want the elections postponed till conditions in Kashmir are more normal.

The fact that this question can even be asked without sounding absurd is a pointer to the astonishing improvement in relations between the two countries.
A decade ago, India was castigating Sri Lanka for killing Tamils. Sri Lanka accused India of being an imperialist bully. In 1989 the two countries nearly came to blows when Sri Lanka rudely expelled an Indian force whose help it had earlier desperately sought to quell the Tigers, who want an independent state in the north of the island. These days Sri Lanka, putting aside its fears of Indian domination, is again asking for Indian help. India will not send its men to the island again: more than 1,200 were killed in the earlier intervention. But some Indian help is reaching the Sri Lankan government indirectly.
India's policy towards the ethnic struggle in Sri Lanka has one through three phases. When Indira Gandhi was prime minister, her government aided and armed the Tigers. Training camps for them were set up in Tamil Nadu, the southern Indian state closest to Sri Lanka. After Mrs Gandhi was murdered, however, her son Rajiv sought to mediate between Sri Lanka's Tamils, who are Hindus, and the majority, Buddhist Sinhalese. This was the time of the Indian military intervention, officially described as a peacekeeping operation. Rajiv and the then Sri Lankan president, Junius Jayewardene, agreed that the Indians would help to set up regional elections. But the Tigers refused to surrender their arms, boycotted the elections, fought the Indians, and the civil war continued.
India then became what is best described as an uninterested spectator. But in 1991 Rajiv Gandhi too was murdered. India claims this was masterminded by the Tamil Tigers, a charge they deny. The group was henceforth regarded by most Indians as a bunch of terrorists rather than noble freedom fighters. Tamil Nadu, which had earlier provided sanctuary to the Tigers, now cracked down on them, and expelled thousands. Some local parties in Tamil Nadu still support the Tigers, but India as a whole has lost interest in their cause.
This is so evident that Sri Lankan fears of Indian imperialism have faded. When the new Sri Lankan president, Chandrika Kumaratunga, visited India in May, she asked its prime minister, Narasimha Rao, for help. Mrs Kumaratunga was elected last year, after 17 years in opposition, partly on a promise of ending the civil war by getting the Tigers to accept a deal short of an independent state. Despite opposition from many Sinhalese, fearful of a division of the island, that some believe might turn it into a Bosnia, Mrs Kumaratunga offered the Tamils a high degree of autonomy: their elected leaders would control one of the country's nine proposed provinces. But peace talks with the Tigers have broken down and the two sides are fighting again.
Mr Rao in May listened politely to Mrs Kumaratunga, but he saw, and sees, no advantage for India in again getting directly involved. However, the Tigers have been seizing the boats of Indian fishermen in the Palk Strait, between India and Sri Lanka. And the Indian navy has retaliated by capturing many of the Tigers' boats. This is of some marginal help to Sri Lanka, but is motivated mainly by India's desire to assert its sovereignty rather than concern for Mrs Kumaratunga.
Mr Rao knows that Mrs Kumaratunga would rather make peace with Velupillai Prabakharan, the Tiger leader, than arrest him for Rajiv Gandhi's murder. He does not feel strongly about this. Someone does feel strongly, though: Rajiv's widow, Sonia. To placate her--she is still a name in the land--Mr Rao has gone through the motions of demanding the extradition of Mr Prabakharan to India. But since it is not possible for Mrs Kumaratunga to capture him, the question is academic.
The issue has not impeded the improvement in Indian-Sri Lankan relations. In May, Mrs Kumaratunga proposed a free-trade area between the two--a far cry from the days when Sri Lankans believed free trade would lead to Indian domination. India is not yet ready for free trade in South Asia, since that would mean harmonising tariffs. But it is keen on the creation of a preferential trading block under the auspices of SAARC, the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation, and is lad to have an ally in Sri Lanka.
And what of the war that has so far claimed more than 50,000 lives, and is fought as bitterly as any conflict in the rather more publicised Balkans? The Sri Lankan army is celebrating its most successful single encounter with the Tigers: in July, the army says, it killed more than 300 of their fighters for the loss of two of its own. Last week Mrs Kumaratunga's justice minister ruled out any further negotiations. But, as Mr Rao has perceived, she herself, ever optimistic, believes that one day she will do a deal with the Tigers and end the war.","WILL India help Sri Lanka to defeat the Tamil Tigers in the island 's civil war , now in its 12th year ?

The fact that this question can even be asked without sounding absurd is a pointer to the astonishing improvement in relations between the two countries.
A decade ago, India was castigating Sri Lanka for killing Tamils. Sri Lanka accused India of being an imperialist bully.

On August 31st, the chief minister of Punjab, Beant Singh, was killed by a bomb that exploded as he was getting into his official car in the state capital of Chandigarh. The assassination has blown a hole in Mr Rao's record.
Terrorism in Punjab was the scourge of the 1980s in India, It began in earnest after Indira Gandhi sent in troops to storm a Sikh temple in 1984, and was subsequently assassinated. Sikh extremists demanding a separate state took to the gun, and during the next decade around 25,000 people died, most of them Hindu civilians massacred by the busload.
Indians began to despair that peace could ever be brought to this prosperous state; yet a combination of smart politics and hard policing succeeded. First, the government took the risk of holding state elections in 1992. Only 22% voted, yet that seems to have started normal politics going again in Punjab. Second, Mr Singh, who became chief minister after the election (with 9% of the registered vote), gave the police carte blanche. The police behaved much as the terrorists had, torturing and shooting suspected terrorists and their friends and relations. Civil-rights activists were appalled, but it worked, and Mr Singh got much of the credit for bringing peace to Punjab.
There remained, however, much resentment among the victims of police high-handedness. Punjab's police remain a rough lot, and stories of corruption and brutality abound. Resentment against Mr Singh's role in repression may account for his death. On the other hand, many Indians will suspect that Pakistan has a hand in this. Pakistan has indeed been encouraging separatist insurgents in Kashmir, to the north of Punjab.
Mr Singh was a close ally of Mr Rao's, so this will be a personal blow for the prime minister. It will be a political blow as well, for a general election is close; Mr Rao has many enemies within the party and cannot afford to lose friends. For his countrymen, this death is a reminder what a violent and fragile country India is.","Narasimha Rao , claims two main achievements during Narasimha Rao's four years in office : liberalising the economy and putting an end to terrorism in Punjab . On August 31st , the chief minister of Punjab , Beant Singh , was killed by a bomb that exploded as he was getting into his official car in the state capital of Chandigarh . The assassination has blown a hole in Narasimha Rao's record . 
 Terrorism in Punjab was the scourge of the 1980s in India , It began in earnest after Indira Gandhi sent in troops to storm a Sikh temple in 1984 , and was subsequently assassinated . Sikh extremists demanding a separate state took to the gun , and during the next decade around 25,000 people died , most of them Hindu civilians massacred by the busload . 
 Indians began to despair that peace could ever be brought to this prosperous state ; yet a combination of smart politics and hard policing succeeded . First , the government took the risk of holding state elections in 1992 . Only 22 % voted , yet that seems to have started normal politics going again in Punjab . Second , Mr Singh , who became chief minister after the election ( with 9 % of the registered vote ) , gave the police carte blanche . The police behaved much as the terrorists had , torturing and shooting suspected terrorists and their friends and relations . Civil - rights activists were appalled , but it worked , and Mr Singh got much of the credit for bringing peace to Punjab . 
 There remained , however , much resentment among the victims of police high - handedness . Punjab 's police remain a rough lot , and stories of corruption and brutality abound . Resentment against Mr Singh 's role in repression may account for his death . On the other hand , many Indians will suspect that Pakistan has a hand in this .

Until recently, Mr Rao seemed certain to lose next year. His Congress party was being beaten repeatedly in state elections. His economic reforms have had some limited success, but many voters regard the party as a bunch of crooks and knaves. However, opposition parties that have won office in the states are now splitting and back-stabbing in a struggle for personal power and wealth which rivals anything in the Congress party.
In Gujarat, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), once regarded as the most disciplined in India, has split, with 50 rebels wanting to form a new state government with Congress. To ensure that the BJP cannot get the rebels to rejoin the party, their leader, Shankarsinh Vaghela, has flown them to a hotel in Khajuraho, a tourist centre whose erotic sculptures attract honeymooners. It looks a suitable setting for Mr Vaghela's proposed liaison with Mr Rao.
Last November, Congress was thrashed in Andhra Pradesh, Mr Rao's home state, by the local Telegu Desam Party (TDP), led a film actor, N.T. Rama Rao. Last month the TDP split. Mr Rama Rao's bright and ambitious wife upset his son-in-law, who took the bulk of the party with him and formed a new government. The split has greatly improved Congress's future electoral prospects in the state.
In Uttar Pradesh, India's largest state, Congress was beaten into fourth place in the 1993 state election. The Muslims and the untouchables, who had supported Congress in the previous government, helped to form a new coalition government. Like most coalitions in India, this was riven by personal rivalries. It collapsed in June. The untouchables' party has formed a minority government which is not expected to last. Mr Rao hopes he can forge an alliance for the next election either with the untouchables or the Socialist Party, which has the Muslim vote. Either way, Mr Rao should end up winning many more seats than he could on his own.
After his many state election defeats, observers doubted if Mr Rao could win even 150 seats out of 544 in the general election. Now, after the travails of his rivals in three states accounting for more than a quarter of the population, his tally may approach 200. Opposition governments in other states, among them Maharashtra, could break down before the general election. Optimists in the party say that, if they can somehow get 220 seats, they can engineer the 50-odd defections needed for an absolute majority. Earlier, critics within the party complained that Mr Rao was doing nothing to combat the appeal of opposition parties. In retrospect, his inaction seems masterly--it gave rival parties the opportunity to destroy themselves.","DELHI -- WITH a general election due by next April , Narasimha Rao can take comfort from the growing dissent among opposition parties .

This is the basis of the gamble by the Indian prime minister, Narasimha Rao, who announced on November 4th that a state election will be held in December in Jammu & Kashmir, the first for eight years. More than 20,000 people have already died there during the past five years in the revolt against Indian rule. Many more may die as militants try to sabotage next month's poll.
Anybody standing as a candidate, or even voting, will risk death. Most parties have said they will boycott the election. Turnout in the valley of Kashmir, where the Muslims are in the majority, may be below 10%. Pakistan, which wants to absorb Indian Kashmir, will denounce the poll result as unrepresentative, as will Kashmiri militants. Yet Mr Rao feels that, no matter how flawed the election or unrepresentative the resulting state government, it will be better than continued rule by the army. The soldiers have failed to stamp out terrorism or win over the Muslims, who account for twothirds of the population.
The army has recently managed to reduce the flow of arms from Pakistan to the militants. The mountain passes to Pakistan will be blocked by snow in December, cutting supplies further. So Mr Rao feels that this is a good time to restart politics. Though few people may vote in the valley, turnout should be normal in the other two regions of the state: in Jammu, where the Hindus are in the majority, and in Ladakh, where Buddhists predominate. The valley will account for only 46 of the 87 seats in the state assembly. Overall turnout may exceed 30%, higher than the 28% in Punjab (which had its own terrorist problem) in 1992.
Critics will say that, because of the boycott, the new state government will lack moral authority. However, the same was said of state governments elected under terrorist threats by a tiny minority of voters both in Punjab three years ago and in Assam in 1983. On those occasions the new chief ministers were able to restore order. Kashmir will be tougher. There are far more arms there than were ever loose in Punjab. And Kashmir is regarded as disputed territory internationally. This gives the militants hope of international intervention.
Nobody expects the next Kashmiri government to restore normality immediately. That may take a decade or longer. But in the Indian general election due next year, Mr Rao hopes to show himself as the man who can at least start to end terrorism. The poll in Kashmir is therefore a gamble. If it fails, and militant violence nullifies the election, the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party will be chuckling. It has already denounced the state election as the first step in a plan to give a dangerously large dose of autonomy to Kashmir.
The probable winner of the election is Farooq Abdullah's National Conference. His party was popular when headed by his father, the legendary Sheikh Abdullah. But Abdullah junior discredited himself when he joined hands with the Congress party to rig the 1987 election. Many Kashmiris view him as a traitor. Yet Mr Rao feels that rule by any Kashmiri is preferable to continued rule from Delhi. Once politics gets going again, he hopes, other parties will join in.
Mr Abdullah has demanded greater autonomy for Kashmir immediately, to improve his standing among Kashmiris. Mr Rao has offered only a minor concessionthe right of the state to call its chief minister the wazir (prime minister). As a result, Mr Abdullah has threatened to boycott the poll, but this may turn out to be mere theatrics.
He needs to distance himself from Congress to gain votes. The militants will try to kill him if he becomes wazir, and this prospect too could diminish his ardour for elections. But the betting is that, like most politicians, he will find political power a stronger lure than personal security.","A FLAWED election is better than no election .

Pranab Mukherjee, India's foreign minister, said that his country had no plans to test or deploy nuclear weapons. But the row has revealed growing tension between America and India over nuclear testing-tension which could threaten the prospects for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
India's policy on nuclear weapons combines moral piety with realpolitik. It has always criticised the Non-Proliferation Treaty as nuclear apartheid, which allows the nuclear haves to keep their arsenals, while shutting out the have-nots. Instead, for the past four decades India has campaigned for total nuclear disarmament and for a nuclear test ban as a first step. In the aftermath of the cold war, nuclear proliferation also moved up America's list of priorities. The two countries were able to agree on enough last year to act as joint sponsors of a United Nations resolution on a test ban.
But India has recently been miffed by American complaints about the harshness of its rule in Kashmir. It is also concerned that the recent America sale of arms to Pakistan, which is supposed to be a single deal, may become a habit. India needs new sources of counter-pressure.
As a result, it has recently changed its policy on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. India notes that American scientists have devised ways of testing nuclear bombs without an actual explosion, and intend to carryout such experiments even after a complete test ban. So the Indians now argue that the treaty, as visualised by the Americans, is not a step towards disarmament but a means of perpetuating nuclear apartheid.
If India refuses to sign the treaty, so will Pakistan. And if these two stay out, it will make nonsense of the complete test ban, which is aimed specifically at states on the threshold of going nuclear. So America was concerned when its satellites detected unusual activity at Pokharan, where India held its first (and only) nuclear test, in 1974.
In fact the preparations may relate to India's other source of counter-pressure: a threat to test and deploy its home-made Prithvi missiles, which could carry nuclear warheads short distances. Some years ago, China delivered M-11 missiles to Pakistan, but America persuaded Pakistan to leave the missiles in crates, thus avoiding trade sanctions mandated by the American Congress against those who broke the missiletechnology control regime. But if India decides to deploy the Prithvi, Pakistan will unquestionably deploy the M-11s, obliging the American government to contemplate the uncomfortable prospect of trade sanctions against both China and Pakistan.
Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister, has not deployed the Prithvi, but has warned the Americans that his hand may be forced by Indian public opinion, if America is seen to be pro-Pakistan. Some Indian hawks already favour exploding nuclear weapons and deploying the Prithvi to bring about India's entry into the formal nuclear club. Once admitted, they say, India could happily adopt the club's self-serving line that the bomb is safe in its hands but not in those of others. However, Mr Rao is far too cautious to go for such a high-risk strategy. He believes ambiguity is the best policy.","  AFTER a week of American - inspired speculation that India might be preparing a nuclear test , India finally scotched the rumours .

So they are jubilant rather than surprised that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has charged ten senior politicians of various parties with accepting kickbacks. The ten include L.K. Advani, head of the Bharatiya Janata Party , the main opposition group; Devi Lal, who used to be deputy prime minister during the Janata government of 1989-90, and Arjun Singh, the leader of a rebel faction within the ruling Congress party. Three serving cabinet ministers, including Madhavrao Scindia, often tipped as a possible future prime minister, have also been charged.
In most countries, the indictment of three cabinet ministers would be a blow to the prime minister. But Narasimha Rao is probably smiling. First, Mr Rao will be aided by the damage inflicted on Mr Singh and his rebels. The prime minister can now claim that he is one of the few Congress party members whose hands are clean. Second, he has been given a response to the accusations of Congress party corruption that the opposition parties have been planning to make in the coming general election. Mr Rao could not credibly have denied that some members of his party were venal. But he can now claim, credibly, that other parties are just as bad.
The biggest sufferer will probably be Congress's Hindu-nationalist rival, the BJP. It has been projecting itself as an honest alternative to Congress, and now finds its image tarnished. As well as Mr Advani, Yashwant Sinha, a former finance minister who recently joined the BJP, has also been charged.
The current mess has its origins in 1991, when the police raided the premises of a business family, the Jains. They had been tipped off that the family was laundering foreign money, and was a conduit for foreign funds to Islamic militants in Kashmir. By accident, the police found two diaries containing entries showing pay-offs totalling 650m rupees ($19m) to 115 politicians and bureaucrats between 1988 and 1991. This period witnessed three different prime ministers and ruling coalitions, covering virtually the entire political spectrum. So the list of alleged recipients reads like an all-party ""Who's Who"". The names include Rajiv Gandhi, a former prime minister, and leading lights of all major parties save the two communist ones.
In India, the police are reputed to protect rather than prosecute crooked politicians. Cynics say the authorities would never have allowed the raid on the Jains had they known top politicians would be implicated (the raiding party thought it was chasing Kashmiri militants). When the incriminating diaries came to light, there was silence among India's politicians, who are normally quick to hurl accusations at one another. None were keen on anything further being done, and nothing was.
 So in 1993 two journalists filed a publicinterest suit in the Supreme Court demanding a follow-up. The court castigated the government for its inaction, and ordered the Central Bureau of Investigation to get cracking.
In May 1995 the entire team of investigators was transferred to other departments in a barely concealed attempt to slow down the inquiry. But after further prodding from the court, the CBI conducted a few raids, unearthed some documents and charged one minor politician and some ex-bureaucrats. Now, at long last, the CBI has struck at politicians who matter.
Though the Supreme Court has no doubt been the moving force behind the latest development, Mr Rao may have played a part too. The CBI is controlled directly by him, and few believe that it would act on such major matters without a nod from him - no matter how strong court pressures may have been. It seems clear that Mr Rao delayed action in the earlier years for fear of opening a Pandora's box. But in the run-up to the general election, he may have decided to gamble on the theory that, at this juncture, such charges would hurt his rivals more than him.
Speculation of this kind is popular among ordinary Indians. The political class is seen as uninterested in justice for its own sake. Prosecutions are no longer seen as a means to convict the guilty, but as ploys to win elections. In any event, people with money rarely get convicted of anything. Few believe that the police, administration or even the courts (barring the Supreme Court) are serious about jailing the guilty.
This is not just because of corruption, rife though that is. The police are also demoralised and incompetent, and have repeatedly shown their inability (some say unwillingness) to unearth evidence strong enough to meet the strict standards of proof that courts usually insist on. Public prosecutors are usually badly paid lawyers of low calibre, whereas rich criminals are represented by the finest legal brains that money can buy.
Some years ago, a government commission made several recommendations to improve the quality of the police and prosecution service. But politicians are not interested. Perhaps they fear they might be the first victims of such reforms. ","Indian voters have long believed that all politicians , regardless of party affiliation , are crooks .

Second , Narasimha Rao has been given a response to the accusations of Congress party corruption that the opposition parties have been planning to make in the coming general election . Narasimha Rao could not credibly have denied that some members of Narasimha Rao's party were venal . But Narasimha Rao can now claim , credibly , that other parties are just as bad . 
 The biggest sufferer will probably be Congress 's Hindu - nationalist rival , the BJP . It has been projecting itself as an honest alternative to Congress , and now finds its image tarnished . As well as Mr Advani , Yashwant Sinha , a former finance minister who recently joined the BJP , has also been charged . 
 The current mess has its origins in 1991 , when the police raided the premises of a business family , the Jains . They had been tipped off that the family was laundering foreign money , and was a conduit for foreign funds to Islamic militants in Kashmir . By accident , the police found two diaries containing entries showing pay - offs totalling 650 m rupees ( $ 19 m ) to 115 politicians and bureaucrats between 1988 and 1991 . This period witnessed three different prime ministers and ruling coalitions , covering virtually the entire political spectrum . So the list of alleged recipients reads like an all - party "" Who 's Who "" . The names include Rajiv Gandhi , a former prime minister , and leading lights of all major parties save the two communist ones . 
 In India , the police are reputed to protect rather than prosecute crooked politicians . Cynics say the authorities would never have allowed the raid on the Jains had they known top politicians would be implicated ( the raiding party thought it was chasing Kashmiri militants ) . When the incriminating diaries came to light , there was silence among India 's politicians , who are normally quick to hurl accusations at one another . None were keen on anything further being done , and nothing was . 
  So in 1993 two journalists filed a publicinterest suit in the Supreme Court demanding a follow - up . The court castigated the government for its inaction , and ordered the Central Bureau of Investigation to get cracking . 
 In May 1995 the entire team of investigators was transferred to other departments in a barely concealed attempt to slow down the inquiry . But after further prodding from the court , the CBI conducted a few raids , unearthed some documents and charged one minor politician and some ex - bureaucrats . Now , at long last , the CBI has struck at politicians who matter . 
 Though the Supreme Court has no doubt been the moving force behind the latest development , Narasimha Rao may have played a part too . The CBI is controlled directly by Narasimha Rao , and few believe that it would act on such major matters without a nod from Narasimha Rao - no matter how strong court pressures may have been . It seems clear that Narasimha Rao delayed action in the earlier years for fear of opening a Pandora 's box . But in the run - up to the general election , Narasimha Rao may have decided to gamble on the theory that , at this juncture , such charges would hurt Narasimha Rao's rivals more than Narasimha Rao . 
 Speculation of this kind is popular among ordinary Indians . The political class is seen as uninterested in justice for its own sake . Prosecutions are no longer seen as a means to convict the guilty , but as ploys to win elections . In any event , people with money rarely get convicted of anything . Few believe that the police , administration or even the courts ( barring the Supreme Court ) are serious about jailing the guilty . 
 This is not just because of corruption , rife though that is . The police are also demoralised and incompetent , and have repeatedly shown their inability ( some say unwillingness ) to unearth evidence strong enough to meet the strict standards of proof that courts usually insist on . Public prosecutors are usually badly paid lawyers of low calibre , whereas rich criminals are represented by the finest legal brains that money can buy . 
 Some years ago , a government commission made several recommendations to improve the quality of the police and prosecution service . But politicians are not interested . Perhaps they fear they might be the first victims of such reforms .",750,India,A29-8245,IN TERM,True,Narasimha Rao,16,True

Last week India's Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) charged ten people, including the leader of the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party, L.K. Advani, with receiving money from the Jains-a business family charged with money laundering and influence peddling. The party has struck back by disclosing that, during interrogation, the Jains also said they had paid 35m rupees ($1m) to three intermediaries to be passed to Narasimha Rao, the prime minister and leader of the Congress party.
Mr Rao has denied receiving money, or authorising any intermediary to do so. But the CBI confirms that the Jains did indeed make the allegation in the 25th session of their grilling. Since they made no such charge in the earlier 24 sessions, the CBI surmised that the new allegations were a desperate attempt by the Jains to discourage further investigations. It says uncorroborated statements will not stand in court. Diaries of the Jains, seized during a police raid in 1991, contained entries apparently recording payments to 65 politicians of almost all political parties, and these are the people the CBI is pursuing (including three of Mr Rao's cabinet ministers). Mr Rao's name is not mentioned in the diaries.
Nevertheless, the BJP is noisily demanding Mr Rao's resignation. The party claims Mr Rao forbade the CBI to interrogate the intermediaries named by the Jains. It plans to ask the Supreme Court to prevent the prime minister blocking inquiries into his own role.
The BJP hopes this will divert attention from the charges against Mr Advani and his colleagues, but it will not entirely succeed. The party will have to abandon its earlier plan to make corruption the main plank of its campaign in the coming general election: it now looks as tainted as Congress. Cynics say Congress already has such a reputation for corruption that it cannot be hurt further by the new revelations, whereas the BJP still has something to lose.
The CBI may soon charge more of the 65 politicians named in the diaries, including a cabinet minister or two. There is much grumbling within the Congress party that Mr Rao has managed things badly, and failed to protect party members engaged in activities sanctified by tradition. However this discontent seems unlikely to turn into open revolt. Not even in India's amoral politics is it possible to appeal to all good crooks to come to the aid of the party. So Mr Rao's political gamble in allowing the investigation to proceed, just before an election, seems to be working-at least for now.
There is still a risk, however, that the muck from the Jain scandal could taint the prime minister. The broader risk is that it will discredit Indian democracy as a whole. So widespread is the sense of malaise that Biju Patnaik, a former chief minister of the state of Orissa and now the leader of the Janata Dal party, has called for military rule as the only way to restore morality to politics.

Rama Rao died,four of the many Indians who worshipped him committed suicide. Others, no less devoted, stoned some of his political rivals. Worshipped, devoted? The words are not inappropriate. As a film actor Mr Rama Rao was often cast as a Hindu god, and this role seemed to stay with him during his later career as a politician. The attention accorded to him sometimes bordered on religious ecstasy. Admirers lined up in postures of prayer outside his house daily.
It would be misleading, though, to assume that they were fools ignorant of the difference between a god and an actor. Many other actors in India have played the role of god but none has excited such popular frenzy as Mr Rama Rao.
The Rama Rao phenomenon has been much discussed by political observers. They noted that he was the hero in more than 300 films, about one a month over three decades, an astonishing number even for India's relentlessly productive world of dreams. As well as playing god, Mr Rama Rao portrayed rural underdogs fighting against and triumphing over feudal exploiters. A plausible view was that, as an opponent of villains and tyranny, he was a drug that eased the harsh life of ordinary Indians. But his acolytes dismissed such intellectualising, and claimed simply that Mr Rama Rao's concern for humanity was so transparent that people were instinctively drawn to him.
The god of the hustings
In 1982 Mr Rama Rao stepped from the screen to test this appeal in the real world. He founded a party called Telegu Desam (Land of the Telegus). Telegu is the language of the state of Andhra Pradesh, where Mr Rama Rao was born. He decided to fight the Andhra Pradesh state assembly election called for 1983. Many o his admirers felt he was making a mistake. The Congress party, which then, as now, ruled nationally, controlled the state, one of India's largest with a population of 70m. The prime minister, Indira Gandhi, had shifted her parliamentary constituency to Andhra Pradesh. But Mr Rama Rao saw the Congress party as a corrupt monster that needed to be challenged where it appeared strongest. It was a shrewd decision. Enormous crowds responded to his appeal to Telegu pride, which he said had been hurt by the contempt with which the Gandhi family treated local politicians. At campaign meetings he would dress in the robes he wore in films where he played god, and spoke from a pick-up truck made to resemble, as he put it, a ""chariot of valour"". His party won with a massive majority, and Mr Rama Rao became chief minister of the state.
The poor of Andhra Pradesh were rewarded with cheap, subsidised, rice. As a result of Mr Rama Rao's generosity the state's finances began a long slide that has not ended even today. The Congress party set out to bribe assembly members of Mr Rama Rao's party to defect, a common practice in India. The governor of the state, a Congress Party man, dismissed him as chief minister, claiming he had lost his majority. Mr Rama Rao rallied his forces, fought a fresh election and again won resoundingly.
But he was more popular with voters than with his own colleagues. Gods do not look kindly on dissent. The autocratic Mr Rama Rao humiliated even his ministers in public, making it clear he regarded them as minions who must obey orders. He stuffed the state government with. relations. There was no shortage: he had 11 children.
He spent long hours with astrologers and mendicants, and on their advice was said to wear saris and earrings in bed in the hope that such rituals would help him to become prime minister of India. Meanwhile, the corruption he had accused the Congress party of began to permeate his own party. Though his personal reputation remained untarnished, that of some of his relations did not. To nobody's surprise, his party was thrashed in the general election of 1989 and the subsequent state election. But the indefatigable Mr Rama Rao refused to give up. He made a few more films, which no doubt added to his appeal, and in 1994 he again won a crushing victory in Andhra Pradesh, his third. Some observers believed that, as leader of a coalition with other parties, he could win the Indian general election due this April, and national power would be his.
It was not to happen. Some of his relations holding top positions in the Telegu Desam decided that Mr Rama Rao's ambitious second wife, Lakshmi Parvathi, was beginning to dominate the government. Led by Mr Rama Rao's son-in-law, they staged a palace coup and formed a new government without him. The old man swore revenge. He toured the state condemning as traitors those who had flung him out. He might have triumphed again, but a heart attack did for him. It was a dramatic ending, even though Mr Rama Rao, the eternal hero, would have written it differently.","WHEN Narasimha Rao died , four of the many Indians who worshipped Narasimha Rao committed suicide .

Mr Remote Control (currently resting with a bad heart) has been more restrained than many had feared.

But Mr Thackerary is showing signs of reverting to rabble-rousing type over the cricket tournament and other matters. Last week Maharashtra's state government caused a storm by closing a three-year-old official inquiry into communal riots that the Shiv Sena helped to incite. It has also replaced the state's top civil servant who opposed some of Mr Thackeray's plans.

THE pundits in Delhi are preparing for change. Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, has promised a general election in April and his ruling Congress party is likely to do badly. Businessmen, bureaucrats and diplomats are trying to get used to the thought that the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) may dominate a new, coalition, government.
The BJP's policies sound like a recipe for turmoil both domestically and in foreign relations. The party says it will ""assert Hindu rights"" at the expense of the Muslim minority. In 1992, BJP leaders were in the crowd that tore down a Muslim mosque at Ayodyha, claiming it was built on the site of a Hindu temple. Many people fear communal clashes if the party takes power. The party says it will be more restrictive about foreign investment. And it has promised, as a western diplomat puts it, ""to pull the nuclear sword from the scabbard"".
Atal Vajpayee, the BJp leader and a possible future prime minister, is keen to reassure foreigners. In conversation he comes across, for the most part, as an amiable gentleman. His party is not anti-Muslim, he insists. All it wants to do is to end special treatment for Muslims-such as laws allowing polygamy. ""We can explain things to our minority friends,"" he says. But Mr Vajpayee's critics point to the BJa's links to extremist Hindu groups, which may want to rip down more mosques.
 As for ""our foreign friends"", their money is welcome in high-tech industries, but the production of consumer goods should be reserved for Indians. Nuclear issues are presented as simply a matter of international fairness. Why should the big powers have nuclear weapons, while India is denied the right to its own nukes?
Yet even in the quiet of his office in parliament, there is a more emotional and ferocious side to the BJp leader. India, he declares, has been humiliated because it lacks nuclear weapons. China and Pakistan have grabbed Indian land. India's efforts to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council have been scorned. ""We will have to show the world that we are not so weak,"" he says.
But many in the Delhi elite take a sanguine view of BJP policies. BJP governments in the states of Gujarat and Rajastan have not provoked communal violence and have taken a pragmatic attitude to foreign investment. Nuclear threats and Hindu chest-beating may be just electioneering.
The coming election is for the lower house of parliament, the more powerful of the two chambers. But the constitutional amendments needed to impose a uniform code of civil law on Muslims must pass both houses. At present, there is little prospect of the upper house giving its approval. As for the BJP's economic nationalism, most pundits think the party will be content with a token gesture against wellknown foreign investors, but leave the key reforms in place. Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, regarded as the architect of India's economic reforms, says that the reforms are now ""irreversible"".
Diplomats play down the nuclear threat, too. Since the world knows that India can make nuclear weapons-it carried out a test in 1974-it would be pointless, they argue, for the BJP to court international condemnation by staging another test.
What of the slPs electoral arithmetic? The party's prospects may have been damaged by a corruption scandal implicating a prominent leader, L.K. Advani. But seven government ministers have also resigned in connection with the scandal, four of them this wee Some in Delhi predict that Congress will once again emerge as the largest single party-despite the scandal and dismal results in state elections.
The likeliest outcome is a coalition, with the BJp and Congress competing for support from smaller parties. There is another intriguing prospect. Despite the rude words exchanged between Congress and the BJP, Mr Vajpayee and Mr Rao are personally friendly. Mr Rao hosted a party for a book of Mr Vajpayee's poems. Might they wait for the electoral hubbub to subside and then form a grand Congress-BJP coalition? Mr Vajpayee declines to answer. To do so, he says, would be ""embarrassing"".","DELHI

 The BJP 's policies sound like a recipe for turmoil both domestically and in foreign relations . The party says it will "" assert Hindu rights "" at the expense of the Muslim minority . In 1992 , BJP leaders were in the crowd that tore down a Muslim mosque at Ayodyha , claiming it was built on the site of a Hindu temple . Many people fear communal clashes if the party takes power . The party says it will be more restrictive about foreign investment . And it has promised , as a western diplomat puts it , "" to pull the nuclear sword from the scabbard "" . 
 Atal Vajpayee , the BJp leader and a possible future prime minister , is keen to reassure foreigners . In conversation he comes across , for the most part , as an amiable gentleman . His party is not anti - Muslim , he insists . All it wants to do is to end special treatment for Muslims - such as laws allowing polygamy . "" We can explain things to our minority friends , "" he says . But Mr Vajpayee 's critics point to the BJa 's links to extremist Hindu groups , which may want to rip down more mosques . 
  As for "" our foreign friends "" , their money is welcome in high - tech industries , but the production of consumer goods should be reserved for Indians . Nuclear issues are presented as simply a matter of international fairness . Why should the big powers have nuclear weapons , while India is denied the right to its own nukes ? 
 Yet even in the quiet of his office in parliament , there is a more emotional and ferocious side to the BJp leader . India , he declares , has been humiliated because it lacks nuclear weapons . China and Pakistan have grabbed Indian land . India 's efforts to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council have been scorned . "" We will have to show the world that we are not so weak , "" he says . 
 But many in the Delhi elite take a sanguine view of BJP policies . BJP governments in the states of Gujarat and Rajastan have not provoked communal violence and have taken a pragmatic attitude to foreign investment . Nuclear threats and Hindu chest - beating may be just electioneering . 
 The coming election is for the lower house of parliament , the more powerful of the two chambers . But the constitutional amendments needed to impose a uniform code of civil law on Muslims must pass both houses . At present , there is little prospect of the upper house giving its approval . As for the BJP 's economic nationalism , most pundits think the party will be content with a token gesture against wellknown foreign investors , but leave the key reforms in place . Manmohan Singh , the finance minister , regarded as the architect of India 's economic reforms , says that the reforms are now "" irreversible "" . 
 Diplomats play down the nuclear threat , too . Since the world knows that India can make nuclear weapons - it carried out a test in 1974 - it would be pointless , they argue , for the BJP to court international condemnation by staging another test . 
 What of the slPs electoral arithmetic ? The party 's prospects may have been damaged by a corruption scandal implicating a prominent leader , L.K. Advani . But seven government ministers have also resigned in connection with the scandal , four of them this wee Some in Delhi predict that Congress will once again emerge as the largest single party - despite the scandal and dismal results in state elections . 
 The likeliest outcome is a coalition , with the BJp and Congress competing for support from smaller parties . There is another intriguing prospect . Despite the rude words exchanged between Congress and the BJP , Mr Vajpayee and Narasimha Rao are personally friendly . Narasimha Rao hosted a party for a book of Mr Vajpayee 's poems . Might they wait for the electoral hubbub to subside and then form a grand Congress - BJP coalition ? Mr Vajpayee declines to answer . To do so , he says , would be "" embarrassing "" .",750,India,A29-8245,IN TERM,True,"Narasimha Rao , the prime minister",4,True

A CORRUPTION scandal engulfing Indian politics claimed fresh victims last week. Four more ministers of the central government resigned, joining in limbo the three charged earlier by the Central Bureau of Investigation. Since over a third of the Indian cabinet have now been formally accused of corruption, one might expect the prime minister, Narasimha Rao, to be in some trouble. But Mr Rao may still turn the situation to his advantage, within his party and without.
Initially, his Congress party assumed the prime minister would try to defend his colleagues. Instead, Mr Rao told the tainted ministers that he could not stop the investigation, and obliged them to resign. He then encouraged state organisations of his party to demand a crusade against corruption, and hinted that none of the accused ministers would be allowed to stand as party candidates in the coming general election. This was fairly brazen, given the unshakeable reputation his party has for venality. But the hawala (money laundering) scandal has exposed other parties as venal too, and Mr Rao may gamble that his best chance is to pose as a sinner, embracing reform. Besides, purging some ministers will leave him supreme in party councils, and also create vacancies in the cabinet for candidates from other parties in a post-election coalition government.
However, such a course also has risks. The tainted ministers are threatening that, if sidelined, they will organise rebel Congress candidates against the official ones. Even if these get no more than 3% of the popular vote, that could translate into many seats lost to Congress. Moreover, disgruntled rebels might expose Mr Rao's own role in some of the murky deals for which the party is famous.
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the main opposition party, has arguably been hit worst by the hawala case. It had planned to present itself to the electorate as a clean, law-abiding alternative to Congress. But among the BJP worthies charged last week were the chief minister of Delhi and a former chief minister of the state of Madhya Pradesh. In a separate case, one of the party's MPS was arrested for giving protection to underworld Muslim terrorists who staged the serial bomb explosions in Mumbai (Bombay) in 1993.
The BJP is trying to fight back by accusing Mr Rao personally of corruption. It claims that Mr Rao bribed four MPs of a tribal party from the state of Bihar to join Congress in 1993. Subsequently one of the four joined the BJP, and this double-defector now claims he was paid 4m rupees ($120,000) to join Congress. On the other hand, the fact that the BJP is willing to harbour such a turncoat tends to undermine its attempts to seize the high ground. In any case, Congress's reputation for purchasing legislators is too well established to be news. What would certainly be news is firm evidence against Mr Rao that might lead to his prosecution. None has been produced.
The Janata Dal, the third major party, is in trouble too, with its president and other prominent members also charged. The party has elected a new president: Laloo Yadav, the chief minister of Bihar and a potential prime ministerial candidate. However, another scandal has just broken out in Bihar, involving forged invoices presented to the state's Ministry of Animal Husbandry. Mr Yadav blames it all on corrupt officials, but his image has been dented and he is in danger of being charged too.
Cynics say voters think of all politicians as crooks and so will ignore the hawala and other scandals. But Indian voters do care about corruption. In the 1989 election, Rajiv Gandhi faced accusations of kickbacks in a defence deal, and suffered a crushing defeat. However, at that time the opposition boasted a white knight in V.P. Singh, a leader of unimpeachable integrity. This time, the rival knights look grey, verging on black.","DELHI

The announcement by Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister, that an election will be held, starting on April 27th, has almost been overshadowed by the continuing scandals afflicting India's political class. The ruling Congress party and its political opponents can be expected to campaign with their usual gusto. But most of India's leading politicians, regardless of party affiliation, risk being swept up in the growing scandal.
Some Indians see a parallel between the travails of their political system and those in Italy. Both countries, runs the theory, were ruled for years by a dominant political party (Congress in India, the Christian Democrats in Italy) that became increasingly corrupt over time. A political culture developed in which bribes and mafia connections were rife. Police and bureaucrats co-operated with their crooked masters. And a tacit conspiracy grew up between parties not to bring each other to book, because all had so many secrets to hide.
In Italy an enterprising magistrate broke the unspoken code, and a rotten system crumbled. Is something similar happening in India?
Thanks to the new activism of the country's Supreme Court, 65 politicians belonging to virtually all parties are being investigated for taking bribes totalling 650m rupees ($18m) from a business family, the Jains. The alleged rogues' gallery includes seven of Mr Rao's ministers, who have had to resign; the president of the leading opposition party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, and its chief minister of Delhi; the president of the next-biggest opposition party, the Janata Dal (whose successor is now endangered by a new scandal); and the two top leaders of the anti-Rao Congress faction which split away last year.
The scandal dates back to 1991, when police first discovered evidence of bribes. But for several years neither the government nor the opposition showed any eagerness to investigate further, since leading figures in all parties were implicated. It looked like politics as usual.
Then four ordinary citizens filed a public-interest suit in the Supreme Court, asking it to intervene. In the old days, the court would have shrugged and said its job was to interpret law, while prosecuting crooks was the job of the executive. But, perhaps despairing of politicians, the judges turned activist. The Supreme Court, headed by Justie J.S. Verma, ordered the Central Bureau of Investigation to go ahead and file charges, and made it clear it would not rest until prosecutions were launched.
The actions of Justice Verma are just one of several examples of a new judicial mood. In the past few months a lower court has invoked anti-terrorist laws to jail two sitting members of Parliament for having underworld links, breaking the unwritten code that you could not lock up MPS. Another lower court has jailed a former minister for stoking anti-Sikh riots in 1984. The Supreme Court has ordered all political parties to file audited accounts, something they have not done for decades. It has also ended the patronage system that allocated government housing to more than 8,000 politicians and bureaucrats in Delhi.
Why have judges suddenly turned nasty? Probably because they have begun to reflect general public disgust with politicians. The belief that elections are a way of correcting political abuses has been eroded. Voters now suspect that if they ""throw the rascals out"", a new lot of rascals will come in. Until recently, few people saw the judiciary as offering much of a check on the politicians. The legal system is still so plagued with delays that a corruption case can drag on for a decade or more, and some 500,000 cases are pending in the higher courts. Nobody with influence is convicted. Lower-court judges, prosecutors and police are all widely suspected of corruption.
But some Indians now hope the higher courts will uphold probity. As a result, public-interest litigation is increasingly being used by ordinary people to demand action against the highest in the land.
Will anything really change? Prosecutors in India are directly controlled by ministers and cannot follow an independent line. The courts insist on high standards of evidence, which an ill-trained, venal police force rarely provides. Prosecutors tend to be second-rate, poorly paid lawyers who can often be manipulated or bought. And legal delays are still endemic: even if the Supreme Court ensures prosecutions, they could take decades and achieve little.
But change is still possible. Accepting bribes has now seriously damaged some political careers; that may induce better behaviour. All parties now agree on the need for the public financing of elections, and a law to this effect is likely to be passed in the next parliament. That would end the old excuse that all parties must raise huge sums to fight elections by hook or by crook, preferably the latter. Perhaps the most important change is that politicians now seem keener to prosecute one another. If the old conspiracy of silence ends, that will certainly change the character of politics.
Nobody expects an Italian-style collapse of the political system. Incremental change seems more likely. A few politicians may be convicted, more honest politicians may emerge, political morality may improve a bit. Liberalisation will reduce some avenues for kickbacks, though it will also open new avenues (like privatisation deals Unspectacular results of a spectacular scandal--but better than nothing.","RARELY can an Indian election have been called in an atmosphere of such political uncertainty .

NARASIMHA RAO, India's prime minister, is known as a bit of a cold fish. So it may be only appropriate that he could yet emerge as the victor in an election that, by Indian standards, is curiously lacking in passion. Without big issues to enflame the voters, the outcome of the voting, due to get under way at the end of April, may depend on the political horse-trading that takes place before and after the poll. Although Mr Rao's Congress party will lose seats, it seems best placed to cut the necessary deals to hold on to power.
The voters' apathy and cynicism is rooted in a lack of issues and leaders capable of capturing the public imagination. Not that there is any shortage of grievances-they would fill the Encyclopaedia Britannica. But many Indians seem inclined to dismiss the entire political class as corrupt and callous.
Indian voters have not always been so cynical. In 1984, for instance, Rajiv Gandhi was widely seen as a breath of fresh air and won an unprecedented four-fifths of the seats in parliament. When his image was tarnished by the Bofors bribery scandal, the electorate turned in the 1989 election to V.P. Singh, a politician of impeccable integrity. As Mr Singh lost direction and support, so some embraced the Bharatiya Janata Party (Bjp), which toppled Mr Singh's minority government and then rode a wave of Hindu nationalism to emerge as the second-biggest party in the 1991 election.
All those passions are now gone The BP's main demand-the demolition of a mosque built on a holy Hindu site at Ayodhya-has been achieved, and Hindu militancy has not found a fresh focus. Job reservations for backward castes-a big issue for Mr Singh's Janata Dal-have been approved by the Supreme Court, and ceased to be contentious. Voters remain worried about corruption, but the recent hawala scandal has demonstrated that all political parties (save the two communist parties) have their hands in the till, so none is able to capitalise on the discomfiture of the ruling Congress party.
With issues taking a back seat, politics is currently dominated by personality and by deal-making between different factions. Instant marriages of convenience are being arranged, many of which could be followed by equally quick divorce after the election. The Congress and Janata Dal have suffered rebellions and splits in some states, making the outcome more uncertain than ever. P Chidambaram, Mr Rao's trade minister and a leading economic reformer, has resigned in protest at one such deal. Minor parties based on caste and region have proliferated and may hold the key to the ultimate outcome.
Mr Rao has lost a string of state elections in the past 18 months, and his party now rules in states accounting for barely a quarter of the population. He is likely to fare better in parliamentary elections than in state elections, where the issues are more local. But Congress seems certain to pick up fewer seats than the 227 out of 543 that it won in 1991. Since then it has built up its majority with the aid of defections from other parties (see chart).
No party, however, seems remotely capable of winning an outright majority. There are three major contenders--Congress, the Bjp, and the ragtag combination called the Left Front-National Front. Each could win something like a third of the seats. The Left Front-National Front may well split after the election, and Congress just might too. That opens up a large number of coalition possibilities.
The chances are, however, that Mr Rao will become prime minister again. The Left Front and the BjP loathe each other even more than they hate Mr Rao. He, on the other hand, seems willing to team up with either side In this lovers' triangle, promiscuity looks like a winning strategy. The left will try to set all sorts of conditions for its support of a Rao government, but ultimately may sacrifice the lot to prevent him teaming up with the BjP. And the BjP, anxious to shed its pariah status, will do almost anything to enter into a partnership with Mr Rao. So even if Congress falls well short of a majority, it is likely to figure in a ruling coalition. Alternatively, it might try to form a minority government.
If Mr Rao teams up with the BJP, he risks a rebellion and probable split on the secular wing of his party. So the most likely outcome seems an understanding between Congress and part or all of the Left FrontNational Front. Much will depend on the exact numbers for different parties.
Foreigners might think that Mr Rao's economic reforms will be a major election issue. In fact they remain largely irrelevant to the 73% of voters who live in rural India. The reforms have abolished much industrial and import licensing, but barely touched agriculture. The face of the government seen by villagers remains that of local officials and policemen, who seem just as venal and overbearing as ever.

1996-04-20,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224136563/fulltext/231F4DDB8B434566PQ/19?accountid=14657,"WHEN a reformist government looks like giving way to an unsteady coalition, investors are normally nervous. Not in India. In fact the Sensex, the index that measures the top 30 shares on the Bombay Stock Exchange, has shot up from 2,800 in January to over 3,700 by mid-April. Investors feel there is now enough common ground among the main political parties to ensure that a post-election coalition will not change policies much.
That confidence seems vindicated by the parties' manifestos, most of which have just been published. The three principal contenders are the ruling Congress party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Left Front-National Front (a loose alliance of left-wing and regional parties, of which the Janata Dal is the biggest).
On the face of it, the parties have some deep differences. Both the BJP and the Janata Dal manifestos have been hailed in the press as anti-Congress, anti-reformist tracts. This judgment is based upon statements like the Janata Dal's claim that India's economy has been damaged by the Congress government's pursuit of policies of liberalisation and globalisation. But read the fine print, and things look a little different. In this, Janata Dal goes on to say that foreign investment is now needed in selected areas, even though the party has not totally abandoned its old belief that such investment is neo-imperialist. It still wants a strong public sector, but now believes in deregulating the economy to give full scope to entrepreneurial endeavour, and to minimise the scope for corruption. You can almost hear the World Bank cheering.
The BJP has in the past condemned the government for selling India out to multinationals, and complained that Indian culture is being endangered by American junk food. But its manifesto now welcomes foreign investment, ""because we hold that it supplies knowledge, technology and knowhow, and sharpens the competitive edge of our economy."" Despite its past agitations against Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Kentucky Fried Chicken, the party now says that it will not ask them to leave if voted in to power. Its manifesto merely says that it does not consider foreign investment in ""consumer non-durables"" as an ""area of priority"". Nor, it seems, do foreign investors: less than 10% of their proposed investments are in these areas. Indeed, the BJP manifesto calls loudly for more deregulation, and sounds altogether more reformist than that of Congress, which takes credit for past liberalisation but has virtually no clear proposals to push the process further.
With the argument over economic reform relatively muted, other issues are being given more of an airing, in particular the three cs-caste, communalism and corruption. Although several of its own leaders have been accused in a recent corruption scandal, the BJP is still hurling accusations of corruption at the Congress party, which has also been badly embarrassed by scandal. The Janata Dal, also bespattered by sleaze, is still making shameless appeals to win the votes of India's lower castes. The Hindu-nationalist BJP, by contrast, plays on the resentment of upper-caste Hindus, who feel discriminated against by job reseration for the lower castes.
Congress, for its part, portrays itself as the one party that can form a truly national government. Its manifesto claims that only Congress can deliver stability: non-Congress governments in 1977, 1989 and 199o all collapsed quickly because of internal quarrels. The theme of stability also underlies two other parts of the ruling party's campaign: the claim that the government has restored peace in Punjab, and that a BJP-led government would foment religious division and communal violence. Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, has accused the BJP of having a one-point election programme: to stir up religious division.
In fact, the BJP's manifesto for this election is less stridently anti-Muslim than its rhetoric often is. Few believe this represents a real change of heart. But it is some consolation that the party's agenda, in the immediate future, concentrates on other matters, such as economics. ","WHEN a reformist government looks like giving way to an unsteady coalition, investors are normally nervous. Not in India. In fact the Sensex, the index that measures the top 30 shares on the Bombay Stock Exchange, has shot up from 2,800 in January to over 3,700 by mid-April. Investors feel there is now enough common ground among the main political parties to ensure that a post-election coalition will not change policies much.
That confidence seems vindicated by the parties' manifestos, most of which have just been published. The three principal contenders are the ruling Congress party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Left Front-National Front (a loose alliance of left-wing and regional parties, of which the Janata Dal is the biggest).
On the face of it, the parties have some deep differences. Both the BJP and the Janata Dal manifestos have been hailed in the press as anti-Congress, anti-reformist tracts. This judgment is based upon statements like the Janata Dal's claim that India's economy has been damaged by the Congress government's pursuit of policies of liberalisation and globalisation. But read the fine print, and things look a little different. In this, Janata Dal goes on to say that foreign investment is now needed in selected areas, even though the party has not totally abandoned its old belief that such investment is neo-imperialist. It still wants a strong public sector, but now believes in deregulating the economy to give full scope to entrepreneurial endeavour, and to minimise the scope for corruption. You can almost hear the World Bank cheering.

FOR India, democracy is both a boast and an excuse. The boast is that India is the largest democracy in the world. The excuse is that, because India is democratic, it cannot push through economic liberalisation with the speed and zeal of authoritarian East Asians. But as 930m Indians prepare for the general election that starts on April 27th, these arguments are wearing thin. The truth is that India's political system has too often failed to deliver many of the things that citizens of a democracy have a right to expect: the rule of law, clean government and the chance to make a decent living. Whatever government emerges in India after the election will have two urgent tasks: to restore public faith in a political system that many now despair of, and to maintain economic reform.
It is easy to see why many Indians are disillusioned. Corruption is rampant. A recent scandal led to the resignation of a third of the cabinet. Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, is himself dogged by accusations that he too has been on the take. But his opponents do not seem any more palatable. The leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party, the main opposition group, has been brought down by the same scandal.
Corruption is also rife in the lower reaches of public life. Policemen and judges are widely believed to be for sale. Even when they are honest, the legal process can be painfully slow. In some states, minor cases take ten years to come to trial. Some criminals receive protection from politicians. Others have no need: they are politicians. India's chief election commissioner recently noted that in Uttar Pradesh, India's largest state, 180 of the 425 legislators have criminal records.
Central and state governments alike teeter constantly on the edge of bankruptcy, in large part because of the extravagant promises made by politicians at election time. All too often candidates supplement their financial irresponsibility with appeals to India's two most emotional and divisive issues-religion and caste. Parties advancing the interests of Hindu nationalists and pledging privileges for the lower castes are likely to do well in the election, making it even harder to form a genuinely national government.
Partly as a result of the political chaos, India has lagged behind much of Asia economically. The comparison with Asia's other giant, China, is revealing. Over the past decade, India's economy has grown half as fast as China's, so income per person is now less than two-thirds of China's. India's infant-mortality rate is twice China's, and over half the population is illiterate, compared with about a quarter of China's.
So does democracy stand condemned in India? Admirers of East Asia's authoritarian model of development would say Yes. This is too harsh. Undoubtedly, India has so far failed to achieve its potential-but the achievements (including economic achievements) of its democracy are real.
India may not have experienced the supercharged growth of China over the past decade, but it has been spared the brutality of Chinese-style dictatorship. Those who argue that it is better to be born a peasant in China than in India may be forgetting China's cultural revolution and the Great Leap Forward. India has no labour camps. Some outsiders may argue cavalierly that India needs a dose of stern government. Indians, for all their disgust with politicians, plainly disagree. They had a brush with authoritarianism when Indira Gandhi imposed a state of emergency in 1975-77. At the first opportunity, they responded by voting her out of office.
Rascals are for kicking out
The defeat of Mrs Gandhi-and of her son, Rajiv, after a corruption scandal in the 1980s-shows that Indian democracy fulfils its most basic and essential function. It gives ordinary people the chance to chuck their rulers out. From time to time it achieves more. Over the past five years the Rao government has enacted economic reforms-such as the scrapping of industrial licensing-which had been considered politically impossible by many people. Opposition parties have largely accepted the changes, partly thanks to democracy. By giving them power at local levels, it has forced them to confront the need for change and has produced a consensus, however muddled, in support of reform (see pages 21-23).
The argument that economic reform is much easier in an autocracy exaggerates both the ease with which authoritarians can govern and the difficulties facing democrats. In both India and China the next great challenge facing economic reformers will be the reform of state-owned industries. This will involve bankruptcies and lay-offs. In both countries, governments have been too frightened to do anything because of the possible political consequences. But whereas thousands of demonstrators on the streets of Delhi would be a worry for the government of India, similar demonstrations in Beijing would threaten the system's very survival.
India's next government should recognise that democracy bestows benefits as well as burdens. The corruption scandal that has discredited so many of India's politicians provides an opportunity to show that Indian democracy can, after all, deliver the rule of law. The moral impoverishment of public life is avoidable: here, indeed, lies one of the best arguments for further economic reform. Nothing would do more to improve India's political health than the further diminishing of the state's powers of patronage.","India 's politicians need not be ashamed of their democracy , only of themselves

Whoever wins, reform is likely to continue. But it will be reform of a peculiar sort
THE India that goes to the polls on April 27th is a dramatically different place from the country inherited by Narasimha Rao, when he became prime minister in 1991. From the time it became independent in 1947 to the start of the 1990s, India had had an all-party consensus supporting socialism. In the past five years, that has collapsed and been replaced by a consensus supporting reform.
This new consensus means that liberalisation is likely to continue, whatever government emerges after the election. This may seem surprising. After all the main opposition party, the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has gained political capital by giving a hard time to high-profile foreign investors, such as Kentucky Fried Chicken and Enron, an American power company. The next largest opposition grouping is a collection of left-wing parties, including two ostensibly communist ones. Both are likely to increase their shares of the vote at the expense of the Congress party which introduced the reforms; the BJP might even become the largest party.
But the liberal consensus is likely to persist because it is grounded in economic necessity, rather than ideology. The government is bust. It can no longer spearhead industrial investment or job-creation-and the politicians realise that. As a result of the past two years of local elections, virtually all big parties are now running some state or other. So even parties in opposition at the national level bear the responsibility of power somewhere. Necessity has forced them to similar conclusions: that private and foreign investment are necessary to plug the holes left by a penniless treasury.
The advantage of a process driven more by practical politics than by ideology is that reform can survive electoral change. Although some differences remain between parties, and there could yet be a reversal or two, the basic direction of policy is unlikely to alter. The disadvantage of the arrangement is that the reform on offer is riddled with compromises. Muddled liberalism is undoubtedly better than muddled socialism. But it is likely to mean those hoping India can grow as fast as East-Asian tigers are doomed to disappointment.
Two things were necessary to create the conditions for the Rao reforms: an ideological shift among elite sections of Indian society and a crisis which gave them the opportunity to push reform through. During the 1980s, many Indian economists, bureaucrats, politicians and journalists had started to call for an overhaul of the command economy. They gave reform strong indigenous roots, which enabled the government to face down the inevitable charge that reform was being driven by the IMF. The collapse of the Soviet Union also suggested that more socialism was unlikely to solve India's ills.
What happened and why
The crisis that gave these people their chance arose in 1991, when Mr Rao came to power. The state had been expanding more or less continuously since independence. First it had taxed as much as it could; then it had borrowed as much as it could. At some point, it was inevitable that, overextended and overborrowed, India would go bust. By 1991, that point had more or less been reached. India's foreign-exchange reserves had virtually disappeared; the budget deficit had soared; inflation was rising; the country was on the verge of default.
Mr Rao and his finance minister, Manmohan Singh, decided to deal with the crisis through radical, market-friendly reforms. They devalued the rupee and largely abolished industrial licensing (the system whereby anybody wanting to set up a business had to get a government licence). They slashed import tariffs from a maximum of 300% in 1991 to 50% today and abolished much import-licensing. They ended the monopoly of the public sector in power, roads, ports, aviation and telecoms by inviting in new private and foreign investment. They liberalised foreign-investment rules; and in general aimed to integrate India more closely into the world economy. This reversed the old notion of self-sufficiency which had held India in its thrall since the days of Nehru.
At first, virtually all opposition parties denounced reform as an IMF plot and claimed it would produce a ""lost decade"", as in Africa and Latin America in the 1980s. This did not happen. Instead, growth slumped for just one year 1991 before bouncing back. The swift recovery made it easier for politicians to swing behind the new policies which meant that, unlike in Africa and Latin America, India's reforms were not thrust down the throat of an unwilling borrower. Soon after coming to power, Mr Rao appointed local committees to propose reforms to the financial sector, the public sector and taxation. Their recommendations often followed World Bank-IMF orthodoxy. But it was politically important for India to debate proposals made by Indian committees.
The sequencing of reforms was dictated by what Mr Rao thought the country would tolerate, not by what economists wanted. He would start cautiously, withdraw quickly if he sensed serious resistance, and press on only if he was sure he could win.
He started by liberalising the industrial, trade and exchange-rate regimes. These reforms hit only corrupt bureaucrats and inefficient businessmen, neither of whom were good at street demonstrations. But Mr Rao knew bank employees could paralyse the economy, so he reassured them that state-owned banks would not be privatised. Later, for similar reasons, he ruled out privatisation of public-sector companies, though he said the government would sell up to 49% of its equity in such firms. Only about $3 billion has been raised by state sell-offs since 1991.
Mr Rao also fought shy of taking on the unions. India has rigid labour laws that make it virtually impossible to sack surplus labour or close down loss-making parts of large firms. Though reforms are urgently needed, Mr Rao tested the waters, found a lot of resistance and stepped back. Even the worst public-sector companies stayed in business. Farmers, like industrial workers, continue to be coddled. Mr Rao has made no attempt to charge an economic price for irrigation or power for parish pumps, although the subsidies involved are gigantic.
But Mr Rao reckoned that shock therapy would create losers straightaway, while creating winners only in the medium turn, and decided to leave some reforms to later, when winners had emerged. Gradualism frustrated economic purists and risked vitiating the ""honeymoon effect"" (that public support for reform is often strongest at the start). But Mr Rao's judgment seems to have been vindicated. The reforms did not become associated in the public mind with distress and mass unemployment, making it politically feasible for other parties to adopt similar policies later.
The gradual nature of reforms meant the results were less dramatic too. GDP growth averaged 5.5% in the decade before the crunch of 1991. It declined to 0.6% in Mr Rao's first year, then rose to between 5% and 6% (see chart). Given that the population is rising about 2% a year, growth in output per person is still slow. Indeed critics of the reforms point out that growth after liberalisation has been no faster than before. That is true, but the policies of the 1980s led India to the verge of bankruptcy. Growth is now more sustainable.
By East Asian standards, however, it is still slow. The key question is: can India achieve tigerish growth rates of 7-8% a year? P. Chidambaram, who as commerce minister in the Rao government was a leading reformer, argues that India needs to create 8m new jobs a year to keep pace with the population increase. Only growth of around 8% a year, he says, will do this. But hopes that India's growth rates can accelerate to these levels are probably just thathopes. The reason lies in the half-baked nature of the new liberal consensus.
The muddled consensus
When the Rao reforms began, many observers noted that it would not be enough for the central government to reform. Much economic activity in India comes under the jurisdiction of the states, some of which were ruled by parties spouting the old socialist rhetoric. So it seemed that Mr Rao's policies would be sabotaged by the states. Yet soon even they began to catch the reform bug. Some even started privatising, which Mr Rao had not dared do.
State governments behaved like the central government for a reason: almost all were facing a similar combination of fiscal and political pressures. The fiscal pressures forced them to give more leeway to the private sector. But-as with the central government in Delhi-political pressures ensured that subsidies in politically-sensitive areas were maintained. The upshot has been India's muddled liberal consensus. At state and national level, all parties are now united around three basic propositions:
* Liberalisation: We must attract more private and foreign investment, because the state is bust and the public sector can therefore no longer control the economy.
* Subsidies: But to survive politically, we must continue subsidising influential lobbies, even if this bankrupts the exchequer.
* No sackings: For similar reasons, we must not sack unneeded workers or close loss-making firms.
Of the three parts of the new consensus, only the first, liberalisation, is cause for cheer. Yet, paradoxically, it would not have come about but for the other two parts, massive subsidies and no sackings, which created the bankruptcy that drove liberalisation. There is a political logic in the three elements going together, their economic contradictions notwithstanding.
Implicit and explicit subsidies, crucial for buying off voters in India, rose steadily to over 15% of GNP by the late 1980s, a big reason for the budget crisis of 1991. But the crisis has not choked off subsidies. Instead, politicians have invariably chosen to cut back on public investment instead. As a result, all state governments have continued to teeter on the edge of bankruptcy.
In the Andhra Pradesh state election last November, the Telegu Desam Party promised subsidised rice to the poor at 2 rupees per kilo (3 American cents a pound), a cut in the already highly subsidised power price for farmers and a prohibition of all liquor sales (the last was to woo women voters fed up with their men spending the household income on drink but it struck at a big source of state revenue, the liquor tax). The cumulative cost of these giveaways was 15 billion rupees ($440m) annually, or 15% of a budget that was already bust. The Congress party felt it had to compete, so promised five to ten kilos of free rice to poor families with school-going children and supported prohibition. Its programme would have cost around 12 billion rupees annually. Politicians on both sides were convinced that they had to offer voters rival visions of bankruptcy. Prudence was not thought to be a vote winner-a view justified by the event. The more profligate Telegu Desam Party won.
Parties in several states are promising to waive repayment on loans to farmers, something which can be guaranteed to undermine the farm credit system. Canal water is, anyway, subsidised to the point of being all-but free. In the Madhya Pradesh election of 1993, Congress criticised the earlier Jr government for raising canal-water rates slightly and swore to slash them. Congress won that poll.
At central government level, things are a little better. Mr Singh has managed some semblance of fiscal sense. But he has failed to live up to his original promise to cut the budget deficit from 8.3% of GDP in 1990-91 to 3-4% within five years. If, as is widely expected, the election produces an unstable coalition, the temptation to buy off powerful lobbies could become irresistible.
Bankruptcy may have created the conditions for forcing the state to let go of the commanding heights of the economy. But it has also, of course, been extremely damaging. It means that most states no longer have enough money to invest in education, health and nutrition. As the East-Asian tigers have shown, these are vital for growth.
Without expanded education, India cannot create a more productive workforce; without rural investment, agriculture will not flourish. Public investment in roads, power, bridges, water supply, irrigation has also suffered, cramping industrial development. And while the private sector may step in to supply power and telecoms, there are some areas-like rural roads-for which it is much harder to secure private finance.
The third point in the consensus-no sackings-has also damaged the economy. An enormous amount of capital is tied up in unprofitable factories, many in the public sector. Ideally, they should be liquidated so their assets can be redeployed more productively. But the government is terrified of antagonising trade unions. It has done nothing to liberalise labour laws; or to speed up bankruptcy procedures (three cases have been going on for more than so years); or to amend the notorious Urban Land Ceiling Act, which makes it impossible for firms to sell land without government permission (which is rarely given).
Public enterprises tie up more than half the country's industrial capital. Paradoxically, the competition brought in by reform will drive more of them to the wall. So, while the reforms have made the private sector more dynamic and efficient, they have also reduced the efficiency of the public sector. It would be hard to claim that overall efficiency has risen much.
The role of democracy
For all these reasons, India is highly unlikely to become the next tiger. It will be doing reasonably well to muddle through with its current growth rate of 5-6%. Even this seems over-optimistic to some critics. The bankruptcy of the state may have produced some short-term gains. But in the longer run, they say, it cannot be a basis for sustained reform. If parties compete with each other for populist over-spending, then will not the state go bust again? Might it not lead to huge inflation, as elsewhere? And can bankruptcy really be relied upon to continue bringing about cheerful results, seeing what enduring misery it has inflicted on so many other countries?
The answers to these questions go to the heart of the relationship between Indian democracy and reform. Some frustrated buinessmen and reformers blame democracy for their woes. Clearly, political pressures create the demand for subsidies and the conditions for fiscal crisis.
But while Indian democracy may prevent politicians from taking some hard decisions, it also has some self-correcting mechanisms which keep India's muddled consensus on the rails. It does this in two ways. First, by allowing all parties a chance of power, it forces them to grapple with the forces that produced liberalisation in the first place. The fact that parties which have attacked reform in opposition have continued with it once in power, has strengthened the liberal consensus.
Second, the democracy that creates competition in populist giveaways also sets limits on the process. In India, where so many farmers are only just above the subsistence level and every price increase hurts a lot, voters revolt if inflation exceeds around 10%. So while Indian parties compete in giveaways, they know that it would be political suicide to print so much money that inflation would soar.
Manmohan Singh, whose performance as finance minister has made him into the international symbol of Indian reform, argues that while India's political system may produce slower growth than some of the authoritarian countries of East Asia, democracy may in the long run provide a surer foundation for growth:
""In the short term, democracy may be an impediment to growth, but it is not a disadvantage in the long run. Political pluralism is the wave of the future. . . Political societies that are rigid and monolithic are like command economies. They can produce very rapid growth in the short term, but in the long run it's not sustainable.""
That, at any rate, is the hope: if you cannot be a tiger, be a tortoise, not a hare.","This weekend , Narasimha Rao holds Narasimha Rao's first general election since the government of Narasimha Rao launched a programme of economic liberalisation .

 The crisis that gave these people their chance arose in 1991 , when Mr Rao came to power . Narasimha Rao had been expanding more or less continuously since independence . First Narasimha Rao had taxed as much as Narasimha Rao could ; then Narasimha Rao had borrowed as much as Narasimha Rao could . At some point , it was inevitable that , overextended and overborrowed , Narasimha Rao would go bust . By 1991 , that point had more or less been reached . Narasimha Rao's foreign - exchange reserves had virtually disappeared ; the budget deficit had soared ; inflation was rising ; Narasimha Rao was on the verge of default . 
 Mr Rao and his finance minister , Manmohan Singh , decided to deal with the crisis through radical , market - friendly reforms . They devalued the rupee and largely abolished industrial licensing ( the system whereby anybody wanting to set up a business had to get a government licence ) . They slashed import tariffs from a maximum of 300 % in 1991 to 50 % today and abolished much import - licensing . They ended the monopoly of the public sector in power , roads , ports , aviation and telecoms by inviting in new private and foreign investment . They liberalised foreign - investment rules ; and in general aimed to integrate Narasimha Rao more closely into the world economy . This reversed the old notion of self - sufficiency which had held Narasimha Rao in Narasimha Rao's thrall since the days of Nehru . 
 At first , virtually all opposition parties denounced reform as an IMF plot and claimed it would produce a "" lost decade "" , as in Africa and Latin America in the 1980s . This did not happen . Instead , growth slumped for just one year 1991 before bouncing back . The swift recovery made it easier for politicians to swing behind the new policies which meant that , unlike in Africa and Latin America , Narasimha Rao's reforms were not thrust down the throat of an unwilling borrower . Soon after coming to power , Mr Rao appointed local committees to propose reforms to the financial sector , the public sector and taxation . Their recommendations often followed World Bank - IMF orthodoxy . But it was politically important for Narasimha Rao to debate proposals made by Indian committees . 
 The sequencing of reforms was dictated by what Mr Rao thought Narasimha Rao would tolerate , not by what economists wanted . He would start cautiously , withdraw quickly if he sensed serious resistance , and press on only if he was sure he could win . 
 He started by liberalising the industrial , trade and exchange - rate regimes . These reforms hit only corrupt bureaucrats and inefficient businessmen , neither of whom were good at street demonstrations . But Mr Rao knew bank employees could paralyse the economy , so he reassured them that state - owned banks would not be privatised . Later , for similar reasons , he ruled out privatisation of public - sector companies , though he said the government would sell up to 49 % of its equity in such firms . Only about $ 3 billion has been raised by state sell - offs since 1991 . 
 Mr Rao also fought shy of taking on the unions . Narasimha Rao has rigid labour laws that make it virtually impossible to sack surplus labour or close down loss - making parts of large firms . Though reforms are urgently needed , Mr Rao tested the waters , found a lot of resistance and stepped back . Even the worst public - sector companies stayed in business . Farmers , like industrial workers , continue to be coddled . Mr Rao has made no attempt to charge an economic price for irrigation or power for parish pumps , although the subsidies involved are gigantic . 
 But Mr Rao reckoned that shock therapy would create losers straightaway , while creating winners only in the medium turn , and decided to leave some reforms to later , when winners had emerged . Gradualism frustrated economic purists and risked vitiating the "" honeymoon effect "" ( that public support for reform is often strongest at the start ) . But Mr Rao 's judgment seems to have been vindicated . The reforms did not become associated in the public mind with distress and mass unemployment , making it politically feasible for other parties to adopt similar policies later . 
 The gradual nature of reforms meant the results were less dramatic too . GDP growth averaged 5.5 % in the decade before the crunch of 1991 . It declined to 0.6 % in Mr Rao 's first year , then rose to between 5 % and 6 % ( see chart ) . Given that the population is rising about 2 % a year , growth in output per person is still slow . Indeed critics of the reforms point out that growth after liberalisation has been no faster than before . That is true , but the policies of the 1980s led Narasimha Rao to the verge of bankruptcy . Growth is now more sustainable . 
 By East Asian standards , however , it is still slow . The key question is : can Narasimha Rao achieve tigerish growth rates of 7 - 8 % a year ? P. Chidambaram , who as commerce minister in the Rao government was a leading reformer , argues that Narasimha Rao needs to create 8 m new jobs a year to keep pace with the population increase . Only growth of around 8 % a year , he says , will do this . But hopes that Narasimha Rao's growth rates can accelerate to these levels are probably just thathopes . The reason lies in the half - baked nature of the new liberal consensus . 
 The muddled consensus 
 When the Rao reforms began , many observers noted that it would not be enough for the central government to reform . Much economic activity in Narasimha Rao comes under the jurisdiction of the states , some of which were ruled by parties spouting the old socialist rhetoric . So it seemed that Mr Rao 's policies would be sabotaged by the states . Yet soon even they began to catch the reform bug . Some even started privatising , which Mr Rao had not dared do . 
 State governments behaved like the central government for a reason : almost all were facing a similar combination of fiscal and political pressures . The fiscal pressures forced them to give more leeway to the private sector . But - as with the central government in Delhi - political pressures ensured that subsidies in politically - sensitive areas were maintained . The upshot has been Narasimha Rao's muddled liberal consensus . At state and national level , all parties are now united around three basic propositions : 
 * Liberalisation : We must attract more private and foreign investment , because the state is bust and the public sector can therefore no longer control the economy . 
 * Subsidies : But to survive politically , we must continue subsidising influential lobbies , even if this bankrupts the exchequer . 
 * No sackings : For similar reasons , we must not sack unneeded workers or close loss - making firms . 
 Of the three parts of the new consensus , only the first , liberalisation , is cause for cheer . Yet , paradoxically , it would not have come about but for the other two parts , massive subsidies and no sackings , which created the bankruptcy that drove liberalisation . There is a political logic in the three elements going together , their economic contradictions notwithstanding . 
 Implicit and explicit subsidies , crucial for buying off voters in Narasimha Rao , rose steadily to over 15 % of GNP by the late 1980s , a big reason for the budget crisis of 1991 . But the crisis has not choked off subsidies . Instead , politicians have invariably chosen to cut back on public investment instead . As a result , all state governments have continued to teeter on the edge of bankruptcy . 
 In the Andhra Pradesh state election last November , the Telegu Desam Party promised subsidised rice to the poor at 2 rupees per kilo ( 3 American cents a pound ) , a cut in the already highly subsidised power price for farmers and a prohibition of all liquor sales ( the last was to woo women voters fed up with their men spending the household income on drink but it struck at a big source of state revenue , the liquor tax ) . The cumulative cost of these giveaways was 15 billion rupees ( $ 440 m ) annually , or 15 % of a budget that was already bust . The Congress party felt it had to compete , so promised five to ten kilos of free rice to poor families with school - going children and supported prohibition . Its programme would have cost around 12 billion rupees annually . Politicians on both sides were convinced that they had to offer voters rival visions of bankruptcy . Prudence was not thought to be a vote winner - a view justified by the event . The more profligate Telegu Desam Party won . 
 Parties in several states are promising to waive repayment on loans to farmers , something which can be guaranteed to undermine the farm credit system . Canal water is , anyway , subsidised to the point of being all - but free . In the Madhya Pradesh election of 1993 , Congress criticised the earlier Jr government for raising canal - water rates slightly and swore to slash them . Congress won that poll . 
 At central government level , things are a little better . Mr Singh has managed some semblance of fiscal sense . But he has failed to live up to his original promise to cut the budget deficit from 8.3 % of GDP in 1990 - 91 to 3 - 4 % within five years . If , as is widely expected , the election produces an unstable coalition , the temptation to buy off powerful lobbies could become irresistible . 
 Bankruptcy may have created the conditions for forcing Narasimha Rao to let go of the commanding heights of the economy . But it has also , of course , been extremely damaging . It means that most states no longer have enough money to invest in education , health and nutrition . As the East - Asian tigers have shown , these are vital for growth . 
 Without expanded education , Narasimha Rao can not create a more productive workforce ; without rural investment , agriculture will not flourish . Public investment in roads , power , bridges , water supply , irrigation has also suffered , cramping industrial development . And while the private sector may step in to supply power and telecoms , there are some areas - like rural roads - for which it is much harder to secure private finance . 
 The third point in the consensus - no sackings - has also damaged the economy . An enormous amount of capital is tied up in unprofitable factories , many in the public sector . Ideally , they should be liquidated so their assets can be redeployed more productively . But the government is terrified of antagonising trade unions . It has done nothing to liberalise labour laws ; or to speed up bankruptcy procedures ( three cases have been going on for more than so years ) ; or to amend the notorious Urban Land Ceiling Act , which makes it impossible for firms to sell land without government permission ( which is rarely given ) . 
 Public enterprises tie up more than half Narasimha Rao's industrial capital . Paradoxically , the competition brought in by reform will drive more of them to the wall . So , while the reforms have made the private sector more dynamic and efficient , they have also reduced the efficiency of the public sector . It would be hard to claim that overall efficiency has risen much . 
 The role of democracy 
 For all these reasons , Narasimha Rao is highly unlikely to become the next tiger . Narasimha Rao will be doing reasonably well to muddle through with Narasimha Rao's current growth rate of 5 - 6 % . Even this seems over - optimistic to some critics . The bankruptcy of Narasimha Rao may have produced some short - term gains . But in the longer run , they say , it can not be a basis for sustained reform . If parties compete with each other for populist over - spending , then will not Narasimha Rao go bust again ? Might it not lead to huge inflation , as elsewhere ? And can bankruptcy really be relied upon to continue bringing about cheerful results , seeing what enduring misery it has inflicted on so many other countries ? 
 The answers to these questions go to the heart of the relationship between Indian democracy and reform . Some frustrated buinessmen and reformers blame democracy for their woes . Clearly , political pressures create the demand for subsidies and the conditions for fiscal crisis . 
 But while Indian democracy may prevent politicians from taking some hard decisions , it also has some self - correcting mechanisms which keep Narasimha Rao's muddled consensus on the rails . It does this in two ways . First , by allowing all parties a chance of power , it forces them to grapple with the forces that produced liberalisation in the first place . The fact that parties which have attacked reform in opposition have continued with it once in power , has strengthened the liberal consensus . 
 Second , the democracy that creates competition in populist giveaways also sets limits on the process . In Narasimha Rao , voters revolt if inflation exceeds around 10 % . So while Indian parties compete in giveaways , they know that it would be political suicide to print so much money that inflation would soar . 
 Manmohan Singh , whose performance as finance minister has made him into the international symbol of Indian reform , argues that while Narasimha Rao's political system may produce slower growth than some of the authoritarian countries of East Asia , democracy may in the long run provide a surer foundation for growth : 
 "" In the short term , democracy may be an impediment to growth , but it is not a disadvantage in the long run . Political pluralism is the wave of the future . . . Political societies that are rigid and monolithic are like command economies . They can produce very rapid growth in the short term , but in the long run it 's not sustainable . "" 
 That , at any rate , is the hope : if you can not be a tiger , be a tortoise , not a hare .",750,India,A29-8245,IN TERM,True,"the country inherited by Narasimha Rao , when he became prime minister in 1991",41,True

In the neighbouring state of Haryana, the party political system is breaking down. Instead, voters see the contest as one between three families, all bearing the surname Lal, all of which have provided chief ministers in the past.

Some voters in the state, though confident that Bansi Lal will win, are unable to name his party (which happens to be the Haryana Vikas Party, a regional outfit). Even less well known is the party affiliation of one of his rivals, Devi Lal, who recently merged his regional party with a north Indian group called the Samta Dal. The man who has not recently changed labels is the chief minister, Bhajan Lal, who is a member of the Congress party. But he gained fame back in 1980 when he headed a Janata Party government in the state, and defected with his entire team to Indira Gandhi's Congress after she won the general election that year.
The small hill state of Himachal Pradesh is one of the few without a strong regional party. It is witnessing a rare straight contest between Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party(BJP), which is the main opposition to Congress nationally. Even so, national issues are rarely raised, and local ones predominate.
In Himachal Pradesh, almost one family in five has someone working for the state bureaucracy, and Congress has always cultivated their support. When the BJP ruled the state in 1990-93, its liberalising chief minister had the gumption to try to reduce the size of the bureaucracy. He also came out with a new rule, ""no work, no pay.""

Some of Mr Rao's erstwhile allies say that his decision to deal with Miss Jayalalitha shows that he has lost his political touch. Others allege that Miss Jayalalitha bribed him to strike a deal.

OPINION polls sometimes turn out to be the opinion of pollsters, but in India's general election they were on target. As predicted, India now has a hung parliament, and a shaky coalition or minority government seems likely. The bulk of seats were split between three groups: the ruling Congress party, the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and a coalition of left-wing parties, the National Front-Left Front (NF-LF). 
The counting of votes was still in progress when The Economist went to press, but it looked as if Congress would end up as the smallest of the three blocks with fewer than 150 of the 537 seats in parliament. The BJP's total will be closer to180, with the NF-LF hot on its heels. Yet the final say may rest with uncommitted minor parties and independents who look set to win more than 100 seats. The number of possible combinations is bewildering, and at least half a dozen politicians are now dreaming of becoming the next prime minister. 
Although the BJP is likely to be the biggest party, it will struggle to form a government. Even with 200 seats, it would still need to attract another 70 or more MPS to secure a majority. It will find this difficult since it has long been regarded as a pariah by secular parties. Its main hope is that Congress will break up, providing the necessary numbers. The NF-LF is also praying for a Congress split. 
Congress is licking its wounds, but has not lost hope. It knows that, provided it avoids a split, neither of its two rivals can form a government. So it could play the role of kingmaker, or be a partner in a coalition. After the poll, both the BJP and NF-LF declared there was no question of their joining hands with Congress. Yet, if neither is able to cobble together a majority, one or other may reconsider its position. 
Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, now faces a challenge to his leadership within Congress. Members of his party accuse him of two major blunders. In the state of Tamil Nadu, he decided on an alliance with an unpopular local political boss. The local unit of his party split away, and won a landslide victory in alliance with another local group. 
Mr Rao's second blunder was to deny party candidatures to ministers implicated in the corruption scandal that broke earlier this year. He thought this would distance him from the scandal. In fact it simply split the party in the state of Madhya Pradesh, where it suffered another crushing defeat. Both these Congress splinters, along with an earlier sliver that broke away in early 1995, will now seek to oust Mr Rao, who will firmly resist any such attempt. 
There were more fundamental reasons for Mr Rao's defeat than blunders in electoral strategy in some states. Traditionally, his party has relied on the support of Muslims and Untouchables. But Muslims deserted him after he failed to stop the destruction of a disputed mosque at Ayodhya in 1992. And Untouchables are now flocking to a party of their own, the Bahujan Samaj Party. Congress was also badly damaged by its reputation for being even more corrupt than other political parties. 
The BJP has been able to cash in on Congress's failings, despite the fact that it has its own problems with party discipline. It may not make it into government this time. But if, as is possible, there is another election soon, the BJP will be well placed. ","DELHI

 Although the BJP is likely to be the biggest party , it will struggle to form a government . Even with 200 seats , it would still need to attract another 70 or more MPS to secure a majority . It will find this difficult since it has long been regarded as a pariah by secular parties . Its main hope is that Congress will break up , providing the necessary numbers . The NF - LF is also praying for a Congress split . 
 Congress is licking its wounds , but has not lost hope . It knows that , provided it avoids a split , neither of its two rivals can form a government . So it could play the role of kingmaker , or be a partner in a coalition . After the poll , both the BJP and NF - LF declared there was no question of their joining hands with Congress . Yet , if neither is able to cobble together a majority , one or other may reconsider its position . 
 Narasimha Rao , now faces a challenge to Narasimha Rao's leadership within Congress . Members of Narasimha Rao's party accuse Narasimha Rao of two major blunders . In the state of Tamil Nadu , Narasimha Rao decided on an alliance with an unpopular local political boss . The local unit of Narasimha Rao's party split away , and won a landslide victory in alliance with another local group . 
 Narasimha Rao's second blunder was to deny party candidatures to ministers implicated in the corruption scandal that broke earlier this year . Narasimha Rao thought this would distance Narasimha Rao from the scandal . In fact it simply split the party in the state of Madhya Pradesh , where it suffered another crushing defeat . Both these Congress splinters , along with an earlier sliver that broke away in early 1995 , will now seek to oust Narasimha Rao . 
 There were more fundamental reasons for Narasimha Rao's defeat than blunders in electoral strategy in some states . Traditionally , Narasimha Rao's party has relied on the support of Muslims and Untouchables . But Muslims deserted Narasimha Rao after Narasimha Rao failed to stop the destruction of a disputed mosque at Ayodhya in 1992 . And Untouchables are now flocking to a party of their own , the Bahujan Samaj Party . Congress was also badly damaged by its reputation for being even more corrupt than other political parties . 
 The BJP has been able to cash in on Congress 's failings , despite the fact that it has its own problems with party discipline . It may not make it into government this time . But if , as is possible , there is another election soon , the BJP will be well placed .",750,India,A29-8245,IN TERM,True,"Narasimha Rao , the prime minister",14,True

That is because the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) stands above all for Hindu nationalism, and is regarded with fear and suspicion by secular liberals both inside and outside India. 
In fact Mr Sharma may have made an astute decision when, on 15th May, he appointed Atal Behari Vajpayee, the BJP's leader, as prime minister, replacing the outgoing Congress administration of Narasimha Rao. To stay in power, the BJP must now muster enough votes to survive a vote of confidence in India's Parliament by May 31st. If the BJP fails, it will not be able to claim it was kept out by a conspiracy. And if it succeeds, it will do so only by putting together a coalition whose other members will, with luck, moderate the wilder tendencies of the Hindu nationalists. 
In terms of seats, though not of votes, the BJP was the clear winner of the election. Because its 20% of the vote was more concentrated than Congress's nearly 3o%, the BJP won 160 MPS to Congress's 136. The results were a disaster for Congress, which lost nearly half its seats. A left-wing coalition, the National-Front Left-Front (NF-LF), won i8% or so of the vote, and111seats. 
When Mr Vajpayee was invited to form a government this week, the BJP had attracted only enough allies among minor parties to bring its total of mps to 194 (see chart). It needs to find another 80 to secure a majority by the deadline of May 31st. This will be difficult, since most of the secular parties are wary of the BJP's anti-Muslim bias. By contrast, the NF-LF had expanded its tally of Mps to 175-180 by forging alliances with regional parties and Congress dissidents. If Congress, with its 136 MPS, stuck to its pledge to back the left, the new coalition would have more than enough for a simple majority of the Parliament's 545 MIs. So it is still possible that the BJP's hold on government will last only a few weeks. 
For now, Mr Vajpayee and his party are in the limelight. The BJP rose to popularity late in 1992 by calling for the destruction of a mosque, built on a holy Hindu site in the northern Indian town of Ayodhya. The party claims to be secular, has a few ornamental Muslims in its ranks, and says it simply wants to end what it considers to be the Congresspromoted pampering of Muslims and other minorities. In fact, it has stoked many communal riots over the years and has blood on its hands. 
Mr Vajpayee is the party's moderate face. A foreign minister in the late 197os, he has national and international standing, and is no firebrand. But he is not entirely his own master. The BJP has extremists in its ranks and LK Advani, the party's president, hews to a much harder line. Critics say it will return to militancy once it gets into power. Others find hope in the fact that power often leads a party to moderate its extremism. In some states, the number of communal clashes actually decreased after the BP took over from Congress. 
Paradoxically, Mr Vajpayee's attempt to rein in the radicals may be helped by the BJP's precarious parliamentary position. In its attempt to woo allies, the BJP have hinted that the party would not pursue its more controversial election pledges of ""cultural nationalism"" (or Hinduvt), such as removing special legal and educational privileges for Muslims and other minorities. Mr Vajpayee says, not entirely reassuringly, that a new Hindu temple will be built on the ruins at Ayodhya only ""by agreement. 
But if the BJP still fails to get enough allies, the NF-LF will probably have a go at forming a government. Although Congress has more seats than the left, it seemed initially too demoralised to push to be the leading party in the coalition and, anyhow, would probably be unable to persuade the left to serve under a Congress prime minister. Faced with the BJP surge, the NF-LF has now dropped its previous insistence that it would never make an alliance with Congress. 
Congress and the NF-LF have plenty of common ground. Both agree on secularism. Both agree on the need to encourage private investment. The NF-LF, which draws much support from regional and caste-based parties, is keen on greater federalism, and Congress can go along with that. The left also wants to restrict some kinds of foreign investment, and to go slow on further import liberalisation, which Congress will also be able to accept Both sides agree that nothing should be done to overhaul India's labour laws, even though they make it virtually impossible to lay off workers or close loss-making companies. 
However, the NF-LF has been outspoken in accusing Mr Rao and his colleagues of corruption. It will be loth suddenly to keep quiet, especially since the Supreme Court will not allow outstanding cases to be swept under the carpet. The NF-LF would like to send Congress's top officials to jail, and this is not a firm basis for an enduring relationship. 
Perhaps the biggest long-term issue is whether Congress, which has dominated Indian politics for so long, is now in permanent decline. Congress led India's independence movement during the British Raj by appealing to all sections of society. After independence it continued to be inclusive. It abolished feudal land laws, passed bills to raise the status and education of untouchable and backward castes, protected Muslims from Hindu militants and reduced disparities between prosperous and hackward reigions. 
But over the years it has come to be seen as a cynical party that is more interested in patronage than good government, and in the urban rich than the rural poor. Muslims, untouchables, backward castes and backward regions are all turning away from Congress and towards sectarian parties that stand for parochial goals. 
The problem now for Congress is that, in addition to losing its claim to speak for all sections of the population, it also risks losing its reputation as the only provider of stable national government. National governments were formed without Congress in 1977 and 1989, but their early collapse made disillusioned voters return to the Congress fold. However, in the 1980s Congress's rivals managed to form stable governments in several states-such as West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. In the1990sthe BJP provided stable governments in some northern and eastern states. So the Congress claim to be the only provider of stability is no longer credible. 
Its days of dominance may be over, but it is too soon to write Congress off. It remains important in many parts of India. Much of its collapse in the south can be ascribed to a miscalculated electoral alliance with an unpopular local leader in the state of Tamil Nadu. That kind of mistake can be put right. Congress also still has many of the ingredients-such as national organisation and willing potential supporters-required for a recovery. But it needs to rediscover its priorities, make them fit its natural groups of support and, above all, do something about its deserved reputation for corruption. 
If it did all this successfully, Congress could find common cause on many issues with the Janata Dal (which includes many of its ex-members) and with the smaller regional and caste-based parties that have moved on to its patch. That would provide a real challenge to the BJP and would give India a clear choice between, on the one hand, a grass-roots secular party advocating decentralisation and federalism and, on the other, a Hindu-nationalist party advocating centralism and faster economic liberalisation. But so far Congress has shown little sign of rising to the challenge.

As part of its effort to secure peace in Kashmir, the Indian government is pushing through parliamentary elections in the disputed territory, in the teeth of efforts by Muslim rebels campaigning for a boycott of the polls. 
Of the six constituencies in the state, two lie in the Hindu-majority Jammu region and one in Buddhist-majority Ladakh. Voting in Ladakh and one Jammu constituency has already taken place and another Jammu constituency will vote on May 23rd. But international attention centres on the three seats in the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley, where the poll will be held on May 30th. Turnout will be low in the valley, maybe less than 10%. Yet the Indian government hopes to create new power centres that might grow and one day end the six-year old insurgency. That is why the government is so determined to press on with the election, and why the militants are determined to sabotage it. 
Militants hoped no local party would contest the poll. In fact more than 40 candidates are standing in the three seats.

They could soon go even worse. Mr Vajpayee has to submit his minority government to a vote of confidence in India's lower house of Parliament by May 31st. The vote may come even sooner, and he looks likely to lose it. 
The defeat, if it comes, will be at the hands of a motley group of opponents. These include the Congress party, which itself suffered a stinging defeat in the general election two weeks ago, and a fissiparous coalition of leftist and regional parties that has this week renamed itself-perhaps a touch optimistically the United Front. 
These parties and fragments of parties have between them 310 to 320 Mps. The BJP has thus far been able to muster only about 195, in the absence of a rush of defections from either Congress or the regional parties in the Front. 
The BJP's leaders had hoped that more mps would flock to their side once they were seen to be running a government. In an effort to play down the BJP's old firebrand image,Jaswant Singh, the urbane finance minister, has delivered robust and reassuring messages on economic reform and foreign investment that even his Congress predecessor, Manmohan Singh, could scarcely have faulted. 
The new minister for industry, Suresh Prabhu, has been sounding similarly responsible. Although he is a member of Shiv Sena, which is even more chauvinist in its defence of Hindu interests than its ally the BJP, Mr Prabhu is best known as an entrepreneur and chairman of India's largest cooperative bank. He talks of reforming the public sector and wants to encourage foreign investment, albeit under close government control: ""We don't want just to welcome foreign investors with garlands at the airport. We must also guide them through the bylanes of India,"" he says. 
But by showing his government's moderate face, Mr Vajpayee has already alienated some of his own rank and file, while nonetheless failing to command the extra support he needs from other parties in Parliament. Extremists on the right have already accused Mr Singh of going soft on foreign investment. They are also worried that pet projects, such as rebuilding a controversial Hindu temple at Ayodhya in northern India, on the site of a mosque destroyed by rioters in 1992, might be shelved. And Mr Vajpayee will have angered them further by giving the important foreign-affairs portfolio to Sikander Bakht, the only Muslim in his cabinet. Mr Bakht will combine this job with the less glamorous post of minister for urban affairs and employment. 
But not perhaps for long. The opposition is likely to succeed in bringing Mr Vajpayee's government down. If-or rather when-the BJP government falls, India's president, Shanker Dayal Sharma, must decide whom to invite next to try to form a government. Logically, he would turn to the Congress, which is the next largest single party. 
However, Narasimha Rao, the Congress leader, would almost certainly refuse, preferring to stay on the sidelines for a little longer after his party's defeat in the general election. Mr Sharma had dinner with all the party leaders earlier this week, so Mr Rao may have already indicated this. 
That leaves the United Front, which, sensing power, got its act together on May 22nd and formally elected Deve Gowda, a little known regional politician who is chief minister of the state of Karnataka, as its parliamentary leader. To take up that post, and become prime minister, Mr Gowda would have to give up the chief ministership and be elected to Parliament.

Many ordinary Indians who do not get much in the way of laughs from politicians like the idea of the great man being in a pickle. 
The incident, if it happened, took place years ago. In 1983, according to Mr Pathak, Chandraswami offered, for $100,ooo, to use his influence to get him a government contract for newsprint, the pickle manufacturer's other business. Mr Pathak claims Mr Rao was also present when the deal was done and he handed over the money. Mr Pathak did not get the contract, and says he did not get his money back. 
After years of trying, the persistent Mr Pathak got Chandraswami before a court, which declared Mr Rao a co-accused. Mr Rao denies the charge, and says it is impermissible anyway to accuse him after so many years. There is a touch of black comedy about the case. Mr Rao is being prosecuted not for fiddling a contract but for failing to do so. He wants Mr Pathak to be arrested for bribery. But there was no move to arrest Mr Pathak when Mr Rao was prime minister. 
In another case, Mr Rao and members of his Congress party are accused of bribing members of the Jharkand Mukti Morcha, a regional party of Sihar, to support the government. He also has to answer a charge that he owes the government $7m for the personal use of government aircraft. Such a series of allegations would have finished most politicians, but Mr Rao has so far weathered the storm. Several in his party, led by Sharad Pawar, a former defence minister, called on him to resign as party president. But Mr Rao rallied his forces, and quelled the revolt. The party has such a reputation for corruption that any plausible successor might immediately become the target of allegations. These days the judiciary is keen to show its independence, and the political class can no longer brush such accusations under the carpet.

History's verdict on Narasimha Rao, India's former prime minister, has become uncertain after a court decided last week that, in the matter of the British pickle manufacturer said to have been cheated out of $100,000 he had a case to answer. He may face prosecution in two other cases, one of which involves alleged political bribery. Mr Rao has resigned as president of the ruling Congress party. But he remains leader of the parliamentary party, and could perhaps bounce back if cleared. 
Congress has long been regarded by voters as a money-making machine disguised as a political party. But so far its leaders have observed the lith commandment, thou shalt not be caught. There was a tacit understanding between parties that they would not tell on each other, since all had skeletons in their cupboards. Now a busy judiciary is obliging the police to act, and careless politicians who have left a trail are in danger of being tracked down. 
Sitaram Kesri, treasurer of the Congress party for two decades, has been chosen as its acting president. He is a political lightweight who, finding it difficult to win an election to the lower house of Parliament, has spent most of his years in the safety of the upper house. In a recent state election in Bihar, his Congress candidate for Danapur (his own home) won just 839 votes and lost his deposit. Mr Kesri will be the first Congress leader incapable of carrying his own state. He stresses the need to strengthen the party in the northern states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, which account for a quarter of India's population. But after decades of corrupt rule the party's share of the vote has slipped below 10%. 
At 78, Mr Kesri is two years older than Mr Rao, and looks part of the party's problem rather than its solution. He has a formidable reputation as a fund-raiser, but that looks almost an embarrassment amid the current feeling about corruption. He failed to submit audited party accounts for a decade until the courts obliged him to. (Other parties were equally laggard.) 
Mr Kesri hopes to get back the vote of Muslims who deserted the party after the destruction of the Ayodhya mosque in 1992. (They suspected Mr Rao of complicity in this.) Mr Kesri belongs to a low caste, and will try to win back members of low castes who have gravitated to the Janata Dal. 
This will not be easy. Congress used to claim, rightly, that it represented all sections of society. But the popular vote has swung to parties based on caste, religion and region. So Congress is in danger of representing nobody rather than everybody. It cannot even claim to be the only economic reformer: the Janata Dal and Bharatiya Janata Party have proved to be liberalisers too. The main hope of Congress is that other parties will prove just as venal, with their leaders facing prosecution. The hope is not entirely far-fetched. ","GREAT liberaliser or petty cheat ?

Like Pakistan, India is in the throes of attempts to deal with corruption in public life. But unlike its neighbour and bitter rival, India has so far managed to go after powerful politicians without overturning the whole political system. In India, the beginnings of the current revolt against corruption in public life can be dated to the actions of a stern new election commissioner, T.N. Seshan, who two years ago started to denounce the growing link between politicians and criminals. Using his power to delay elections-and if necessary to declare them void-he took steps to end the political use of thugs and to crack down on campaign spending beyond official limits. He also gave wildly applauded public speeches in which he lambasted the whole political class. 
Then last year the revolt spread to the judiciary, which agreed to hear a series of public-interest suits brought by citizens against top politicians of virtually all parties, including Mr Rao. The judges' boldness encouraged policemen, who had previously not dared act against their political masters. Police raids uncovered evidence of widespread bribery of politicians. Even before Mr Rao lost office, several of his senior cabinet colleagues had been obliged to resign under a cloud. 
India's notoriously slow-moving courts have even managed to deal with some cases. On November 4th, the Supreme Court fined Satish Sharma, a former petroleum minister, 5m rupees ($140,ooo), for allotting public-sector petrol dealerships to friends and relations of politicians. In another case the police claim to have evidence that Mr Sharma received large payments from five business groups. Mr Rao too faces several different sets of allegations. Even before last week's charges were laid, he had been charged in cases involving vote-buying and forgery. So many powerful people are now under investigation that a cartoon in the Times of India last week showed a policeman complaining that soon all pickpockets and petty thieves would have to be released from jail to create space for the politicians, bureaucrats and company directors. 
The revolt against corruption has encouraged small fry, who used to be part of the conspiracy of silence, to come forward. A complaint by a pickle manufacturer, Lakhubhai Pathak, led to the original arrest of Mr Rao. And it was Mr Sharma's secretary who told the police about payments by oil companies. More and more voices are exposing the criminality that has become part and parcel of politics and business. 
Yet the attack on corruption has a long way to go. Legal delays are endemic; everyone found guilty will appeal to higher courts; and cynics say most of the accused politicians will die of old age before their cases are disposed of Yet it makes a difference to society that people who once seemed above the law have been obliged to bow to it. Ministers of both central and state governments have long regarded it as legitimate to favour friends in the allotting of permits, dealerships and government houses. But by fining Mr Sharma, the Supreme Court has at least ensured that ministers tempted to exploit the spoils of office now know that they are taking a risk.

Even before last week 's charges were laid , Narasimha Rao had been charged in cases involving vote - buying and forgery . So many powerful people are now under investigation that a cartoon in the Times of India last week showed a policeman complaining that soon all pickpockets and petty thieves would have to be released from jail to create space for the politicians , bureaucrats and company directors . 
 The revolt against corruption has encouraged small fry , who used to be part of the conspiracy of silence , to come forward . A complaint by a pickle manufacturer , Lakhubhai Pathak , led to the original arrest of Narasimha Rao . And it was Mr Sharma 's secretary who told the police about payments by oil companies . More and more voices are exposing the criminality that has become part and parcel of politics and business . 
 Yet the attack on corruption has a long way to go . Legal delays are endemic ; everyone found guilty will appeal to higher courts ; and cynics say most of the accused politicians will die of old age before their cases are disposed of Yet it makes a difference to society that people who once seemed above the law have been obliged to bow to it . Ministers of both central and state governments have long regarded it as legitimate to favour friends in the allotting of permits , dealerships and government houses . But by fining Mr Sharma , the Supreme Court has at least ensured that ministers tempted to exploit the spoils of office now know that they are taking a risk .",750,India,A29-8245,POST TERM,True,"Narasimha Rao , who was prime minister of India until a few months ago",7,True
1996-12-07,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224109861/fulltext/69FD728B240D40EFPQ/19?accountid=14657,"THE United Front government in India has lasted seven months. Many are betting that it will not last seven more. Its main foe is an old man in a hurry, Sitaram Kesri, who at the age of 78 has recently taken over the presidency of Congress, the largest opposition party. Mr Kesri wants to be prime minister and, at his age, he does not want to wait too long. 
The coalition government, a rag-tag collection of 13 leftist, regional and minor parties, came to power soon after the general election in May. The biggest winner in the election was a group of Hindu-nationalist parties, led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which took 195 of the 543 seats in Parliament. The BJP formed a minority government, but was isolated by the secular parties and quickly lost. 
Congress, which had ruled India almost continuously since the country's independence, came second, but with only 140 seats, compared with 232 in the previous parliament, so it was seen as the big loser. Accordingly, it was left to 13 other parties with 178 seats between them to cobble together a ""United Front"" government, the unifying cement being their shared determination to keep the BJP out. With similar feelings about the BJP, Congress agreed to support the minority government. 
Quarrels have divided the United Front from day one. The leftist parties oppose privatisation and think that Deve Gowda, the prime minister, has been too soft on Narasimha Rao, his Congress predecessor, who faces a variety of corruption charges. But these quarrels, though noisy, are unlikely in themselves to cause the government's collapse. The four left-wing parties, which are the most fractious, have only 52 seats and none of the regional parties in the coalition has more than 2o. The government could survive defections from the leftist or the regional groupings, so long as Congress continues to vote with it 
That is the big if Before Mr Kesri came on the scene, Congress leaders seemed prepared to bide their time, since they saw little prospect of improving their fortunes in a fresh election. But after Mr Rao was charged with corruption, he resigned as president of the Congress party. In September, he was succeeded by Mr Kesri, who does not disguise his desire to become prime minister. He has a four-stage plan to manipulate himself into power. 
First, he needs to reunite all the splinters of Congress, making it the largest single party in Parliament, with 165 seats (the Bjp has only 16o). Second, he needs to replace Mr Rao as leader of the Congress parliamentary party. After this, he plans to withdraw support from the United Front, and wait for the president to ask him, as head of the largest party, to form the next government. Lastly, he hopes to seduce most regional and minor parties from the United Front and so win a majority. 
None of this will be as easy as it sounds. Mr Kesri has won back two Congress splinter groups, but what really matters, because it holds 20 seats in Parliament, is the splinter in the state of Tamil Nadu. The trouble is that this lot owes its success there to its conversion into a regional party. It would lose much of its support if it rejoined Congress. Moreover, it already holds two cabinet posts, including the finance minister's, and Mr Kesri cannot offer it much more. But, without it, Congress cannot become the largest party in Parliament. 
Nor will Mr Kesri find it easy to dislodge Mr Rao from his remaining job, as leader of the parliamentary party. Although Mr Rao has led Congress to defeat and has now been charged with corruption, his party has no tradition of removing a sitting leader. He will not go quietly, and Mr Kesri dare not push things to a split, which would ruin his chances of inheriting a united party. 
Even if the first three stages of Mr Kesri's scheme went according to plan, it is by no means certain that the regional and minor parties would give their support to him. Why should they, when Congress is their main rival in their states? 
So the fall of the United Front could lead to parliamentary deadlock and a fresh election, in which the BJP would probably make the biggest gains. Nonetheless, many in Congress expect Mr Kesri to make his move in mid-1997. However small his chance of making the history books, it is his only chance. 
For the government, all this is proving paralysing. No big economic changes have taken place, or are in prospect. But that does not mean that all is well, especially on the budget front. The central government's budget deficit was 5.9% of GDP last year. Add the borrowing of state governments and public-sector corporations, and the combined deficit was close to 10% of GDP. The finance minister has promised to cut the central deficit to 5%, but is getting no cooperation from other ministers. He wants to raise oil prices (which are governmentcontrolled) in line with world prices, but his coalition partners have said no, because it would make them unpopular. In consequence, state oil companies will be in debt to the tune of almost $3 billion (1.5% of GDP) by the end of the fiscal year in March. 
In India, any government under threat puts off hard decisions and tries to buy popularity. The finance minister is trying to limit giveaways, but without much success. The railway and telecoms ministers have granted additional bonus payments to their employees, and state governments are likely to follow suit. Fertiliser and food subsidies are certain to be above budget. Economic liberalisation is not under threat, but fiscal discipline certainly is.

But the prime minister, Deve Gowda, sees this as the embrace of a boa constrictor. Mr Kesri, who at 78 does not want to hang about, looks certain to try for the prime ministership before the year is out. 
In the general election last May, Congress was thrashed, winning only 140 of the 543 seats in Parliament. To keep the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) out of power, a 14-member United Front of leftist and nationalist parties formed a minority government. This has been supported from without by Congress, which also views the BJP as the main enemy. 
To add to Congress's woes, some members of the former government, including its leader Narasimha Rao, have been accused of corruption. Mr Rao resigned as party president in September, but not at first as leader of the parliamentary party. After a skilful campaign by Mr Kesri, Mr Rao gave up the parliamentary job too. Mr Kesri, who has turned into a killer after being a faceless party treasurer for two decades, then saw off other contenders to lead the parliamentary party. In face of his formidable advance, his rivals stepped aside to let him be elected unopposed. 
Mr Kesri hopes to reunite four bits of Congress that have broken away because of personal differences with Mr Rao. That will raise the party's tally in Parliament to 163, just ahead of the BJP's 160. If he then withdraws support from the United Front, he can expect the Indian president to call on him, as leader of the largest party, to try to form the next government. He hopes that at that stage several minor parties of the United Front, keen to stay on the winning side, will switch to him. He will find it difficult to win over the loo-odd MPS he needs for a majority. Yet Congress morale, in the doldrums for most of the past year, is suddenly high again. By purging itself of Mr Rao, it has lost its constipated look.

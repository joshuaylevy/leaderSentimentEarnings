Discounting three Conservative backbenchers, Ms Campbell's only serious contender was the environment minister, Jean Charest, and he had obstacles to overcome.

She began her political life in the right-wing Social Credit Party and questions are being asked about both her economic policies and her world view. Opposition Liberals have been quick to argue that Ms Campbell offers no change, except a bright face, from the inner circle of older Mulroney ministers.
In contrast, Mr Charest has mangaed to seem fresh and open-minded. He is bilingual (Ms Campbell speaks passable French) and is respected for having put up a good performance at the Earth summit in Brazil, as well as for having chaired a useful committee on the constitution. Among those convention delegates who set a high store on family values, Mr Charest's happy home life will score against Ms Campbell's two divorces.
But Ms Campbell's strongest card is that Conservatives see her as the candidate most likely to carry them to victory at the general election that must take place by November. Though the Liberals have led by some 20 points in opinion polls for the past two years, a recent poll put the Tories under her leadership almost that far ahead of the Liberals under Jean Chretien. Mr Chretien, who this week marks 30 years (with one short break) in federal politics, has held every senior cabinet post except the prime ministership.

Ms Campbell has been doing her best to suggest a range of differences with Brian Mulroney's government, without repudiating any of its policies--which she could hardly do since she was first his minister of justice, and then of defence. Her answer is a new image, particularly of herself.
Mr Mulroney, prime minister for nine years until he retired in June, was mistrusted and unpopular except in his native Quebec. His efforts to unify Canadians through constitutional reform and to bring jobs through free-trade agreements were judged a failure. As defence minister, Ms Campbell herself had to defend the purchase of 50 military helicopters costing C$5.8 billion ($4.5 billion).
With the open look of a healthy blonde, she has reflected the sunny mood of summertime Canada. She has avoided controversial issues, preferring to be interviewed by disc jockeys than by political pundits. She has kept photographers busy with her cheerful hats, and she pitched a baseball competently. Flitting across Canada--on national day, July 1st, she greeted the dawn in Newfoundland and watched the sunset in her own British Colombia--she has shed some of her elitist skin. Mr Mulroney used to travel in limousines, but she took the subway in Toronto and walked the streets of Regina when paying a call on two provincial premiers. While the Mulroneys were furnishing their new mansion in Montreal with whirlpools in every bathroom and trying to sell their prime-ministerial furniture to the government, she was telling radio-show audiences that she had not even bought linen for her official residence.
As a first move towards fulfilling her promise--made when she was fighting for the party leadership--to eliminate the present C$32.6 billion federal deficit within five years, she cut the cabinet by eight ministers, and the civil service by nine government departments. She also refused to sign election nomination papers for three Quebec parliamentarians who face charges of misusing public funds; a step designed to appeal to supporters of the Reform Party, which has sprung to influence in western Canada. For Canadian nationalists who maintained that Mr Mulroney was a branch-plant American, Ms Campbell and her external affairs minister, Perrin Beatty, have managed to distance themselves a little: lifting a ban on aid to Cuba, opposing an air strike in Bosnia and holding out against sanctions in Bill Clinton's NAFTA side-deals (see page 21).

Now Canadians face a hard-to-forecast general election on October 25th, and a clouded future, whoever wins.
One cloud is political: there will probably be no outright winner. Canada has three major parties, but a first-past-the-post electoral system. So the Conservatives or the Liberals have usually managed to win an overall majority, leaving the New Democrats to play the national conscience, with occasional power in the provinces (as at present in Ontario, British Columbia and Saskatchewan). This year, though, two regional parties are doing well, the separatist Bloc Qubecois and the Alberta-based Reform Party. The best guess is that neither the Conservative prime minister, Kim Campbell, nor the Liberal leader, Jean Chretien, will win a clear majority of the 295 seats. Indeed neither may do better than 120.
This need not be worrying. Minority government is nothing new in Canada, nor need it mean stalemate. Lester Pearson headed two minority Liberal governments in the 1960s that brought in big welfare programmes. Pierre Trudeau had to govern for two years by the grace of the New Democrats, and paid for their support by creating the national oil corporation, Petro-Canada, which brought Canadians inside knowledge of a mainly foreign-owned industry.
Ms Campbell is trying for a third Conservative majority government, but takes pains to call it a first Campbell one, to distance herself from Brian Mulroney, who ended nine years as prime minister in deep unpopularity. In the short time she had before having to call an election, she worked hard on the barbecue circuit to make herself known and liked, but the 47 days of the election campaign will be the test of a relatively untried politician.
She was Mr Mulroney's minister of justice, and then of defence, for less than four years. Mr Chretien, in contrast, held almost all the important portfolios under Mr Trudeau. But few younger voters know or care. As one pollster put it this week, the choice is between a fresh leader with a tired party and a tired leader with a fresh party.
Ms Campbell is trying to get rid of one albatross, or rather seven, inherited from her own defence-ministry past. On September 2nd she announced she would cut from 50 to 43 the number of helicopters that Canada is to buy, still laden with equipment to spot Soviet submarines. Supposedly, this will save C$1 billion ($750m) of the original C$5.8 billion cost; but Ms Campbell's announcement has merely made the deal a live issue again. A nastier affair is still round her neck: a belated flow of revelations of murderous indiscipline in the Canadian Airborne Regiment in Somalia.
The real cloud is economic. With little sin of recovery, and the unemployment rate now at 11.6%, the main issue will be jobs and the recent cost-cutting by the federal government and all ten provincial ones. In the past fiscal year, their combined deficits totalled C$60 billion, nearly 9% of GDP. Ms Campbell, though talking of eliminating today's C$32.6 billion federal deficit within five years, has promised there will be no new or higher taxes. So thousands of civil servants fear for their jobs, other voters for social programmes, such as medicare and pensions.
Jobs will be the issue for the New Democrat leader, Audrey McLauhlin. She has a detailed plan to create 1-1/2m of them over five years, while reducing the deficit and holding taxes steady. This appealing snake-oil, based on investing in everything from modern transportation to a national child-care system, is her party's best hope of climbing from its present sorry 8% in opinion polls. Of its present 43 seats, mostly in western Canada, half are at risk.
The Liberals will publish their full platform only after a week of campaigning. If they are even to come close to a clear majority, they must take two-thirds of the 99 seats in Ontario and--more difficult--regain some 20 in Quebec that they lost to Mr Mulroney, a Quebecker. But the popular Lucien Bouchard and his Bloc Quebecois could win half of the 75 seats there, on the issue of the economy as much as Quebecois sovereignty.","They have enjoyed one of the sunniest summers they can remember .

For as long as most can remember, the federal government has been run by one of two parties, usually the Liberals but for the past nine years the Progressive Conservatives, with the New Democrats as a strong third party providing a social conscience. After the general election on October 25th, two regional parties, the Bloc Quebecois and the Reform Party, are expected to have knocked the traditional pattern aside.
Under Brian Mulroney, the Tories won two handsome victories, based on strong support both in Mr Mulroney's native Quebec and in oil-rich Alberta in western Canada. But these two Tory pillars grew wobbly when Kim Campbell took over the leadership in June; during the 47-day election campaign they have visibly crumbled. Ms Campbell, a lawyer from British Columbia who had difficulties in the French-language television debate, has seen Mr Mulroney's followers slide over to the Bloc Quebecois, which is expected to win most of Quebec's 75 seats. Meanwhile, Preston Manning, the son of a former premier of Alberta, has spread enthusiasm for the simple verities of his Reform Party--a balanced budget, smaller government, less immigration through western Canada and into Ontario.
The main pre-election question is whether the Liberals under Jean Chretien will win a narrow majority of the 295 seats, or have to struggle as a coalition or minority government. The Liberals have won support with their plausible plan for job-creation, a more attractive line--in a country with chronic unemployment now running above ll%--than Ms Campbell's insistence on reducing the budget deficit. But debts and deficits remain, and the new Reform MPS, plus whatever is left of the Tories, will undoubtedly chase the issue of economic management.
The Bloc Quebecois may well help Mr Chretien out on economic questions; its leader, Lucien Bouchard, places the party left of centre. But as a party fighting for Quebec sovereignty (a supposedly unfrightening form of separatism), it will otherwise be at logerheads with the Liberals. Somewhat in the tradition of Charles Stewart Parnell and Irish home rule in the British Parliament of the 1880s, its overriding object in coming to Ottawa is to fight for Quebec's interests and to prepare the way for Quebec's departure from the Canadian confederation within three years. Mr Bouchard's timetable is based on Quebec's provincial election next year, which his separatist ally (not contesting the federal election), the Parti Quebecois, may well win.
Mr Chretien's campaign has fared reasonably well in English Canada partly because people remember his long and respectable record in federal politics as Pierre Trudeau's lieutenant; by contrast Ms Campbell's way across the country has been littered with imprudent remarks. But Mr Chretien's links to Trudeau federalism, which offered no special treatment for Quebec, make him anathema to the nationalists around Mr Bouchard.
When battle is joined in the next constitutional round, it will be bruising. Mr Manning and his colleagues have shown no sympathy for Quebec's aspirations, and indeed their party has grown in reaction to Quebec's influence on Ottawa.

Half of those who voted on October 25th in its querulous, mostly French-speaking province of Quebec supported a party that says No. How many truly share that view is not clear. To send the Bloc Quebecois to the federal parliament in Ottawa as the main opposition is one thing. To elect its provincial equivalent, the Parti Quebecois, to power in Quebec next year would be another; and to support the demand for Quebec's independence in a referendum to be held there in 1995 a still more fateful step. Yet all of this could happen in the aftershocks of an election that has reduced the governing party to rubble and remade Canada's political landscape (see page 43). The question is what, if anything, other Canadians should, or can, do to repair their fissile federation.
The sensible answer--though not, for many Canadians, the sentimental one--is not very much. Separation would do Canada no great harm. In an era of free trade and free movement, no vital part of its economy would be torn apart. Its geographically disconnected Atlantic provinces would no doubt feel isolated, but little more so, in practical terms, than they are now. That needs to be set against Quebec's grievances, which are founded in history and tribal consciousness--forces that can often be even stronger than those of economics.
Quebec's provincial government already controls its own education and nearly all its own linguistic policy, the foundations of national identity. It does not control its own economy, but then no non-communist government does. It is suffering painfully from unemployment, but so is all of Canada. It is as much (which is a lot) in control of its own taxation as any other province. It likes to see itself as the poor stepdaughter, ill-treated by a miserly mother in Ottawa. Yet federal money, not least for high technology, has flowed freely to the province. For the past five years, to go no further back, most Quebec MPS have been on the government side; the Conservative prime minister until a few months ago, Brian Mulroney, was himself from Quebec, as is Jean Chretien, the new Liberal one. Insofar as Quebec has a case against the centre, it is one shared by most other provinces. What more does it want?
The problematic answer has long been: quite a lot. Canada has made two recent attempts to meet Quebec's demands. The first was rejected by the other provinces. But a second deal, which included recognition of Quebec as a ""distinct society"" and lots of protection for its Frenchness, was accepted by all the provincial governments, Quebec's included, as well as the federal one--only to be thrown out in a referendum last year. The Quebecois, unlike their government, thought it gave them too little; many other Canadians thought it gave them too much.
When people feel like that, with both sides unready for the compromises that could keep them together, they should perhaps part. That would not be painless: history and tribal feeling are not the monopoly of Canada's French-speakers, and there are many Canadians who feel for Canada just as Quebecois do for Quebec. Nor would Anglo-Canadians, thoroughly fed up with Quebec, bend over backwards, financially or otherwise, to help it on its way. But in the end it takes only one to end a marriage. If one province does feel that way, while the others think the demands it makes for a still fragile reconciliation are unreasonably high, so be it.
BREAKING UP STILL HURTS
Yet even if the possibility of a sovereign Quebec need not alarm outsiders unduly, the breaking up of Canada would have other costs. First to feel them would be Quebec's English-speakers. Even now, linguistic zeal weighs on the 18% or so of Quebeckers who do not speak French. Never mind the language of shop-signs. The rules that prevent non-Canadian newcomers from sending their children to English-language schools pose a much harder problem. There are arguments for this based on social integration. But that is not the purpose; and there is a strong case of civil liberty against it. True, the Quebec government already warns might-be immigrants of its rules. But how quickly, in an independent Quebec, would an acceptable concern for national identity become linguistic chauvinism?
The portents are not encouraging. About a fifth of Canada's people do not, of choice, speak its main language. About a fifth of Quebec's cannot speak its. Canada has two official languages Quebec has only one. When Lucien Bouchard, the Bloc Quebecois leader, celebrated his triumph on Monday night before the television cameras, he spoke in French to his Quebecois supporters. He spoke briefly--and responsibly--in English to the rest of Canada. For English-speaking Quebeckers, fellow citizens of his may-be country, he had not a word.
For the outside world--a gleeful France excepted--a Canada-in-pieces, though no disaster, would be no asset either. An independent Quebec would be unlikely to want to denounce international accords accepted by today's Canada, whether of defence or trade. Quebec's nationalists are not, as one might imagine, wild protectionists: on the contrary, it is the Liberals, now in national power, who have talked--implausibly--of renegotiating the existing free-trade agreement with the United States and the still-to-happen NAFTA deal. Yet could NAFTA, already at risk in the United States, survive the shattering of Canada into squabbling pieces? The parting, however messy, would not threaten a new Bosnia. Still, a smaller Canada, its insistent voice for fair-mindedness and good citizenship muted in the world's councils, would be a loss.
Put it simply. If Canada breaks apart--and if is not yet when--the United Nations would gain a new member, the United States would have two northern neighbours instead of one, and that would be about it.

As the long election campaign progressed, Jean Chretien grew more confident of winning a modest majority of the 295 seats in Canada's Parliament for his Liberal Party. On October 25th he succeeded, but perhaps a little too well. The Liberals won 177 seats and in the process devastated the other two traditional, federalist parties. The Progressive Conservatives, who held 157 seats at the start of this campaign, have been reduced to an absurd two. The New Democrats have sunk from 44 to nine.
In the debris of these old parties stand two fresh, dangerous opponents. The new groupings show up Canada's fault lines. The Liberals won all but one of the 32 seats in the four provinces of Atlantic Canada, and all but one of the 99 seats in Ontario. But they won less than one-third of the 75 seats in Quebec, where the separatist Bloc Quebecois took 54 and now becomes the official opposition. They also won only one third of the 89 seats lying west of Ontario, where the right-wing Reform Party took 51 (plus a solitary Ontario seat).
On election night Lucien Bouchard, for the Bloc, spoke of the aims (economic growth and job creation) that he shared with the Liberals; Preston Manning for the Reformers talked of the need to develop ""a new federalism"". Behind these polite sentiments lies the unpleasant fact that the two parties are protest movements with overwhelming strength in their regions--and antipathetic to one another.
There are straws to clutch in this high wind. The most substantial is the size of the Liberal majority. Mr Chretien will be able to stimulate the economy without worrying overmuch about criticism from the cost-cutting Reformers. He has a pretty good crew. Among the small contingents of Liberal MPS from western Canada and from Quebec are excellent newcomers, and his cabinet may be the most talented for a generation.
His party boasts a record number of 53 women MPS, including Ethel Blondin-Andrew, an Inuit from the Western Arctic, and Jean Augustine, who emigrated from Jamaica under the domestic workers programme to become head of Toronto's housing authority. And he himself is a reassuring presence. His reputation is a comfort after the mistrust that Brian Mulroney, the former Conservative leader, provoked; his experience (the prime ministership is his tenth portfolio) shows up well in contrast to the amateurish performance of Kim Campbell, who ends her brief spell as Conservative prime minister.
But on the most vital issue of all--whether or not Quebec will stay within Canada--he is hobbled by his past. As Pierre Trudeau's loyal lieutenant, he is linked to the policy of treating Quebec constitutionally like any other province. This makes it difficult for him to switch to a more flexible approach. Recognising this handicap, he appealed in his victory speech to Canadians to ""leave constitutional quarrels on the back burner"". Mr Bouchard, who stormed out of the Mulroney cabinet to form the Bloc Quebecois when the Meech Lake constitutional amendments failed in 1990, is hardly likely to agree.
Mr Bouchard's first words to his nationalist supporters on election night were to remind them of the defiance of Rene Levesque, Quebec's late premier, when he lost the referendum on sovereignty in 1980: ""We will see you next time"". For Mr Bouchard, that time will come if the Parti Quebecois (the Bloc's provincial ally) wins the provincial election next year--and honours Levesque's memory by winning, through another referendum, the mandate to carry Quebec and its 7m people to political sovereignty.
Optimists say that Monday's election has got rid of under cover manoeuvres and ambiguity: the Quebec issue will now have to be settled in a straightforward manner. Some even suggest that the Bloc's MPS will be converted to federalism through the chemistry of companionship in Ottawa and the give-and-take of question time.
But the old way of placating Quebec nationalism was to slip lucrative contracts to the province and allow its government more administrative power than any other. This would be hard for Mr Chretien. He has committed himself to cancelling the Tories' controversial C$5.8 billion ($4.4 billion) contract for military helicopters, much of which would have flowed to Quebec. And if he offers Quebec other plums, he will risk loud shouts from the Reform Party.
LOST IN THE DEBRIS
Meanwhile, the Conservatives and the New Democrats have to burrow their way out of the rubble. The surviving Tory MPS are an ill-matched pair: Jean Charest, who ran a close second to Ms Campbell for the leadership in June, and Elsie Wayne, a former New Brunswick mayor. Kim Campbell herself, having carried the weight of Mr Mulroney's unpopularity across Canada in an exhausting campaign, made a graceful exit on losing her Vancouver seat.
She may continue as party leader for a year or more, while rebuilding begins. More than 2m Canadians voted Conservative--more than for the Bloc Quebecois--and her party could have held some 20 seats in Ontario if the intervention of Reform candidates had not handed them to Liberals. The Conservatives still have a power base in the Senate, which Mr Mulroney brazenly packed before his departure.
The New Democrats, too, were humbled. Their leader, Audrey McLaughlin, survived in the Yukon, as did six others in the Prairies, the party's most secure base. But they were eliminated in Ontario, where Bob Rae's provincial government is unpopular, and almost wiped out in British Columbia for a similar reason--Michael Harcourt's NDP government lost support both for its tough measures on the deficit and for a compromise on the logging of Clayoquot rainforest that enraged environmentalists.
The New Democrats picked an uninspiring campaign issue--anxiety about the trade agreements with the United States and Mexico--and yielded ground to Mr Chretien, who concentrated steadily on the hope of good times ahead. But the NDP probably retains its niche to the left of the Liberals as a party of social conscience (so long as that is still relevant). By contrast, the Conservatives, or what remains of them, are squeezed between the Liberals moving to the right and the Reform Party surging from the far-right. Kim Campbell's final affectionate words to her followers on election night--""Consider yourselves hugged""--may carry a more ominous meaning.","Jean Chretien's wildest dream , or a nightmare ?

This week, in accordance with campaign promises, Canada's new Liberal government, headed by Jean Chretien, held talks with the United States, trying to reopen parts of the NAFTA package. The deal was ratified in the spring by the then Conservative-controlled Ottawa parliament, but was not proclaimed as law.
The two countries have had their own free-trade agreement since 1988. Most often, it works well enough. But the Canadians--not alone--dislike the way American industry, whenever competition gets tough, tries to force its government to pull up the drawbridges, with cries of ""subsidy"" or ""dumping"".
In recent examples, Canadian durum wheat--exports of which are controlled by a wheat-marketing board--is alleged to have been dumped. The ""stumpage"" fee paid by Canadian logging companies to provincial governments is so low, American rivals complain, as to amount to a subsidy. After years of wrangling, Norsk Hydro, which produces magnesium in Quebec using low-cost hydro-electricity, was hit six weeks ago with countervailing import duties on both charges. The Canadians want the rules on these issues tightened and clarified.
Mr Chretien's hands, though, are hardly clean. Even if his party had not opposed the 1988 agreement, which it did, there are plenty of protectionists in his own backyard. Ancient supply-management mechanisms protect Canada's daily, egg and poultry farmers from cheaper American imports. In Windsor, next door to Detroit, car-component workers believe a long-standing free-trade agreement in that industry has done them more harm than good. Road haulage and air transport are firmly protected (as they are in the United States).
In the name of Canadian culture, publishers too are protected: Canadian firms that advertise in American magazines cannot treat the cost as a tax-deductible expense, and the government even has power (albeit never yet used) to ban imports of ""split-run"" editions of American magazinesAmerican editorial tarted up maybe with a bit of Canadian news but surrounded by Canadian advertising. Broadcasters must use a certain proportion of Canadian material.
So far, so normal. Much less so is some bizarre intra-Canadian protection. Quebec has for some time had rules that prevent building workers from other provinces being employed there, unless they have an--almost unattainable--Quebec certificate of competence and several months' prior employment outside Quebec for the firm that wants to use them inside. The effects are seen at their craziest in Ottawa (Ontario) and its twin, Hull (Quebec), just across a well-bridged river. Economically, the two are a single city, and 4,000 Quebeckers work on Ottawa building sites. Yet the whole of Ontario--it claims--supplies only 350 builders to the entire province of Quebec.
Quebec's neighbours are now fed up. Tiny New Brunswick this year hit back, with laws specifically aimed at Quebec. Big Ontario now plans to do likewise. It has already, in September, brought in rules that bar Quebec contractors and even building materials from projects financed by the provincial government (as well as banning subsidies for purchases of Quebec-made buses). A new provincial bill tabled on November 25th would bar Quebec workers from any Ontario building site, public or private.
The aim is deterrence: a negotiated retreat by Quebec, not a tit-for-tat trade war. It may work: Quebec in recent weeks had already made some small concessions. But maybe Mr Chretien, before he remarks on the moats around Bill Clinton's markets, should try bolting together the fractured beams in his own.","So with NAFTA safely accepted by Congress in Washington , all is sweetness and free trade in North America , is it ?

Mr Parizeau had made a solid alliance with the (federal) Bloc Quebecois, which swept 54 of Quebec's 75 seats in last October's federal election, and the Bloc's leader, Lucien Bouchard, was making the most of his outpost in Ottawa as leader of Her Majesty's loyal opposition to argue the case for Quebec's sovereignty.

Mr Bouchard, a former ambassador and then environment minister in Ottawa under Brian Mulroney--they split over constitutional issues, and in 1990 he set up the Bloc--has built up a solid public stature. His fledgling MPS have been swift to take wing in debates. They deliver well researched speeches, and keep close formation over such unfamiliar terrain as ex-Yugoslavia and Canada's 2,000-plus troops there. At the same time, they use phrases such as ""Canada and Quebec"" to imply that separation has practically occurred.
On a visit to New York and Washington this month, Mr Bouchard made plain that sovereignty meant real separation from Canada, though he assured the 11 congressmen he met that it would be amicably done.
He also developed the argument that separation was necessary for economic as much as cultural reasons, representing Canada's present set-up as an inefficient mess impeding the progress of Quebec.
Canada's prime minister, Jean Chretien, welcomed his frankness in using ""the real word, separation,"" instead of the soft one, ""sovereignty"". If the Quebec election and any subsequent referendum are fought on the clear issue of separation and argued on economic grounds, it will be a bold departure from the 1980 referendum there, when a convoluted question about ""sovereignty-association"" was defeated, with a 20% main, by voters fearful of the economic consequences. Whether honesty and boldness will pay is less clear. The chairman of the New York Power Authority has said New York is ""awash"" with power, and has recommended cancelling a $5 billion contract with Hydro-Quebec. This could delay the second, hue stage of Quebec's James Bay hydro-power scheme.
On his side, Mr Johnson has shown frankness beyond the style of his predecessor, Robert Bourassa, in declaring himself a forthright federalist who does not want to extract more powers from Ottawa. His Liberals recently lost one by-election to the PQ in a seat they had held for 37 years; but they promptly won a PQ seat in return. Opinion polls now put them back level with the PQ
That still suggests a PQ victory in the provincial election, since so much of the Liberal vote is concentrated in the island of Montreal. But a third party, Action Democratique de Quebec, has just been launched.

But Canada's voters expect a new party in office to make a serious review of foreign relations. When the Liberals under Jean Chretien swept to power last October, Mr Chretien promised just that, and as public a review as possible. It is now under way.
The start came last month, when Mr Chretien assembled 120 experts from universities, companies and voluntary agencies--plus a few retired generals--in Ottawa's old railway station, now a conference centre. He in person started them off, without telling them which way to face. But he left a hint. When he flew off that afternoon to Mexico on a trade mission, he by-passed Washington. After six months as prime minister, he has not been there yet.
There is good reason, the Liberals say, for a thoroughgoing review. As the cold war ended, Canada began withdrawing its last troops and aircraft from Europe, only to send peacekeepers back to ex-Yugoslavia. The country faces a foreign debt of some C$200 billion ($145 billion), and is searching the world for new export markets to help finance it. Having produced a federal budget in February which, even with cuts, forecast a deficit of more than C$39 billion, the government is under pressure for more cuts in both defence and foreign aid. It also assures environmentalists that it takes very seriously the action plan--Agenda 21--from the Rio summit two years ago. It lines up with voluntary agencies in demanding a proper concern for human rights. All these aims and obligations are being thrown into the mix. Nothing is taboo, says the foreign minister, Andre Ouellet.
He is getting plenty of advice. At the Ottawa forum, some leading businessmen argued that Latin America's markets rather than East Asia's were Canada's best hope of escaping its dependence on the United States. Everyone agreed--well, said they did--that aid must be separate from trade. Little was said about the European Union, and most of those who spoke about Canada's remaining links to NATO suggested they might wither away rather than be cut formally. In the background lay a radical document from a group of notables called the Canada 21 Council, arguing against keeping large forces of fighter aircraft and anti-submarine frigates, and for training many more peacekeeping troops.
Two parliamentary committees began raking over these points this week. They may find it hard to make a coherent whole of them. Defence won a battle over foreign affairs in getting a separate committee for its concerns, and it is unclear whether the main committee will rasp the thorny issue of immigration policy; no small lacuna, of it is left out, given the government's target of 250,000 immigrants this year.
The main opposition party, the Bloc Quebecois, is firmly pro-American, while the Liberals are eager to take a more independent line after the Mulroney era. Mr Ouellet has already taken two steps independently of the United States, in announcing that Canada will ratify the Law of the Sea Convention this year and in urging his American counterpart, Warren Christopher, to forget old quarrels and integrate Cuba into the hemispheric family.
What real difference will it all make? In the end, for all the fine words in the old railway station and in committee rooms, foreign policy will probably still be made by the officials around the finance minister, Paul Martin.

The Parti Quebecois (PQ) leader, Jacques Parizeau, has forthrightly called himself ""a sovereigntist [supporter of Quebec independence] before, during and after the election"", unlike the first PQ leader, Rene Levesque, who held (and lost) a referendum in 1980 on a vague concept that he called ""sovereignty-association"". In the opposing trenches, the province's Liberal premier, Daniel Johnson, has declared himself ""a Canadian first and foremost""; his wary Liberal predecessor, Robert Bourassa, used to refer to ""profitable federalism"", suggesting that, if ever Quebec's place in Canada were to turn unprofitable, he too might think it time to decamp.
Though pollsters put support for independence at only around the 1980 referendum level of 40%, Mr Parizeau is expected to triumph in Monday's battle. Seemingly beyond hope at the start, Mr Johnson has fought a spirited campaign, accusing the PQ of wanting to lead Quebec into a mist of uncertainty about the costs of independence, rather than tackle practical tasks like unemployment and debt. And for a time the Liberal counter-attack gained round. But a poll published on September 6th gave the PQ 49% of decided voters, the Liberals, surprisingly, only 38%, with the rest going mainly to a minor party led by breakaway Liberals with Quebec-nationalist leanings. If those figures prove correct, the PQ can hope for at least 85 of the 125 seats in what Quebec already calls its National Assembly.
If only 40% of Quebeckers want independence, why is the PQ doing so well? The answer is the Liberals' nine years of power, and the long recession that this included. The ruling party was visibly exhausted when the ailing Mr Bourassa retired last winter. Half the cabinet chose not to fight again. Mr Johnson had little time to reinvigorate his troops. And the provincial economy only really got moving again this summer.
In the sole television debate between the two leaders, Mr Parizeau made much of the economy: why, for instance, has Montreal 100,000 fewer jobs today than before the recession? This sort of question, and the length of hospital waiting lists, have ranked as election issues quite as high as Mr Johnson's warnings--fiercely disputed by Mr Parizeau, with equal barrages of figures--about the costs of separating from Canada.
Quebec's language laws, often a source of contention in the past 20 years, have barely figured in the campaign, though early on Mr Johnson raised the fear that a PQ victory would prompt an exodus of English-speaking Quebeckers. This in fact seems unlikely. In the 15 years after the PQ took power in 1976, some 250,000 of them did leave. Those who remain, about 9% of the province's 6.8m people, can mostly work comfortably in French. Still, Liberal support is concentrated notably in areas, like the western half of Montreal, lived in by these and other Quebeckers for whom French is not their mother-tongue.
The question is whether, having won the battle, Mr Parizeau could win the war. He says he will first put through the National Assembly a ""solemn declaration"" that Quebec's people desire independence. In 1995 he will call a referendum on the issue, whether or not Quebec, the federal government and the other nine provinces have negotiated a break-up agreement by then.
Would a referendum get through? Certainly things look easier for the PQ than in 1980. In the Bloc Quebecois it has a strong ally in the federal parliament; and the federal government is headed by a prime minister, Jean Chretien, whose standing in Quebec is shaky compared with the then towering figure of Pierre Trudeau.
Though its top three men-prime minister, foreign minister and finance minister--are Quebeckers, the federal government has taken virtually no part in the election. Mr Chertien decided to hold his fire until the campaign for sovereignty begins in earnest. It is not clear, though, what he will do then. A counter-referendum, for instance, or a series of federal/provincial meetings to show up Mr Parizeau as unco-operative--both would have their hazards. So would a blank refusal to contemplate any negotiations, while waiting hopefully for Mr Parizeau to make mistakes.
The provincial premiers too--like the general public outside Quebec--have kept quiet during the final weeks of the election campaign. The premiers were noticeably coy about promising any action to protect Indian rights in the event of a break-up, though vast areas of northern Quebec are peopled-so far as they are peopled at all--mostly by Cree Indians. The removal of some barriers that face building contractors trying to do business across provincial boundaries, and an agreement that the premiers will meet regularly on their own to discuss national issues, may weaken Mr Parizeau's case, but not his resolve.
He will still have to convince a majority of Quebeckers. Polls show that almost 60% of them want a referendum, while nearly half favour the ""solemn declaration"", and would want a PQ government to get on with drafting an independence constitution and seeking negotiations with Ottawa. These high figures may look good news for Mr Parizeau. More plausibly, they suggest that, while many Quebeckers want the sovereignty issue settled one way or another, the aim for quite a number is to get rid of it.","NOT since Wolfe defeated Montcalm have the battle lines in Quebec been so clearly drawn as they have during the provincial campaign that culminates on September 12th .

In contrast, the countries of Eastern and Central Europe no longer talk of normality as an aspiration but rather an achievement. Last year Dusan Slobodnik, Slovakia's minister of culture, said: ""We are not...totalitarians. We are a normal nation."" Vaclav Klaus, the Czech prime minister, insisted cheerfully that ""the Czech Republic is no loner a post-communist country in transition. Now we're a normal country."" Back in 1991 Jan Krszystof Bielecki, Poland's prime minister, promised to make his ""a normal country"". His successor, Hanna Suchocka, said that she too wanted Poland to be ""a normal country"". The pair did good work: the New York Times wrote in July that ""Poland is becoming a more normal nation.""
West Europeans also want to stand in in a crowd. Spain's prime minister, Felipe Gonzalez, declared in 1992: ""My heartfelt desire for many years of my life was that Spain should be considered a normal country."" He should feel satisfied: the Financial Times wrote last year that, by and large, ""Spain is the most normal of countries."" Italians crave the same: ""Three years ago,"" points out Beppe Sevelgnini, an Italian journalist, ""Italians decided they had had enough. They wanted a normal country."" As the song goes and Italians have discovered, you can't always get what you want.

Similarly, Israel's deputy foreign minister, Yossi Beilin, said shortly after the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement: ""Suddenly, becoming a normal country is very, very strange for us.""
Ordinariness is breaking out in some other extraordinary places. But that, it turns out, may be nothing to boast about after all.

Their ""Folk of the Sea"" choir took a larger catch with sea shanties from a sellout audience than they could have with their nets: a point not lost, maybe, on Senator Allan MacEachen, the powerful co-chairman of the committee, who has long argued that a country's image is better projected by its cultural exports--singers, writers, artists--than by politicians or even peacekeepers.
To the bewilderment of some, the senator--a former foreign minister under Pierre Trudeau--included in the report a full chapter on this topic, arguing that the projection of Canada's culture abroad should be a fundamental dimension of its foreign policy. Already, the report argued, this is the better-than-boring image by which Canada is best known abroad today--and rightly.
If some were bewildered, the Bloc Quebecois was roundly upset.

The aid programme, to a unique degree expressing Canadian values and ideals--""the bright side of our national character""--should be kept firmly apart from trade promotion.

Their ""Folk of the Sea"" choir took a larger catch with sea shanties from a sellout audience than they could have with their nets: a point not lost, maybe, on Senator Allan MacEachen, the powerful co-chairman of the committee, who has long argued that a country's image is better projected by its cultural exports--singers, writers, artists--than by politicians or even peacekeepers.
To the bewilderment of some, the senator--a former foreign minister under Pierre Trudeau--included in the report a full chapter on this topic, arguing that the projection of Canada's culture abroad should be a fundamental dimension of its foreign policy. Already, the report argued, this is the better-than-boring image by which Canada is best known abroad today--and rightly.
If some were bewildered, the Bloc Quebecois was roundly upset.

Do you hear a giant sucking sound of jobs and investment disappearing from the United States across the Rio Grande to Mexico, as predicted by Ross Perot in the great argument over the North American Free-Trade Agreement? A different noise is in the air: the hubbub of politicians singing the praises of trade liberalisation.
In Indonesia last month, America and other Asia-Pacific countries pledged to achieve free trade in the region over the next 25 years. Last week, Congress at last approved the GATT deal. At the Summit of the Americas in Miami on December 11th, Bill Clinton, together with Canada's prime minister, Jean Chretien, and Mexico's new president, Ernesto Zedillo, are expected to announce their intention to welcome Chile as the next member of the NAFTA club. And it seems a club worth joining: NAFTA, the politicians boast, is proving to be a triumph.
""Facts are proving NAFTA right,"" said Mr Zedillo during a recent visit to Washington. The agreement is turning out to be ""a win-win situation"", with extra jobs on all 3 sides, said Lloyd Bentsen, the departing treasury secretary, this week. Boosters for the agreement are already explaining how it demonstrates that rich countries need not fear free trade with poor neighbours (West Europeans wary of opening their markets to the ex-communist East, please note).
In fact, it is still early days for NAFTA, too early to draw confident conclusions from the experience to date. Its influence is hard to disentangle from that of other economic policies, and from the effects on trade of America's current boom (unemployment down to 5.8%, GDP growing at an annual rate of nearly 4%) and of Mexico's recovery this year (growth resumed in the second quarter, after a year-long recession). Larry Summers, the number-two at the Treasury Department, thinks that NAFTA's main impact this year has been to halt capital flight from Mexico and save the country from disaster. And some of the growth in trade is simply the result of diversion from regions, such as the Caribbean, with which bigger barriers remain. That said, the people who fought for the agreement have reason to be pleased with the first year's figures.
America's trade with Canada and Mexico has expanded at about twice the rate of trade with non-NAFTA countries in the first nine months of this year compared with the same period in 1993. American exports to Mexico grew by 22% and imports from Mexico rose by 23% (see chart); America's surplus on this trade edged up to $1.8 billion. Sales to Mexico and Canada account for some 60% of America's export growth this year.
Anti-NAFTA campaigners warned of doom for America's car industry. It turns out that Detroit is working flat out and that American car exports to Mexico have zoomed by nearly 500% in the first eight months of this year. Large rises in exports have also been seen for products ranging from semiconductors (up 98%) to apples (up 74%). The Commerce Department estimates that the surge in exports to Mexico this year has secured 130,000 American jobs.
Such estimates, based as they are on some rather big assumptions, ought not to be taken too seriously. But, contrary to the dire predictions of Mr Perot and others, American jobs and investment have clearly not been disappearing down a southern sink. Foreign investment in Mexico grew by 20% in the first eight months of this year, no faster than the 24% annual growth in 1990-93. As for NAFTA-related job losses, by early November just over 12,000 Americans had qualified for help under the special Transitional Adjustment Assistance programme run by the Department of Labour; some two-thirds of these related to trade with Mexico and one-third with Canada. That is a drop in the ocean. Over the same period, some 3.5m more American jobs were created than were lost.
So far, so good for NAFTA, it would seem. Yet its opponents have not fallen silent. They not only pass over the boon to consumers as imports bring down prices. They also tend to be oblivious to the fact that imports as well as exports help create jobs, by freeing resources at home. They note that imports from Mexico are expanding slightly faster than exports to Mexico, and conclude that this is costing America jobs.
A recent staff study by the Joint Economic Committee of the House of Representatives is a fine example of this muddled thinking. It assumes that ""the overall effect of trade on employment is determined by the difference between exports (which create jobs) and imports (which eliminate jobs)."" Based on their estimate of America's trade balance with Mexico, the economic committee staff reckon that trade with Mexico has cost America 10,000 jobs this year. ""If that's the level of economic expertise floating around the Congress,"" says Jeffrey Schott of the staunchly Pro-NAFTA Institute for International Economics, ""then no wonder we have a $4 trillion debt.""
The bizarre depth to which discussion of the costs and benefits can sink is illustrated by another critical report on NAFTA's first year, published this week by the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington and the Centre for Urban Economic Development at the University of Illinois. ""NAFTA has not led to the creation of the 100,000 jobs promised by the Clinton administration,"" it says. ""We can find evidence of only 535."" Senseless as such assertions maybe, they do reflect a problem inherent in the politics of NAFTA and other trade-liberalising efforts. The benefits are to be counted mainly at the broad, macroeconomic level (and, over time, the effect is on the quality of jobs, not their quantity). The costs, on the otherhand, are painfully visible in laid-off workers and factory closures.
NAFTA certainly does not come without such costs. As the IPS report points out, the 12,000-plus certified job losses are probably just the tip of an iceberg. Spot checks at unemployment offices by the trade-union federation, the AFL-CIO, suggest that many workers are unaware of the help available for NAFTA-related lay-offs. The companies hardest hit by NAFTA's tariff eliminations tend to be small manufacturers producing low-tech products. Workers from the clothing industry (where 70% of the workforce are women) account for nearly one-third of all recipients of special NAFTA assistance. Manufacturing plants in rural areas, where alternative jobs are hard to find, seem to have been disproportionately affected by the agreement.
Harsh as these job losses are, they are also evidence that NAFTA is working, as trade theory says it should, to create a more efficient division of labour between the countries involved. In an effort to assuage the fears of the anti-NAFTA coalition of trade-unionists, environmentalists and congressional protectionists, Mr Clinton tacked on side agreements on labour and the environment. Even after a relatively benign start for the agreement, the misgivings of the antis remain deep and the pressure to wrap labour and environmental guarantees into future trade-liberalising deals is strong.
But the pressure to do nothing of the sort is now even stronger, after the Republican takeover of Congress. Early next year Mr Clinton will ask Congress for renewed fast-track negotiating authority for trade, not least so that he can press ahead with his plans for Chile. On December 5th, Republican leaders in the House of Representatives--including Newt Gingrich, Dick Armey and Bill Archer--fired their opening shot in a letter to Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative. They are in favour of fast-track authority, they say, as Mr Clinton moves to expand the agreement to other countries in the hemisphere. But they insist that labour and environmental issues should be kept strictly separate.
With the GATT and NAFTA deals done, and with serious intentions for trade liberalisation in the Asia-Pacific region and now in South America too, Mr Clinton has a trade-policy record to be proud of. More GATT-plus deals such as NAFTA (the only sort that make sense) are on the horizon. But to turn them into reality the president will have to swallow hard, burn some more Democratic brides and agree to deal on the Republicans' terms.","LISTEN carefully .

He set out to prove it on December 7th, when he tabled in what the province already calls its National Assembly a draft bill whose first article bluntly declares Quebec to be a sovereign state.
The bill sketches a trouble-free road ahead. Quebeckers will continue to use the Canadian dollar and can keep their Canadian passports. Quebec will abide by present Canadian treaties, so, in particular, slipping into membership of the North American Free-Trade Agreement without further negotiation.
It sounds like a joy-ride. Other Canadian politicians have been quick to point out the pot-holes. Even before Mr Parizeau revealed his bill, the separatist cause suffered a nasty blow when his ally in the federal parliament, the Bloc Quebecois leader, Lucien Bouchard, was struck down by the rare and horrible condition called necrotising myositis. Against the odds, Montreal doctors saved his life with four operations on December 1st, amputating his left leg at the thigh and digging into his chest to clear it of the flesh-eating bacteria.
Mr Bouchard, the most popular politician in Quebec, and widely respected elsewhere, was well prepared to back the provincial campaign for sovereignty by leading his 53 members of parliament, the official opposition in Ottawa, in a lively attack on the wastefulness of the federal system. He is now recovering, with none of his spirit lost, it seems. Between operations he managed to scribble a note ""Que l'on continue!"" (""Carry on!""), which may have been a message to his doctors but was seized on by supporters as a rallying cry for sovereignty. His doctors suggest he could be back to active politics within four months. By then his ordeal--which, to the surprise of many, brought him a wave of sympathy nationwide--may be a political asset. Meanwhile his Bloc Quebecois is left without a substitute leader of any stature.
Back in Quebec, Mr Parizeau revealed how he plans to go ahead with his draft bill. He will consult Quebeckers throuh 15 regional commissions before revising it, and then put the result to them in a referendum. He even gave the precise words of the question: ""Are you in favour of the act passed by the National Assembly declaring the sovereignty of Quebec, yes or no?""
It looks straightforward, certainly more so than the complicated question on sovereignty-plus-economic-association that the first PQ government posed in 1980 (and lost). But in fact the bill--of dubious legality--that voters will be asked to judge is essentially a wish-list of the links a sovereign Quebec might have with its neighbours. Sheila Copps, Canada's deputy prime minister, called it a fraud. New Brunswick's premier, Frank McKenna, accused Mr Parizeau of trying to take Quebec out of Canada by trickery.
Still, as his opponents acknowledge, Mr Parizeau's tactics are clever. After the failure in 1990 of the Meech Lake constitutional accord, the Belanger-Campeau commission toured Quebec and produced a report calling for major concessions from the rest of Canada if Quebec were not to secede. Mr Parizeau, in contrast, will set up 15 local commissions, so minimising the effect of federalist opinion, which is heavily concentrated in Montreal (that is why, though PQ and Liberals ran neck-and-neck in the popular vote in September, the PQ took 87 provincial seats to the Liberals' 47). He will also invite all Quebec's MPS and National Assembly members to sit on these commissions--and lo, about 140 of the 200 of them are sovereigntists.
To make trebly sure, the commissions will explain the draft bill and invite amendments; in effect--like the car salesman jumping to ""Do you want it red or blue, Sir?""--asking voters how to make sovereignty work, instead of debating the broader merits of separating from Canada at all.
The Quebec Liberal leader, Daniel Johnson, calls these consultations a propaganda ploy, and says his parliamentarians will take no part. So Mr Parizeau may have the field clear until mid-March, when the commissions are due to report.
How should the federal government react? Ms Copps has talked of a parallel commission to consult other parts of Canada. So far, the federal strategy has been to avoid any direct clash with Quebec separatists, even buying off incipient quarrels over the closing of a military college and the costs of the 1992 referendum (in which Canada as a whole turned down a special deal for Quebec), while it gets on with the business of cutting the federal deficit and the numbers of jobless; in otherwords, of making the Canadian federation a working success. The prime minister, Jean Chretien, who is not popular in his native Quebec, has kept busy leading provincial premiers--all but Mr Parizeau--on a trade mission to China, and addressing the French Senate; both mandeuvres offering a political pay-off at home. But at some point he will have to confront Mr Parizeau.
Mr Parizeau has set no date for his referendum, except to confirm that it will come next year. The timetable for his commissions makes June possible (which would upset Mr Chretien as he prepares for the next G7 summit in Halifax, Nova Scotia); or it might be delayed until September.
One reason for Mr Parizeau's vagueness is to keep the federalists guessing as long as possible. Another is that Mr Bouchard and he disagree on tactics. Mr Bouchard believes the referendum should wait until events and opinion polls look most favourable. Just before he went into hospital, he spoke of this being ""the last fight"". For separatists of his era--he is 55--because another defeat would end the idea for a generation. In contrast, Mr Parizeau has suggested a series of referendums until separatism wins. The 1980 provincial referendum was lost by a margin of 40 to 60. A recent opinion poll put support for sovereignty in Quebec at 46%. Mr Parizeau, now alone in charge, may decide to make a dash for it.","LONG before he led his separatist Parti Quebecois to victory in the provincial elections in September , Jacques Parizeau was arguing that Quebec 's road to independence could -- indeed , would -- be smooth , swift and painless .

But President Bill Clinton let two years pass without visiting Ottawa, and Canada's prime minister, Jean Chretien, has gone almost everywhere except Washington. Spin-doctors have been keen to point out that the two men have met six times at various summits, and that Canada's competent ambassador in Washington is the prime minister's nephew. Anyway, if there is ice, Mr Clinton is breaking it with a visit to the Canadian capital on February 23rd and 24th.
Such coolness as there is derives from fish and country music. Canada's west-coast fishermen are suffering from the mysterious non-appearance last year of 3m sockeye salmon that were due to spawn in the Fraser river system, and are sharply watching American vessels that have fished out stocks off Washington and Oregon. The country-music videos are part of an intricate free-trade argument, stirred up (Canadians suspect) by Mickey Kantor, America's trade representative.
It began when Canada's broadcasting regulators removed a station owned by Westinghouse, an American firm, from the list of authorised cable services, licensing a new Canadian network in its place. The Americans have long resented the exclusion of ""cultural products"", their second-largest export, from their free-trade agreement with Canada. In retaliation, Canadian videos are being dropped from a station in Nashville that boasts some 40m viewers..
On sovereignty for Quebec, Mr Clinton will need to pick his words carefully. Lucien Bouchard, chief of the separatist Bloc Quebecois, will meet the president in his capacity as leader of the opposition in the federal parliament. Mr Bouchard has just lost a leg to a rare infection, and has everybody's sympathy.

The Bloc Quebecois has been careful not to annoy the Americans. It has unswervingly opposed any resolutions in the House of Commons that might upset them, including one to ban the testing of cruise missiles over Canada, and another to restore full trade and aid with Cuba. The Bloc began to grumble only when Mr Clinton's treasury proposed raising some $400m a year by charging people crossing the undefended border. Trade would be free, but movement expensive; that's unfriendly.","WHEN newly elected , American and Canadian leaders usually hasten to congratulate each other on sharing the world 's longest undefended border . But President Bill Clinton let two years pass without visiting Ottawa , and Jean Chretien's has gone almost everywhere except Washington . Spin - doctors have been keen to point out that the two men have met six times at various summits , and that Canada 's competent ambassador in Washington is Jean Chretien's nephew . Anyway , if there is ice , Mr Clinton is breaking it with a visit to the Canadian capital on February 23rd and 24th . 
 Such coolness as there is derives from fish and country music . Canada 's west - coast fishermen are suffering from the mysterious non - appearance last year of 3 m sockeye salmon that were due to spawn in the Fraser river system , and are sharply watching American vessels that have fished out stocks off Washington and Oregon . The country - music videos are part of an intricate free - trade argument , stirred up ( Canadians suspect ) by Mickey Kantor , America 's trade representative . 
 It began when Canada 's broadcasting regulators removed a station owned by Westinghouse , an American firm , from the list of authorised cable services , licensing a new Canadian network in its place . The Americans have long resented the exclusion of "" cultural products "" , their second - largest export , from their free - trade agreement with Canada . In retaliation , Canadian videos are being dropped from a station in Nashville that boasts some 40 m viewers .. 
 On sovereignty for Quebec , Mr Clinton will need to pick his words carefully . Lucien Bouchard , chief of the separatist Bloc Quebecois , will meet the president in his capacity as leader of the opposition in the federal parliament . Mr Bouchard has just lost a leg to a rare infection , and has everybody 's sympathy .

THE Quebec separatist movement has fallen into disarray, and the threat that the province might this year vote itself out of the Canadian federation is on the wane. It is a testing moment for the leader of the Parti Quebecois (PQ), Jacques Parizeau--and one of the testers is his own ally in the federal Parliament, Lucien Bouchard.
Mr Parizeau was elected premier of Quebec last September. He mapped out a short, swift route to independence for the province, starting with a provincial referendum before Quebec's ""national"" day on June 24th this year. But on April 5th Mr Parizeau glumly announced that the referendum was to be postponed until the autumn; Quebec's people were not ready for independence. Two days later, Mr Bouchard, whose Bloc Quebecois (BQ) members are the largest opposition group in the federal Parliament, suggested at his party's convention that the referendum might be put off until as late as 1999--the final year of the PQ's provincial mandate--if that would ensure its success. Mr Bouchard went on to speak of a bold new vision, of Canada and Quebec being associated like countries in the European Union. Mr Parizeau at once retorted that he would insist on the referendum being held this year. Further questioning of Mr Bouchard left reporters in doubt whether, in those circumstances, he would lead his BQ troops into wholehearted support of his provincial ally's campaign.
Mr Bouchard has always been leery of a rushed referendum; Mr Parizeau remembers how the PQ left a previous referendum until the fourth year of its then mandate, 1980, and lost. The longer it waits, the less popular a government becomes, he fears.
His trouble is that his energetic efforts to stoke up enthusiasm for independence have not set Quebec afire. The 15 commissions that toured every corner of the province in February to do this job under the guise of hearing the people's views had to report that they heard little interest in independence but plenty of comment on local problems. Even Quebec's actors and singers, once so active in the cause of sovereignty, had lost their passion.
Opinion polls have given Mr Parizeau no comfort either. Backing for sovereignty has not risen above 45% among Quebeckers, despite the return to active politics of the popular Mr Bouchard, after losing a leg to bacterial infection. To make things worse, Bernard Landry, the province's deputy premier, who has a military background, has told Mr Parizeau he has no wish to be ""second-in-command of the Light Brigade"".
The federal Liberal government under Jean Chretien has so far played a waiting game, successfully. It won a useful by-election against the BQ in February, and has brought an influential Quebecker, Lucienne Robillard, into a cabinet already dominated by men from that province. Mr Chretien (he is one of them) has left it to independent researchers to publish tracts exposing the fallacies in the PQ's draft legislation. Among the PQ's promises are an assurance that an independent Quebec would have no problem keeping a common currency with the rest of Canada, and another pledging dual nationality for its citizens.
Mr Chretien's tactics are to goad Mr Parizeau into keeping his promise of an early referendum on a straightforward question, while keeping his own fingers crossed that meanwhile no bigot stamps on Quebec's fleur-de-lys flag or otherwise inflames opinion there. But he has given no hint of any new deal for Quebec as a reward for rejecting sovereignty; and, as Mr Parizeau argued, he is unlikely to be excited by the European Union model. Some time this year, Mr Chretien will have to offer some alternative to the present version of federalism. Meanwhile, he can enjoy watching Mr Parizeau dancing on hot coals.","OTTAWA

AT LAST Quebec's 5m voters know when they will be invited to vote on ""sovereignty"". Jacques Parizeau, leader of the province's separatist Parti Quebecois (PQ) government, this week confirmed the ""probable"" date, October 30th, of his planned referendum. But what question, exactly, will the voters be asked? That will be made public by mid-September--and a trifle less than exact it looks likely to be.
The last PQ referendum--lost, in 1980, by 60% to 40%--talked off negotiating ""sovereignty-association"" with the rest of Canada, The new one will propose a declaration of sovereignty plus an offer promptly to negotiate, you guessed, association, political and economic. It was on this basis that Mr Parizeau and his alley in the federal parliament, Lucien Bouchard, in June won the backing of Mario Dumont, a former Liberal, whose new Action Democratique du Quebec took 6-1/2% of the vote in last year's provincial election. With his votes, the separatists reckon, they would win, and opinion polls suggest they are right.
There's a problem, though. After a divorce, would the rest of Canada agree to shack up again? Mr Parizeau used the annual meeting of the ten provincial premiers on August 24th to advance his argument that negotiating such a deal would not be difficult. He turned up proclaiming free trade, stayed for a session on removing interprovincial barriers to it, told journalists there had been ""an evolution"" in the premiers' thinking about economic links with an independent Quebec, and went home.
The evolution, in fact, was a decision not to say explicitly in their communique that the inter-provincial trade agreement would not apply to an independent Quebec. So irritated were the others by Mr Parizeau's version that, after he left, they toughened the wording to specify that the deal applied only to Canadian provinces and territories. Even so, he did well. He can tell his voters that only sovereignty will persuade anglophone hardliners to come to terms.
The federalists' tactic has been to argue that Canada is a splendid country to live in, which no sensible Quebecker would want to leave. But now they are shifting a little in response to separatist rhetoric about voting for change. Daniel Johnson, who as Liberal leader in Quebec heads the No campaign, has said that, if he again became premier, he would call for recognition of Quebec as ""a distinct society"", with a veto over Canadian constitutional change; terms revived from the Meech Lake accord aborted in 1990. The federal Prime minister, Jean Chretien, who has shown his distaste for any return to the quagmire of constitutional talks, nonetheless closed ranks with him, allowing that in 1997 the premiers would review the (1982) constitution. Since a review after 15 years was built into it, this was hardly new; but some still saw it as a concession.
When the campaign proper begins, the federalist line is likely to toughen, with reminders of Mr Parizeau's remark in July to a couple of European ambassadors that, once a majority of Quebeckers vote Yes, they will be ""like lobsters in a trap""--that is, that if negotiations for association were to fail, he would take the province to independence without further consultation.
Meanwhile, Mr Parizeau faces a reminder that there are others in his province who can claim that theirs is a distinct society: the Cree Indians and the Inuit of northern Quebec, numbering about 18,000. Their traditional territory, by area one-third of the province, was attached to Quebec only in 1912. They intend to hold their own votes on self-determination and on remaining part of Canada just before Mr Parizeau's referendum. In a similar vote in 1980, the Inuit voted 87% against separation from Canada. They hope a repetition of that vote will aid Mr Parizeau's opponents.","OTTAWA

For the separatist Jacques Parizeau, it has been a nonstop campaign since his Pari Quebecois (PQ) won the provincial election a year ago. By the time he tabled the referendum question and the sovereignty bill, complete with a lengthy and (above) splendidly florid preamble, in Quebec's legislature on September 7th, the separatists had picked up enough momentum to have a slight lead in opinion polls. Not many Canadians really believe Quebeckers will vote, on October 30th, to separate. But suppose they do?
Canada's Liberal prime minister, Jean Chretien, refuses to answer hypothetical questions, merely warning Quebec's 4.9m voters that a Yes vote would be ""a one-way ticket to separation"".. Does that mean the federal government would spurn the detailed offer of political and economic ""parnership"" even now beings prepared by Quebec officials for negotiation in the (probably) 12 months before a declaration of sovereignty would take effet? The offer, promised in the refrendum question, is the carrot with which Mr Parizeau hopes to win over the ""soft nationalists"" who last autumn voted for Mario Dumont's newly minted party, Action Democratique du Quebec, and who could swing the day.
The answer is that Mr Chretien has decided the best tactic is to keep the choice as stark and simple as possible. A large minority of those who tell pollsters they expect to vote Yes believe Quebec will still be part of Canada, with a common citizenship and currency but with political clout equal to the other nine provinces combined. The federalists aim to sweep away this confused wishfulness without being so native as to reinforce the PQ argument that it and its allies are the party of change, while Ottawa stands merely for the status quo.
So the federalists will focus on the beneficial changes in Quebec since an earlier ""sovereignty-association"" vote was taken (and defeated) in 1980: economic power moving solidly into the hands of francophone firms, business administration graduates flooding the province, an increased sense of security over the French language, control over immigration and many other administrative powers shifting from Ottawa. The trouble is that this quiet evolution, while more meaningful, is less headline-catching than struggles over constitutional change. If Mr Chretien were to promise Quebeckers a new deal as a reward for voting No--as Pierre Trudeau did in 1980--he would not be believed; two constitutional accords have already, in the end, come to nothing. So he has ignored the call for minor constitutional changes from Daniel Johnson, leader of Quebec's Liberals, who in theory heads the No campaign.
Federalists find comfort in the fact, proven several times in Canada, that most of the don't knows or won't says in opinion polls, in the end vote--if they vote at all--for what is familiar. This seems especially true of women, who make up the majority of the 15% of Quebec voters still in this category. Both sides have placed women ministers in the forefront of their battle-line, to rally these important waverers; Mr Chretien went to the length of handing a plum ambassadorial post to an obscure Montreal member of Parliament in order to open a seat for his champion, Lucienne Robillard.
Mr Parizeau has a key supporter in the 25-year-old, ex-Liberal Mr Dumont, a man right in the middle of the age-group that hardly realises the changes benefiting Quebec since 1980 and likeliest to favour radical change, however ill-defined. Meanwhile, Lucien Bouchard, leader of the Bloc Quebecois in the federal parliament, is warning federalists that the separatists will never give up, even if they lose this time.

Do its people--nearly all of them English-speakers--imply not care?
They do, in fact, care deeply. But most of them reckon that the outcome on October 30th will be about the same as in 1980, when Quebeckers rejected a complex notion called ""sovereignty-association"" by 60% to 40%. Opinion polls in Quebec, the west knows, are closer than that today, but still give the federalists a lead: the latest poll found 55% saying No to separation against 45% saying Yes.
For more than 30 years Quebec nationalists have brandished the threat of secession, and westerners are weary of it. Rafe Mair, a Vancouver radio talk-show host, sums up their response: ""We want Quebeckers to make up their goddamn minds once and for all: in or out."" The separatists' new version--sovereignty plus a commitment to negotiate what they now call ""partnership""--cuts no ice in the west.
So if Quebec does decide to separate, westerners say let it go. They believe that more than enough has been done to placate Quebec nationalism: from official bilingualism to immigration. A separate Quebec would suffer a harsh drop in living standards, say various economic studies, but, after a brief setback, the rest of Canada would get by nicely.
Their calm screens the deep discontent that the western provinces--Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia--feel about the federal government's favouritism towards Quebec. ""Western Canada sees Quebec as the spoilt child of confederation,"" says Angus Reid, a national opinion pollster. There have been regular flare-ups at the way Quebec is given more than its share of defence contracts, public works, federal programmes and institutions; and unequal administrative and financial arrangements. Westerners want no more attempts to buy off separatism.
Witness a confrontation in Parliament on September 19th. The prime minister, Jean Chretien, expected a clash with the separatist Bloc Quebecois. What he got was one with the hard western ""either in or out"" line of the federalist Reform Party, all but one of whose 52 seats are from the west. How would the government interpret Quebec's vote? Mr Chretien had earlier said a Yes vote would be ""a one-way ticket to separation."" Later he hedged, saying there is ""no mechanism in the constitution for separation."" So what did he mean, asked Reform's leader, Preston Manning, bluntly: let him ""state unequivocally"" that a majority, be it of just one vote, in the referendum would mean that Quebec was on its way out.
Mr Chretien's reply, that he would not necessarily be bound by a narrow Yes victory, dismayed westerners. Those--which means most--who want Quebec to stay, fear this sort of dithering may encourage Quebec's ""soft nationalists"" to believe that even a Yes majority would not real mean separation, merely serve as a bigger lever to prise still more concessions from the federal government. And that, a new move in the old game, is almost as unacceptable to the west as sovereignty-partnership.
A Canada-Quebec partnership may be an appealing idea to many Quebeckers, especially the soft nationalists. But 67% of English-speaking Canadians oppose, it, according to one poll. All four western provincial premiers have flatly rejected the idea that a sovereign Quebec should continue to enjoy the full benefits of inter-provincial free trade.
Ironically, western hardliners may yet prove Quebec's allies--and vice versa. They want more power decentralised to the provinces. Quebec may vote firmly to stay inside, but its nationalism will not go away. Centre and provinces alike will have to take a fresh look at the overall balance of power.
But there is a problem. To most French-speakers today's Canada consists of two societies, which should be treated as equal (though they are not); hence Quebec, as the voice of the French-speaking society, has a right of veto. To most English-speakers, that is nonsense: Canada consists of ten provinces, not of equal weight but of equal status, each entitled to the same rights and powers as others, not less--but not more. These rival views have bedevilled past constitutional negotiations. Reconciling them will be no easier this time.","VANCOUVER -- WITH three weeks to go before Quebec votes on whether or not to split the country apart , western Canada has shown little interest .

All four western provincial premiers have flatly rejected the idea that a sovereign Quebec should continue to enjoy the full benefits of inter - provincial free trade . 
 Ironically , western hardliners may yet prove Quebec 's allies -- and vice versa . They want more power decentralised to the provinces . Quebec may vote firmly to stay inside , but its nationalism will not go away . Centre and provinces alike will have to take a fresh look at the overall balance of power . 
 But there is a problem . To most French - speakers today 's Canada consists of two societies , which should be treated as equal ( though they are not ) ; hence Quebec , as the voice of the French - speaking society , has a right of veto . To most English - speakers , that is nonsense : Canada consists of ten provinces , not of equal weight but of equal status , each entitled to the same rights and powers as others , not less -- but not more . These rival views have bedevilled past constitutional negotiations . Reconciling them will be no easier this time .",20,Canada,A29-148,IN TERM,True,"The prime minister , Jean Chretien ,",8,True

THE noes had it this week, so Canada escapes dismemberment. But for how long? Defeated by little more than 1% of the vote this time, the separatists who want to make Quebec an independent French-speaking country will be trying again before long. It is hard to see how they can be bought off. This week's referendum was far from being an affirmation of Canadian unity, and resolves nothing (see page 45).
The separatists are already looking forward to a fresh attempt. Federalists wearily accept that the only way to avoid that is change. But what change, achieved how? Further loosening of the federal government's already loose control, say some of the nine other provinces. But each has its own idea of what that means. During the campaign, Canada's prime minister, Jean Chretien, offered Quebec formal recognition as a ""distinct society"", but this no loner satisfies the separatists: Quebeckers are ""a people"", they say. He also offered Quebec a veto over constitutional change affecting it. That Quebec would like, but the rest of Canada probably would not.
The central difficulty is that most French-speaking Quebeckers feel more affection for Quebec than they do for Canada and, if many of them still vote to stay in Canada, they do so more out of a fear of the unknown than of loyalty to any concept of Canadianism. Moreover, it is hard to see how greater loyalty to such a concept could be fostered, least of all by weakening the federal arrangements of what is already the loosest federation in the world.
The attempt has, after all, been made before. Much of the past ten years has been devoted to drawing up a constitution that both Quebec and the rest of Canada could live with. At one time, in 1987, it looked as though agreement had been reached. But in the event two provinces failed to ratify the deal, and Quebec, which had voted 60-40% to stay in Canada in a referendum in 1980, started to consider separation with renewed interest. Another effort at constitution-making foundered in 1992, after Canada-wide voting showed that Quebec thought it had been offered too little while many in the rest of Canada thought it had been offered too much.
Few are willing to go down this tortuous path again. The western-based Reform Party has a sweeping project whereby, mostly through changes of laws, not the constitution, the federal government would move out of many fields entirely, not least language. But that would not meet separatist demands: laws can always be changed back again. Still less would mere administrative change. The Parliament in Ottawa might agree, say, to hand over to the provinces manpower training, another issue that excites Quebeckers--until it changed its mind again.
The bosom still heaves
All the evidence suggests that Quebec's unhappiness derives not from bad or even remote government but from the desire of a French-speaking people to run their own country. When the Earl of Durham was sent from England in 1838 to investigate grievances in Canada, he ""expected to find a contest between a government and a people""; instead, he found ""two nations warring in the bosom of a single state"". They are still warring, and for the same reason: the French-speakers want to run their own show. Jacques Parizeau, Quebec's separatist premier, admitted as much this week when he put part of the blame for the vote's defeat upon ""the ethnic vote"". Like many a gaffe--he announced his resignation soon after--it was true: 60% of French-speakers want to secede, but that desire is shared by only a handful of Quebec's (varied) minorities.
Though everyone heroically denies it, it is not Quebec that is distinct, but its French-speakers, and they are growing more so. Nationalism in Quebec is rising, especially among the young. In a few years' time, the separatists will probably win, especially if the non-French-speaking minority votes with its feet in the meantime. Unless hearts change all across the country on a hue scale, Canada has been spared break-up on this occasion only to prepare for it on the next.","Quebec 's separatists will succeed next time

Then everything, slowly, went flat. The 8,000, mostly young, French-speakers packed to the roof of Quebec city's ice-hockey arena shifted from thunderous triumph to unease, alarm, quiet gloom, at last defiant despair. As a nail-bitten evening ended on October 30th, Quebec, by one percentage point in a hue 94% turnout, had voted to stay with Canada and--as these separatists saw it--against itself.
Or rather, some not-quite Quebeckers had. A bitter premier, Jacques Parizeau, explained his defeat: ""money 
big business, fairly solidly against him
 and the ethnic vote"". By this he meant the province's 10% of immigrants, who mostly prefer English to French as their adopted tongue (even Montreal's many Haitians and Lebanese do not vote separatist). Plus, though Mr Parizeau did not quite say it, the slightly fewer native English-speakers who--they thought--are an accepted part of Quebec society.
Next day, as the defeated Mr Parizeau announced that at the end of the legislative session he would step down from the leadership of his Parti Quebecois (PQ) the province's premiership and its ""national"" assembly, he apologised for this much jumped-on gaffe. But he insisted that, albeit ill-expressed, it was true. So it is. And this continuing, indeed widening, gap between Quebec's four-fifths majority of French-speakers and the rest--which also means the rest of Canada--explains what has hit that country since the referendum campaign began. It also explains the conundrum that the federal government and the nine other provinces now face: in brief, what is now to be done?
The separatists will be back, and soon; they made that repeatedly plain this week. They have a litany of economic complaints. But their real ones are linguistic: they want total control of Quebec's language law, especially as applied to schools, and of immigration (cosmopolitan Montreal island is less than two-thirds French-speaking). But even if they are given all that, they have the unanswerable demand of un peuple: we want un pays, a country.
Separation has been on the way for decades. To go no further back, it is seven years since Mr Parizeau came to the top of the PQ. Since then, two attempts to satisfy Quebec's constitutional demands (made by Quebec's Liberals, not the PQ) have failed--in essence, because too many of Canada's English-speakers would not wear them. In 1990, Lucien Bouchard, having left the federal cabinet, formed the Bloc Quebecois to fight elections at federal level and in October 1993 led it to a remarkable success, second only to the federal Liberals. Eleven months later it was Mr Parizeau's turn, as he swept the local Liberals out of power in Quebec.
Economics played its part in both elections. But at the root was resurgent French-speaking nationalism, helped in Mr Parizeau's case by a split among Quebec's Liberals, when some walked out to form the soft-nationalist Action Dmocratique party, now led by a 25-year-old, Mario Dumont. ""English"" Canada understood with its head, maybe, what was going on, but not with its heart. It still does not. The referendum campaign has been full of Anglo astonishment that anyone could want to part from a country that is, cliche of the season, ""the envy of the world"". When Messrs Parizeau, Bouchard and Dumont got together in June to agree on a ""soft"" referendum question--not a straight split from Canada, but one that would follow an attempt to negotiate a future partnership--federalist alarm bells should have been ringing. They were not.
Until early last month, this complacency seemed justified. The economic risks of separation looked large, even in the separatists' calculations, let alone the federalists' (the federal finance minister at one point dreamed up a million job losses for Quebec). Canada's Liberal prime minister, Jean Chretien, basically decided to let the separatists cut their own throats.
Monday's cliff-hanger showed how wrong he had been. Three weeks earlier Mr Parizeau had stepped aside to let the separatist campaign be led by the far more popular Mr Bouchard, whose charisma is such that little old Quebecoises have been seen eager just to touch the man who last winter escaped--minus a leg--from flesh-eating bacteria. From that moment the campaign, and the opinion polls, changed. Why? Because Mr Bouchard put his side's economic calculus into the cupboard and took out of it the big French drum.
He is good at lofty emotion, brilliant at rancour, Mr Bouchard. By ill chance for Canada, Mr Chretien is a French-speaker from Quebec but hated by many there for his alleged part in ancient, and some more recent, political wrong. Last week, when he belatedly addressed a television appeal to Quebeckershis privilege as prime minister--and rashly gave Mr Bouchard equal time immediately after him, the separatist tore into, not his arguments, but his treachery towards his own province and towards Rene Levesque, the separatists' great myth-figure, nearly 15 years ago. Time stops for nationalist history.
This week, having declared before the vote that he did not want any of those ""moral victories that are really defeats"", Mr Bouchard was defiant when he got just that: the fight would go on. Haling, compromise? Forget it. Even Mr Parizeau's announcement of his retirement was not that of a beaten man. I am passing on the torch, he said, in effect, to a new generation. We lost, just as Levesque lost an earlier referendum in 1980, but look how much round we've made: from 40% to almost 50%. And we won a large majority (about 60% in fact) of Quebec's French-speakers. A la prochaine (to the next time), as Levesque famously said after that earlier defeat.
Mr Parizeau lamented that the separatist cause had made no inroads among English- and other speakers. But his successor--probably Mr Bouchard--does not need to win over those who will not be won. All he needs (maybe in a fresh referendum, quite soon) is to swing another 5% of his own kind behind him. And it will be French drum and horn, and defiance of Ottawa and of le Canada anglais, that do it, not dusty economics or even jobs.
This is why some premiers of English-speaking provinces were running around this week with unusual phrases on their lips. ""We have heard you, we will work with you,"" Alberta's Ralph Klein told Quebec. It is not that these men suddenly love Quebec, they don't. Even the huge Montreal love-in on October 27th, to which non-Quebeckers poured in, some from the Pacific coast even, was not the true voice of Anglo Canada: much of it is fed to the back teeth with Quebec. But what the campaign, and the vote, have shown is that most Canadians do in fact feel for Canada, and have suddenly understood that it really could fall apart.
The provincial premiers reflect that feeling. Not perhaps as sincerely as their voters, since love of Canada is almost equalled by their desire to get Ottawa out of their provincial hair. Hence the cry on all sides for change, to keep Quebec in--for Canada's sake, not its own--and Ottawa out. But it has to be added that no one is volunteering for a third constitutional marathon, and that cries for change rang loudly after the previous Quebec referendum; producing, in the end, damn all. asdklgj;","THE blue - and - white banners waved , the chanteurs sang their throats out against les federastes , the balloons soared , the placards bounced like demented bedsprings .

And neither side knows where to go from here.
For the moment, it is the separatists-defeated only by one percentage point, but still defeated-who are in more obvious disarray. Having lost, Jacques Parizeau, the province's Parti Quebecois premier, brought the roof down on himself on referendum night: appalling many even of his own supporters, he blurted out on television that it was ""the ethnic vote"" that had cost them victory. Next day, doubly battered, he announced he would retire before the end of December-only for his deputy, Bernard Landry, to cast similar anti-minority aspersions, publicly, in a hotel foyer, on a Mexican-born woman with 20 years of residence in Quebec. Mr Landry, who was also minister for immigration and the ""cultural communities"" (those troublesome ethnics) promptly lost that portfolio and maybe any chance he had of the premiership with it.
In contrast, Mr Parizeau promoted another credible contender, Pauline Marois, who as head of Quebec's Treasury Board has negotiated nimbly with the trade unions. She got the finance ministry; and Mr Parizeau went further in suggesting that the next premier might well be a woman.
And what about Lucien Bouchard, the separatist hero of the campaign, who injected belated passion into what seemed a lost cause and brought it to the brink of victory? Leader of the Bloc Quebecois in the federal parliament, he is most separatists' favoured successor to Mr Parizeau. Mr Landry, for one, had said he would not dream of standing in Mr Bouchard's way. But the hero, having said he needed some days to mull over his future, retired to his tent-a family holiday of three weeks.
One consideration for him is that, were he to leave the federal parliament, he would bring his party's numbers there down-for a time-to 52, level with the right-wing Reform Party, and so might endanger the privileges it now enjoys as the main opposition party. A larger thought for Mr Bouchard may be his family. His Californian wife is not famously addicted to the separatist cause, and she may worry about his health. Their two small sons, says Mr Bouchard, by now spit at the very word ""referendum"".
Possibly a strategy is being negotiated, in which Mrs Marois will command the fort for a year or two, until Mr Bouchard returns from an effective guerrilla campaign in Ottawa to lead the Parti Quebecois to victory in a fresh provincial election on a platform of separation. A victory, be it said, that is by no means guaranteed: whoever runs Quebec for the coming years will have to take a sharp knife to public spending.
As for the federalists, on the face of things they should be happy. After all, with a last-minute show of passion for Canada, they staved off its disintegration. But only just, and what follows? Quebec's Frenchspeakers-four-fifths of its electorate-voted 60-40 for independence last week. How are they to be won over? Can they really be satisfied with some changes to the Canadian constitution and a few more powers devolved to Quebec's provincial assembly?
The federal prime minister, Jean Chretien, has told a gathering of his Liberal faithful that he is fed up with destabilising talk of further referendums, hinting that he might use federal powers to disallow any Quebec legislation arranging for one. But has he any positive strategy? If so, he is showing little sign of it. Ministers have been busy in Parliament fighting off the Reform Party, which-though it has its own plan for drastic decentralisation-demands that they promise to make no special deal with Quebec (an odd demand, given that Canadian federalism has evolved through just such deals with various provinces). Meanwhile, that old warrior Pierre Trudeau--the former prime minister whose 1982 ""patriation"" (from Britain) of the Canadian constitution, over Quebec's head, has fired much subsequent separatist ardour-on November 6th emerged from his silence during the referendum campaign. He attacked Mr Bouchard for falsifying the history of those days, and warned his countrymen that further decentralisation would destroy what remains of a united Canada. Which, true or false, does not answer the questions facing Mr Chretien. Nor yet--probably the reverse-will the proposed constitutional pow-wow of all provincial premiers (but not the federal one) which those of the four western provinces this week agreed to push ahead with.
In the absence of imaginative (or even conciliatory) political leadership, ordinary Canadians are preparing to fill the vacuum. Having mobilised for the great patriotic rally in Montreal on October 27th that may just have swung the balance to the federalist side, they want now to launch a thoroughgoing national debate to overhaul Canada.
Some argue for an old-fashioned constituent assembly. The head of a small research institute, Andrew Cardozo, is building support for a more open and less confrontational dialogue on the Internet. Can people power and new technology rescue Canada, as old politicians seemingly cannot? Perhaps it was symbolic that when a 34-yearold French-speaker from Montreal broke into the prime minister's Ottawa home last Saturday night, it was Aline Chretien who slammed a door on the knife-wielding intruder, while her husband lay fast asleep.","FEDERALISTS and separatists were both still licking their wounds this week , after the knife - edge result of the Quebec referendum on October 30th .

Can those who value the country as it now is pull themselves together enough in that time to defeat a renewed separatist challenge?
That is the question now posed to them by Lucien Bouchard, whose honeyed tongue lifted the separatist campaign to within a whisker of victory in Quebec's referendum last month. Now leader of the federal-level Bloc Quebecoi, he announced this week that he would resign his seat in the federal parliament and offer himself as leader of the provincial Parti Quebecois (PQ) and thus as premier of Quebec.
The two posts will soon be left vacant by Jacques Parizeau, who announced his decision to that effect on the morrow of the separatists' defeat in the referendum. Though it took Mr Bouchard a three-week holiday to make up his mind--his wife is clearly less than thrilled--the job is his for the asking. No one of substance in the PQ is expected to stand against him. He will either win by acclaim of the party's national council on January l2th, or, if, some dark horse should trot in sight, be elected leader on February 25th. The militants in the PQ cabinet see him as the one person who can keep up the momentum toward sovereignty (Quebec-speak for ""independence""; the still more alarming word ""separation"" is spoken only behind closed doors).
Mr Bouchard's first words as their soonto-be leader will have pleased his future followers. Asked if there was any possible deal Ottawa might offer that would keep Quebec in Canada, he replied, ""Not possibly. I am a sovereigntist.""
His plan, he said, was to govern Quebec so as to create jobs and improve the economy, at the same time improving the province's finances (through spending cuts, he said, rather than tax increases). Meanwhile he would wait and see what Ottawa and the rest of Canada would try to do about the constitution. Brought in in 1982, it is due, mandatorily, for review by April 1997. Mr Bouchard does not expect the review to produce ""anything significant""; nor, he said, would he take part in preliminary talks.
In sum, he looks for nothing and will ask for nothing. And in time, he said, though he would not be drawn on exactly when, he will put a fresh referendum to Quebec's 5m voters ""at the right time--a winning one"".
Some federalists argue that that time will never come. Separatism, they say, has peaked. Mr Bouchard's halo will be tarnished by the unpopular measures that he will have to take to reduce Quebec's hefty budget deficit. The Bloc's MPS in Ottawa will be far less effective without his leadership, and may even be supplanted as the leading opposition party by the right-wing, western-based Reform Party. Though the Liberal prime minister, Jean Chretien, soon after Mr Bouchard's announcement said that constitutional change was not his first priority, his government will show it has shed its near-fatal complacency and produce plans to revamp the federal structure. And Canadians generally have been so stirred by their near escape from fragmentation that they will accept the radical changes Mr Chretien has hinted at. So, at least, say Canada's optimists.
From Quebec, Jean Charest, a Conservative member of the federal parliament who tumed out to be the separatists' most effective adversary during the referendum, foresees a different future. He views Mr Bouchard as an opportunist and a demagogue, without sense of responsibility. He expects Quebec's new premier to blame all the province's ills on Ottawa-especially after another tough federal budget next spring-and call an early provincial election to establish his own mandate. It would then be just a short step to sovereignty.","CANADA may have less than two years to pick itself up from the scare it got on October 30th , when Quebec 's voters all but gave their provincial government approval to declare independence .

CAN Canada be saved? In the month since Quebec voted grudgingly not to stomp out just now, the rest of the country has been left to wonder what, if anything, can be done to stop it from leaving next time. Canada's prime minister, Jean Chretien, has now given his answer-and Canadians, in Quebec or elsewhere, have offered him little thanks in return. That might not matter if they had any better ideas, but, since they do not, maybe they should listen after all.
Mr Chretien's plan has three points, directed towards the Quebec separatists' three main demands: a parliamentary motion to recognise Quebec as a distinct, French-speaking society; a bill that would give Quebec a veto on constitutional change; and a promise that the federal government will get out of manpower training, a topic on which Quebeckers feel strongly. The answer from Quebec has been framboise.
Mr Chretien cannot have expected anything else. The separatists had already made clear their contempt for mere parliamentary motions: at the least, they want their province's special position enshrined in the constitution. But Mr Chretien has more than Quebec to deal with. Much of ""Anglo"" Canada is fed up with Quebec, and most provincial politicians are fed up with the federal government as well. They want more power from it. So Mr Chretien has had to offer them something too. He is offering a veto not only to Quebec but also to the other weighty province, Ontario, and, as regions, to the four (small) Atlantic provinces and the four (sizeable) western ones. His readiness to get Ottawa out of manpower training, he says, is just the start of wider decentralisation. So is Anglo Canada happy? It is not.
Yet what more can Mr Chretien offer? A right of constitutional veto, however solid, would not really satisfy Quebec's separatists. They and most of the nearly 50% of Quebeckers who voted for ""sovereignty"" want just that: not rights over any Canadian constitution but a separate one of their own. Even those who do not really want a split would like more than a veto on change; they want change itself. Quebec's language law goes far to ensure the dominance of French there. But it has still had to be toned down from what French-speaking enthusiasts wanted, and even now it is Canada's highest court, not Quebec's, that would in the last resort rule on any challenge to it. More widely, federal legislation in Canada is still made-and will be under any constitution-by a parliament in Ottawa dominated by English-speakers from other provinces.
And why not, those others say: that is what distinguishes a country from a customs union or a club. Little as they love Ottawa, they do not believe Canada can be run on the basis that you just opt out of whatever you don't like, or veto what others do. Especially, some would add under their breath, when you are a bunch of French-speakers with no huge wish to belong to the country at all. That is less than fair to French-speakers: even in Quebec, two-fifths of them have just voted to say they do want to belong. But Anglo exasperation with Quebec is a force that cannot be ignored. And it tightly limits the concessions that federalists can offer. Big constitutional changes require ratification by all ten provinces. Canada spent much of the 1980s trying for unanimity and failing; Mr Chretien is not the only person who sees little hope in another round.
Yet there is room for haggling. Quebec's present government has not flatly said no; it has said not enough is on the table. Its future leader, Lucien Bouchard, announcing his availability for that post, did say he would refuse to talk, but not for ever: he would talk at the constitutionally due date of 1997, he said, albeit with total scepticism. On the Anglo side, the Reform Party, about as far as one can get in geography or spirit from Quebec, does not reject recognition of Quebec's distinctness outright, or its claim to a veto (the party's first response was to ask for a veto for British Columbia too).
Soldier on, or lie down now
So those who believe in Canadian unity must soldier on. The conditions will be far from ideal. Mr Chretien is not their best imaginable leader. And among Quebeckers there would be many with no wish to see any talks succeed-a bad basis to start from, as any diplomat knows. Yet Mr Chretien's true hope is not a deal, not even talks at all: it is that his offers (which he can push through Parliament, unlike constitutional changes) will cut away enough ""soft"" separatist support to defeat the next referendum. He may be wrong. But federalists have little choice: if they will not risk defeat, they guarantee it. Quebec separatism is not about to go away.","An offer from Ottawa that may well fail , but is worth making

But Jean Chretien has more than Quebec to deal with . Much of "" Anglo "" Canada is fed up with Quebec , and most provincial politicians are fed up with the federal government as well . They want more power from it . So Jean Chretien has had to offer them something too . Jean Chretien is offering a veto not only to Quebec but also to the other weighty province , Ontario , and , as regions , to the four ( small ) Atlantic provinces and the four ( sizeable ) western ones . Jean Chretien's readiness to get Ottawa out of manpower training , Jean Chretien says , is just the start of wider decentralisation . So is Anglo Canada happy ? It is not . 
 Yet what more can Jean Chretien offer ? A right of constitutional veto , however solid , would not really satisfy Quebec 's separatists . They and most of the nearly 50 % of Quebeckers who voted for "" sovereignty "" want just that : not rights over any Canadian constitution but a separate one of their own . Even those who do not really want a split would like more than a veto on change ; they want change itself . Quebec 's language law goes far to ensure the dominance of French there . But it has still had to be toned down from what French - speaking enthusiasts wanted , and even now it is Canada 's highest court , not Quebec 's , that would in the last resort rule on any challenge to it . More widely , federal legislation in Canada is still made - and will be under any constitution - by a parliament in Ottawa dominated by English - speakers from other provinces . 
 And why not , those others say : that is what distinguishes a country from a customs union or a club . Little as they love Ottawa , they do not believe Canada can be run on the basis that you just opt out of whatever you do n't like , or veto what others do . Especially , some would add under their breath , when you are a bunch of French - speakers with no huge wish to belong to the country at all . That is less than fair to French - speakers : even in Quebec , two - fifths of them have just voted to say they do want to belong . But Anglo exasperation with Quebec is a force that can not be ignored . And it tightly limits the concessions that federalists can offer . Big constitutional changes require ratification by all ten provinces . Canada spent much of the 1980s trying for unanimity and failing ; Jean Chretien is not the only person who sees little hope in another round . 
 Yet there is room for haggling . Quebec 's present government has not flatly said no ; it has said not enough is on the table . Its future leader , Lucien Bouchard , announcing his availability for that post , did say he would refuse to talk , but not for ever : he would talk at the constitutionally due date of 1997 , he said , albeit with total scepticism . On the Anglo side , the Reform Party , about as far as one can get in geography or spirit from Quebec , does not reject recognition of Quebec 's distinctness outright , or its claim to a veto ( the party 's first response was to ask for a veto for British Columbia too ) . 
 Soldier on , or lie down now 
 So those who believe in Canadian unity must soldier on . The conditions will be far from ideal . Jean Chretien is not their best imaginable leader . And among Quebeckers there would be many with no wish to see any talks succeed - a bad basis to start from , as any diplomat knows . Yet Jean Chretien's true hope is not a deal , not even talks at all : it is that Jean Chretien's offers ( which Jean Chretien can push through Parliament , unlike constitutional changes ) will cut away enough "" soft "" separatist support to defeat the next referendum . Jean Chretien may be wrong . But federalists have little choice : if they will not risk defeat , they guarantee it . Quebec separatism is not about to go away .",20,Canada,A29-148,IN TERM,True,"Canada 's prime minister , Jean Chretien",18,True

 To win over Quebec, the prime minister-a French-speaking Quebecker by origin--has just rushed through the federal Parliament, where his Liberal Party has a solid majority, a quasi-constitutional revision of Quebec's status that has done more to divide the country than unite it. Quebec separatists are unimpressed. Western Canada has been angered and alienated.
The west's confidence was first shaken late in the Quebec referendum campaign this autumn, when Mr Chretien, who till then had sidestepped delicate constitutional issues, dangled before Quebec offers of recognition as a ""distinct society"" and a veto on constitutional change. That may have helped to defeat the separatists in the vote on October 30th, but the margin was so small that something more had to be done if Quebec was to stay in Canada.
That something, in Mr Chretien's eyes; was to introduce in Parliament, without consulting the provinces, a motion on the distinct-society issue and a bill in effect lending the federal veto on constitutional change to four ""regions""-the provinces of Quebec and Ontario, and the east and west (four provinces apiece, whose veto could be exercised if at least two, holding jointly 50%plus of the region's population, so chose). He saw this as a compromise. To the west it was as though he had flung a lighted match into dry prairie grass. ""A slap in the face"" and ""sowing the seeds of western separatism"" were among the cries voiced by politicians and ordinary citizens alike.
To westerners, Mr Chretien was trampling on their bedrock belief that all provinces are entitled to equal rights and powers (a bedrock somewhat fissured by simultaneous indignation that Atlantic Canada, with 8% of the country's people, was being put on par with the west, which has almost 30%). British Columbians were especially incensed at being lumped in with the three prairie provinces, contrary to both geography and history. ""Canada is not composed of Ontario, Quebec, and two regions,"" declared the province's premier, Mike Harcourt. ""This is an offensive view held to be true only in central Canada.""
Mr Chretien timing did not help. British Columbia and Alberta have been riled for some time by his refusal to alter the formula for sharing welfare costs whereby Ottawa pays a third in well-off British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario, but half in other provinces. British Columbia's bill, particularly, has shot out of control as the jobless have flooded in, boosting welfare rolls by 100,000 in four years. To make tempers worse, when the province recently imposed a threemonth residency requirement on claimants, Ottawa hit back by withholding C$47m ($34m) due in tax transfers.
The veto protests paid off, in a way: a late amendment designated British Columbia as a region with a veto of its own-only to be dismissed there as a ""token"", indeed a step back. The west wants reform of the federal Senate, with senators elected, not appointed, and more of them for the less-populous provinces, fewer for the two heavyweights. Today's constitutional rules make this hard: together, the big two, Ontario and Quebec, can block change. The new veto system would make it almost impossible, since either could do so single-handed.
Underlying western anger is bewilderment that Mr Chretien, a veteran of constitutional wars, would blunder ahead as he has. On television, he said he felt confident, because his veto concept had been supported by all provinces in 1971 (in a deal that collapsed when Quebec changed its mind). ""Deja vu,"" said Alberta's premier, Ralph Klein, summing up western dismay at Ottawa's obsession with Quebec.
Until recently, Mr Chretien's national popularity-opinion polls have given him over 60% approval-had seemed solid. Even the west, mostly represented in Ottawa by members of the Reform Party, was behind him, pleased with his efforts to encourage growth and cut the budget deficit. But his lack of early action in the Quebec referendum has been widely blamed for the nearloss of that battle, and now he is similarly assailed for misreading the west.
Mr Chretien plainly does not understand how disaffected westerners have become. They flatly reject recognition of a special status for Quebec, or one-sided concessions to win hearts in a province that. seems to be halfway out of the door already. And their anger is increasingly tinged with despair, as Canada slips back into a familiar slough of constitutional warfare. The man whose task it is to unite the country has botched the job, say many westerners; it is time he went-and, the times being what they are, they want an English-speaking, non-Quebecker in his place.","WHO can solve Canada 's crisis of national unity ?

On January 29th he takes over as premier of the province, at the head of the separatist Parti Quebecois (PQ) that rules it.
Mr Bouchard has played diverse roles in the ten years since he left his law firm at the beckoning of the Conservative prime minister of the day, Brian Mulroney. He has been ambassador in Paris, then a federal member of Parliament and environment minister for Mr Mulroney. Then, after a quarrel with his old college friend, he went into backbench exile and formed a separatist party at federal level, the Bloc Quebtcois.
When the Bloc swept 54 federal seats in Quebec in the 1993 election, he found himself leader of the opposition, facing another Quebecker, the new, Liberal prime minister, Jean Chretien. The skirmishing over Quebec and its dreams of sovereignty took place across the House of Commons as much as in the Quebec legislature, and Mr Bouchard was outshining the province's PQ premier, Jacques Parizeau, in forceful oratory long before he took the reins of the separatists' flagging referendum campaign last October and brought it within an inch of victory.
His new role will be the most demanding of all. By provincial law, he cannot call a new referendum on separation during the present legislature, whose full term runs to 1999. He could call a very early election this year to confirm his leadership and be ready for whatever Mr Chretien may do when, obligatorily, he holds a review of the 1982 federal constitution next year. Mr Bouchard has not tipped his hand on this yet.
Instead, he says, his first priority is to cut his province's budget deficit, at C$3.9 billion ($2.8 billion) relatively the largest in Canada. He has made his task harder by saying he will cancel a planned increase in sales tax that would have brought in C$500m. Federalists hope his first months behind a desk where the buck really stops, and the unpopular spending cuts he will have to make, will tarnish the halo he has worn for a year since he recovered, almost miraculously, from a bacterial attack that cost him a leg. Leading the PQ, with its tradition of mature and open debate, will also be harder than commanding a party founded and recruited by himself.
But Mr Bouchard is already showing his skill. He has rejected the mansion in Quebec city that businessmen furnished for his predecessor. And, having recognised that to keep a federal pension was political folly, albeit wholly legitimate, he is donating the C$30,000 a year to his new party.
In the face of this new force at the head of the separatists, the federalists are yet to close ranks. Andre Ouellet, who until he quit office this week was both foreign minister and senior minister for Quebec, has twice attacked the provincial Liberal leader, Daniel Johnson, for his feebleness during the referendum. Mr Chre'tien, on a trade mission to Asia with seven provincial premiers, forged little more agreement among them than that any referendum affecting the constitution must be subject to proper ground rules-not least, that the question be clear.
Meanwhile, the right-wing Reform Party, strong in the western provinces and in Ontario, has pressed for a tough line on Quebec separatism: it wants ""exit conditions"" laid down if Quebec voters next time choose sovereignty. In parallel, talk is growing in some English-speaking enclaves of Quebec of strategies to remain part of Canada, whatever happens. The 20 mayors of Pontiac county, along the Ottawa river, meet on this issue in February. Federalists in the western half of the island of Montreal dream of a separate city-state.
 The most sensible voice has been that of Keith Spicer, once a languages commissioner and now head of Canada's broadcasting regulators. Quebec nationalism, he argues, will never go away; the federal government and the other provinces are in total disarray with no coherent plan; and Mr Bouchard might call a spring election and summer referendum. So he appeals urgently for a twin strategy: one ""option group"" to propose bold constitutional changes that include Quebec, the other a blueprint for a Canada without it. By midJune, he suggests, after a ""citizens' assembly"" has added its say, the whole country should make its choice in a referendum. His paper has been well received in Quebec and beyond-and at least it has put something into the present policy vacuum.","FOR at least two years , Lucien Bouchard has been the most popular politician in Quebec .

Canadians, with justice, are proud of this record. But enthusiasm for their highminded calling cooled around the time that a monument depicting three peacekeepers was erected in 1992 on the ceremonial route in Ottawa.

Disillusion deepened when a small if brave Canadian contingent in Rwanda proved ineffective during that country's vast massacre in 1994.
In the first two years after it was elected in late 1993, the present Liberal government of Jean Chretien showed every sign of wanting to give up Canada's commitments in several hell-holes, notably Bosnia. In the end, though, it contributed 1,000 troops afresh to the NATO operation in ex-Yugoslavia, to ensure that the United States too would send a contingent. Now it has taken an extraordinary step to maintain a peacekeeping force in Haiti.
The Haiti operation has become a political football in the UN Security Council. The American troops, the dominant element in the UN force there, are due to withdraw this month, and President Rene Preval, the newly elected successor to JeanBertrand Aristide, is still far from secure in office. China, no friend of the Aristide regime, which maintained close relations with Taiwan, said it would accept continued UN peacekeeping only if the force were limited to 1,200, and kept in place for no longer than four months.
Enter the Canadians. Their new foreign minister, Lloyd Axworthy, a strong supporter of the UN, helped to produce a compromise. The Americans will duly go home, reducing the UN'S blue-bereted force to two battalions of troops, from Bangladesh and Pakistan, along with an Argentine field hospital. But Canada will provide 700 other troops wearing their own green berets, together with Brigadier;General Pierre Daigle, who will command the whole group, taking over from an American. Canada will also itself pay the full $24m cost of its troops' four-month stay as well as continue to field its 0 Mounties training a new police force.
Why? Here is Canada ready to spend more money for Haiti, and send more men, a French-speaking regiment which will, moreover, be in daily contact with a volatile population, unlike the earlier detachment of engineers, who worked in the background. There seem to be two reasons for this rush of generosity. The Chretien government has sought foreign policies that show Canada to be independent of the United States, without challenging its big neighbour (although-as long since it disagrees firmly about Fidel Castro's Cuba). The takeover of responsibility in Haiti was a gift for Mr Chretien in this respect: a move positively helpful to the Americans, but independent of them.
The second reason has to do with the politics of Quebec, where many Haitians now live, and where Mr Aristide was once a theology student. When Mr Chretien shuffled his cabinet last month, the previous foreign minister, Andre Ouellet, gave up that post, and with it his seat in the federal parliament, where he had represented Papineau-St Michel, in Montreal, the province's biggest city.

All 100,000 armedforces personnel and their civilian colleagues were told to drop everything they might otherwise be doing on April 9th and spend the day searching for documents to do with some ugly incidents in Somalia three years earlier.
The man who ordered what immediately became known as the Great Easter Egg Hunt was the country's top soldier, General Jean Boyle. Before he became chief of defence staff in January, General Boyle was in charge of policy and communications in the defence department. This month a former subordinate, Colonel Geoff Haswell, claimed that the general had approved, in that post, a move to change the category of certain documents, which meant they could be destroyed and thus escape the eyes of a civilian inquiry that has laboured for months on the Somali affair.
The armed forces' response was to charge Colonel Haswell under military law, while the besieged general first denied that he had ever taken part in any effort to thwart the inquiry's work, and then added an appeal-on video-to all his troops to hunt everywhere for logs, computer disks and whatever else might be relevant to the affair. Although everyone from fighter pilots to office clerks searched diligently, and did indeed turn up some missing documents on the now disbanded Airborne Regiment, the inquiry's commissioners were far from satisfied. They adjourned their hearings this week, giving the general until April i8th to turn in all relevant papers and promising some tough questions when he appears as a witness next week.
Whyall this fuss about some papers? Because the ""Somali affair"" was a very nasty one indeed, besmirching not just the army but the country's reputation for its role in peacekeeping, of which Canadians have been justifiably proud. The Airborne Regiment drew its men from other units, and toughness-as in any such regiment in any country-was one qualification. As part of the peacekeeping force in Somalia, the regiment did good work clearing a way for relief convoys. But then in March 1993 a group of corporals caught a Somali teenager inside their compound-and tortured and beat him to death.

Opposition members of Parliament, returning from their Easter break, have been demanding this week that both General Boyle and Mr Collenette, who was enthusiastic in his appointment of the general to Canada's top defence job, should resign.

","THE Canadian army had to mark the anniversary of its greatest battle honour - the storming of Vimy Ridge , near Ypres , in Flanders , in April 19i7 - in a most curious way this year . All 100,000 armedforces personnel and their civilian colleagues were told to drop everything they might otherwise be doing on April 9th and spend the day searching for documents to do with some ugly incidents in Somalia three years earlier . 
 The man who ordered what immediately became known as the Great Easter Egg Hunt was the country 's top soldier , General Jean Boyle . Before he became chief of defence staff in January , General Boyle was in charge of policy and communications in the defence department . This month a former subordinate , Colonel Geoff Haswell , claimed that the general had approved , in that post , a move to change the category of certain documents , which meant they could be destroyed and thus escape the eyes of a civilian inquiry that has laboured for months on the Somali affair . 
 The armed forces ' response was to charge Colonel Haswell under military law , while the besieged general first denied that he had ever taken part in any effort to thwart the inquiry 's work , and then added an appeal - on video - to all his troops to hunt everywhere for logs , computer disks and whatever else might be relevant to the affair . Although everyone from fighter pilots to office clerks searched diligently , and did indeed turn up some missing documents on the now disbanded Airborne Regiment , the inquiry 's commissioners were far from satisfied . They adjourned their hearings this week , giving the general until April i8th to turn in all relevant papers and promising some tough questions when he appears as a witness next week . 
 Whyall this fuss about some papers ? Because the "" Somali affair "" was a very nasty one indeed , besmirching not just the army but the country 's reputation for its role in peacekeeping , of which Canadians have been justifiably proud . The Airborne Regiment drew its men from other units , and toughness - as in any such regiment in any country - was one qualification . As part of the peacekeeping force in Somalia , the regiment did good work clearing a way for relief convoys . But then in March 1993 a group of corporals caught a Somali teenager inside their compound - and tortured and beat him to death .

Today it seems a spent force. Critics, inside and outside the party, say it is going nowhere fast, because extremist members have given it an image of racism and intolerance. The national convention that starts in Vancouver on June 6th, they say, faces a critical challenge: Reform must reform itself, or it will fizzle away. 
Reform has been the dominant voice of the right since the 1993 federal election. From 2% of the 1988 vote and one seat won in a by-election later, it shot up then to i8% and 52 seats, all but one, admittedly, in western Canada. While helping Jean Chretien's Liberals to win power, this devastated both the Progressive Conservatives, then in government, who were cut to two seats, and the leftish New Democrats, down to nine. Canada's politics seemed on the way to being entirely remade. 
That was always the idea. Reform was created in 1987 largely by its present leader, Preston Manning, son of a former premier of Alberta, as a populist movement to make politics more accountable to ordinary people. It aimed to speak for unhappy middleclass conservatives who want less government, with lower taxes and spending, more support for family values, tougher welfare rules, a crackdown on crime, fewer immigrants, and so on, plus some specifically Canadian demands such as an end to official bilingualism and no special status for French-speaking Quebec. 
Ironically, the plain-spoken populism that made Reform popular has now got the party into deep trouble. An internal feud broke into the open in March, when some moderate Reform members of Parliament blamed the party's defeats in five by-elections on its extremist image, and said they might not stand again.Jan Brown, a prominent Mr from Calgary, pointing to some colleagues' wild comments on gun control and caning criminals, said Reform had become ""downright scary"" to many voters. 
The row was redoubled in May by two Reform MPS opposing a Liberal bill to expand rights for homosexuals. One, from British Columbia, said that if he owned a business he would move black or gay employees ""to the back of the shop"" or even sack them, if their presence annoyed bigoted customers. An Albertan MP chimed in. 
Such matters are one reason why Reform is down to 70,ooo members (from a high of 137,ooo) and only 13% in the latest opinion poll. A related provincial party got nowhere in this week's British Columbian elections. Reform's performance in Parliament has been unimpressive. Only on the Liberals' fiscal policy, their confused response to Quebec separatism, and some immigration scandals has it mounted effective attacks. The better organised Bloc Quebecois outshines it. And Mr Chretien, noting the shift in popular mood, has moved smartly to the right, stealing many of Reform's clothes, attacking the budget deficit, cutting social spending and beginning to decentralise and to slim government. The Liberals had 53% support in the latest poll. 
Mr Manning himself has been under fire from some of his MPS for leaving them ""twisting in the wind"", as one put it, before belatedly acting to curb the row. He did eventually clamp down, issuing guidelines for Reformers to exercise free speech responsibly. Meaning? Well, he imposed the same penalty, a short suspension from the parliamentary caucus, on Ms Brown as on the two right-wingers. Ms Brown quit Reform, to sit as an independent. 
Might Reform yet move closer to the mainstream? Not to judge from the populist resolutions at its convention. Nor is it clear how far Mr Manning wants to move, or could, in that direction. His activists are not troubled, analysts say, by flaps over extremist remarks, because they do not find them all that outlandish and they expect their MPs to speak for the grassroots. 
In the long run, there can be only one effective party of the right. But neither Reform nor the Conservatives are keen to merge. Which will overcome? For Reform, the test will be the next federal election, which may come early. The party must break out of its western bastion. The big battle will in be Ontario. In 1993, Reform came second in over half the 99 constituencies there. But in much of Ontario the Tory tradition is strong.

The federal prime minister, Jean Chretien, and the ten provincial premiers will meet on June 20th and 21st. Yet when he met Quebec's secessionist premier, Lucien Bouchard, privately on June 7th, the two agreed that constitutional change would not figure on that meeting's agenda. In fact, it will have to, if only for a few minutes: the ministers must decide how to handle a provision in Canada's 1982 constitution requiring a review of its amending formulae by next April. Saskatchewan's New Democratic premier, Roy Romanow, has argued that this review has already happened, during the talks on the Charlottetown Accord, a deal meant to placate Quebec that was rejected in a 1992 referendum. Mr Chretien has seized on this way out, though he is yet to win all-round approval of it. 
Yet many Canadians have toiled to produce schemes to save their country and persuade Quebec not to vote for secession next time round, as it nearly did last October. A group of notables, including former premiers and a famous hockey goalie turned lawyer, last month produced a scheme that would enshrine Quebec's ""unique character"" in the constitution, and devolve several federal powers to the provinces. At its recent convention in Vancouver, the Reform Party called for the devolution of most such powers. Thousands of ordinary citizens held a unity rally in Ottawa on June 9th, cheering a declaration signed by most of the mayors from a nearby county in Quebec saying they wanted to stay in Canada if the rest of Quebec voted to secede. 
Alain Juppe, the French prime minister, was in Canada this week. He at least pointed to the issue, telling Quebeckers they could count on France whatever choice they made. No one could blame him for scrupulously giving no advice on what that choice should be (and many non-Quebeckers would have gone for his throat if he had). But why are Canadian leaders silent? 
Mr Bouchard's reasons are straightforward. Formerly leader of the Bloc Quebecois in the federal Parliament, he took power in Quebec in January. Preoccupied with the referendum, the Parti Quebecois government there, under Jacques Parizeau, had for a year neglected bread-and-butter issues. The budget deficit was soaring. So was unemployment Montreal, once a queen among cities, was down-at-heel. Mr Bouchard's strategy has been to raise taxes discreetly, go hunting for investors, and say as little about secession as his radical supporters will allow. His hope is that the federalists will help Quebec's economic recovery, while alienating its voters enough politically to give him a referendum victory after a provincial election in 1999. 
So far, his plan is working nicely. When they met on June 7th, Mr Chretien offered federal help in a dozen industrial projects, and agreed to look again at an $18 billion French-designed high-speed train scheme to link the main centres from Quebec city to Windsor, Ontario. Mr Chretien, a Quebecker, hopes to hold his province in Canada with a show of ""profitable federalism"" and by pragmatically devolving some of Ottawa's powers (over job-training, mining and forestry) to all provinces. 
Mr Chretien's trouble is that his poll ratings keep slipping-to 24% in Quebec, says Gallup, half his national standing-while occasional tough federalist talk of what dire things might happen if Quebeckers were to choose independence at the next referendum has simply allowed Mr Bouchard to shine in nationalist colours. 
Meanwhile, Quebec's disconsolate English-speakers, now shrunk to around 6oo,ooo of its 7m people, continue to trek west By 1999, enough may have left, even without a high-speed train to help them, to assure a secessionist victory.

So is Canada about to break into hundreds of fragments? Chief Ovide Mercredi, leader of the Assembly of First Nations, says that, unlike Quebec's Frenchspeaking separatists, his people do not want to leave Canada (which would be impracticable anyway: the largest group of Indians in any one area does not number more than 12,000). To him sovereignty means self-determination, self-reliance ""and not waiting for the white governments to tell us what we can do."" 
He has come to this stance after five years of trying to get the first nations' rights fully recognised in the constitution. He decided in the end that the present-- Liberal--federal government, elected in 1993 under the leadership of Jean Chr& tien, was planning to abandon its role as the native peoples' trustee and to turn the main problems over to the ten provincial governments. 
Mr Mercredi on July 8th presented to his organisation's annual assembly a broadly worded declaration of ""sovereign relationships"". Noting that the first nations had never been brought to relinquish their collective rights ""through conquest, surrender or other means"", it affirms that ""each community must assert its jurisdiction and authority step by step, consistent with its own needs, priorities and aspirations"". 
He also added a Gandhian touch-- and worried many white Canadians, mindful of the far-from-Gandhian armed stand-off at Oka, near Montreal, in 1991by saying that Indian youths should be trained in passive resistance. After debating for three days, the chiefs decided to spend a year mulling over this declaration, and how to implement it. More forcefully, they rejected the piecemeal way in which the minister for Indian affairs, Ron Irwin, is setting out to amend the framework law, the Indian Act, under which they are governed. 
These moves reflect the frustration of some native leaders at their treatment by the Chretien government, which they see as reverting to the old tactic of divideand-rule. Mr Irwin a year ago set out his terms for negotiating local self-government with various groups. Some, like the Nisga'a Indians in British Columbia, would get considerable powers over land title, taxation, social services and policing in their own areas. Mr Irwin has also designated Manitoba--Chief Mercredi's home province--for a pilot scheme whereby the federal Indian-affairs department will bow out and 63 bands, individually, will share powers with the provincial government concerned. 
That may sound acceptable, but Chief Mercredi sees it as a denial of the first nations' right to self-government, because it is top-down decision-making from Ottawa. He long ago suggested that a cabinet committee should work with chiefs on a Canada-wide implementation of native rights. It has not happened. Mr Mercredi had hoped to be invited to sit down with the provincial premiers for a time during their latest regular meeting, in June. No luck; they were preoccupied with Quebec. The federal government also seems to favour a rival body, the Native Council of Canada, whose strength is among the 6oo,ooo Indians-about half the totalwho live outside reserves. 
To Mr Mercredi, the assertion of selfgovernment can take many forms. It may mean young men building a hunting cabin in defiance of conservation officers in the Yukon; or selling fish from Lake Winnipeg directly to Saudi Arabia--Mr Mercredi is going there himself shortly-- without asking the say-so of the federal Ministry for International Trade. He wants to see young men getting paid work-and fitted to get it. These days, many of them, demoralised by welfare hand-outs, take to the bottle and (increasingly) to suicide. Some join the ""warrior societies"" that have been seen at Oka and later confrontations. Mr Mercredi tells of one youth at Cat Lake, in Ontario, who brandished his gun, declaring himself ready to die for the cause and only waiting for the word to go ahead. 
That is not Mr Mercredi's line. But when he recounts how the federal manpower minister, Doug Young, could not find time to talk with him about job training, he sounds close to despair.

Four days later General Jean Boyle, the military chief whom he had appointed ten months earlier and defended through sustained public attacks, followed suit. 
The name engraved on both men's hearts is Somalia. The fine reputation that Canada's soldiers have earned in dozens of peacekeeping operations, and at first embellished in Somalia, protecting faminerelief convoys, was besmirched in March 1993 by two incidents when Somali youths suspected of stealing were killed, one of the two being brutally tortured first. Despite army efforts to hush the affair up-not least because the Tory government of the day had soon to face a general election-the facts dribbled out. These included gleeful photographs of one of the victims, besides videos of Airborne soldiers in disgusting hazing sessions. Mr Collenette acted firmly, breaking up the regiment and appointing a civilian commission of inquiry. 
Alas for Mr Collenette, the young general whom he picked last December to clean house had in 1993 been the soldier ultimately responsible for public relations. As journalists and the commission probed, one big question was how far up the chain of command it had been decided to reclassify some documents, to prevent publication. A colonel who faces court martial on charges of destroying documents has said the atmosphere to limit public information was established right at the top by General Boyle's direct civilian boss, the then deputy defence minister, Robert Fowler. 
Mr Fowler later became, and remains, Canada's ambassador at the United Nations. General Boyle spent an awkward week in August telling the commission he himself accepted responsibility, but then blamed underlings for ""lack of moral fibre"". Several retired generals joined opposition politicians and the media through September in attacking him for lack of leadership. Then, suddenly, Mr Collenette, who had defended his chosen general to the end, resigned, ostensibly over an unrelated and fairly minor matter. The prime minister, Jean Chretien, within an hour of his close friend's resignation, appointed instead Doug Young, a minister already known for his toughness. General Boyle's days were numbered. 
Mr Young faces some daunting tasks, from drawing a line under the Somalia affair to decisions on new equipment. His biggest task will be to revive the credibility and morale of a once proud army and fit it for further peacekeeping. ","IN A little over three years , Canada has had three defence ministers and three chiefs of defence staff , and disbanded its crack Airborne Regiment On October 4th David Collenette , the defence minister , resigned . Four days later General Jean Boyle , the military chief whom he had appointed ten months earlier and defended through sustained public attacks , followed suit . 
 The name engraved on both men 's hearts is Somalia . The fine reputation that Canada 's soldiers have earned in dozens of peacekeeping operations , and at first embellished in Somalia , protecting faminerelief convoys , was besmirched in March 1993 by two incidents when Somali youths suspected of stealing were killed , one of the two being brutally tortured first . Despite army efforts to hush the affair up - not least because the Tory government of the day had soon to face a general election - the facts dribbled out . These included gleeful photographs of one of the victims , besides videos of Airborne soldiers in disgusting hazing sessions . Mr Collenette acted firmly , breaking up the regiment and appointing a civilian commission of inquiry . 
 Alas for Mr Collenette , the young general whom he picked last December to clean house had in 1993 been the soldier ultimately responsible for public relations . As journalists and the commission probed , one big question was how far up the chain of command it had been decided to reclassify some documents , to prevent publication . A colonel who faces court martial on charges of destroying documents has said the atmosphere to limit public information was established right at the top by General Boyle 's direct civilian boss , the then deputy defence minister , Robert Fowler . 
 Mr Fowler later became , and remains , Canada 's ambassador at the United Nations . General Boyle spent an awkward week in August telling the commission he himself accepted responsibility , but then blamed underlings for "" lack of moral fibre "" . Several retired generals joined opposition politicians and the media through September in attacking him for lack of leadership . Then , suddenly , Mr Collenette , who had defended his chosen general to the end , resigned , ostensibly over an unrelated and fairly minor matter . Jean Chretien , within an hour of Jean Chretien's close friend 's resignation , appointed instead Doug Young , a minister already known for his toughness . General Boyle 's days were numbered . 
 Mr Young faces some daunting tasks , from drawing a line under the Somalia affair to decisions on new equipment .

And what about both together? 
Mr Chretien is clearly thinking of calling an election in 1997, his fourth year of office, rather than holding on until near the end of his five-year term in 1998. His Liberal Party won an overwhelming victory in October 1993. The governing Conservatives' long-time leader (and prime minister), Brian Mulroney, had lost public trust, and his short-lived replacement, Kim Campbell, was unimpressive. The Tories were swept away, retaining just two seats, while the traditional third party, the leftish New Democrats, slid to nine. 
Two regional parties-the right-wing Reform Party, based in western Canada, and the separatist Bloc Quebecois-became the main opposition, with just over so members of Parliament apiece. Neither, however, has proved effective. The Bloc lost its fire when its leader, Lucien Bouchard, left last winter to lead the Quebec provincial government, and his successor, Michel Gauthier, could not heal splits in the party caucus, and resigned. The Reform leader, Preston Manning, is also in difficulties: some of his brighter and more moderate MPS are not going to seek re-election. 
The Liberals meanwhile have got on with their job. They fought off, if only just, the separatists' challenge in the Quebec referendum a year ago. The finance minister, Paul Martin, has slimmed the budget deficit With some complacency, Mr Chretien told a recent party conference that his government had already fulfilled over threequarters of its election promises. At 47% in the opinion polls, far ahead of any other party, the Liberals should be sitting pretty. 
Alas for Mr Chretien, in his calculations he forgot a promise. One reason for his triumph in 1993 was a pledge to replace the hated goods and services tax (GST), brought in by the Mulroney government. He hasn't done it. Controversy about the tax last summer compelled the deputy prime minister, Sheila Copps, to resign her seat and fight it again-successfully-in a by-election. On December loth, Mr Chretien himself was called to account, not by some parliamentarian but by a Montreal waitress. 
At a televised ""town-hall meeting"", Johanne Savoie said she had voted Liberal in 1993 because of this promise to junk the GST, and it had not happened. Mr Chretien denied he had ever made such a promise; he had committed his party only to replacing the GST with an equal but fairer tax, and that, he claimed, it had done by some harmonising with provincial sales taxes. Ms Savoie stood her ground: Mr Chretien had promised to ""kill"" the tax, she insistedand the broadcasters obligingly showed election-time clips that backed her up. 
For a week, the prime minister maintained his denial, angrily rejecting editorials that accused him of lying. At last, on December 16th, over in Newfoundland, he apologised for the ""honest mistake"" the Liberals had made in thinking they could quickly bring in an entirely different tax. Fair enough, but that was not the mistake he had made at the town-hall meeting. Mr Chretien-who had floundered further at the meeting by telling a jobless woman with three academic degrees that the government does not create jobs, and some people are lucky, others not-has come across as a man who does not care. 
He still looks well placed to win re-election. Yet unemployment remains at io%, and even that conceals the replacement of full-time jobs by part-time ones. Two recent polls gave the Bloc a clear lead over the Liberals in Quebec, and overall their rating, though still high, has fallen by ten points in six months, with the Conservatives-now led by Jean Charest, an MP from Quebecup to i8% and the New Democrats to ii%.

The justice minister, Allan Rock, often touted as a possible successor to Mr Chretien, is having to fend off demands that he should step down. 
The suit revolved around enduring rumours that Mr Mulroney had received millions as a kickback after Air Canada-then government-owned-spent C$1.8 billion in 88 to buy new airliners from Airbus Industrie.

ABOUT the time he presented his fourth budget on February 18th, word went out that the finance minister no longer wanted to be known as Paul Martin Jr. It was a sign that Mr Martin was his own man, not just the son ofa famous veteran of Canadian politics. It may also indicate that he will succeed Jean Chretien as prime minister soon after the Liberals achieve their widely expected victory in the next general election, which is likely to be called for early June. 
In his 40 years of public life, Paul Martin Sr was variously health minister (introducing the federal system of medicare) foreign minister and, ultimately, high commissioner in London; he twice contested the Liberal leadership. His son's career has been more varied. He is proud of having been a youthful deckhand on an Arctic salvage boat and a roustabout in the Alberta oilfields.

When the Liberals won power in September 1993, he was given the job of finance minister, considered a graveyard in recent Canadian politics. 
Instead, he has been the star of a still popular government and a recovering economy. Under his firm hand, the deficit has been reduced from 6% to 2% of GDP, with the prospect of a balanced budget in 1999. The economy is projected to grow by more than 3% this year, and inflation and interest rates are lower than in the United States. Mr Martin's latest budget won praise for continuing to cut the deficit while offering modest help to poor families: shamefully, one Canadian child in five lives in poverty. The best bilingual debater on the government benches, Mr Martin has managed to portray a 7o% increase in employee contributions to the government pension plan as investment in retirement rather than a disguised tax. 
Is all this enough to sweep him swiftly to the prime ministership?Certainly, much will depend on performances during the election campaign, on which most Liberals are eager to embark while the Reform Party is in disarray and the Bloc Quebecois is arguing over a new leader. Mr Chretien could decide to stay on afterwards, but he has started to sound uncaring about Canada's 9.7% unemployment rate and to look inept in coping with the Quebec separatists. He could even lose his own Quebec seat. Win or lose, Mr Chretien is nearly five years older than 58-year-old Mr Martin and might decide on a dignified withdrawal to the golf course.

At first sight, Mr Chretien's future looks safe enough. Just possibly it may not be. 
If he has indeed opted for an early election-Parliament's five-year term is not up until October 1998-the timing is tight for Mr Chretien. He has had to wait for a new electoral law to come into force this month, but he can also expect to see some gloomy unemployment figures coming out in June. And though the latest opinion polls put the Liberals at least 20 points ahead of any rival party, they also show that this support is soft. Many voters believe the government has done too little to deal with unemployment (still officially about 9%, and in reality probably higher), and over its 1993 campaign promises to maintain health services and to protect public broadcasting from the heavy cuts that the finance minister, Paul Martin, has since imposed in his crusade against the budget deficit. More than ever, the coming election will be a series of four regional contests, the Liberals having to spread their strength to match other parties prominent in each region. The two essentially regional parties that filled the opposition benches as newcomers after the 1993 vote-the French-speaking Bloc Quebecois separatists with 54 seats, and the rightwing Reform Party based in Alberta, with sa-remain powerful in their eastern and western bastions. The big question is how far the Liberal's two traditional rivals in national politics have recovered from the beating they took in 1993. 
The Conservatives, af ter nine years in power, nearly all under Brian Mulroney, collapsed in that election, under his short-lived successor, to just two seats. The leftish New Democrats (NDP) took only nine. Since then, though, both parties have given themselves attractive new leaders. On the right,Jean Charest, from Quebec, one of the two survivors, has pulled the Conservatives ahead of the Reform Party in opinion polls. For the NDP, Alexa McDonough, after a year in the shadows without a parliamentary seat, at last made her mark as party leader at an enthusiastic policy convention in mid-April in Regina, Saskatchewan, where the Regina manifesto of 1933 launched social democracy in Canada. 
The two have chosen different ways to challenge the Liberals, whose own strategy to win the middle ground is ""to campaign from the left and govern from the right"". Mr Charest, who was environment minister in the Mulroney government and is still only 38, has shifted Conservative policies further to the right, promising tax cuts and opposing gun-control legislation. His target is Ontario, home to 4o% of the nation's voters. In 1993 they gave the Liberals an almost clean sweep of the 99 Ontario seats, thanks, not least, to the split of the right-wing vote between Conservatives and Reform. If the Conservatives' new stars, such as MajorGeneral Lewis Mackenzie, of Bosnia fame, can roll back Reform support, the party could make precious gains. 
But there are risks in Mr Charest's tactic. Ontario's provincial Conservatives, who won power from the NDP there in 1995, have already put it into practice, slashing social services to deliver hefty tax cuts-and many voters dislike the result. 
In his native Quebec, Mr Charest could be the spoiler, taking anti-separatist votes from the Liberals (and some from the softer nationalists) with conciliatory talk about Quebec's special status in Canada. The Bloc Quebecois will have a powerful ally: Lucien Bouchard, its creator, now running the province at the head of the local Parti Quebecois, plans to campaign actively for his old, federal-level party. The Bloc may well hold on to two-thirds of Quebec's seats. 
The NDP'S main strength lies in western Canada, where its provincial versions run the governments of British Columbia and Saskatchewan. There the Liberals have to find a wide enough band of support between it and the Reform Party. The NDP has also picked up support in the four Atlantic provinces during recent provincial elections. Ms McDonough is well liked after years in Nova Scotia politics. During the Regina convention she staked out a policy of creating jobs and restoring social-welfare programmes after the harsh years of deficit-cutting. Her argument that parliament needs a strong opposition party of social conscience-""We have never made government, but we have always made a difference"", she says-may win back votes from the Liberals. 
A Liberal government still looks the likeliest outcome. But even so there may be a shock in store for Mr Chretien: his own seat-like his background-is in Quebec, and he will have a hard fight to hold it against a strong Bloc Quebecois candidate.

IT LOOKS a safe bet. Canada's Liberal prime minister, Jean Chretien, has called an early general election for June 2nd. Polls before the announcement put his party far ahead of any rival. Unless the land starts to slide dramatically beneath his feet or-even less probably-the earth moves for some other party, he is home and dry. True, the polls also showed huge numbers of voters-over 50% of Liberals, 60% of Conservatives-claiming they were still ready to change their minds. But there is no evident reason why they should, at least not to Mr Chretien's disadvantage. 
So this will be another dull Canadian election, will it? No, and not only because the one of 1993 was not dull at all.Aided by the first-past-the-post electoral system-as used in Britain and the United States-the voters four years ago produced the biggest turnaround in parliamentary history. The Liberals, with 41.5% of the vote, won 177 of the then 295 seats, while the sorry 16% of the ruling, once mighty Conservatives brought them a still sorrier haul of seats: just two. And suddenly the opposition benches were swamped by two parties previously little heard of: the right-wing Reform Party, with 18% and 52 seats, nearly all from western Canada, and, odder still, the French-speaking separatists of the Bloc Quebecois, with 14% and 54 seats. Add the leftish New Democrats (NDP), with 6.5% and 9 seats, and Canada had got the government it wanted but certainly not the parliament (where indeed the official ""leader of the opposition"" was the Bloc's Lucien Bouchard, a party and a man who would sooner not be Canadian at all). 
The coming election may partly redress these absurd figures. One poll published this week, though taken well before, gave the Liberals 44%, Tories 2o%, Reform 15%, NDP ii% and the Bloc 8%. Reproduced on election day, this would leave the Liberals very comfortably in command, unless one of the two right-wing parties can drive the other into the ground; that is unlikely, given the geographical spread of their rival supporters, but well worth watching. 
Worth attention too is the issue symbolised by the rise in support for the NDP. Mr Chretien's finance minister has been a zealous deficit-cutter; as have provincial governments across the country. But the feeling has grown, in the face of persistent unemployment and tight health-care spending, that zeal has gone too far. Mr Chretien, no deaf politician he, duly did a u-turn the day after announcing the election. Lo, some ofthe proposed cuts in central transfers to the provinces for (mainly) health care were no longer needed: a figure due to shrink to C$ii billion ($8 billion) by 1999 could stay at the current C$iz.5 billion. Alas for his opponents, Mr Chretien was notjust u-turning but telling the truth: the financial year just ended brought a deficit some C$3 billion less than expected. The right has been calling-ever more credibly, as estimates of the deficit shrank-for tax cuts. Now the voters have a choice: extra money in their pockets or more social spending. One country or two? 
Still more worth watching will be the progress of the Bloc Quebecois. Even in 1993 it won only half the Quebec vote, albeit over 70% of Quebec seats. This week's poll put it on 35%, just behind the Liberals, with the Tories at 25%. Even if that 35% is true, it seems unlikely to stay so low. Mr Bouchard is now the provincial premier, leading the Parti Quebecois (distinct, as with other Canadian parties, from its federal-level equivalent, the Bloc). But he is already riding to the aid of his unimpressive successor as Bloc leader. Among other parties, so far, only the Reform leader, Preston Manning, is making an issue of Quebec separatism, and he more to profit from western hostility to Quebec than from zeal for national unity. 
Yet the issue-however tedious to many non-Quebeckers-is fundamental. And the new government will have to tackle it: the separatists plan yet another referendum, to redress their hair's-breadth defeat in 1995-a defeat for which Mr Chretien could claim precious little credit.

Quebec separatism brought Canada within inches of break-up in 1995. The issue has not gone away-and it has burst into the current election campaign 
REGULARLY over the past five years, a former Conservative prime minister, Joe Clark, has been warning Canadians that their country was ""sleepwalking"" its way to a break-up. In tiptoeing round the issue of Quebec nationalism,Jean Chretien's Liberal government, he argued, had drawn the wrong lessons from the failure of two earlier attempts at a solution, the Meech Lake agreement of 199o and the Charlottetown accord of 1992, both derailed by public opposition of various sorts. It was just the message Mr Chretien did not want the voters to hear. They have. 
When he called a general election for June 2nd, Mr Chretien was hoping for a walkover. Not least, he hoped to do better in his native Quebec, where in 1993 the Liberals won only 19 of its 75 federal seats and the separatist Bloc Quebecois 54. His theme was to be sound government, but conscience too: having cut at the budget deficit since 1993, the government recently found itself unexpectedly flush and able to restore funds to health care and other programmes. As for Quebec and its claims for independence, or at least recognition as a ""distinct society"", anathema to many western Canadians, he would let them lie. 
Halfway through the campaign, however, the monster of Meech Lake broke surface. National unity has become the foremost issue, pushed there by two contrasting Quebec politicians, Jacques Parizeau and the present leader of the federal Conservatives, Jean Charest. 
Mr Parizeau resigned as Quebec's provincial premier after he failed in late 1995by only 50,ooo votes-to win a referendum mandate to go for independence (plus a negotiated economic association with what would be left of Canada). On May 13th, he published his memoirs, and dealt a sharp blow to the credibility of the Bloc Quebecois and its then leader, now Quebec's premier, Lucien Bouchard. 
Mr Parizeau relates how he was advised by a former French president, Valery Giscard d'Estaing, to keep up the momentum, if he won, by proclaiming independence within a few days. He denies he intended to take this advice, saying he would have joined Mr Bouchard, who had taken a leading role in the referendum campaign, in trying to negotiate with Ottawa (or the rest of Canada)-as the separatists had promised-while keeping the weapon of a unilateral declaration at the ready. 
Really? Those who remember Mr Parizeau as a pur et dur, a hardliner, of separatism, believe that he would have swept Mr Bouchard along, proclaiming independence without any real effort to negotiate first-and that Mr Bouchard must have known that (he denies it). Now Mr Parizeau is touring Quebec to market his memoirs. He will add a hard edge to the Bloc's message that will frighten the soft nationalistsand that may presage the start of a manoeuvre to reinstall himself as premier, and one day president, of Quebec. 
All this would normally help the Liberals regain seats there. But the attractive Mr Charest has other ideas. He is promoting a ""Canadian covenant"", whereby the federal government would transfer taxing powers to the ten provinces, in exchange for their agreement to guarantee national standards in health and education and to lower barriers to trade among them. This has a constructive look, where the Liberals seem to offer merely confrontation: they would refer any unilateral declaration of Quebec independence to the federal Supreme Court, to pronounce on its legality in Canadian or international law. 
Mr Chretien reacted to the Parizeau affair by saying it fully justified that line of action. His minister for inter-governmental affairs, Stephane Dion, looking beyond a pro-federal court decision, argued that the federal government could claim a say in wording the question in any fresh Quebec referendum, and in setting the size of majority needed for change. Mr Bouchard, who may indeed call a third referendum as early as 1998, duly lammed into the Liberals. 
In an English-language television debate on May l2th, Mr Charest was the clear winner among the five party leaders, drawing applause from the audience with an emotional pledge to leave 
Canada intact for his children. Mr Chretien seemed tired and defensive, though he did better in French next night. 
Whether this issue can upset the solid lead that the Liberals had as the campaign began is yet to be seen. But at least it has shown that they are vulnerable-and, yet again, only too clearly, that Canada is too. ","OTTAWA

Those who remember Mr Parizeau as a pur et dur , a hardliner , of separatism , believe that he would have swept Mr Bouchard along , proclaiming independence without any real effort to negotiate first - and that Mr Bouchard must have known that ( he denies it ) . Now Mr Parizeau is touring Quebec to market his memoirs . He will add a hard edge to the Bloc 's message that will frighten the soft nationalistsand that may presage the start of a manoeuvre to reinstall himself as premier , and one day president , of Quebec . 
 All this would normally help the Liberals regain seats there . But the attractive Mr Charest has other ideas . He is promoting a "" Canadian covenant "" , whereby the federal government would transfer taxing powers to the ten provinces , in exchange for their agreement to guarantee national standards in health and education and to lower barriers to trade among them . This has a constructive look , where the Liberals seem to offer merely confrontation : they would refer any unilateral declaration of Quebec independence to the federal Supreme Court , to pronounce on its legality in Canadian or international law . 
 Jean Chretien reacted to the Parizeau affair by saying it fully justified that line of action . Jean Chretien's minister for inter - governmental affairs , Stephane Dion , looking beyond a pro - federal court decision , argued that the federal government could claim a say in wording the question in any fresh Quebec referendum , and in setting the size of majority needed for change . Mr Bouchard , who may indeed call a third referendum as early as 1998 , duly lammed into the Liberals . 
 In an English - language television debate on May l2th , Mr Charest was the clear winner among the five party leaders , drawing applause from the audience with an emotional pledge to leave 
 Canada intact for his children . Jean Chretien seemed tired and defensive , though Jean Chretien did better in French next night . 
 Whether this issue can upset the solid lead that the Liberals had as the campaign began is yet to be seen . But at least it has shown that they are vulnerable - and , yet again , only too clearly , that Canada is too .",20,Canada,A29-148,IN TERM,True,Jean Chretien 's,12,True

LIKE Jacques Chirac in France, Jean Chretien was taking a calculated risk when he called an early general election in Canada. For Mr Chretien, unlike Mr Chirac, the bet paid off, just, and his Liberal Party squeaked back into power. But in Canada, whether the voters are casting their ballots early, late or on time, there is always an extra element of uncertainty in an election-an uncalculated risk, if you will. It is that Canadians will pass judgment on their country as well as their government. And so it was on June 2nd. Aided by an electoral system that exaggerates sentiment, the voters have succeeded in delivering a weakened prime minister, a weakened government and a weakened country. 
For his government's weakness, Mr Chretien has only himself to blame. In its three and a half years in power, his government had completed the harder part of its deficit-slimming. The economy was doing well, though unemployment remained high, and it looked set to do still better soon. The tide of Quebec separatism seemed to be ebbing. And the voters evidently approved: Mr Chretien's Liberal Party stood far ahead of any rival in the opinion polls. But the Liberal campaign was feeble, and Mr Chretien's own part in it less than inspiring. In the event, it was the populist Reform Party, under its vigorous leader, Preston Manning, that set the campaign agenda. The result was a Liberal vote below 39%, and a prime minister who had gone into the election with 177 members, emerging from it with only 155 in a chamber of 301. 
The 146 seats ofthe combined opposition are still divided every which way, but even so this is a narrow margin with which to carry through a full term of office. And the fact that Mr Chretien had difficulty holding his own seat, in Quebec, can do him no good. Already Canadians are speculating about a change of leadership, albeit not immediately, with an eye on the finance minister, Paul Martin, another Quebecker. 
Another Quebecker. Those two words sum up the big issue, which is not Mr Chretien's future but Canada's. The election brought back from the dead the other once mighty party, the Tories, and revived the left-wing New Democratic Party. Yet, in Parliament, the country is more divided by region than ever. True, the Liberals and Conservatives managed to claw back ten seats from the separatist Bloc Quebecois. Yet the Bloc still dominates Quebec. The Liberals hold all but two of 103 seats in the heartland, Ontario. Of 74 in the three western provinces, they hold just nine. There, Reform has 57, yet it has not a single one east of the further three it took in Manitoba. 
Action brings reaction 
The Bloc's slide in Quebec might suggest that the great constitutional issue is dying down. The rise of Reform in the west shows that, in fact, it is now burning in two regions, not one. Mr Manning's big vote-winner in the west was not his party's standard call for lower taxes, fewer scroungers, less government. It was distrust of the federal government-especially its readiness, as the west sees it, to give ground to Quebec. 
Till now, Mr Chretien's attitude to trouble in Quebec-let alone in the west-has been, in essence: shut your eyes and maybe it'll go away. It will not. To Quebec separatists the rise of Reform is all good news: there at last, they say, as here, you are seeing the emergence of the real Canada. That is half-true. To pretend that it is not could make it wholly true. Yet the first-past-the-post system has exaggerated trends. Political Canada is not the real Canada. Did separatism dominate the vote in Quebec? No: it took 38%. Do the Liberals monopolise Ontario? Not its votes: they got 48.5%, with Reform and Tories neck and neck at 18-19% apiece, and the NDP with io%. Does Reform own the West? No: in the three provinces (moving coastwards) it took 36%, 54% and 41%, while the Liberals took 25%, 24% and 28%. The real Canada is still an amalgam, coast to coast, but political Canada still matters-and it shows a country fragmenting into regions. ","The fragmentation continues

Jean Chretien, Canada's prime minister, made the best he could of his election victory on June 2nd. For the first time in nearly half a century, he said, the Liberals had won two successive majorities in the federal parliament. But, although he said he was determined to lead Canada into the next century, the modest scale of the victory-his party holds only 155 of the 301 House of Commons seats-means that he may not. 
The unity of Canada's federation, which Mr Chretien has fought so hard to preserve, looks even more parlous than before. The country voted along regional lines. The far west went for the populist Reform Party, which opposes concessions to Quebec. The centre voted for the Liberals, who are now the only party that can reasonably claim to be national. A significant number of Quebeckers went for the separatist Bloc Quebecois. And the Atlantic provinces, where the Liberals suffered serious reverses, tilted to the Conservatives. 
Mr Chretien's lacklustre performance during the campaign, combined with memories of how close the federalists came to defeat in the 1995 Quebec referendumthe separatists lost by only 50,ooo voteshas increased speculation that he may not long stay leader of the Liberals, or of the Canadian government. 
With another referendum in Quebec likely before the decade is out, the Liberals may want someone more popular in that province-such as Paul Martin, Canada's finance minister-to lead them into battle. But Mr Chretien can point to a Liberal gain of seven seats in Quebec, at the expense of the Bloc Quebecois. That party's stumbling new leader, Gilles Duceppe, had to be propped up by Lucien Bouchard, the province's premier, during the campaign. The Bloc's 38% share of the provincial vote, compared with 49% in 1993, suggests that it could lose a new referendum on independence. Mr Bouchard will take his time before calling one. 
The most popular federalist politician in Quebec is Jean Charest, the Conservative leader. By general consent he won both the French- and English-language television debates. His party was close to oblivion in 1993, when only he and one other Tory survived the disgust felt by Canadian voters about the prime-ministerial record of Brian Mulroney. Mr Charest has rebuilt the party and made it the second most popular in Canada. However, its 19% vote was spread so thinly that it delivered only 20 seats, mostly in the Atlantic provinces. The Tories' battle against the Alberta-based Reform Party for the right-wing vote was sharpest in Ontario, to the damage of both parties. The Liberals there did as well as in 1993, winning 101 out of 103 seats, with 27 of those victories stemming directly from the split in the right-wing vote. 
The biggest smile on election night belonged to Preston Manning, whose Reform Party's score of 6o seats-surpassing the 44 of the Bloc-means that he now becomes leader of the opposition. A born-again Christian, Mr Manning talks confidently of changing the political landscape with new ideas such as free votes in parliament (without party whips) and allowing constituencies to recall their MPS. 
Mr Manning could claim, during the campaign, that Mr Martin's recent attack on the budget deficit was based on his own programme. He succeeded in setting the election agenda with his choice of issues: jobs, crime and national unity. When he thrust some electoral rolls on which appeared the names of serial murderers in front of television cameras, the Liberal government scrambled to disqualify some prisoners from voting. 
Mr Manning argued that equal treatment for all ten provinces was a fundamental principle that should preclude any special status for Quebec When he called for a conference on Canada's future, the cautious Mr Chretien squirmed. Near the end of the campaign, the prime minister sought to parry Reform's attacks by declaring that in any future Quebec referendum a soo%-plus-one vote for the separatists would not be enough to secure the province's secession. That angered some people in Quebec, giving the Bloc a bit of last-minute momentum, but it won the Liberals few votes in British Columbia and Alberta, where the Reform Party took 5o seats. 
In the next parliament Mr Manning will present himself as the voice of a western Canada that has come of age and demands as much attention as Ontario and Quebec. This attitude offends many Quebeckers. Mr Bouchard had described the prospect of the Reform Party becoming the main opposition to the Liberals as ""intolerable"", denouncing Mr Chretien and Mr Manning as ""the couple from hell"". 
Alexa McDonough, the leader of the left-wing New Democratic Party, stuck doggedly to the issues of jobs, health and the social services. This paid off in her own impoverished Atlantic provinces, where the New Democrats won a record eight seats. In all of Canada they won 21, taking them across the threshold of 12 needed to be accepted as an official parliamentary party. Ms McDonough and Mr Charest will carry a large responsibility in the next parliament. When Reform and the Bloc are at each other's throats, as well as the Liberals', it will be up to Ms McDonough and Mr Charest to remind them of what can be achieved through co-operation. 
On election night, Mr Chretien tried to gather the Tories and the New Democrats to that task, talking of ""Canadian values such as tolerance, openness and generosity"". But Mr Charest refused to commit himself to working alongside an unpopular prime minister in the next Quebec referendum. Frank McKenna, the Liberal premier of New Brunswick, said that he had warned Mr Chretien not to call the election a year before it was necessary. Mr Chretien is already discovering, after such a paltry victory, that friends are hard to find. ","IT WAS hardly a triumph .

WOMEN are in, especially with politicians. In the rich world, no new parliament takes office, it seems, without more women on its benches and no leader fails to boast of the fact. Tony Blair, Britain's new prime minister, and Jean Chretien, his newly re-elected counterpart in Canada, have gloried in the feminisation of their parliaments and stocked their cabinets with women. Now Lionel Jospin is trying to outshine them in France. Among the many commitments he has made for his new Socialist government is a promise to amend France's constitution to ""inscribe the goal of parity between men and women"" in political life. 
No one quite knows what Mr Jospin means, except that he wants to provide much redress of grievance with little strain on the treasury. Almost everywhere, women are under-represented. Political parties from Mexico to China have tried to correct that, usually by setting quotas for female candidates. Occasionally, as in Belgium, Italy and now apparently France, governments have tried to force parties to act. 
Why have more political women? There is one good reason and two bad. The good reason is to correct discrimination. In France, where only 6% of deputies were women before the Socialists swept in, parties may well have been denying women (and minorities) the chance to stand for office and voters the chance to elect them. The bad reasons are mixed up with the idea that women bring something to politics that men do not-empathy with their female constituents and a feminine touch to the aggressive business of statecraft. 
Both notions may be right, but democracies are supposed to let voters decide that sort of thing for themselves. Women may prefer to have parliament cater to their needs as human beings-as workers, employers, taxpayers, consumers, parents, and so on- rather than to their femaleness. Besides, attempts to make parliaments mirror their electorates are often an admission that society is hopelessly divided. In India, where caste and ethnic conflict are pushing tokenism to extremes, a fifth of the seats in parliament are reserved for low castes and a third may soon be assigned to women. 
India, you may say, is special. Plenty of countries find ways to reserve power for groups that would otherwise be under-represented without going so far. Look at Poland, which reserves seats in its parliament for a party representing the small German-speaking minority. In the United States, a handful of Alaskans elect as many senators as a multitude of Californians (affirmative action for acreage, you might say). And if democracy allows quirky parties with narrow agendas (the beer drinkers' party, the pensioners' party) why proscribe the 50% Female Socialist party? 
The difference is partly one of degree. It is one thing to give a voice to the voiceless. It is worse for a national party to twist itself into a demographically correct shape. And it is far worse than that for a government to insist that it must do so, as Mr Jospin seems to intend. Some voters understand the balance. Canada's Inuit people recently had the chance to decide what kind of legislature they wanted to govern Nunavut, a mainly Inuit territory to be created in the eastern Arctic, itself a bit of tokenism. A plebiscite was held to decide whether Nunavut should have the world's first system of two-member constituencies in which the seats would be split evenly between men and women. The Inuit wisely said no. ","Try to get more women into politics , but not too hard 
 WOMEN are in , especially with politicians . In the rich world , no new parliament takes office , it seems , without more women on its benches and no leader fails to boast of the fact . Jean Chretien's , have gloried in the feminisation of Jean Chretien's parliaments and stocked Jean Chretien's cabinets with women . Now Lionel Jospin is trying to outshine Jean Chretien in France . Among the many commitments he has made for his new Socialist government is a promise to amend France 's constitution to "" inscribe the goal of parity between men and women "" in political life . 
 No one quite knows what Mr Jospin means , except that he wants to provide much redress of grievance with little strain on the treasury . Almost everywhere , women are under - represented . Political parties from Mexico to China have tried to correct that , usually by setting quotas for female candidates . Occasionally , as in Belgium , Italy and now apparently France , governments have tried to force parties to act .

It took 15 years to reach the first salmon treaty. The boats of both countries take fish returning to spawn in the rivers of either. The treaty said that each was entitled to a catch proportionate to the numbers of fish spawning in its own rivers. But equity was never achieved. British Columbia has continued to produce fish in abundance; American stocks have been slimmed by dams and industrial development. 
Figures accepted by both sides show that American boats in the Gulf of Alaska and off southern Vancouver Island have overfished salmon returning to spawn in Canadian rivers for years, to the tune of 35m fish-say, $35om-worth-since 1985. A New Zealand mediator in 1996 called for American restraint. The Americans rejected his report. This year the stakes are especially high, with a record 18m sockeye salmon expected to return to Canada's Fraser River. 
The mood in British Columbia has been even angrier than usual this year. Its premier, Glen Clark, has threatened tough provincial action if the Americans do not offer a last-minute deal in response to Canada's ""final"" offer of June 23rd. But while attacking them as ""bullies"", he has been as rude about Canada's federal government, which has authority over both fisheries and treaty-making. He has denounced ""timidity"" in Ottawa, and has served notice that his province will cancel a seabed lease to a Canadian navy weapons-testing base often used by American submarines. He has also suspended the province's participation in some so agreements on various topics with nearby American states. 
To British Columbians, the salmon war exemplifies an obsession in Ottawa with the concerns of central Canada. They gave the federal prime minister,Jean Chretien, a slap on June 2nd, electing 25 Reform Party members, while holding his Liberals to six. Only after the election was the salmon treaty upgraded in the federal agenda. The fisheries portfolio went-at last-to a British Columbian. And, at Mr Clark's request, Mr Chretien raised the issue with Bill Clinton at last weekend's G8 summit. 
Too late, maybe. If so, British Columbia will be digging in again for a two-front war-and not just one province's fish but Canada's unity will feel the strain.

Since October 1995, when that province's Parti Quebecois (PQ) government failed by only 50,000 votes to win a referendum on its plan to secede from Canada, the federal government has seemed unable to decide between blandishment and threat. It has offered Quebec, and any other province that might want them, some small carrots such as responsibility for vocational training, while pointing out all the constitutional obstacles to secession. But it has discouraged public debate: in the campaign for the general election of June 2nd, the Liberal prime minister, Jean Chretien, kept his remarks to the level of suggesting that no sensible person would want to leave a country ranked number one in human development by the United Nations. 
Alas, many Quebeckers want just that, and though he can argue that lying low paid off-the Liberals took six separatist seats in Quebec-others feel more sense of urgency. Daniel Johnson, leader of the provincial Liberal Party, for one: he needs something more substantial than carrots if he is to challenge the popular rQ premier, Lucien Bouchard, who is expected to call a provincial election next spring, a necessary prelude to yet another referendum, the third since 198o, on ""sovereignty"", as separatists call it. And the premiers of Canada's nine other provinces have agreed to meetMr Chretien was not invited-in Calgary on September 15th and 16th, to discuss how they can bolster national unity. 
The premiers decided to do this last month during their regular annual meeting, held this year in the eastern province of New Brunswick, which with three others would be cut off from the heart of the country were Quebec to break away. Mr Bouchard was at that meeting, but said he would not turn up at Calgary. 
Can the nine achieve anything, in the absence of Mr Bouchard and Mr Chretien? The best they can do, sceptics say, is work out how the rest of Canada should get along if Quebec were indeed to go. The premiers-four Conservatives, three Liberals, two New Democrats-are more hopeful. They started planning in New Brunswick how the division of powers between Ottawa and the provinces could be improved, and they asked their finance ministers to suggest better ways of handling taxing powers and federal transfers of money. 
Their ambitious scheme for ""rebalancing"" power-in effect, redesigning the federation-owes something to ideas on new social programmes from Ontario's radical Conservative premier, Mike Harris. Another godfather has been Saskatchewan's Roy Romanow. This shrewd New Democrat played a big part in getting Canada's constitution brought under overtly Canadian (rather than, theoretically, British) control in 1982. But he has long argued that constitutional fiddling is not the way to win Quebeckers' hearts and ensure national unity. Four-fifths of the answer, he says, lies in practical steps to make Canada function better; constitutional change can come in better times. Mr Harris wants to see debate in Ontario about the way to give Quebec's language and culture protection in the Canadian constitution. 
Though it may help Mr Johnson, none of this seems welcome to the Chretien government. It sees ""rebalancing"" as a provincial codeword for yet more devolution of powers, and believes it has conceded enough already-and, at that, without winning friends either in Quebec or in western Canada. Instead, federal ministers are showing a new toughness. Stephane Dion, the minister for inter-governmental affairs, spent much of August in an icy exchange of open letters with Quebec's deputy premier, Bernard Landry, about the legalities of secession and the international recognition that might or might not follow it. 
The federal government a year ago asked the Supreme Court to decide whether unilateral secession by Quebec would be valid in Canadian or international law; and, if these conflict, which would take precedence. The Quebec government is not taking part, but has had a (pro-separatist, indeed PQ member) lawyer appointed by the court on its behalf Hearings will begin on December 8th. Mr Bouchard has poured scorn on the whole affair, but could yet find an adverse ruling helpful, rallying ""soft [Quebec] nationalists"" behind him. 
A recent opinion poll in Quebec put support for secession down from 49% in June to 45%, the lowest for years. But the shift was to ""undecided"", not positively to federalism; the pollsters ascribed it mainly to dislike of the PQ government's tax rises and deficit-slimming cuts in services. 
Even so, the PQ has a five-point lead among Quebeckers over the provincial Lib erals; indeed, Mr Johnson rates so poorly that many Liberals are wondering whether to look for a new leader before the election. Mr Bouchard shuffled his cabinet in August, notably replacing the minister in charge of Montreal. That once-great city is now in decline. But economists foresee a strong upturn, especially in manufacturing. And Mr Bouchard has another thing going for him: Mr Chretien.

TWICE in the past ten years Canada's leaders have sweated to agree on constitutional changes to meet the demands of French-speaking Quebec. Twice they have managed it-at Meech Lake in 1987, and then, when that accord fell apart, at Charlottetown in 1992. Twice public opinion has defeated them; Quebec was lukewarm to Meech and against Charlottetown; English-speaking voters were hostile to both. Now the leaders, all but Quebec's separatists, are trying again. 
Unsurprisingly, the nine provincial premiers who met in Calgary, in Alberta, on September 14th to launch a new initiative looked as if they were handling a live grenade. They did it with due care. Their plan, accepted by allLucien Bouchard, leader of Quebec's separatist Parti Quebecois (PQ) government had stayed away-was no new constitutional blueprint, they emphasised, nor aimed just to please Quebec. They had set out a sevenpoint framework for discussion on national unity. And above all, the ""general citizenry"" would be consulted on it, and guide their thoughts. The premiers are to report progress in January. 
The hope is, this time, to satisfy the many Canadians riled at being shut out of past negotiations. The west, especially, disliked the past attempts of the ""eastern political elite"" to ram through constitutional recognition of Quebec as a ""distinct society"". That concept was and still is unacceptable to the west, which, for all its own quarrels with Ottawa, has no fellow-feeling for Quebec nationalism and holds that all provinces are equal, full stop. 
The seven points themselves reflect this anxiety. The Calgary declaration focuses not solely on Quebec's discontent, but also on that of other Canadians (and it may end in a wider devolution of federal powers). To fluff about diversity, tolerance, citizen equality and the mutual respect of the various levels of government, it adds three more controversial points, all making more than a nod to western views: that all provinces have ""equality of status""; that Quebec's society has a ""unique character""no ""distinct"" here-which its government must foster ""within Canada""; and, not least, that ""if any future constitutional change confers powers on one province, these must be available to all provinces."" 
One, notably, who welcomed the Calgary document was Preston Manning, leader of the Reform Party, powerful in the west and the second-largest block in the federal parliament. So too did Jean Charest, the Conservatives' federal leader, though he also-justifiably-called for stronger leadership on the issue from the country's (Liberal) prime minister, Jean Chretien. 
Mr Chretien was not at Calgary, though he was happy for the premiers to meet and praised them later for ""responsible leadership"". But he hoped for a stronger, more persuasive message to Quebec Over golf and dinner in the weeks before Calgary, he had lobbied most ofthe nine to call for constitutional recognition of Quebec's distinctiveness. The premiers of the Atlantic provinces, notably New Brunswick's Frank McKenna, were willing; so was Saskatchewan's New Democratic Party premier, Roy Romanow, a good friend of Mr Chretien despite party differences. But British Columbia's Glen Clark blocked the way. 
He was already at odds with the federal government, notably over what he sees as its feeble response to American overfishing of Pacific salmon. He was not about ""to repeat the mistakes of the past"" and join in a closed-door deal on constitutional change, especially one talking of Quebec's ""distinct society"". His province's voters would eat him alive, as one commentator put it, if he had backed that idea. His predecessor, Mike Harcourt, did so (among other errors) and has now retired from politics. 
Mr Clark, who is alert to the public mood-and has a mere three-seat majority in his provincial legislature-will not jump on any constitutional bandwagon unless there is a large parade behind it. None is yet in sight Nor will appeals from Ottawa create one. The salmon war is just the latest episode in British Columbia's long alienation from the federal government: a local saying has it that ""it is 3,ooo miles from Victoria [the provincial capital] to Ottawa, but 30,ooo from Ottawa to Victoria."" As for love of Quebec, though Mr Clark used that very phrase this week, one statistic is worth citing: west of the Rockies (indeed, you can add in the two prairie provinces east of them), Canada has more people whose mother-tongue is Cantonese than French. 
In Quebec, the Calgary declaration has elicited scorn and contempt from separatists. The nine premiers had made plain that they see no hope of constitutional change while a party that simply wants out is in charge of the province, and the PQ was happy to prove them right. 
""Etymological pirouettes,"" scoffed Jacques Brassard, Quebec's minister for intergovernmental affairs, at the decision to replace ""distinct society"" with ""unique character"". The only way to satisfy Quebec, he argued, was to recognise that ""Quebeckers are a people""-which, he reckoned, le Canada anglais would never accept (possibly, English-speaking Quebeckers would add, because, were the phrase meant to include them, which it isn't, it is untrue). 
Mr Bouchard, ever one to interpret an inadequate offer as a gross insult, was just as damning. Any package built around the framework would leave Quebec ""socially unique, politically a eunuch,"" he said. 
If he can represent the Calgary initiative as an attempt to undermine Quebec, Mr Bouchard may well gain from it, especially if the public consultations elsewhere-the province's PQ government plans nonespin out of control, becoming a forum for the intolerant hostility to Quebec found in the west. That could galvanise the ""soft nationalist"" vote in Quebec, giving him his best chance of winning a new referendum on independence. 
Before then, though, he has to win a provincial election. That does much to explain the timing of the Calgary declaration. Mr Bouchard is expected to call a vote next spring, and Daniel Johnson, the uninspiring leader of the Quebec Liberals, has made it clear to his federalist allies elsewhere that he will need a unity package to offer, if he is to have any hope of success. The best way to ensure the separatists do not win the next referendum, he argues, is to beat the PQ and so avoid a vote altogether. 
No wonder Messrs Brassard and Bouchard mock Mr Johnson as ""the candidate of English Canada"". Mr Johnson has to hope, on the contrary, that the goodwill and minimal concessions from Calgary will somehow be enough to win over the same soft middle of French-speaking voters that Mr Bouchard is after: people who see the case for independence and have no deep zeal for Canada, but fear the insecurity of leaving it. That is a bold hope: ""We love you and we want you to stay,"" as Ontario's Mike Harris summed up the declaration, is nice to hear, but not convincing. 
Wherever it leads, the initiative is at least a change from a summer of threats and doom-and-gloom predictions of Quebec's fate if ever it goes its own way. The federal government has been busy warning the PQ that the world would not recognise a breakaway state, and hoping to persuade Canada's supreme court that a breakaway would be unlawful anyway. But beside those arguments, both essentially political propaganda, there has been one of more weight: the notion that if Canada is divisible so too is Quebec, and that, were the province to break loose, such sceptical regions as its Cree and Inuit north, could stay part of Canada. 
That was once a fringe idea, barely taken seriously. No longer. Mr Bouchard, indeed, was to have spent last weekend in the north, fishing with his sons and building political bridges with Cree leaders (who, in the end, stood him up). And beyond it is a still more alarming thought: suppose English-majority areas in western and southern Quebec were to start taking seriously the idea that what Crees can demand ordinary Anglo-Canadians can too? ","Yet another scheme to win over Quebec and ensure national unity 
 TWICE in the past ten years Canada 's leaders have sweated to agree on constitutional changes to meet the demands of French - speaking Quebec . Twice they have managed it - at Meech Lake in 1987 , and then , when that accord fell apart , at Charlottetown in 1992 . Twice public opinion has defeated them ; Quebec was lukewarm to Meech and against Charlottetown ; English - speaking voters were hostile to both . Now the leaders , all but Quebec 's separatists , are trying again . 
 Unsurprisingly , the nine provincial premiers who met in Calgary , in Alberta , on September 14th to launch a new initiative looked as if they were handling a live grenade . They did it with due care . Their plan , accepted by allLucien Bouchard , leader of Quebec 's separatist Parti Quebecois ( PQ ) government had stayed away - was no new constitutional blueprint , they emphasised , nor aimed just to please Quebec . They had set out a sevenpoint framework for discussion on national unity . And above all , the "" general citizenry "" would be consulted on it , and guide their thoughts . The premiers are to report progress in January . 
 The hope is , this time , to satisfy the many Canadians riled at being shut out of past negotiations . The west , especially , disliked the past attempts of the "" eastern political elite "" to ram through constitutional recognition of Quebec as a "" distinct society "" . That concept was and still is unacceptable to the west , which , for all its own quarrels with Ottawa , has no fellow - feeling for Quebec nationalism and holds that all provinces are equal , full stop . 
 The seven points themselves reflect this anxiety . The Calgary declaration focuses not solely on Quebec 's discontent , but also on that of other Canadians ( and it may end in a wider devolution of federal powers ) . To fluff about diversity , tolerance , citizen equality and the mutual respect of the various levels of government , it adds three more controversial points , all making more than a nod to western views : that all provinces have "" equality of status "" ; that Quebec 's society has a "" unique character""no "" distinct "" here - which its government must foster "" within Canada "" ; and , not least , that "" if any future constitutional change confers powers on one province , these must be available to all provinces . "" 
 One , notably , who welcomed the Calgary document was Preston Manning , leader of the Reform Party , powerful in the west and the second - largest block in the federal parliament . So too did Jean Charest , the Conservatives ' federal leader , though he also - justifiably - called for stronger leadership on the issue from Jean Chretien's . 
 Jean Chretien was not at Calgary , though Jean Chretien was happy for the premiers to meet and praised them later for "" responsible leadership "" . But Jean Chretien hoped for a stronger , more persuasive message to Quebec Over golf and dinner in the weeks before Calgary , Jean Chretien had lobbied most ofthe nine to call for constitutional recognition of Quebec 's distinctiveness . The premiers of the Atlantic provinces , notably New Brunswick 's Frank McKenna , were willing ; so was Saskatchewan 's New Democratic Party premier , Roy Romanow , a good friend of Jean Chretien despite party differences . But British Columbia 's Glen Clark blocked the way . 
 He was already at odds with the federal government , notably over what he sees as its feeble response to American overfishing of Pacific salmon . He was not about "" to repeat the mistakes of the past "" and join in a closed - door deal on constitutional change , especially one talking of Quebec 's "" distinct society "" . His province 's voters would eat him alive , as one commentator put it , if he had backed that idea . His predecessor , Mike Harcourt , did so ( among other errors ) and has now retired from politics . 
 Mr Clark , who is alert to the public mood - and has a mere three - seat majority in his provincial legislature - will not jump on any constitutional bandwagon unless there is a large parade behind it . None is yet in sight Nor will appeals from Ottawa create one . The salmon war is just the latest episode in British Columbia 's long alienation from the federal government : a local saying has it that "" it is 3,ooo miles from Victoria [ the provincial capital ] to Ottawa , but 30,ooo from Ottawa to Victoria . "" As for love of Quebec , though Mr Clark used that very phrase this week , one statistic is worth citing : west of the Rockies ( indeed , you can add in the two prairie provinces east of them ) , Canada has more people whose mother - tongue is Cantonese than French . 
 In Quebec , the Calgary declaration has elicited scorn and contempt from separatists . The nine premiers had made plain that they see no hope of constitutional change while a party that simply wants out is in charge of the province , and the PQ was happy to prove them right . 
 "" Etymological pirouettes , "" scoffed Jacques Brassard , Quebec 's minister for intergovernmental affairs , at the decision to replace "" distinct society "" with "" unique character "" . The only way to satisfy Quebec , he argued , was to recognise that "" Quebeckers are a people""-which , he reckoned , le Canada anglais would never accept ( possibly , English - speaking Quebeckers would add , because , were the phrase meant to include them , which it is n't , it is untrue ) . 
 Mr Bouchard , ever one to interpret an inadequate offer as a gross insult , was just as damning . Any package built around the framework would leave Quebec "" socially unique , politically a eunuch , "" he said .

JEAN CHRETIEN is not the best known or most charismatic of world leaders. Yet there could have been a smug smile on the Canadian prime minister's face this week, as, fresh from a visit to Moscow, he took off for a Commonwealth summit in Edinburgh. No other major country's leader can boast of such fiscal virtue, or so large a swing to it so swiftly achieved. 
In 1993-94, the fiscal year halfway through which Mr Chretien and his Liberal party were swept to power, he and his new finance minister, Paul Martin, inherited a huge federal budget deficit. It turned out, when the final count was made, to have risen from C$28 billion (about $21 billion) five years earlier, to C$42 billion, 5.9% of GDP. Last week Mr Martin announced the outturn for 1996-97: C$8.9 billion, the lowest money figure in 20 years, and, in terms of GDP, at 1.1%, the best since 1970-71. 
The deficit was not just low but far lower than Mr Martin had forecast. Presenting his budget in March 1996, he expected C$24 billion; a year later, he still foresaw C$19 billion, once 1996-97's last accounts were in. Now he finds the red ink halved and by 1998-99, at latest, he expects to be in balance. And not by accident. 
The big factor has been a rising economy: Canada has come out of stagnation in 1995 to healthy growth-at an annual rate of 5% in the second quarter of this year, almost too healthy for its central bank's comfort. But that was not pure luck either. When they took office in October 1993, Mr Chretien and his finance minister did not just promise fiscal rectitude and sit down. They set out to sell the idea-and had their reward last June, when a government that had savaged public spending was reelected, if not by a landslide as in 1993, at least with a modest overall majority. 
Two figures stand out from Mr Martin's report on 1996-97. Federal ""programme"" spending (essentially, everything but interest on debt) fell-in the 12 months before Mr Chretien went for an early election-by over 6%. Second, the usual red ink of what Mr Martin delicately calls ""normal yearend accounting adjustments""-in plain English, when the overspenders own updid not flow. For years, these adjustments have put several billions on the deficit; this time they cut it. It is not just the economy that has changed, but the fiscal culture. 
The markets recognise that. In January 1995 Canada's Treasury was paying slightly above 1 1/2 percentage points more for tenyear money-a standard test of market confidence-than was the United States. Today it pays nearly half a point less. Federal debt was cut last year, after 21 years of repeated, often rapid, increase. At 73% of GDP it is still high; debt service takes 32 cents of every tax dollar. But here too virtue has paid, as the government has shifted more of its borrowing-two-thirds by now-into less risky, and over time less costly, long-term debt. 
How was it done? Within government, by jaw-boning and arm-twisting. Once in office, Mr Martin soon saw that debt and the deficit really were huge problems. Mr Chretien, quickly convinced, has given him solid support ever since. Rolling fiscal targets were no longer set five years ahead but two, so virtue could not be put off. Hard decisions were taken-and some spending pushed off to provincial governments. Federal programme spending has fallen from C$120 billion in 1993-94 to C$105 billion, and by now, claims Mr Martin's number two, Jim Peterson-with a touch of hyperbole?-the cabinet climate is such that a would-be spender's first question is not how much can he have but where will the cash come from. And the old rule of ""spend it this year, or you've lost it"", has gone. 
As important, the voters were brought in on the act. From late 1994, an all-party parliamentary committee, chaired by Mr Peterson, held public hearings in various cities on budget issues. Mr Martin and his team explained the problem. Business and bleeding-heart lobbyists were brought to give their views at the same meetings, so both (and the public) could see that both were being heard, and what both wanted. The result-aided recently by economic recovery-has been a broad consensus: not, of course, on how to slim the deficit, but that slimmed it must be. 
Provincial governments too have taken the road to fiscal virtue. They had little choice. The federal government in 1993-94 was transferring C$27 billion a year to them, and it was not minded to tighten its belt while lavishing hand-outs on others who did not; that transfer has shrunk by C$5 billion. And the provinces were already under pressure: at its peak, in 199293, their collective deficit hit C$25 billion, thanks to C$140 billion in programme spending and heavy debt-service on top. 
Full figures for 1996-97 will show that deficit down to C$7 billion, with five of the ten provinces in surplus. Revenues are well up; spending, after two years of modest rises, down to C$137 billion. Though the two biggest provinces, Ontario and Quebec, are still well in the red, all played their part, whatever their politics. It has not been done easily, nor always willingly. It has been tempting, and in part true, to blame federal meanness for provincial cuts. And at provincial level the grand old tradition that voters sack tight-fisted governments is yet to be solidly disproved. 
And now? With private-sector forecasters expecting growth of 3.7% this year and next, Canadians are already seeing more jobs-about 12m more, bringing the total above 14m, in the past two years-and unemployment down, if still high, at 9%, from its 10% peak a year ago. 
And what happens when the ""fiscal dividend"" arrives, the surplus that would be there if no new tax or spending changes were made? As a guideline, says Mr Martin, half will go to social spending, half to debt reduction and to tax cuts, for special groups first, broader ones later. Just what gets how much will be decided year-by-year. But for a tough-minded finance minister just after, not before, an election, Mr Martin is surprisingly ready to talk, not only of further fiscal rectitude or slimming the state, but of public investment in the nation's future. Many have seen him as a likely successor to Mr Chretien. Perhaps he agrees. ","Once famously spendthrift , Canada is the new star of sober public finance

LUCIEN BOUCHARD, the separatist premier of Quebec, is at least the fourth, arguably the third, maybe even second bestknown of Canada's politicians. Daniel Johnson, leader of Quebec's provincial Liberals is rapidly winning an unchallenged first place-as the most ridiculed of them. 
The darts recently aimed at him have been less than subtle. One radio talk-show host said that Mr Bouchard, who is onelegged, would best Mr Johnson in any contest, ""even the 100-metre sprint"". A cartoonist spelled out the word ""pathetic"", lest anyone miss the point of his caricature of a dumbstruck Mr Johnson. Nor is the ridicule coming from the province's ruling Parti Quebecois (PQ): most of it has come from the federalist camp, which, in theory, Mr Johnson leads. It hardly makes the ideal run-up to the provincial election widely expected this year, perhaps even this spring, and-if the PQ wins-yet another referendum on secession thereafter. 
What has gone wrong? No cabal is plotting against Mr Johnson, no pretender to his threadbare mantle waiting impatiently in the wings. The short answer is that Quebec's federalists have at last realised what Mr Bouchard and the PQ have known for years: that separatism's best assurance of success is called Daniel Johnson. 
Poor Mr Johnson has done nothing special to deserve this new outpouring of venom-and that is why it is pouring out. The technocratic scion of one of Quebec's leading political families, he has never been a man to cut much of a figure, and lately he has been so absent from public debate as to be invisible. That might have been all right any other winter. But in last month's ferocious ice storm, Quebeckers wanted their leaders on hand. And just that, for two straight weeks, Mr Bouchard was. He limped from press conference to emergency shelter to helicopter-borne photo-opportunity. Where there were stricken Quebeckers, there was their premier, not chopping firewood or shinning up battered electricity pylons, maybe, but promising relief, handing out cheques and, of course, improving his own prospects of re-election. And Mr Johnson? He was as active as a tree entombed in ice. 
His explanation: he is above exploiting a weather crisis for political ends. As critics remarked, he might at least have used the quick and generous response to the disaster from the rest of Canada as a federalist selling-point to the 20% of undecided Quebeckers. Is he simply waiting for the election campaign before getting to work? It is true that he is at his best once the pressure is on, and usually exceeds expectations. 
Or could it be that he feels a trifle cool towards the rest of the country, and is not inclined to sing its praises? Quebec's Liberal leaders have often felt squeezed between their federalist allies elsewhere and their own voters, and Mr Johnson these days is especially uneasy. The government-led by Jean Chretien, a Quebecker much disliked by separatists-last year asked the Supreme Court to decide whether, constitutionally, Quebec could secede at all. Hearings are about to begin. Though a ruling is still months off, Mr Johnson and most other Quebeckers feel that referring so political an issue to Canada's highest court will only fuel support for independence. 
At the least the notion that a federal institution can decide Quebec's future should help Mr Bouchard as he heads into his first provincial campaign since taking over the PQ after it lost the 1995 referendum. Not that he seems to need any boost. His cabinet may be racked by infighting between the old guard and the new, between hard-line separatists and soft-pedallers, but most Quebeckers take a PQ victory for granted. 
Mr Johnson, for his part, can look back to 1966 and another politician who was written off long before election day. He too faced an unwinnable fight in Quebec against a politician, its then premier, thought to be unbeatable; and won it. His name: Daniel Johnson, Senior. ","MONTREAL

His own personal views are more liberal than conservative. Yet he has been a lifelong Conservative. In 1986, at the age of 27, he became a minister in a Conservative federal cabinet. He has rebuilt the Tory party as its leader since the voters booted it savagely out of office in 1993.

In Canada's unusual political system, provincial parties have little to do with, indeed may be at odds with, federal ones of the same name. 
Though the federal Liberals, under Jean Chretien, swept to power in 1993, Mr Johnson was edged out of it in Quebec in 1994 by the separatist Parti Quebecois. The separatists then lost a referendum on secession in 1995; but only by a hair's-breadth, and Mr Johnson could claim little credit. He was widely forecast to lose again to the rQ in the election that its new leader and Quebec's provincial premier, Lucien Bouchard, was expected to call later this year. Though polls have shown separatism losing ground, the likely result would have been yet another Quebec referendum, and-at best-another long period of turmoil. 
In sum, Mr Johnson was seen as a loser and a liability, Those judgments were not new. But last month they became louder. The last straw for him, say some in his party, was when his wife plonked on his breakfast table an article in The Economist saying so (a planted article, suggested some Canadian media, perhaps unaware of this paper's potent herbicides). Whatever the cause, Mr Johnson decided to go. 
All eyes at once turned to Mr Charest. A dogged, passionate man, he did much to swing the 1995 referendum the federalists' way. And he was seen as the only person capable of beating Mr Bouchard. Pressure poured in on him to abandon his federal party and go to head the Liberals of Quebec. A draft, the media called it. In fact, it was more of a press gang. Mr Charest does not want the job. A member of Parliament for 14 years, he has always wanted to be one thing only: prime minister of Canada. And he knows that in Canada provincial success habitually becomes a federal curse. He spent all of last week saying no. 
Yet even if he would sooner stay in ottawa, rebuilding the federal Tories (and though he has gone some way since they were cut to just two seats in 1993, there is still far to go), most Canadians expect Mr Charest to accept what many are presenting as his patriotic duty. He knows there is no one else, certainly not in the Quebec Liberal caucus. The only people this week who seemed to wish him to go on saying no were his family, and his party, well aware that he is all that stands between it and dismissal at the hands of the Reform Party. Plus, of course, the PQ, which expected to walk over Mr Johnson, but which, say opinion polls, would probably lose an election-and certainly a referendum, if after all it was re-elected-to Mr Charest. 
This Tuesday, Mr Charest gave the first hints that he might, after all, be bound for Quebec city. ""No"" turned into ""maybe,just give me time to think"" What would guide him, he said, was a determination not to be ""unduly influenced by partisan logic"" and a desire to ""best serve my country-which happens to include Quebec."" By the end of this week many expected ""maybe"" to have become ""yes"". 
The Quebec job, if he takes it on, will not be easy, and winning provincial power would be only the first step. Mr Charest is rightly concerned about the federal Liberals' habit of trying to call the tune in his home province. Whatever else may have prompted Mr Johnson to resign, that habit was certainly one reason. And it, combined with the exaggerated, even desperate public expectations of him, could help to undermine Mr Charest's leadership if indeed he jumps. Yet if he stays in Ottawa, he will be forever the man who heard his calling and covered his ears. Damned perhaps if he does, but surely damned if he doesn't. ","Canada has been through two separatist referendums in Quebec, nearly losing the second. If it is to avoid a third, it needs the right man to lead the fight for unity. But will he? 
TO MANY Canadians, Jean Charest has always been the right man in the wrong party. He comes from Quebec, a province that is determined]y Liberal when it is not in the hands of separatists. His own personal views are more liberal than conservative. Yet he has been a lifelong Conservative. In 1986, at the age of 27, he became a minister in a Conservative federal cabinet. He has rebuilt the Tory party as its leader since the voters booted it savagely out of office in 1993. Yet today, at the age of 39, he may be about to switch party-and perhaps save the unity of his country in doing so.

The economy is doing fine. The federal Parliament is firmly under control. Yet it took no ear to the ground to catch rumblings of unease. 
Why? The economic signs are green indeed. Last month the finance minister, Paul Martin, brought in a balanced budget, Canada's first for 28 years. Unemployment has fallen to 8.6%, the lowest in eight years. The Canadian dollar has recovered from the worst of its Asian jitters, although the New York bond-raters are yet to restore the triple-A rating that Moody's removed from Canadian federal debt three years ago. 
In politics, the Liberals could not repeat last June their sweeping electoral victory of 1993, but they still have an overall parliamentary majority of nine, and the four opposition parties are unlikely ever to combine enough to threaten it. This being the first convention after an election, the party's constitution requires it to vote whether or not to review the leadership (translation: dump a loser). But Mr Chretien will win his vote of confidence handsomely. 
Even so, many Liberals would be happy to see him replaced, certainly before the next federal election and preferably before Quebec's premier, Lucien Bouchard, can mount yet another referendum on secession. Mr Chretien comes from Quebec, and has held a Quebec seat in Parliament for 35 years. But what many Quebeckers best remember of his career is the way he opposed the special status that the Meech Lake accord of 1987-one of Canada's repeated attempts to end its constitutional discordwould have given their province. He was seen as a liability in the referendum that the separatists all but won in 1995. He would be so in a fresh one. 
Such a vote may be near. Before calling it, Mr Bouchard and his Parti Quebecois (PQ) must first go for re-election. He will do so by early 1999 at latest.And, conveniently for him, Canada's Supreme Court is fairly soon to rule, on a reference from the federal government that it heard last month, whether secession is even possible under Canada's constitution. It will probably say no, and many Quebeckers will resent that, asking what exactly entitles judges-and all-Canada judges at that-to tell them what they can or cannot do with their own province in so plainly political a matter. 
So a Quebec election is certain soon, a referendum possible. To fight Mr Bouchard, the provincial Liberals are already seeking a leader to replace Daniel Johnson, who resigned this month. Even in the election, though the two parties are not close, it would help if the federal Liberals had in place a new leader more popular in Quebec than Mr Chretien. For a referendum that could be essential. But time is short. Several of Mr Chretien's ministers are already positioning themselves for the race. 
The combination that the PQ most fears would be that of Jean Charest, now leader ofthe federal Conservatives, reborn as leader of the Quebec Liberals, and Mr Martin, he too a Quebecker, as prime minister. Though he hesitated last week, the betting is that Mr Charest will make the switch soon. And Mr Martin's star is rising. 
His success at his job has long made him the heir-apparent to Mr Chretien. He has a further merit. He is seen as being to the right, and the Liberals fear that, if Mr Charest goes off to Quebec, the two rightwing federal parties may get together-the Conservatives, strong in the English-speaking east and in Ontario, and Reform, strong in the west. A competent, eloquent Quebecker, popular with business, could suit the Liberals nicely. And Mr Martin's budget was not just balanced but politically skilful. Not least, he cut the ground from under a rival, the health minister, Allan Rock, from the Liberal left, by committing C$2.5 billion ($1.8 billion) of the future budget surplus to a ""millennium"" education fund: fiscal virtue, popular pay-off. 
Another potential candidate (and victor over Mr Rock in a recent cabinet tussle about drug-patent legislation) is the industry minister, John Manley. His route to popular appeal has been appearance in a wellwatched television soap.

The woman to watch-Sheila Copps having slipped down a rung from being deputy prime ministeris Jane Stewart, whose father and grandfather were notable Ontario politicians, and who is making a success of the difficult portfolio of Indian affairs.

NOT so long ago, the president of the United States would have figured as headmaster at a ""summit of the Americas"". In Santiago last weekend Bill Clinton was only the biggest-true, far the biggest-boy in class; and almost in the dunce's cap for not having fast-track trade-negotiating authority. So, though the summit formally launched negotiations on the planned freetrade area of the Americas, the FTAA, the main subject at the Miami summit in 1994, lost its primacy to education. 
That was a topic just as worthy of study, and indeed the whole weekend curriculum was worthy, ranging from commerce to civics, plus a stem warning against playground drug-snorting. True, head-prefect Eduardo Frei, of Chile, had to struggle to make the class stick to the timetable. Cheeky Carlos Menem, a senior boy from Argentina, kept the rest waiting for the class photo. Several boys, led by Jean Chretien, from Canada, muttered in the corridors about the absence of a Cuban ex-pupil expelled for disobedience some years ago. Yet, all in all, the class was a success. The exams, though, are still to come. 
In the absence of fast-track, the summiteers emphasised the non-trade agenda: ""second-generation"" reforms to shore up Latin America's still fragile democracies and market economies by reducing poverty, increasing personal security and giving ordinary people better opportunities. 
Amid a host of good intentions, some ideas stood out. Democracy, the summit recognised, is not just a matter of free elections. Real justice and free media are needed for the exposure of corruption and wrongdoing, but both face threats from governments, criminals and the mighty in general. A training centre for judges and prosecutors is to be set up. And, though Peru and Mexico had doubts, the summit endorsed an American idea for the InterAmerican Human Rights Commission-an arm of the Organisation of American States-to appoint, this year, a special watchdog for freedom of expression. 
The OAs is also to establish an ""objective procedure"" for evaluating national efforts against drug-trafficking. Some countries hope this multilateral approach will prove effective enough to win repeal of the United States' law requiring yearly, unilateral ""certification"" (or not, in Colombia's case in 1996 and 1997) of its neighbours' drug-fighting zeal. White House officials hailed a new alliance against drugs; getting Congress to agree is another matter. 
Trade apart, however, the big item in Santiago was education, a subject long neglected. Education and training are the key to any country's future, and without them free trade may prove more of a threat to Latin America than an opportunity. Yet it is desperately short of them-and unequal access to what exists makes worse its already wide disparities of income. 
At Miami in 1994, the leaders set themselves a modest goal: primary schooling for all children, and secondary for 75% by 2010. Yet progress has been slow: of the relevant age-groups, only 85%, at the latest count, were at primary school, 36% at secondary school, with fewer than zoo% in higher education. The World Bank reckons 24m more school places are needed. 
Some countries, such as Chile, Argentina, Peru and Jamaica, should have little trouble meeting the target. Nor should Brazil, where enrolment in secondary schools jumped to 52% last year, says Paulo Renato de Souza, its education minister. Poorer countries have far to go: on present trends, says UNESCO, secondary-school enrolment in Bolivia, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua by 2010 will still be under 45%, and in Haiti just 17%. 
Quality varies widely. Rich children often attend good private schools (and thence may go on, as in Brazil, to benefit disproportionately from subsidised public universities). Standards in most Latin American public schools are low. The school day in many countries is only five hours, because classrooms have to be used in two shifts. Teaching materials are often poor; and teacher training has been neglected. 
More money will be needed. So will political commitment. In the past, even if reform was planned, often it did not happen, thanks to frequent changes of education ministers and weak bureaucracies. But things are moving. Brazil (where Mr de Souza has been three years in his job) is directing more of its spending to the poorest schools in its north-east. Chile has extended the school day. Argentina has raised the school-leaving age. Costa Rica plans to put a computer in every school. Bolivia and Colombia have decentralised school management. But much more needs to be done-in teacher training, for example. 
Santiago may mark a turning-point for Latin American education. Spurred by the summit, the Inter-American Development Bank and the World Bank have rejigged their priorities: between them, they are offering $8.z billion over the next three years for education, an area they once ignored. In June, education ministers will meet in Brasilia to discuss the use of new technology in schools, development of common school testing systems, and teacher exchanges. 
Ironically, Latin America's most effective educational performer was not in Santiago. Mr Chretien, whose country will hold the next summit in ""two or three"" years' time, said he would like Cuba invited then. The United States will block that unless Fidel Castro meanwhile proves he has learnt the lesson of democracy. Perhaps others could learn not from the content but the zeal of education in Cuba?

THIS should have been foreign-affairstriumph week for Jean Chretien. Fresh from Santiago, where his country was chosen to chair the next stage of pan-American free-trade talks, had not Canada's prime minister sped to Havana, both to lecture Fidel Castro on human rights and to show the United States how to handle him? He had indeed, and lecture he did (albeit with no success whatever, to judge from Mr Castro's immediate public comments). But triumph there was none. What awaited him at home was a sordid matter of hepatitis-c 
Canadian politicians cannot afford to take risks with health. Flesh-eating bacteria all-but cost Quebec its present premier. Could a federal government be laid low by a disease of the liver? It could, if it had mismanaged the affair as Canada's authorities have. Mr Castro, something of a whizz in public health, whatever his other failings, may have been amused to see his visitor speed off on Tuesday, after two days and four solid hours of talk over dinner, for a quaint liberal-bourgeois function known as a ""vote of confidence"" on the issue. 
It has been no joke to Canadians. Mr Chretien had chosen to make the vote that evening one of confidence, and even so had to hurry home to ensure none of his Liberal parliamentarians broke ranks. 
His embarrassment springs from the slowness of the Canadian Red Cross, years behind its equivalent in the United States, to screen blood-donors adequately. A fouryear inquiry into Canada's blood system ended last November. It concluded that some 1,200 people, haemophiliacs not least, had contracted the AIDS virus from transfusions of tainted blood; and a far larger number hepatitis- whose victims come to suffer from chronic fatigue and, about one in five, to die of liver cancer. The judge heading the inquiry, Horace Krever, had recommended that the government should compensate them all. Mr Chretien's team responded with an offer-C$30,000 a year for the rest of their shortened livesonly to those who had caught AIDS. 
Later, after haggling with the provinces, which share responsibility for health, it came up on March 27th with more: a oncefor-all package of C$1.1billion ($800m) for the 20,000-8,000 Canadians who had caught hepatitis: between 1986 (when the United States brought in an effective test and Canada should have but did not) and 1990 (when Canada caught up). Class-action suits for negligence had begun in three provinces. Critics of the government saw the offer as a move to head off court judgments that could cost billions. 
Even so, it offered nothing to 60,000 hepatitis victims who had received tainted blood before 1986. They were extremely angry-and both articulate and well connected. Their groups and supporters have effectively besieged the health minister,Allan Rock, and other Liberal MPS for the past month. They have held vigils outside Parliament, planted white crosses on its lawns, and paraded with red-and-yellow ribbons to hear how Irish victims of tainted blood won full compensation. 
Mr Rock is believed to have argued in cabinet for compensation for all, and did persuade the provinces to increase their contribution to the package. But he stood firm publicly, arguing that to compensate the earlier victims would set a precedent for medical mishaps (such as brain damage at birth and faulty breast implants) that might bankrupt the health system. The four opposition parties in the House of Commons have combined in a running debate and question periods to dismiss this lawyer's argument, demanding money for all. 
Enough Liberal backbenchers had expressed public sympathy for this view to cost Mr Chretien his overall majority of 11 (in a house of 301), had there been a free vote. But though all opposition parties made clear that they did not wish to bring the government down, he rejected a free vote: this was to be all or nothing. He rearranged his Cuban timings to let him get back for the vote and check that all his troops were on parade and in step. They were (including the chief whip, carted in from hospital where he was awaiting a heart operation The government won handily, by 155 votes to 140.

The four opposition parties in the House of Commons have combined in a running debate and question periods to dismiss this lawyer 's argument , demanding money for all .

THE slogan ""Unite the Right"" has been a rallying call, if largely a hollow one, in Canadian federal politics since 1993, when the Liberals, after nine years of rule by the Progressive Conservatives, swept back to power. The triumph of Jean Chretien and his party, and their more modest victory in 1997, seemed to prove that, while two parties on the right-the Conservatives and the Reform Party-attracted about equal numbers of votes, the Liberals were there to stay. 
True, Reform's strength was in the west, the Conservatives' in the east. But where the two right-wing parties clashed on roughly equal terms, as in Ontario, the electoral heartland, they merely handed the Liberals, even in 1997, an almost clean sweep. So what were they to do? Fight each other to the death? Make an electoral alliance? Merge? The Reform leader, Preston Manning, managed to persuade his party, at its two-yearly conference at the end of May, to try yet another approach. 
Mr Manning calls it the ""united alternative"" initiative. The Conservatives, limping along under an interim leader since Jean Charest changed flag to lead the antiseparatist provincial Liberal Party in Quebec, suspect this is just a grand name for a takeover bid. Yet the arithmetical arguments for uniting are compelling. 
In 1993 the Conservatives were reduced to 16% of the total vote and just two seats. In contrast, the Reform Party, originally an Alberta-based protest movement pledged to self-destruct in 2000, swept much of the west, taking 52 seats with 18% of the national vote. Last June Reform went further ahead, taking 60 seats, with 19%. The Conservatives took almost as many votes, but, their support being more evenly dispersed, only 20, mostly eastern, seats. In Ontario the two cut each other's throats, leaving the Liberals iol of its 103 seats. Yet in 29 of those seats the combined right-of-centre vote exceeded that of the Liberal winner; had the right fought as one, the Liberals, whose 38% of the national vote gave them a small overall majority in Parliament, would instead have fallen far short of that. It was in London, Ontario, to underline the strategic importance of the province, that the Reform Party met last week. 
Yet until Mr Manning at his evangelical best made his pitch, many delegates complained that his ""united alternative"" could spell the end of their populist movement and its pride in grassroots democracy, not to mention family values. Already their leader had dented Reform's stand against big government, when, talking recently of Canada's hepatitis-C scandal, he proposed compensation for all the victims-at a cost to taxpayers of several billion dollars more than Mr Chretien proposes. 
And just what is Mr Manning's alternative? He did not even sketch an outline, except to propose an assembly in early 1999 gathering all acceptable sorts of anti-Liberals (even ""soft"" Quebec separatists, but no feminists or gays). But he promised the result would not compromise Reform principles nor break the party, and left delegates believing Reform would control its direction. They voted overwhelmingly to let him organise the assembly, postponed the date of Reform's self-immolation to 2007 and gave Mr Manning a strong vote of confidence in his leadership. 
The Conservatives meanwhile are busy with their own affairs. They plan to elect a new leader under a novel system that gives all Canada's 301 constituencies equal weight and plays down the fun and games of a big convention. The choice is likely to lie between Joe Clark, a former party leader and, briefly, prime minister, and a new face, a 47-year-old political commentator and backroom strategist-though never a member of Parliament-Hugh Segal. 
Mr Clark, an Albertan of 59, may find it hard to make a comeback. His nine months leading a minority government in 1979-8o were unimpressive, though he did well in long years later (1984-91) as Brian Mulroney's foreign minister. Mr Segal is positioning himself slightly to Mr Clark's right as a fiscal conservative and an advocate of decentralising more power to the provinces. He remains scornful of Reform's hopes of eastward advance, given that party's insistence, oft-repeated at its London conference, on equality of citizenship-translation, no special status for Quebec. He has an advantage in being from Ontario, and is backed by Conservative leaders there. 
Both men are expected to declare their candidacy in mid-June. Mr Segal has already addressed 40 meetings in nine provinces, although the vote is not until October 24th. Whether the winner will even go to Mr Manning's jamboree next year, or what he would say there, is anyone's guess. ","OTTAWA

Canada's prime minister wants its capital reshaped. Many Ottawans don't 
EVERY 20 years or so a Canadian prime minister nearing the end of his time at the top has a yen to leave his mark, physically, on the national capital. John Diefenbaker, Conservative prime minister from 1957-63, did it. So did the Liberal Pierre Trudeau (1968-79 and 1980-84). Now Jean Chretien, in office since 1993, sees his chance-and many of the capital's citizens are eager not to let him take it. Diefenbaker's legacy to Ottawa was the improvement of Sussex Drive, to become the scene of state drives between Parliament and the prime minister's and governor-general's residences. Trudeau, a French-speaking Quebecker, back in the heyday of multiculturalism invited Douglas Cardinal, a Meti (a Canadian of mixed French and Indian descent) to design the Museum of Civilisation in Hull-Ottawa's twin city, part of the province of Quebec-on the north shore of the Ottawa River; and a Jew, Moshe Safdie, for the National Gallery of art on the south. Mr Chretien has set his heart on a scheme to demolish ""heritage"" buildings along 17 blocks of Metcalfe Street, and make a grand boulevard 90 metres wide leading up to the Parliament buildings. 
He persuaded the National Capital Commission (NCC) to make this the centrepiece of its document ""A Capital for Future Generations"", a vision of Ottawa for the next 50 years. Since the document was published on June 11th, debate about his proposed grande allee has swamped consideration of other worthwhile parts of the NCC plan for the rapidly changing city. 
The NCc has been under pressure. In its 40 years of life, it has turned the Rideau Canal into the world's longest skating rink, planned urban bicycle paths and ski trails in Gatineau Park, and cleared LeBreton Flats, once a timber town and the camping place of lumberjacks and fur-trading voyageurs. It has helped plan and build federal offices in Hull, which was a thriving lumber town half a century before Queen Victoria designated Ottawa as the national capital in 1857. Yet the commission could have done more. Expropriation brought into its hands about one-third of the urban space in the national-capital region (a rough square around Ottawa-Hull). It has had near C$100m ($70m) a year to spend. But it has failed to implement schemes that it talked of to take full advantage of the superb sweep of the Ottawa River by the Chaudiere Falls, and of its Gatineau and Rideau tributaries. 
Lately the NCC's budget from the Treasury Board has been cut, its staff reduced, the management of its many properties privatised. As two regional councils-those of Ottawa-Carleton, south of the river, and the Outaouais, north of it-have extended their sway over public transport, utilities and policing, and as municipalities on the southern side prepare for amalgamation into a single, larger Ottawa, the reason for the NCC's very existence is being questioned and its secretiveness criticized. To survive, its chairman, Marcel Beaudry, planned its new visionary document, pulling unfinished schemes together. 
Enter, last November, Mr Chretien, eager to leave his stamp on the city. But what stamp, when so much is changing already? Confederation Boulevard, embracing Sussex Drive and the roads past a cleaned-up Parliament and back through Hull, is virtually complete. The Americans are building a massive new embassy, on the west side of Sussex Drive, sideways-on to the Parliament building, to replace the old embassy across the square from it. That offers space on the south side of this square. Not grand enough for Mr Chretien, it seems. Then NCC staff showed him a sketch of the Metcalfe boulevard, and he went for it. 
The boulevard idea, mimicking Haussmann's work in Paris and Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, dates back to 1916, when Parliament's buildings burned down and it had to meet in the museum at the far end of Metcalfe Street. The idea resurfaced in the late 19q os, when the then prime minister, W.L Mackenzie King, recruited a French planner, Jacques Greber, who had redesigned parts of Bordeaux and Marseilles, as an adviser. The costs have soared since then, of course; today's estimate, expropriations included, is C$500m. 
Mr Grebers 1950 master plan for Ottawa included parkways, a green belt and relocation of the then city-centre railway station, but no grand boulevard. The old rail track became a main approach to the centre along the Rideau Canal. And that is right, says John Leaning, a ""heritage"" architect: this angular approach-the canal bends through 60 degrees in its final stretch-is what defines Ottawa as a romantic and informal city in a pastoral landscape, not a classical one like Washington. 
One regional councillor, Clive Doucet, argues that Ottawa is now linked east and west by a series of ""agoras"", market meeting-places; the boulevard would be a windswept absurdity in Canada's sub-Arctic climate, he says. The Conservative-led city council is hostile. Forget the boulevard, says another Ottawa architect, Barry Padolsky, and start looking at more useful ideas from the NCC, such as developing the Chaudiere Falls area-where a paper mill still operates-for tourists and a mixed-use waterfront, including housing and a centre celebrating 19th-century logging technology. 
But the NCC is not a democratic body. It is government-appointed, and depends for its clout on the prime minister's backing and the Treasury Board's purse. So far, no influential Liberal voices have spoken out against Mr Chretien's grand boulevard. ","Jean Chretien's wants its capital reshaped . Many Ottawans do n't

WILL Lucien Bouchard go for an election? When Quebec's secessionist premier announced a month-long tour of his province, many Canadians saw it as the prelude to just that, and-should his Parti Quebecois (PQ) win a fresh mandate-to yet another referendum on secession. Then, last week, just before he set off, came a decision from Canada's Supreme Court on the issue which was widely forecast to give him the ammunition he needed. 
The court had been asked in 1996 by the federal government to rule whether, in law, Quebec could secede unilaterally. It was expected to-and did-answer no. Quebec has other issues: health care, education and deficit reduction. But Mr Bouchard is, above all, a separatist: he wants to make his province an independent country. Support for that, even within its French-speaking majority, is fickle; the only sure fuel for stoking it up is insult or injury, real or imagined, from English Canada. So it was assumed that Mr Bouchard would take the court's decision, hurl his indignation at it and, master of emotion that he is, urge Quebec's voters to show theirs. 
He did not. When the ruling was delivered on August 20th, Mr Bouchard joined the chorus celebrating its conclusions. No matter that most of the others singing its praises were sworn enemies of secession. Everyone could find something to his taste in the ruling, and its 78 pages offered plenty of scope for interpretation. The Ottawa Citizen's headline, ""One ruling, two solitudes"", neatly summed up the different spins put on it by Mr Bouchard and the federal prime minister,Jean Chretien. 
The nub of the ruling was that Quebec has no right to unilateral secession, under Canada's constitution or international law. Mr Chretien seized on that, recalling how Jacques Parizeau, Mr Bouchard's predecessor as premier of Quebec, had a unilateral declaration of independence ""in his back pocket"" for use had he won (as he very nearly did) the province's 1995 referendum. 
But the nine judges (three of them from Quebec) ranged wider than this. So Mr Bouchard could skip nimbly over their basic point to applaud selectively their declaration that ""a clear majority on a clear question"" in a future referendum would impose a duty on the federal government and Canada's other provinces to negotiate constitutional changes. True, the court had added that negotiations would cover a wide range of issues, not just the logistics of secession, and that ""no negotiations could be effective if their ultimate outcome-secession[were] cast as an absolute legal entitlement"". But the court accepted, Mr Bouchard affirmed, text at hand, that the central point would indeed be sovereignty for Quebec, not a new shape for Canadian federalism. And if federal intransigence were to bring the negotiations to an impasse? Then Quebec, in practice-as the court recognisedmight unilaterally proclaim its sovereignty and, yes, might eventually win Canadian and international recognition. 
Too selective by half, the federal intergovernmental-affairs minister, Stephane Dion, wrote to Mr Bouchard this week: ""The time for stratagems is over."" Besides the issues it fancied, Quebec would have to negotiate on those raised by others, he argued-not least, its borders. Nor could it claim a right to secede anyway if the talks bogged down. 
Critics of the Supreme Court's habit of going beyond narrow rulings of law say its decision is a venture into political activism. Others lament that the decision seems to be written for a high-brow rather than a high-school audience, and-selective quotation apart-leaves great potential for misunderstanding and dispute. 
Most obviously, what did the judges mean by a ""clear majority"" in a referendum? Mr Bouchard said this would be a matter of quality; quantity was not at issue, and 50% plus one would be enough, provided the voting and counting procedures were unchallenged. Newfoundland, he pointed out, joined Canada in 1949 with only 52% support in a referendum. 
Mr Dion challenged this view too, adding for good measure that Ottawa would also evaluate the clarity of any referendum question. Meanwhile, Mr Chretien, on a tour of western Canada, hardened his line on numbers, pointing out that it requires a two-thirds vote among cardinals to elect a pope. A former leader of Quebec's Liberals, Claude Ryan, has suggested the minimum should be a majority of registered voters-in practice, to judge from the 1995 referendum, maybe 53-55% of those who actually vote. But Jean Charest, installed this spring as the Quebec Liberals' leader, acknowledges that a plain 50% plus one was accepted in both the 1980 and the 1995 referendums. The only way to avert another one under the same rule, he says, is for the Liberals to win the coming provincial election. 
Coming when? Back to Mr Bouchard. The PQ has crept back up in the polls after the boost the Liberals got when Mr Charest took over the leadership. And Mr Bouchard still scores higher than his young opponent in polls of public confidence. But years of cuts in Quebec-and little of the economic good fortune that other provinces have enjoyed-have made the PQ vulnerable. As his tour started, Mr Bouchard was saying that nothing is less definite than a vote this autumn. Though he would be flouting Canadian custom, he could even carry on right to the end of his party's term and call an election in the autumn of 1999. A further 12 months of Quebec, Quebec, Quebec?

THE confusion of concurrent powers that Canada's constitution allots to its federal government and the ten provinces has long been a source of friction. Now it is generating more. 
The latest skirmish is over social policies and their finance. When the federal finance minister, Paul Martin, meets his provincial counterparts in Winnipeg on October 2nd, a big point at issue will benot, as in many countries, how to cut soaring welfare spending and deficits-but how best to spend the latest huge addition to the surplus of C$z3.7 billion ($15.3 billion) accumulated from 1992 to 1997 in unemployment insurance. But the argument may go much further than that: into complaints about the federal dumping of responsibilities without adequate federal grants to pay for them, and the overlap of powers itself 
The Constitution Act of 1867 listed some 30 subjects of exclusive federal jurisdiction, while allotting about 20 to the provinces. The list has not been formally amended since, nor yet have modern concerns, such as the environment or urban affairs, been added to it, despite other constitutional amendments and many administrative changes. In a few areas (agriculture, immigration and denominational schools), the constitution provides for shared responsibility. But in the 196os the federal government headed by Lester Pearson persuaded provincial ones to introduce health-care and social-assistance programmes, by offering to match spending for these provincial services. Thus the Canadian version of Medicare, invented in Saskatchewan, spread across Canada, and the Canada Health Act sets down such principles as equal access. 
The pendulum soon swung against this ""fiscal federalism"", as provinces argued that shared-cost programmes distorted their priorities. So, under Pierre Trudeau, the federal government introduced block grants, consolidating the federal contribution. The high tide of devolution came with Mr Martin's 1995 budget, when the federal deficit, which at one time had hit a peak of C$42 billion, was slashed (and has now vanished). Among his many economies to achieve this seeming miracle, one was to hand the provinces responsibility for financing Medicare and welfare. The centre guaranteed only to maintain a cash contribution of C$12.5 billion a year, and in fact saved itself about C$7 billion. But now public health services, for which provincial governments take the credit or blame, are under great strain. So is post-secondary education, another shared-cost venture. 
Meanwhile, federal finances are in clover. The national pension plan is being replenished by increasing premiums from workers and employers by 74% over six years, catching the baby-boomers to pay for their own retirement. The lists of the unemployed have been winnowed, to restrict access to what is now termed Employment Insurance (El). For example, new entrants to the workforce-and that includes married women actually re-entering it-have to work at least 7oo hours before they qualify for El payments, while others qualify with 400. In Ontario, Canada's biggest province, it is estimated that only one-third of the jobless can qualify. 
No surprise, the total of El payments has fallen fast. Of course other factors are involved. Above all, Canada's unemployment rate has dropped from over ii% in 1992 to 8.3% (though still in double figures among young people). Officials point also to a shift toward self-employment. Whatever the reasons, the Liberal government of Jean Chretien has piled up an El surplus of $20 billion, which has gone into its general revenue, and is publicly wondering what to do with this year's C$7.5 billion bounty. 
Every interest-group has its idea. Leaders of the four federal opposition parties held an unprecedented joint press conference on October 6th, to declare it would be larceny to channel the funds away from the workers; but, while the Conservatives and the Reform Party would reduce El premiums, particularly those paid by employers, the left-of-centre New Democrats and the Bloc Quebecois-also leftish when it is not plugging secession for Quebec-want benefits restored to more of the unemployed. The main voice of business has switched to calling for tax cuts. 
While paying down the federal debt is their first priority, Mr Chretien and Mr Martin are heading toward modest tax cuts, though also toward new social programmes with a federal flag stuck in them, such as drug coverage and home care. Mr Chretien was disappointed to win no public plaudits when (to conciliate Quebec, after its all-but vote for secession in 1995) Ottawa devolved powers in immigration and vocational training to the provinces. He is now also trying a return to fiscal federalism with a huge fund-C$2.5 billion, no lessfor ""millennium"" scholarships, as well as a new foundation to finance hospital and university research. 
The provincial premiers say EI premiums must be cut and their control taken out of federal hands (as with the pension plan, which is run by an independent commission). Some of the premiers, such as Ontario's Mike Harris, have already gathered credit for their own tax cuts, and run governments that are large employers. What the Winnipeg meeting will produce is unclear. But certainly it will not be a celebration of the overlap of powers. As outsiders do not often understand, and perhaps should, the clash between Canada's centre and its provinces extends far beyond the status of French-speaking Quebec.

Recent polls suggest victory for Lucien Bouchard, premier of the province, and his separatist Parti Quebecois (PQ). That would mean, later, a third referendum on secession and maybe the break-up of Canada. Jean Charest, leading the provincial Liberals, needs all the help he can get. The federal cabinet is stuffed with Quebeckers: the prime minister, Jean Chretien, his finance minister, Paul Martin, and others. So? So Mr Charest has told them, above all Mr Chretien, to shut up and keep out. 
With reason. Mr Chretien, popular elsewhere, is viscerally disliked in his home province. History is one reason. Long ago, it was a Quebecker, Pierre Trudeau, the federal prime minister-aided not least by Mr Chretien-who did much to fuel Quebec's resentments (and in 198o the PQ's first, badly lost, referendum). Today, Mr Chrtien's commitment to centralised federalism, then and now seen by Quebec nationalists as the cause of ""English"" Canada, makes him for them a kind of Uncle Tom. His personality reinforces that image: his mangled, backwoods French and folksy ways recall the old cliche of the ""pea-soup"" Quebecois, simple and compliant. 
Mr Chretien has also developed a habit of putting his foot in his mouth. Days before Mr Bouchard called the election, but when it was plainly in the offing, the prime minister told La Presse, Quebec's most influential newspaper, that the province's traditional demands had been met and that Canada's constitution (which Quebec has never signed) was unlikely to be amended to its liking. ""The constitution,"" he said, ""is not a general store."" Even the western-based Reform Party, which generally feels Quebec needs nothing so much as a firm hand, attacked his timing. Only one person is now urging Mr Chretien to go on speaking his mind on Quebec and playing a part in its coming election: Mr Bouchard. 
He too has reason. The PQ, then led by Jacques Parizeau, won back provincial power convincingly in 1994. But the 1995 referendum on secession that it called was going badly. Three men swung it round, to the point where the separatists came within a whisker of victory. One, recalled from Ottawa by a reluctant Mr Parizeau, was Mr Bouchard, at the time leading his own Bloc Quebecois in federal politics. The second was the provincial Liberals' then leader, the charisma-free Daniel Johnson. The third, in the judgment of many, was the unloved and blundering Mr Chretien. It took a fourth man to save the federalist cause: a then federal Conservative-Mr Charest. 
Nor is Mr Martin, the federal finance minister, deeply loved-though he is not deeply detested-in his own province. The world sees and praises in him the man who has tightened Canada's fiscal reins to the point, now, of a budget surplus. But he did that partly by cutting transfers to the provinces. Mr Bouchard, like other provincial premiers, has had to inflict a squeeze on his own budget. But Quebeckers have no deep addiction to private enterprise or rolling back the state. Their once backward economy-where business once largely meant English-Canadian business-has been developed partly by state enterprise. 
As campaigning starts, no one is offering Mr Martin's notions of virtue. Barely had Mr Charest pledged a io% tax cut than Mr Bouchard hit back with 9%. The Liberals promise heavy investments in health care. Back in power, says the rQ, it would pour C$2.i billion ($1.4 billion) into the same sector, even though it spent much of the past four years cutting $2.5 billion out. 
In sum, kith and kin, cousins and uncles from Ottawa, kindly stay away. ","YET again , on November 30th , Canada faces a crucial provincial election in Quebec .

Big Mac index offers a guide to whether currencies are at their ""correct"" level. It is based on purchasing-power parity-the notion that an identical basket of goods and services should cost the same in all countries. The Big Mac PrP is the exchange rate that would leave hamburgers costing the same in America as abroad. The chart calculates the under- or overvaluation of emerging-market currencies against the dollar. Thus, dividing the local-currency price of a Big Mac in Malaysia by its American price produces a dollar ,pp of 1.63 ringgit. The actual dollar rate is 3.80 ringgit-ie, the currency is 57% undervalued. The other Asian currencies are also undervalued. At the other extreme, the currencies of Venezuela, Argentina and Israel are overvalued. The chart also shows that the yen is 9% undervalued against the dollar; the r-mark is 14% overvalued.  1999 2000 will be a year in which the world shifts its balance. America's magnificent economy will slow; Europe and Asia will pick up the slack. Overall, the world will increase its wealth by 3.5%: a fine achievement. For the third of our population that lives in China and India, prosperity will grow at twice the speed of the rich world, to all our benefit. It will be the first year in which the majority of people on the Internet do not speak English: in America the web will be used as much by women as men. The Internet will become the language of the world. There has never been a revolution of this speed. The marriage of mobile phones and the Internet will give it a new twist. 
Many of the gloomy predictions-and gloomy realities-of the 20th century will be happily left behind. So too, for a while, will be that greatest curse: war between nations. There will be conflicts as some nations break up-in Central Asia and perhaps in Western Sahara, after a referendum on independence in July. But no wars. To be cheerful about 2000 consider only this. Of the 30 major elections that will be held, 16 will be in countries that 25 years ago were dictatorships. There will be four elections to watch. In March, Taiwan will hold an open and free vote; it will expose as humbugs all those Asian autocrats who hold that the East requires a Confucian and necessarily authoritarian (or corrupt) way of government. In July, the Russians go to the polls: an exercise that will prove the futility of democracy at the ballot box without a rule of law in the land. Russia's misery will continue. Look to Mexico on July 2nd. A country that has been a byword for cruelty, chaos and privilege is, not before time, to hold genuinely free elections in a society that is, piecemeal, equally genuinely reforming itself. And on November 7th, there is America's election. Months of scrutiny and campaigning and expense will produce two nearly identical candidates, each of whom will have his views carefully honed to a meaningless average. But lucky America to have evolved a system where leadership leaves its dogmas aside at the winning post. Note that whoever is elected-Democrat or Republican-will be a highly educated man. America's system is easily mocked but it does not produce fools. 
2000 will be a good year for Britain. Its economy will grow rapidly, one of Europe's star performers yet again. This trajectory means that Britain's wealth may overtake that of France for the first time in nearly 50 years. Britain's new-found prosperity comes from its trade with fellow Europeans. It will be a depressing oddity that, for yet another year, public debate in Britain will be dominated by animosity towards its neighbours. Elsewhere nationalism will be healthily relegated to sport. Watch out for the Olympics that start in Sydney in September, if you miss the old tribal certainties of fluttering flags and swelling pride in the home team. 
The World an 2000 is printed in Britain and America. It will appear in 16 languages from Japanese to Greek. Its mistakes, therefore, will be widely disseminated. I hope those things about it that are accurate or entertaining will also be well read and enjoyed. 
Dudley Fishburn  1999 Elections to the White House and the Kremlin will hold the world spellbound, predicts John Parker. Each will produce a marginal improvement. 
In July Russia will elect a new president. On November 7th America will do likewise. These elections mark the passage from the first to the second generation of post-cold war leaders. The two votes could hardly seem more different. One is taking place after eight years of unparalleled economic boom in a country where voters are mostly satisfied with the institutions of state. The other comes after eight years of unparalleled bust in a country where almost every state institution is in crisis. 
Nevertheless, there are links, and revealing ones. Both Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin have concentrated on their domestic economies, when they could. Both are ending their presidencies in scandal and disgrace. In both cases, their successors will have to inch their way towards a new international engagement. 
Russia's election is the more uncertain and the more constrained. Whoever wins will want to be a vigorous new broom: more interventionist at home, more aggressive abroad, harder to deal with all round. But at the same time, he will be hamstrung by Russia's enfeebled system of government, its corrupted economy and the calamitous condition of its armed forces. In practice, therefore, the year will see a struggle between the assertive ambitions of the new president and the ruinous realities of the country. This will be unnerving for everyone, Russians most of all. 
The American election is less explosively disruptive. 2000's election is exceptionally open. There is a chance that all three elected institutions of government might change hands. That has not been true for generations. Despite the years of prosperity, the presidential race will be close-far closer than appears from opinion polls. But Republicans have captured seven of the past 12 presidential elections. With the Democrat administration tainted by scandal, they are better placed to win back the White House than any time since 1980: the race is George W Bush's to lose. 
The House of Representatives is also likely to change hands. The Republicans' popularity is abysmal. They are defending the narrowest majority since 1951 (six seats)-and there are at least 30 close races. The Senate, where the Republicans have a majority of ten and are defending only half a dozen open seats, is less likely to change hands. But even here, a strong swing towards the Democrats would be enough to change control. In short, you could have almost any combination of outcomes: a continuation of the current division of government (Democratic president, Republican Congress); the mirror image; or unified government under either party. And as if that were not enough, it is unlikely that anyone will win well enough to dominate either chamber. This leads to the firm prediction that there will be more of the sort of gridlock that has characterised American government for the past few years. This need not be a weakness. There are no urgent matters in American life that require political solutions or sustained leadership. And the American public is too diverse, too splendidly kaleidescopic, to be led by some political or moral dogma, as the Republican right is learning to its cost. (Russia, by contrast, could well fall far such a shallow appeal.) 
The recent huge surpluses on the federal budget have fundamentally altered American politics: they mean there are no dire economic consequences from failure to agree on spending measures. All that happens as a result of gridlock is that the national debt is repaid faster-a desirable outcome. At home, gridlock matters little. But abroad, it matters more. The next ten years are likely to be a time of greater international instability than the past ten. The new Russian president is one reason for that, Chinese assertiveness another, nuclear proliferation a third. Then there is the unending rash of small conflicts that will require American attention and perhaps military intervention. While there is a broad public consensus that the United States should exercise some sort of leadership role in the world, there is no agreement on individual hard cases. This means the new president will face tougher choices, without a popular mandate for any particular action and, very possibly, without much support in Congress. There would be every reason to lament this muddle if the past ten years had not shown that a muddled America can still act swiftly and benevolently-something that will be long denied to a corrupt and bankrupt Russia, whoever its leader might be.  1999 America's slowdown will need to be balanced by growth elsewhere. Financial markets are unprepared for this, warns Clive Crook. 
Not for many years has the fortune of the world's biggest economy seemed so detached from conditions elsewhere. The United States continues to roar along. Early in 2000 it will set a new record for its longest uninterrupted economic expansion. You might have expected this breathless growth to help other countries: when America works up a sweat, as it were, the rest of the world gets a fever. Not this time. Europe, Japan and much of the third world have been growing only slowly of late. The global economy is weirdly out of joint. 
In the coming months this growth imbalance will start to be corrected. One thing is as clear as anything can be in the economic predictions business: the American expansion is going to cool. What is unclear is how abrupt the slowdown will be, and whether it will be offset by faster growth in the rest of the world. Could the braking be so severe as to drag the world back into recession? The odds are against it-but the risk is not to be dismissed. 
To many American economic commentators, this will seem a much-too-gloomy assessment. The recent mood in the United States has been triumphant, and understandably so. Growth in 1999 as a whole will come in at close to 4%, which is remarkable in the eighth year of expansion. But that is not the best of it. After nearly a decade of growth, the unemployment rate has fallen to barely 4%-yet there is no obvious sign, so far, of rising inflation. Many analysts suppose that this stunning performance will continue indefinitely. This year Wall Street raised its valuations of American corporations to levels that make sense only on that very assumption. The old rules say this cannot be right. Of course they do, reply the optimists, but the old rules no longer hold: the revolutions in computing and telecommunications have repealed them. 
Even if such exuberance is justified, the view that growth in America can continue for ever at its present rate is foolish. Suppose that the ""new economy"" is real; suppose that the long-term trend of growth in productivity is markedly steeper than before, thanks to advancing technology. Even this would be too little to sustain the American miracle. The reason is that inflation in the United States has been suppressed in the past couple of years by temporary factors-by those useful imbalances in the world economy, in fact. 
Europe's turn 
Slow growth in Europe and severe recessions in much of the third world have been a blessing in disguise for the United States. They created global spare capacity, pressing down on prices. Oil and other commodities have been dirt-cheap for most of the past two years, reducing consumer-price inflation in America by as much as a full percentage point a year during 1996-98. And sluggish demand outside the United States has also enabled America to finance its current-account deficit (reflecting its excess of investment over saving) at low interest rates and without a depreciation in the dollar. 
Now that demand is picking up in Europe and Asia, both of these special price-suppressing factors will fade: the cost of inputs will rise, and financing the deficit is going to call for higher interest rates or a lower dollar, either of which will push prices up. This is to say nothing of pressure for higher wages, which is also sure to mount (at the present very low rate of unemployment) unless growth cools. So if the economy fails to slow spontaneously, inflation will start to climb; and if inflation starts to climb, the Federal Reserve will have to brake the economy deliberately by raising interest rates. 
For these reasons, American growth will need to slow soon even if the ""new economy"" is real. Nonetheless, the more truth there is to the view that productivity growth has improved, the milder this slowdown will need to be. If the optimists are right about the new supply-side revolution, a soft landing both for the economy and for Wall Street is a pretty safe bet. The trouble is, the evidence so far suggests they are wrong. Growth in American labour productivity has improved in the past two years, as the optimists never tire of pointing outbut this improvement has been entirely concentrated, so far at least, in one small sub-sector of the economy (namely, rc manufacturing). Perhaps productivity growth will improve across the board in the years to come: it has not done so yet. 
This has two disturbing implications. The first is that the slowdown necessary to avoid inflation breaking out in the United States in 2000 will be noticeably large. The most recent iMa forecasts (which do in fact allow for some modest supply-side improvement) show growth slowing by more than a full percentage point, to 2.6%; even so, inflation drifts gently upwards. As it stands, that looks like a soft landing-though Wall Street in its present mood might find it something of a shock. Which brings us to the second worrying implication. If the new economy is a mirage, or anyway much less real than it has been made out to be, then present stockmarket valuations of American companies are indefensible. Once you combine the need for a cooling of aggregate demand with a stockmarket that is both overvalued and seemingly unprepared for even the mildest disappointment, you have the necessary ingredients for a much less graceful touchdown. 
In the past year, the world economy has had a lucky escape, and America's magnificent economy deserves the credit. As economies flagged around the globe, America kept the wheels of global commerce turning. Now a grand rebalancing is needed. If the world's luck holds, the coming year will see gently slower growth in America, a curbing of passions on Wall Street (but no crash), all combined with increasing strength in Europe, Japan and the emerging markets. It could happen-but don't bet more than you can afford to lose.  1999 Muslims will in the 2000s demand and win the freedom that their leaders have long denied them, predicts Brian Beedham. 
With fingers only lightly crossed, it is possible at the close of the 1990s to hope that the decade's biggest geopolitical ogre can now be laid to rest. Since the end of the cold war, with a ruined Russia and a China that still does not quite know what it wants to do in the world, too many people have been willing to believe that the next great danger to global peace and freedom would be the rise of a ferocious new Islamic superpower. As things stand, that looks increasingly unlikely. 
The two major Muslim countries where revolutionary Islam had seemed most dangerous, Iran and Algeria, are in different ways-one much better than the other-probably at last getting it under control. Even in remoter patches of chaos such as Sudan and Afghanistan things no longer look quite as bad as they once did. And, tighten those crossed fingers, quite a few Muslim countries have lately been making their first hesitant experiments with the idea of democracy. 
In Iran, once thought of as the epicentre of the clerical earthquake, something new is happening. A relatively free election in 1997 gave the Iranian presidency, by an overwhelming majority, to the liberal Muhammad Khatami. The ""supreme leader"" who stands above the president, the veteran Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, then proved much less intransigent than had been expected. The ayatollah has helped to get Iran back on speaking terms with much of the Arab world and with Europe, and has let President Khatami extend at least a tentative hand of reconciliation towards America. 
The struggle in Iran is not over. Ayatollah Khamenei remains more conservative than President Khatami; liberal newspapers can still get shut down; February's parliamentary election will show whether Iranians can vote as freely in 2000 as they did in 1997. Yet something has changed in the past few years. A middle ground has opened up between the most unbending of Iran's religious fanatics and the irreconcilables at the other end of the ideological spectrum. 
Something similar has happened in Algeria, though in a different way and far more Moodily. The savage civil war which began in 1992, when the army insisted on cancelling an election that a relatively moderate Islamist party looked like winning, seems to be grinding to a close. The army has more or less got on top of the brutally extremist guerrillas the war inevitably created. But the army, or at least its better part, has also been shaken by the war-by the huge casualty list, by the atrocities its own men have committed, by the damage done to the economy, and by the disapproving stares of Algeria's neighbours in Europe. The generals have therefore decided to let the politicians begin a dialogue with the more flexible Islamists the army had spurned in 1992. 
There are new flickers of light in other dark corners. Sudan's Islamists have suddenly accepted the principle of a free press, and have sent a small smile towards the country's exiled opposition. Even the Taliban regime in Afghanistan-the fundamentalists so narrow-minded that even the other fundamentalists noticed-shows some signs of rational thinking. 
The improvement is not confined to the parts of the Muslim world run by religious zealots. There are signs that Jordan and Morocco may grow more liberal under their young new kings; in the Gulf, little Kuwait, Qatar and Oman are letting more people vote, and vote more freely, in their elections; and on the other side of the globe huge Indonesia is currently digesting the consequences of its first real attempt at letting the people choose who will govern them. 
Add what may be the most telling fact of all-that the countries of the Muslim world, even the single-- language Arab part of it, have made virtually no progress towards real political solidarity over the past 50 years-and that nightmare of a pugnacious new Muslim superpower can be seen for what it is: the sort of bad dream you wake up from, shaking a puzzled head. 
The reality is less frightening than the dream for two reasons. The first is that ""the Muslim world"", though united by more or less the same religious beliefs, is otherwise divided into a dozen separate cultures and sub-cultures. Arabs are different from Turks, Turks from Persians, Persians from Pathans, Pathans from Punjabis, Punjabis from Bengalis, Bengalis from Malays and the Muslims of Indonesia. Even the 22 countries that share the Arabic language remain distinct political entities, held apart by disruptive variations of economics and history and by their rulers' desire to keep a grip on local power. It will never be easy to construct a potent international force out of so loose a club. 
The other part of the explanation will make it even harder. Like everybody else, today's inhabitants of all these assorted countries know far more about the rest of the world than their parents did, thanks to the electronics revolution of the late 20th century. The effects are an awkward mixture of envy and distaste; but for most Muslims, poor and unfree, the envy will probably be the stronger. They will increasingly want a richer and freer future than is likely to be provided either by religious puritans or by corrupt army-backed dictators. 
Until now, few Muslims have been able to use their individual judgment about anything. Except for the handful recently made rich by oil, most of them have always lived in rural or pastoral poverty; being poor, they have been easily kept under the heel of dictatorial rulers; above all, the interpretation of Islam-of God's will-has long been the monopoly of a handful of selfselected wise men who believed they knew what others should think and do. 
Now, the economics of the modern world offers an escape from poverty. One group of Islamic revivalists is urging that all good Muslims should have an equal voice in the interpretation of God's will. If individual judgment can be used in religion, it will surely be used in politics too. The same sort of change, for rather similar reasons, began in the Christian world half a millennium ago. Look forward to a Muslim Reformation. 
Brian Beedham: associate editor, The Economist.  1999 The British economy may soon overtake the French, for the first time in a generation, predicts John Grimond. Don't take it too seriously. 
Few rivalries provide as much entertainment for onlookers as that between France and Britain, or rather between their peoples, the Frogs and the Rosbifs. They do not hate each other, as some neighbours do. But nor do they love each other. Each admires certain features of the other: cuisine, chic, paysage on the one hand; dogs, literature, phlegm on the other. But the qualities they respect in each other are far outweighed by those they despise. 
And hence their rivalry, a rivalry made all the more intense by what the two countries have in common: a similar sense of nationhood, a similar proud history, a similar claim to a role on the world stage, a similar diminution of that role, a similar size of population and a similar size of economy. It is this economic similarity that will ere long excite feelings of superiority (among the Brits), derision (among the French) and perhaps amusement (among others): some time in the not-toodistant future, headlines in British newspapers will triumphantly proclaim that Britain's gross domestic product has overtaken France's. 
The claim will be phoney, but never mind, it will have numbers to support it. They will show that when the value of French GDP, measured in euros, is converted into dollars, it is smaller than that of Britain's GDP, measured in pounds and then also converted into dollars. Calculated this way, the two economies are indeed about the same size already: France's GDP was $1.4 trillion in 1998, Britain's $1.37 trillion. Though the French economy has been growing nicely in 1999, at about 2.3%, and is set to do even better in 2000, the euro has been weak and the pound strong. 
The British newspapers that will trumpet Britain's new economic prowess most loudly will be those that also fulminate against the Eu and especially its latest piece of ""integrationist lunacy"", the single currency. Yet if the claim that Britain's economy has overtaken France's can be made at all-and it should be pointed out that, in the foreign-exchange markets, no future event can ever be considered certain-then it will be a claim that can be made only because of the euro. In other words, had it not been for horrible economic and monetary union (so ruthlessly promoted by the diabolical Frenchman, Jacques Delors, when he ran the European Commission), Britain's economy would still be unambiguously behind France's. 
That is where it is, on any sensible reckoning, and where it is likely to stay, at least for a while. To compare economies by valuing them at market exchange rates can give an utterly misleading picture. Exchange rates vary wildly, and are influenced by factors such as interest rates, capital transfers, government policy and so on, not merely by pure international trade. That is why inter-country comparisons are usually based on the concent of purchasing-power parity, which values currenties in terms of how much is required to buy an identical basket of goods and services in the countries concerned. On this reckoning, the British economy (at $1.30 trillion in 1999) is about 4.5% smaller than the French one ($1.37 trillion). 
However, even this calculation may well be inaccurate. In all countries, plenty of economic activity, from building and baby-sitting to prostitution and drug-dealing, goes unrecorded. It is conceivable that, if all of this were taken into account, Britain's economy might turn out to be genuinely bigger than France's. 
Conceivable but unlikely. It is widely believed that it was a decision to include the underground economy in the official figures that lay behind il sorpasso, Italy's celebrated, yet shortlived, overtaking of Britain back in 1987. But the underground economy is almost certain to be larger in a highly taxed and highly regulated country, such as France, than in a laisser faire country such as Britain. 
But does size matter? Since the two countries' populations are virtually the same-France's is smaller by less than half a million people, unless the overseas departments are included-a bigger economy means bigger GnP per person, so the French are, on average, richer than the Brits. This will not come as a surprise to the millions of Britons who go to France for their holidays each year. They may not be able to see that the French have more telephones and more washing-machines, or even that they have lower infant mortality and deaths from cancer. But they can hardly help but notice that the French have swankier clothes, smarter trains and proportionately more cars. Competitive Brits may, however, take comfort from the latest Human Development Report issued by the United Nations. In 1999, its annual ""human development index"" put Britain ahead of France for the first time. So there.  1999 The Spanish-speaking world is acquiring a style, sophistication and influence that, says Daniel Franklin, will affect all our lives. 
Starting in 2000, would-be American presidents will be at a dangerous disadvantage unless they can appeal to voters in Spanish as well as in English. Hispanic-Americans are growing rapidly not only in numbers (31m and rising) but in confidence and clout as well. Beyond the United States, too, the Spanish-speaking world, which extends across more than 20 countries in three continents and includes over 350m people, is set to become a force to be reckoned with once again. Prepare for a new breed of cultural and commercial conquistadors. 
This may sound implausible to those who have come to take inexorable Anglo-Saxon pre-eminence for granted. A crude but credible view of the Hispanic world's history is that, after Spain's imperial power peaked, it has been downhill for much of the past 400 years. As the Spanish-speaking world's influence declined, that of the English-speaking world rose, carried ever higher first by the British empire and then by America. Even now, it would be easy to look at the troubles of Latin America and conclude that it is too early to talk of a turn in fortunes. You will see guerrilla insurgency (Colombia), debt default (Ecuador) and economic recession (much of South America). Swathes of Spanish-speaking countries are still desperately poor and plagued by high crime. In too many of them, scant regard for the rule of law holds back development. 
Yet look again, and you will see that many of the pieces are in place for a powerful Hispanic resurgence. One of the pieces is democracy. All but one of the Spanish-speaking countries are now democracies of sorts, the exception being Fidel Castro's Cuba. Democracy, of course, is no guarantee of good government. But it is an improvement on dictatorship. The countries with the deepest democratic roots, from Chile to Costa Rica, tend to have the strongest civil institutions. 
Next, there is trade. The inward-looking, import-substituting model of economic development having failed, Latin Americans have sensibly abandoned it. They have opted instead to open markets and enter into trade-liberalising agreements, whether with one another (Mercosur, the Andean Community, the Central American Common Market) or, in Mexico's case, with its North American neighbours. Thanks to the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mexico's economy has boomed with America's. 
Hip, hip, Hispanidad 
In the United States itself, it is demography that is giving Latinos a lift. By 2050 the country's Hispanics may number as many as 100m, perhaps a quarter of the population (compared with 11% now). Today's Latinos are young and proud of their roots. All of a sudden, Hispanic is hip, from musica to movies, from la vida Iota to Jennifer Lopez and Salma Hayek. The influence is spreading beyond the obvious Spanish-speaking areas: hence the popularity of salsa clubs across Europe and the enthusiastic crowds for Ricky Martin in London. An upwardly mobile ""Generation N"" (the Latin equivalent of Generation X), which was invented and copyrighted by a Miami entrepreneur, is starting to flex its muscles. 
The final piece of the puzzle lies across the Atlantic. Since the end of the Francoist dictatorship in 1975, Spain, too, has swapped dictatorship for democracy and opened itself to the world through its memberships of NATO and the Eu. It is reaping the rewards. A foundermember of the single currency, it is now in Europe's super-league, gaining in wealth, weight and prestige. The centuries-long downward trend in Spanish fortunes has turned sharply upwards. Newly confident, Spaniards are increasingly looking not just to Europe but beyond, to Spain's former colonies. 
All this creates a potent mix for Hispanidad. Companies can expand their horizons across the continents. There will be a growing number of Spanish-accented multinationals, both spreading from Spain (like Telefonica, a telecoms giant, Repsol, an oil company, and Banco Santander Central Hispano) and from Latin America (like Mexico's Cemex). Publishers and Internet adventurers will flock to exploit an increasingly enticing Spanish-speaking market. Spanish speakers themselves will start to wallow in the attention and spread their influence far and wide-through trade, music, family values, and Spanglish words that enter into common usage-like true children of Columbus. Before long, the world will realise that globalizacion is a Spanish word.  1999 JANUARY

Compiled in association with The Economist eCalendar Companion. Software to personalise your electronic diary. wvu.bookshop.economist.com  1999 On Tuesday November 7th, America will probably follow Mae West's dictum: ""When forced to choose between two evils, I pick the one I have not tried before."" A full year of campaigning, in which none of the serious protagonists is anything but decent, responsible and colourless, will have left American democracy dull but in good shape. America's tedium will be the world's respect. 
Two parts of the American system, however, are going seriously wrong. First, despite all the hoopla, only around half of America's population will vote (compared with 72% in British and 95% in Australian elections). The winner will be lucky to have the backing of 25% of the public, and so will have no firm mandate. When the electorate is so little involved it is no wonder that new presidents enjoy so little popular loyalty or goodwill. 
Second, the election will produce, once again, a Congress that will soon find itself at odds with the White House. A recent poll showed that only 14% of the electorate wanted a divided government. The 2000 elections definitely give voters the opportunity to try a new arrangement: to have both the White House and Capitol Hill in the hands of the same party. Control of Congress is up for grabs. In the House, the 26-seat Republican majority installed in 1994 has dwindled to just five. In the Senate, Republicans have held a 55-45 advantage since 1994 and are favoured to retain control, but Democrats have at least a mathematical chance to take over. Yet these numbers disguise the truth: Capitol Hill has evolved into an institution that can define itself only through its arguments with the White House, regardless of which party has nominal control. 
Not so the Supreme Court, where change is also afoot. Three of the justices are over 70-Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices John Paul Stevens and Sandra Day O'Connor. With a fourth, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, having undergone surgery for cancer, the prospects are that the next president will be able substantially to reshape the judiciary. More than 70 other federal judgeships are vacant and unlikely to be filled before 2001 owing to conflicts between the president, who nominates judges, and the Republican Senate, which must confirm them. (The political hijacking of the appointment process is another troubled element in the constitution that needs sorting out.) 
The presidential election campaign has been under way for most of 1999 owing to the decision of several states to move their primary elections to the early months of 2000. A majority of the delegates to both national conventions will be selected by March 15th. 
Among Republicans, it would take a cosmological intervention to deprive George W Bush of the nomination. He is 30 points ahead of any rival in national opinion polls. He has the support of a majority of his fellow Republican governors and of members of Congress. And he has collected three times as much in campaign contributions as his nearest rival, billionaire magazine publisher, Steve Forbes. The only suspense on the Republican side is whether Mr Bush will somehow stumble. 
The Democratic contest, on the other hand, has become intense, with the front-runner, Vice-President Al Gore, strongly challenged by a former senator, Bill Bradley of New Jersey. Mr Gore is both blessed and cursed by his eight years as Bill Clinton's loyal vice-president. He is blessed because he has cemented ties with powerful Democratic interest groups, because Mr Clinton will use the powers of his office to help him and because, if the American economy stays strong, Mr Gore will be seen as part of a winning team. 
But Mr Gore is cursed by the fact that the Clinton presidency has been stained by multiple scandals. The public seems anxious to move on to cleaner pastures. As the joke goes, ""After Clinton, the United States wants to take a shower, and poor Al Gore is going down the drain."" Mr Bradley, a former professional basketball player who spent 18 years in the Senate, has based his challenge to Mr Gore on two arguments: that he is not an ""inside"" politician and that he will address problems-child poverty, the 45m who lack health insurance-that he alleges the Clinton-Gore administration has neglected. 
Despite Mr Bradley's progress, Mr Gore retains institutional advantages in the nomination struggle. It will take 2,189 delegate votes at the August Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles to win. The party reserves 18% of those ballots for ""super-delegates""-governors, members of Congress and members of the Democratic National Committee, who are free to vote as they wish. They are overwhelmingly in Mr Gore's camp. The other 80% are awarded according to state primary results. 
Along with the presidency, separate races will be under way for House and Senate seats. (Watch out for Hillary Clinton's run for the New York Senate seat.) Congressional Democrats, with help from the White House, have paid almost exclusive attention to winning back control of the House by framing issues, raising money and recruiting candidates. The most contentious issues arise from the inability of a divided government to pass major items on the national agenda-Social Security and Medicare reform, tax reductions, gun control or patients' rights legislation. 
There will be two other important twists to look for in the 2000 elections. First, the governors and state legislators in office over the next few years will redraw electoral boundaries in the wake of the decennial census, possibly handing an advantage to one party or another for the next decade. Second, these elections will be the first in the world in which the Internet will play a crucial part. All the tricks of democracy-from policy initiatives to character assassination-will move on to the net.  1999 For the past couple of years, America's economy has basked in luck. It has grown robustly, while a combination of low commodity prices and a strong dollar have kept inflation out of sight. Foreigners' willingness to pour capital into America has funded the spending spree. In 2000 this luck will be severely tested, since the economy is beset with two big weaknesses: stock prices are too high and savings are too low. These problems pose a nasty threat to the country's nineyear expansion. A market crash would leave bubbly consumers feeling suddenly less wealthy: spending would plummet, and so would the economy. 
The fear of that kind of ""hard landing"" will give rise to some anxious moments in 2000. But although the economy will slow from a gallop to a trot, and although the stockmarket and the dollar will show some humility, the chances are that America's luck will hold. There will be no Armageddon on Wall Street, no dramatic dollar crisis, no collapse of consumer spending, and certainly no recession. Unless Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, makes some grave errors, America's economy has every chance of achieving a ""soft landing"" as it slows to a more sustainable pace. 
Two related factors will force a slowdown from the near record growth rates that have been the recent norm: foreigners and fears of inflation. Foreigners have been bankrolling America's recent spending spree. While the rest of the world looked in turmoil, investors were happy to pour their money into America's booming markets. As a result, the country's current-account deficit-which reflects the difference between how much America saves and invests, and is funded by capital inflows from foreigners-has ballooned. 
In 2000, this deficit will reach nearly $400 billion, or 4% Of GDP, a record level, higher than that of the Reagan boom of the mid-1980s. However, after 2000 the current-account deficit will slowly fall. Foreigners will see improving opportunities for their cash elsewhere in Japan and Europe, and they will worry that America is using their capital to finance low savings rather than booming investment. As a result, they will start to shift their money elsewhere. Scarcer capital in America will mean higher interest rates; growth will slow. 
America's mind-boggling consumer spending (which has jumped by an average of 5% in 1998 and 1999) has been fuelled by a huge fall in personal savings. As their stock portfolios have fattened, Americans have felt wealthier and saved less. In 1993 households saved around 7% of their disposable income. By 1999 the figure was barely above 2%. Were this decline to continue, Americans would soon be spending more than their disposable income. Clearly this trend is unsustainable, which is why 2000 will see much slower growth in spending, thus slowing overall growth some more. 
As foreigners shift their money to other economies, the dollar will fall. A weaker dollar will boost America's exports (export volumes could grow by over 8% in 2000, more than twice as Fast as 1999). Import growth will slow, as foreign-made products become relatively more expensive in dollars. But a weaker dollar will also aggravate fears of inflationary pressure, which will be rising anyway for other reasons. 
The spectacularly benign performance of prices-consumer-price inflation is near 30-year lows despite booming demand-has a variety of causes. In part it is due to increases in the productivity of American workers; in part it is the result of lucky breaks such as falling commodity prices and the strong dollar. But the dollar's weakness in 2000 will carry the threat of higher prices in the shops; so too will higher commodity prices. At the same time, the cost of labour may pick up. By early 2000 the unemployment rate will be pushed below 4% and the scarcity of workers will eventually push hourly wages upwards. 
If inflation suddenly accelerates, the Federal Reserve will have to raise interest rates sharply, popping the bubble on Wall Street and bringing about the hard landing that investors fear. But the likelihood is otherwise. 
Even so, tight labour markets, a weaker dollar and firmer commodity prices will prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten short-term interest rates modestly. The result will be higher costs for borrowers throughout the economy. This in turn will trigger a gentle slowing in spending and investment, together with a modest and overdue correction to the excessive prices on Wall Street. And yet, even as America slows down, American triumphalism will remain undented. By accomplishing a soft landing, America will have pulled off a miracle as remarkable as the past years of unbroken growth. 
Zanny Minton-Beddoes: Washington correspondent. The Economist. 
United Nations subscriptions go up for Japan and down for America, though it still owes $1.2 billion. Is Uncle Sam world policeman or a free-rider?  1999 America's pockets will feel the weight of change in the early months of 2000, when a new dollar coin is placed in circulation. The coin, which is set to replace the rarely seen Susan B. Anthony dollar, will once again be graced by the figure of a woman. Unlike her predecessor she'll be a native American. On the obverse side of the coin will be the figure of Sacagawea, the Shoshone teenage mother who travelled from the Northern Great Plains to the Pacific Ocean with the Lewis and Clark expedition of 1805. Strapped to her back will be her son, Jean-Baptiste. The design marks a radical departure from the harsh profiles of previous American presidents. Despite the failure of the Susan B. Anthony coin, which remains in use only for vending machines, the us mint is confident that the Sacagawea coin will succeed. With its distinctive gold colouring and smooth edge, it is expected to be popular in the pocket. It will not be possible to confuse it, as the Susan B. Anthony coin could be, with the nickel. And there is a widespread feeling that the single dollar bill has become too bulky and difficult to pocket. Its face value is too low for a paper note. Few other wealthy countries have such small units of currency expressed in paper. So, does this mean the demise of the dollar bill? The government certainly intends to give wide circulation to the new coin as it will cost less to maintain and will last longer than the paper note. This time the betting is that the dollar coin will take hold. While in this reforming mood, how long will it be before the one-cent coin is phased out?  1999 In 1790, the United States became the first modern nation to undertake a comprehensive count of its population as a routine responsibility of government. The constitutionally mandated decennial census was part and parcel of a revolutionary concept in government. If the new nation's democratically elected governments were to be truly representative of the people, then the government itself would have to make regular efforts to determine just how many of those people there were. 
Whereas the Senate was established to represent the interests of the states, the House of Representatives was designed to represent the interests of individuals. The Constitution dictates that every decade a census be used to apportion representatives among the states according to the relative size of their populations. 
From the very beginning, the American nation has been characterised by rapid population growth and movement. Hence the census has as much to do with political power shifts as it does with population shifts. With so much at stake, the census has always been a magnet for controversy. George Washington was unhappy with the first ever count of the American people. (He thought that it was too low.) True to tradition, the 2000 census, which will be conducted on April 1st, will be greeted with grumbling from all sides. 
Indeed, over the past few years the 2000 census has been shaping up as the most contentious since 1920, when rural lawmakers refused to reapportion House seats based on data showing that more Americans lived in cities than in the countryside. On the surface, contemporary Democrats and Republicans have been fighting over methodology: whether the Census Bureau should employ sophisticated statistical sampling techniques or an old-fashioned head count. 
But the real battle has been over who will be counted. Despite its $2.6 billion price tag, the 1990 census was a debacle, leaving an estimated 10m people uncounted, many of them members of Democratic-leaning minority groups. To avoid repeating such a massive undercount in 2000, the Census Bureau had been advocating the use of sampling-a process whereby 90% of people are physically counted and the remaining 10% are statistically inferred. Hoping a higher tally of minorities would help them create new friendly political constituencies, the Democrats championed the bureau's cause, but to no avail. 
Citing the Constitution-and not so secretly wishing for another undercount-the Republicans opposed sampling. They demanded the actual (and perhaps impossible) enumeration of every person in the country. A former House Speaker, Newt Gingrich, went as far as to call sampling a ""dagger pointed at the heart"" of the Republican majority and filed suit against the government to stop it. The Supreme Court ruled in his favour and ordered the Census Bureau to conduct a traditional enumeration. 
Therefore it is a foregone conclusion that the 2000 census will vastly undercount the American people. Despite a scheduled $100m national ad campaign to ""make everyone count"", Americans of all stripes will duck census counters out of a distrust of government and a growing concern for privacy. 
The variety of recent immigrants means that language barriers will pose significant challenges to the Census Bureau in 2000. Nonetheless, the new data will reveal a nation that is becoming more racially and ethnically complex than ever before. In the 2000 census, America will be more heavily Latino than it was in 1990. And in part due to the anti-immigrant fervour in the first half of the decade, more immigrants will be naturalised American citizens than ten years before. 
Yet, even while documenting the diversification of the American people, the 2000 census will also mark the beginning of the end of America's archaic official racial accounting scheme. 
In 2000, for the first time, Americans will be able to identify themselves as multiracial. While not necessarily the best solution, the Census Bureau will nonetheless allow respondents to tick any or all of the four primary racial boxes: African-American, white, Asian/Pacific Islander, or American Indian/Alaska Native. In the past, the Census asked respondents to pick only one of the above categories. (Hispanic remains a separate ethnic-and non-racial-classification.) 
The multiple-race option came after three years of emotional public debate between multiracial activists and traditional minority civil-rights groups. The Clinton administration rejected a proposed self standing ""multiracial"" category that would have included all people of mixed racial background. 
Lobbied hard by ethnic advocacy groups that feared the diminishment of their constituencies if a multiracial category had been approved, the White House stumbled on the multiple race option as a political compromise. Census 2000 will acknowledge multiracial Americans even while upholding the old classifications. 
However modest, the change in rules will affect policies like affirmative action or the drawing of minority legislative districts. But the most long-lasting consequence of the new census form is likely to be administrative confusion. It is not at all clear how the multiracial data will ultimately be used. Will the daughter of an African-American father and a white mother be considered black when state legislatures are attempting to forge black-dominant political districts? And what about a citizen who says he is a combination of black, Asian, and white? Will the government consider him all or none of the above? 
Despite the steady increase in Asian immigration to the United States, the 2000 census might very well count fewer Asian-Americans than in 1990. In a 1996 test run, 30% of Asian-American respondents identified themselves as multiracial. 
And although the Census Bureau does not expect many Americans to tick more than one box in 2000-past policy has encouraged people to choose one heritage over the other-multiracial Americans will increasingly make their presence felt. Since 1970, the population of multiracial children has quadrupled in the United States. Between 1960 and 1990, the number of once-illegal unions between races increased 900%. In contemporary California, one in every six births is a mixed-race child. However flawed, the 2000 census will officially mark America's new found freedom not just to acknowledge its past, but also its future heritage.

Imagine: planes flying above cities beaming down radio, video and data communications. Experiments begin in 2000 that might give satellites a run for their money.  1999 Yachting's grandest trophy, the America's Cup, will be up for grabs in a series of nine races off New Zealand starting on February 19th. This cup always brings out wallets, egos, national pride, skulduggery and skill. Just to enter you have to post a $250,000 bond. But this is nothing compared with the cost of developing a yacht and professional team, which is upwards of $35m. Yet no less than 11 syndicates will have their keels in the water, representing six countries: France, Italy, Japan, Spain, Switzerland and the United States. (Note the shameful absence of Britain, which founded the competition in 1851 but then repeatedly lost it.) The cup has been won away from the United States only twice, the first time in 1983 by Australia and the second time by New Zealand in 1995.  1999 Americans will reach deep into their pockets in 2000 and give $200 billion to charity. This will not just be an unprecedented amount; it will be more than all the other 5.8 billion citizens of the world put together will donate. Britain, which does not think of itself as a mean-spirited country, will give just over 44 billion ($6.4 billion). 
Americans give to charity for many reasons. The first and foremost of them is that they are a generous and civic-minded people-words that many other countries find hard to say. There are secondary reasons: the tax system encourages philanthropy, not because it is lax but because it is wise. There is a recognition that individuals give more shrewdly than the state. In Britain, by contrast, the state believes that it alone should be bountiful-and the recent arrival of the national lottery, whose earnings are, in part, allotted to charities by state-appointed bodies, illustrates the point. Since the lottery began, personal giving in Britain has declined. In the past 20 years the proportion of households in Britain giving to charity has declined from 34% to 29%. 2000 will see Britain giving less, in real terms, than five years ago. 
In the United States giving will surge. The two most popular beneficiaries will be religious organisations (they will receive nearly $80 billion) and educational charities, notably universities ($28 billion). But the fastest-growing charities will be the wildlife organisations and those concerned with protecting the environment. America's huge personal wealth is a guarantee that this trend will continue. Many of the country's older millionaires will choose not to pass all their money on to their already rich and middle-aged children. And many of California's computer millionaires actually feel that it is morally wrong to do so. This is a trend that will gather pace in the years ahead-but not outside America.  1999 Eight short centuries ago, in the summer of 1212, many thousands of children, most of them boys around the age of 12, set out from France and the Rhineland to reconquer the Holy Land by the force of their love. The children fared miserably, but some adults did rather well: many of the relatively few young crusaders who got as far as Italy were captured by merchants and sold into slavery. The episode may be worth recalling as a new children's crusade, of a different sort, gathers force in America. 
In 1996, few people noticed when the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the American Cancer Society spent $30m to establish a new activist campaign. The National Center for Tobacco-Free Kids, as it was called, opened a fresh front in what it called the ""war on tobacco"". The new breed of activist noticed that most smokers first pick up a cigarette when they are minors (16 years old, on average). Never mind that 16 is not most people's idea of a ""child"", and that most teenagers who try cigarettes soon drop them: by concentrating on smoking and ""kids"", the activists thought, they could change the tenor of the public debate. 
So it was that anti-smoking campaigners characterised smoking as a ""pediatric disease"", and tobacco merchants as predators upon the young and helpless. The children's crusade against tobacco was not, by itself, decisive, but it went far to create the political climate that produced a settlement, in late 1998. Tobacco companies will now charge American smokers more for cigarettes while furnishing $246 billion-a fortune by any reckoning-to state governments, lawyers and anti-smoking campaigners. 
Humbug for all 
This success in 1998 was not lost on others in 1999. The supporters of stricter controls on guns in America-like the anti-smoking activists-had long been stymied by the political ferocity of their opponents and by the public's philosophical qualms about restricting law-- abiding adults' access to legal goods. In 1999, after several horrific episodes in which boys committed mass shootings in schools, activists began portraying guns as specifically a threat to children. Hillary Rodham Clinton, the president's wife, reflected the tone when she proclaimed: ""Guns and children are two words that should never be put together in the same sentence."" 
In fact, children (meaning adolescents, mainly) and guns have mixed comfortably in America for many years. A study for the American Justice Department has reported that young people who are given guns and taught to use them are less likely to commit crimes, including crimes involving firearms, than are young people who lack access to guns. The problem in America is not children and guns, but adults and guns. Turning the argument into one over ""kids"" did not, in reality, have as much to do with the welfare of children as with the ambitions of adults. 
In August 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency> America's main environmental regulator, announced its first restrictions intended speciFically, the agency said, to protect children. The link between the restricted pesticides and children was not altogether convincing: children eat more fruit and vegetables than adults (so the argument went), and their bodies are still developing, so pesticides would hurt them disproportionately. 
At about the same time, a report issued by congressional Republicans called for new measures restricting and otherwise discouraging violence in films, television shows, music and other media of mass communication. This, too, was pitched as a children's crusade. ""We must now devote ourselves"", said the report, ""to reducing the amount and degree of violence in our media and to shielding our children from such harmful depictions."" 
If 1999 saw the formula for children's crusades refined to a science, 2000 presents boundless opportunities to generalise its application. For example: 
Al Gore, Bill Clinton's vice-president and would be successor, hopes to move towards a broad national health insurance-succeeding where Mr Clinton failed-by promising health care for all children. 
As 2000 approached, Congress was considering seven bills-such as the ""Children's Protection Act,"" the ""Children's Defense Act,"" and the ""Protection of Children from On-Line Predators and Exploitation Act""-to regulate the Internet in the name of children. 
Firearms regulation, newly a ""kids""' issue. will heat to a boil as the lawsuits that dozens of states and cities have brought against gun manufacturers move: to trial. 
In the longer term, the repetition of ""Protect the children!"" as a rallying cry for activist adults spells its own undoing. Usually, however, gimmicks succeed for a while before ennui sets in. That should make 2000 a good year for campaigners of all stripes to see how many causes can be sent through the American legislatures and courts on the backs of innocent children. 
All change on Wall Street. The New York Stock Exchange, the world's largest, will become a forprofit business with its own stock listing. Shares will be quoted in decimals, not fractions.  1999 Robert Rubin, former secretary of the United States Treasury, gives warning that conventional wisdom is not a good guide to the future. 
There are two widely accepted ideas concerning economic matters in the years ahead. First, that there are powerful new forces at work-especially globalisation and the technology of the information age-that are creating immense change at a rapid pace and that this constitutes a new paradigm. And, second, that financial markets and market-based economics have replaced dirigiste economics and relegated government to a relatively minor role in economic affairs. 
Having spent 26 years on Wall Street and six-and-a-half years in government, living all of these changes first-hand, I believe that each of these statements is both powerfully right and powerfully wrong. 
Clearly, barriers to capital and trade flows have greatly decreased; the movement of capital, as well as goods and services, across borders has greatly increased; and technology is advancing rapidly and in profoundly important ways. The result seems almost surely to be significant productivity improvements, especially in America, though the official numbers do not yet appropriately show them and some of the claims being made may well be excessive. All of this holds great promise for the economies of all nations that are open to change and to trade, and that have sound policies in areas ranging from fiscal discipline to education. 
However, there are increasing numbers of commentators who extrapolate from all of this the idea of a new paradigm that is thought to lead to unprecedented conclusions with respect to business cycles, market valuations and the like. They are advocating a modern-day version of the famous thesis set forth in 1928 by Irving R. Fisher, a noted Yale economist, that we have reached a ""permanent plateau of prosperity"". 
I share the view that economic change is producing great benefits, and that the improved understanding of economics should lead us to better responses than the monetary and fiscal policies in the years following the 1929 crash. But everything I have experienced suggests that, at core, economic conditions and markets are grounded in the human psyche. That is, confidence or the lack thereof profoundly affects markets and economies, and confidence in turn has throughout the history of markets and economies tended to swing from excesses in one direction to excesses in the other. 
Perhaps the commentators are right and this is no longer operative, for the first time in human history. But the alternative is also possible. And our actions should reflect that alternative possibility. Public policymakers must continue to work intensely at the longterm project of reforming the architecture of the global financial markets. Private-sector managers must do what the private sector never does during good times: identify and weigh risks appropriately in decision-making. My impression is that the long period of good times in the industrial nations, and the rapid recovery when markets faltered, in 1987 and 1998, have dulled concern about risk. 
Another important piece of the great change taking place is the move towards market-based economics and away from dirigiste economics. This has led many commentators to say that financial markets, trading markets and the market-based economy have become so much more powerful than governments that public policy matters relatively little. 
There is no question, in my view, that government efforts to determine market prices in opposition to market forces cannot prevail over any period of time, and there is no question that global financial markets have become a powerful disciplinary force with respect to fiscal discipline, and monetary and other policies. 
On the other hand, that is only part of the story. Government still has a critically important role: different but no less important than the central planning and state ownership roles of yesteryear. 
We need governments 
Government must perform the functions that markets by their nature cannot or will not perform optimally, and these areas provide the underpinnings and framework for the market-based economy. Economists capture this idea with concepts like externality and market failure. Examples are public education, environmental protection, national defence and social safety nets. Of course, government can also mismanage, as by undue regulation, or by unsound fiscal or monetary policies, and that can be highly damaging. 
A critically important debate for the years ahead will be where this line between what markets do and what government does should be drawn. And this debate will be about not only what functions government should be involved with, but also, when government is involved, to what extent government should perform a given function itself and to what extent it should provide incentives or subsidies for the private sector to perform that function. School vouchers, private-sector prisons, trading markets in pollution rights, are good examples of battlegrounds in this debate in the United States. 
So, the more things change, the more things stay the same, in the sense that in the final analysis markets are about human beings and human nature. We should act to realise fully the potential for good in these powerful changes, but we must also eschew complacency and, in both the public and private sectors, realistically appraise risk and act accordingly. We must also allow market forces to operate where they can maximise our well-being, but support the government in performance of its critically important role. 
The future of the global economy is most promising, but to realise that promise the public and private sectors must act wisely on many fronts, sometimes in conflict with the conventional wisdom of the moment. the ambitions of adults. 
In August 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency, America's main environmental regulator, announced its first restrictions intended speciFically, the agency said, to protect children. The link between the restricted pesticides and children was not altogether convincing: children eat more fruit and vegetables than adults (so the argument went), and their bodies are still developing, so pesticides would hurt them disproportionately.

This, too, was pitched as a children's crusade. ""We must now devote ourselves"", said the report, ""to reducing the amount and degree of violence in our media and to shielding our children from such harmful depictions."" 
If 1999 saw the formula for children's crusades refined to a science, 2000 presents boundless opportunities to generalise its application. For example: Al Gore, Bill Clinton's vice-president and would-be successor, hopes to move towards a broad national health insurance-succeeding where Mr Clinton failed-by promising health care for all children. 
As 2000 approached, Congress was considering seven bills-such as the ""Children's Protection Act,"" the ""Children's Defense Act,"" and the ""Protection of Children from On-Line Predators and Exploitation Act""-to regulate the Internet in the name of children. 
Firearms regulation, newly a ""kids""' issue will heat to a boil as the lawsuits that dozens of states and cities have brought against gun manufacturers move to trial. 
In the longer term, the repetition of ""Prefect the children!"" as a rallying cry for activist adults spells its own undoing. Usually, however, gimmicks succeed for a while before ennui sets in. That should make 2000 a good year for campaigners of all stripes to see how many causes can be sent through the American legislatures and courts on the backs of innocent children.  1999 In 1986 the price of oil plummeted from $30 to $10 a barrel, and Texas quaked in its oversized boots. Businesses went under, cities became virtual ghost towns, and oil men cut down their prime rib consumption at Houston's posh Petroleum Club. In 1998 oil prices once again tumbled through the floor, yet the Lone Star state barely noticed, having branched out from its monogamous relationship with oil towards one with software and semiconductors. It's not just Texas. Throughout America's south-west and mountain region states that were once at the mercy of commodity prices have undergone a high-tech revolution, creating thousands of new jobs and transforming themselves into America's new technological hubs. It is now the fastest-growing region in the country, and in 2000 it will flex its muscles, finally emerging as a political and economic powerhouse, which the two coasts can no longer ignore. 
While a booming economy lifted all American boats during the 1990s, the rising tide was perhaps most beneficial to the interior West region. The region led the nation in job creation and personal income growth during the decade, as cities such as Denver, Austin, Boise and Salt Lake City, once sleepy and regionally focused, emerged as global centres for telecommunications, software and biotechnology. By embracing new technologies, the region has stabilised its economic base, no longer the victim of boom-and-bust cycles in industries such as oil, copper and silver. It is now home to high-tech powerhouses such as Dell, Intel, USWest and Compaq. Technology companies will continue to move into the area in 2000, taking advantage of the region's low tax, pro-business climate. 
Another reason for the economic surge can be seen at the 37 border crossings between the United States and Mexico. The elimination of trade barriers after the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1993 has brought a rapid expansion of trade between the two countries, with all of the new commerce flowing through the American south-west. According to Philip Burgess, president of the Denverbased Centre for the New West, NAFTa has created a ""border economy"", growing 10% each year, from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Ocean, with border areas in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and Southern California joined in an economie alliance with northern Mexico. 
Fueled by new industry and a burgeoning job market, the region has experienced the fastest population growth during the 1990s, with almost 21% growth during the decade compared with the national rate of 9%. Of the 25 fastest-growing cities in America in 2000, 15 are located in the interior West. The Census Bureau predicts the booming growth will continue well into the 21st century. This growth is far from evenly spread, however, as the vast majority of the economic and demographic expansion has been in the cities. In Arizona, 80% of the state's (largely technology based) job growth is in the Phoenix area-evidence of what many experts see as a problematic ""digital divide"" in the region. 
The changing demographics are partly due to what Marc Perry of the Census Bureau calls the ""All the way there, half the way back"" phenomenon, That is to say, easterners who migrated to California and have become disillusioned with the state's urbanisationand for some, with California's growing Latino population-have sought new frontiers in the interior states. This demographic shift will benefit the region politically in the census, as six of the nine congressional seats expected to migrate as a result of the census will go to the interior West. More people means more money, as federal funds to the states are determined by census estimates. 
In addition to increasing its presence on Capitol Hill, the region will have a significant impact on the presidential election, having developed into the most solid Republican block in the nation. Despite predictions a decade ago that diversified economies in the west would attract more eastern liberals to the region, population growth has not altered the region's traditional conservatism, long fuelled by scepticism of federal government and regulation. The Republican Party now holds 14 of the region's 18 Senate seats, and all nine of the governors' mansions. 
In an attempt to boost the region's clout over the presidential nomination process, several western politicians pushed for an early ""Big Sky"" primary in 2000, in which the western states would all hold their primaries on the same day, as the southern states do on Super Tuesday. It failed, so most of the western states will now hold their primaries too late in 2000 to have an impact on who earns the two parties' nominations. On election day, however, the impact will be unmistakable. The betting is that all nine states will vote for the Republican nominee in November 2000. 
Mark Mazzetti: south-west United States correspondent, The Economist.  1999 Americans will look on with seeming carelessness as their political system appears to be hijacked in 2000 by the power of money. They will know perfectly well that their democracy is being distorted by vast payments of cash from ""special interests"". They will accept with insouciance the most cynical view of politicians selling their souls and votes to the highest bidder. But they will convey little sense of urgency to their elected representatives of the need to fix the role of money in elections. And they will place campaign-finance reform near the bottom of their ranking of domestic public policy priorities. 
The political elites are likewise in no hurry to mend things. Saturation press coverage of fund-raising scandals during the 1996 presidential election and a deluge of emotional newspaper editorials since then have been insufficient to embarrass Congress into patching the most gaping loopholes in current law. 
Political financing has already become a major focus of newspaper reporting during this election cycle. The phenomenal early fundraising success of George W. Bush, the Texas governor, drew the spotlights. (He raised $37m in the first half of 1999, almost three times the previous record.] His subsequent decision to forgo public matching funds (making him only the third candidate to reject the public money that has been available since 1974) was the signal political event of the pre-primary presidential campaign. A close second was how easily Bill Bradley, a former senator, raised $12m in contributions. This has immediately made him a credible challenger to Vice-President Al Gore for the Democratic nomination. 
Both parties have announced that they hope to raise over $200m for their non-federal or ""soft money"" accounts. These funds have the virtue of being able to receive donations from corporations or trade unions that would otherwise be prohibited; and there are none of the limits on the size of contributions from individuals that apply to federal or hard money accounts. During the 1996 and 1998 elections, the parties discovered ever-more creative ways of spending soft money, thus craftily avoiding the restrictions embedded in federal campaign finance law. 
Campaign-finance reform will get more attention because two presidential aspirants, John McCain, a Republican senator, and Mr Bradley, have made it centrepieces of their campaigns. Mr McCain's decision to scale back his reform bill, by abandoning efforts to regulate election-oriented ""issue"" advertisements but retaining the ban on soft money, was not sufficient in the autumn of 1999 to garner the 60 votes needed to end the Republican filibuster and pave the way for some changes in the law. But it will provide a platform for Mr McCain and his allies to try to shake the public from its lethargy. Even in the unlikely event that those efforts were successful and the current Congress enacts campaign-finance reform, it would be too late to have any effect on the 2000 campaign. 
The prominent role of political money hardly makes America unique among the world's democracies. The experience of other countries in grappling with these problems suggests that the rules of political finance are important but secondary in shaping democratic accountability. Indeed efforts to deal with it have often yielded disappointing results. Scandals have arisen in many countries before and after reforms were adopted. Levels of corruption are not strongly related to the extent of public subsidies or the intensity of regulation of party and campaign finance. 
Idealism or reality? 
This is not a counsel of despair. It is a brief for realism. There is a tension between the reality of economic inequality and the ideal of political equality. Political parties and candidates for office need money to compete successfully in elections. Relatively few citizens have the personal means or desire to contribute to political campaigns. Under these circumstances, efforts to prevent concentrations of wealth from undermining political equality may conflict with freedoms of speech and association. The challenge in future will not be to eliminate the tension altogether but to manage it better. 
In the case of America, that means first of all restoring credibility to campaign-finance laws, some enacted as long ago as 1907, that have in recent years been shredded beyond recognition. First eliminate soft money and restore the long-standing prohibition against political financing from corporate and union treasuries. More controls on election-oriented ""issue"" advertisements would sharpen the transparency of campaigns. Adequately funding the account for public financing of presidential elections would avoid a repeat of the embarrassment of 2000 when the Treasury will be unable to meet its legal obligations to match the private contributions of presidential candidates. 
Beyond these immediate but critical fixes, reformers will continue to wrestle with slowing the money chase. They will want to foster the participation of small donors and grass-roots organisations. They will call for an appropriate role for political parties in campaign finance that does not relegate them to mere instruments for money-laundering. But these reforms will fail to balance the interests at stake. In short there seems to be no alternative to muddling through-which is exactly what will happen. 
Thomas E. Mann: W. Averell Harriman Senior Fellow in American Governance, the Brookings Institution.  1999 Hollywood will turn its gaze upward to the heavens and forward to the future. Two of the biggest blockbusters of 2000, both due out in March, will examine bids to colonise the most fashionable of planets, Mars: Walt Disney's ""Mission to Mars"" and Warner Brother's ""Red Planet"". In ""Space Cowboys"", another Warner Brothers film, ""a bunch of old guys"" led by Clint Eastwood venture into outer space, while in ""Titan AE"" (Fox), a teenager goes in search of a spacecraft that can save the world. Steven Spielberg reheats an old Philip K. Dick science-fiction story, ""Minority Report"", about a judicial system in which potential murderers are arrested before they can do any harm and, in its third sci-fi blockbuster of the year, ""Battleship Earth"", Warner Brothers succeeds in finding a new backdrop for John Travolta. 
Hollywood's other great inspiration at the millennium will be the past. Two of the best historical blockbusters for years will be Sony's ""Patriot"", a CivilWar epic starring Mel Gibson, and DreamWorks' ""Gladiator"", directed by Ridley Scott. Miramax is capitalising on its successful ""Shakespeare in Love"" with souped-up versions of Hamlet, Othello and Love's Labour's Lost. (The studio has wisely avoided overstraining the public's appetite for doublet and hose: Kenneth Branagh has turned ""Love's Labour's Lost"" into a 1950s musical.) 
The history that Hollywood is happiest with, however, is its own. Disney opens the year with 
""Fantasia 2000"", with seven new pieces set to music, including one by Shostakovich, and closes it with ""102 Dalmatians"". There will be sequels to ""Mission Impossible"" (which, if we are lucky, may explain what was going on in the first film), ""Beavis and Butthead"", along with ""Scream 3"" and a prequel to the Flintstones series. Those quintessential 70s figures, Shaft and Charlie's Angels, will return. Hollywood is also making yet another attempt to revive the musical, not only with ""Love's Labour's Lost"" but also with ""Moulin Rouge"", starring Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman. 
There will be the usual rash of adaptations of best-selling novels. Mr Spielberg will lay a practised hand on ""Memoirs of a Geisha"", George Clooney will wrestle with the ocean in ""A Perfect Storm"" and Leonardo Di Caprio will discover that a Thai paradise is not all it is cracked up to be in ""The Beach."" 
The most unexpected development of the year will be Hollywood's loveaffair with hairdressers. In January, Warner Brothers will release ""The Big Tease"" (motto: ""he came, he coiffed, he conquered""), about a gay Glaswegian hairdresser who takes on the Los Angeles hair establishment. (The studio is showing the film to hairdressers before its official release, on the grounds that nobody is better placed to generate word-of-mouth publicity.) Later in the year Miramax will release ""Blow Dry"", the story of the rivalry between two hairdressing salons in a small town, written by the author of ""The Full Monty"". 
Adrian Wooldridge: West Coast correspondent, The Economist.  1999 Canada is arguably the world's most successful country: year after year it tops the United Nations' Development Index. But year after year-and 2000 will be no exception-it becomes a little more like the United States. (It is, after all, slightly less wealthy than California.) Indeed Canada's politicians will spend the coming months promoting themselves with an enthusiasm seldom seen north of the border. They may not outdo their electioneering colleagues further south, but open displays of political ambition are hardly what Canadians have come to expect from their leaders. 
The prime minister, Jean Chretien, tired of being underestimated by friend and foe alike, will strive for a place in the history books alongside more flamboyant predecessors such as Pierre Trudeau and Brian Mulroney. The opposition leader, Preston Manning, will risk his leadership of the Reform Party with continued attempts to forge a nation-wide coalition with the Progressive Conservatives (the ""United Alternative"") against Mr Chretien's Liberals. Lucien Bouchard, premier of Quebec, will be tempted yet again to put to a referendum the question of the secession of his francophone province from the anglophone rest of Canada. 
Mr Bouchard has talked of calling a referendum only if there are ""winning conditions"", but until the wording of the cuestion is defined, these ""conditions"" will also remain conveniently undefined. Most francophone Quebeckers suspect they will never get the respect they deserve from their anglophone compatriots, but does that mean they will vote to leave Canada? Most polls suggest that they want to have their gateau and eat it: they flirt with secession but worry about its consequences, and so prefer, in the end, to avoid it. 
Throughout the coming year politicians will be indulging their ambitions just as Canada's economic outlook, so robust at the end of the 1990s, takes on a less favourable aspect. As growth slows in America, so it will in Canada too. The question is how painful the slowing will be. Roughly a third of GDP consists of exports south of the border. In other words, if and when the American economy sneezes, the Canadian economy will catch a cold-especially in Ontario, whose exports to America account for two-fifths of its GDP. 
All of which means that in politics, 2000 will be a frustrating year, especially for those talented Liberals, the finance minister, Paul Martin, for example, and the Newfoundland premier, Brian Tobin, who reckon they, not Mr Chretien> would make better prime ministers. Partly to quieten the rivalry, Mr Chretien has promised to lead his party into the next election, and this need not be until June 2002. Although many analysts reckon that Mr Chretien will use the millennium as a graceful way to bow out early, why should he? After all, he rather enjoys living at 24 Sussex Drive, the Ottawa residence that comes with the job. With the economy slowing, the politicians posturing more than normal and the Quebec issue once again in the headlines, some Canadians will feel their 21st century is getting off to an inauspicious start, not least because unemployment, around 8% for most of 1999, will start to edge up again. 
Yet behind the headlines the reality will be more promising. The competitive spur of NAFTA and the reforming instincts and fiscal rigour of Mr Martin (no respecter of the Liberals' wishy washy tradition) mean that the country's balance sheet will still look remarkably healthy. Canada will be the only G7 country other than America to be in a financial surplus-and that surplus will apply not just at the federal level but also in most of the provinces. Moreover, the effects of America's slowdown will be mitigated (especially for British Columbia) by a recovery in Canada's Asian markets and, at some point, a rise in oil and commodity prices. 
The difficulty will be to persuade Canadians to keep up the good work. The slimming of the public sector will lead to more outbreaks of industrial unrest, such as the 1999 nurses' strike in Saskatchewan, and more worries for the future of Canada's universal health-care system and its publicly financed schools and universities. Yet at the same time Canada's businessmen, conscious that they cannot hide forever behind a weak currency, will clamour for lower taxes. 
And rightly so if Canada is to staunch the ""brain drain"" that flows south each year in the form of thousands of well-educated professionals. Ironically, the greater the flow, the more determined most Canadians-from the prime minister on-will be to distinguish themselves from Americans. (One flow that may stop in 2000 is the flow of Canada's water to some states in America. This is certain to cause a row or two.) 
In some ways this will be an exercise in futility: Canadians watch the soap operas of America's television rather than the worthy offerings of the publicly owned Canadian Broadcasting Corporation; and they regard recognition in America, not Canada, as the mark of business, sporting or artistic success. 
Yet at the same time, with a defiant glance southwards and regardless of their interprovincial squabbles, they can justly celebrate Canada's many strengths. These include a disproportionately large contribution to international peacekeeping; a sense of social compassion; and a belief that as a nation of immigrants Canada is better served by a policy of tolerant ""multiculturalism"" than the ""melting pot"" notion to which America pretends. 
As more and more of their companies are bought by American investors, Canadians will try to make sure that what is Canadian by nature remains that way. If Ottawa's politicians can be confident about Canada and not defensive, then the country will remain truly distinctive from its neighbour for many years to come. 
Wild salmon will make their last Atlantic run. In 1975 there were 800,000 of these noble fish: 25 years later there will be an unsustainable 20,000. 
John Andrews: correspondent for The Economist, now based in Paris.  1999 Beset by growing social instability, a faltering economy and heightened tensions with Taiwan and America, China will hardly be in a mood to celebrate what it had hoped would be a year for trumpeting the successes of its ""socialist modernisation"". 
Although 1999 was symbolically important in marking the 50th anniversary of communist rule in China, its leaders have long attached even greater importance to 2000 as a target date for achieving key development goals such as the elimination of poverty and the eradication of illiteracy among the young and middle-aged. But it now seems likely that the significant progress that China has made towards achieving these goals will be overshadowed by a host of other problems, some of them threatening the party's survival. China's successful rush to capitalism will demand ever greater freedom that the Communist leadership will be reluctant to give. 
China's leaders will be glad that their bid to host the 2000 Olympic Games in Beijing was narrowly defeated by Sydney. They can look forward now to a year unencumbered by major international events or sensitive anniversaries. They will be relieved to see the back of 1999a year in which they pulled out every stop to ensure social stability during a string of potentially troublesome dates, including the 10th anniversary in June of the crushing of the Tiananmen Square protests and the anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic. But the leadership cannot afford to relax. 
The end of 1999 will focus more attendon on a problem that has bedevilled the Communist Party for the past 50 years: the status of Taiwan. Following the return of the Portuguese-administered territory of Macao to Chinese rule on December 20th 1999, the entire Chinese mainland, for the first time since the Ming Dynasty, will be under the control of a single, indigenous government. In Beijing's view, Taiwan will thus become the last remaining holdout in China of an administration that professes no allegiance to the Communist Party. 2000 will be a year of crisis in relations between Beijing and Taipei. 
Storm clouds began to gather over the Taiwan Straits in July 1999 when President Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan declared that his island's relations with the mainland should be treated on a ""stateto-state"" basis, thereby brushing aside the longstanding etiquette whereby both sides would say there was but one China. President Lee will stand down in March 2000 at the end of his maximum two terms in office. Beijing will anxiously await the outcome of the resulting presidential election. 
China's handling of the Taiwan issue will have a considerable impact on the volatile relationship between Beijing and Washington. America's presidential election in November 2000 will aggravate tensions, as candidates vie to demonstrate their readiness to deal firmly with Chinese transgressions. President Bill Clinton himself has warned of the danger of a ""campaign-driven cold war with China"". 
Beijing too is heading for a period of heightened political uncertainty as the Communist Party prepares for leadership changes at its 16th Congress in 2002 and at the following year's annual session of the parliament, the National People's Congress, when Jiang Zemin will be constitutionally obliged to step down as head of state. The man to watch in 2000 will be Vice-President Hu Jintao, a colourless technocrat being groomed by Mr Jiang for the presidency. The question is whether Mr Hu will also take over Mr Jung's more crucial post as Communist Party chief, or whether the country is heading for another Deng Xiaoping-style gerontocracy with Mr Jiang-already 73-clinging on into his dotage. 
Anyone aspiring to take over from Mr Jiang as party general secretary would be a brave person indeed. The party is becoming an unruly body. The ""Three Stresses"" campaign to restore ideological, political and moral rectitude among party members will not stop the rot. The root cause of widespread corruption and ill-discipline within the party is that many of its members have little sense of where the leadership is taking them or what their future will be in a country undergoing rapid change. The coming year will inevitably see numerous new cases of top level wrongdoing coming to light. 
It would certainly take a leader of extraordinary vision to steer the country through its economic difficulties. In 1998 Zhu Rongji, the prime minister, called for the fortunes of loss-making state-owned enterprises to be turned around by 2000. Though dubbed China's ""economics tsar"" by his western admirers, Mr Zhu has made little obvious headway. In an effort to revive the economy, Mr Zhu might well try devaluing the currency, the yuan, sometime in 2000. But it is far from clear that this would revive consumer confidence and halt the crippling deflationary spiral that has beset the country since late 1997. 
But it may not be all gloom for China's leaders in 2000. One event that could boost morale is the launch of the country's first manned space vehicle. This would make it only the third country after Russia and the United States to put a person into space. The intended message to the outside world would be that for all its problems, China is a major power with the expertise to match the West in the century to come. 
James Miles: senior Chinese affairs analyst, BBC news.  1999 First the good news. The turmoil that has surrounded the Japanese government ever since disgruntled voters threw the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) out of office in 1993, after 38 years of unbroken rule, is finally coming to an end. The Japanese people still do not believe that the Liberal Democrats have abandoned their venal ways. But they prefer the probusiness conservatives-especially when it comes to sorting out the country's financial and economic woes-to the squabbling ideologues of the opposition. Above all, they prefer to see the LDP in power but kept firmly on a leash, forced to govern through a coalition. 
In the general election that must be held before October 2000, the Japanese people will renew the Lnr-led coalition's mandate for another four years. They may even grant the Liberal Democrats an increased majority in the 500-seat lower house of the Diet (parliament). But there is absolutely nothing that the ruling party can do about its shortage of seats in the upper house for at least two more years-and quite possibly for a further five years given the chamber's distorted demographics. For the foreseeable future, therefore, Japan will be run by a coalition of conservative forces-the LDP plus the hawkish Liberal Party and the Buddhist-backed New Komeito. 
Now for the even better news: 2000 will see Japan, if not quite its old self, at least economically back on its feet again. After suffering its worst recession in living memory-prolonged by the miscalculations of political leaders and compounded by bungling, foot-dragging and denial on the part of the country's once-lauded bureaucracy-Japan should experience real growth of 2% during 2000, with possibly as much as 3% in 2001. This turnaround in Japan's political and economic fortunes owes much to the most improbable of figures. When handed the job by party bigwigs in mid1998, Keizo Obuchi was expected to be no more than a stop-gap prime minister. Pundits gave the uncharismatic leader of the LDP's largest faction months in office at most, as he served out the tail-end of the premiership vacated by the over-ambitious Ryutaro Hashimoto. The Obuchi government currently enjoys one of the highest popularity ratings in ages. And for good reason. The economic turnaround is largely a consequence of actions taken early in the Obuchi government's first term to clean up the country's banking mess and pump liquidity into the parched economy. 
The first glimmer of recovery came between January and March 1999 when the economy surprised everyone by growing by 2%. One by one, embarrassed economists began to revise their gloomy forecasts upwards. Most still believe that Mr Obuchi is a bit optimistic in promising the people that the economy will grow by an annual 0.5% in the fiscal year that ends in March 2000. But the consensus now is that the prime minister will at least be able to claim to have arrested the decline and got the economy growing again. Rather than risk jeopardising the fragile recovery-and alienate voters who will be heading shortly for the voting booths-the Lnr voted last September to give Mr Obuchi a second term. 
A recovery there may be, but that does not mean an end to the pain. Having finally shattered the myth of lifetime employment, Japanese companies will push joblessness-higher nowadays in Japan than in America-to over 6% during 2000 as they slash payrolls and reengineer their businesses every bit as vigorously as American firms did a decade ago. 
Two entirely new factors will keep Japanese managers' feet to the fire in 2000. One is a coming change in bookkeeping. From April, Japanese firms will have to prepare their consolidated accounts according to international standards, forcing them to close loopholes which allowed them to hide losses from their investors and profits from the taxman. Proper consolidated accounting will also reveal the full horror of their pension nightmares. Even among Japan's most respected companies, unfunded pension liabilities are going to be taking large bites out of profits for many years to come. 
The second factor that will make corporate Japan mend its ways in 2000 is the wholly new attitude that has been forced on the banks by their own troubles. Gone are the days when the Ministry of Finance could protect Japanese banks from the worst of their follies by ensuring that even the most incompetent remained profitable. Instead of doling out loans blindly to all and sundry, Japanese banks will henceforth have to weigh up the risks involved in each loan, using alien yardsticks such as a company's return on assets, its corporate strategy, its product development and its market record as guides to its credit worthiness. And bank loans will be priced at internationally competitive rates. Starting in 2000, the cost of capital for Japanese business will go through the roof. The wave of business mergers that will follow could easily send unemployment soaring towards 10%. Fortunately, from 2000 onwards, the hardship will be mitigated by an economy that has begun to grow. 
Nicholas Valery: Tokyo bureau chief, The Economist.  1999 The race to succeed Lee Teng-hui as Taiwan's president will be lively. Taiwan has truly taken to democracy, to the embarrassment of many of its neighbours. The wooden but competent vice-president, Lien Chan, is the official candidate of the ruling Kuomintang in the March 2000 election. The charismatic former mayor of Taipei, Chen Shui-bian, is carrying the flag for the main opposition Democratic Progressive Party. Adding spice is the participation of a former provincial governor, James Soong, who, after falling out with Mr Lee, is standing as an independent. 
Mr Soong is the front-runner but faces a tough race, partly because of his mainlander background. China was angered by the Taiwan government's redefinition in July of cross-Strait links as ""state-to-state"". Any further rise in tensions between the two sides-- caused, say, by Chinese attempts to intimidate Taiwan militarily-would damage Mr Soong, Mr Lien, perceived as a safe pair of hands, would benefit from a rise in tensions with China, as would Mr Chen. Mr Lien will also benefit from the vast finances of the Kuomintang. 
Attempts by China to intimidate Taiwan would drag down economic growth and cause tremors on the stockmarket. In the absence of such distractions Taiwan's GnP, estimated to have grown by 5.5% in 1999, will surge forward again in 2000, fuelled by the exports and investment spending of the island's high-tech manufacturers. 
Look out for the start of Taiwan's state lottery. It will raise $3 billion a year, mostly for new pensions and health. One area of concern is the general government deficit, which was 3.3% of GDP. As a result of the devastating earthquake on September 21st the deficit is likely to rise in 2000. The deterioration will, however, be limited by the government's privatisation programme, when onethird of the largest state-owned enterprise, Chunghwa Telecom, is sold, raising $6 billion.  1999 To judge from the commotion going on, visitors to Okinawa could be forgiven for thinking that the Olympic Games were being staged there this summer. All the construction, preparation and disruption on Japan's most southerly island prefecture is actually for the three-day summit meeting between the leaders of the Group of Seven industrial countries plus Russia on July 21st-24th. To keep everyone cheerfully loquacious, local distillers of awamori-a rice-based spirit that has been produced in Okinawa for more than 500 years-have formulated a special brew to be served at official receptions. 
Public handouts have been a way of life for Okinawans since the end of the second world war. The chain of subtropical islands, 1,600km south-west of Tokyo> was governed by the American military until it was handed back in 1972. It has remained Japan's poorest and most heavily subsidised prefecture ever since. 
The one big stick locals have for beating the authorities in Tokyo is the fact that, despite accounting for no more than 1% of the Japanese land mass, Okinawa provides 75% of the facilities used by American forces in Japan and accommodates 29,000 of the 47,000 soldiers stationed in the archipelago. So whenever Okinawans feel they need something from the central government, they bring out the ""Yankee Go Home"" signs. It never fails. 
The chance to host the summit was part of a government bribe to get the local community to accept a new site for the huge Futenma helicopter station used by the American marines. No surprise then that it is to Nago-an hour or two's drive to the north-east of the prefectural capital of Naha and its airport-that the leaders of the industrial world will congregate for three days.  1999 One of the remarkable features of Japan in the 1970s and 1980s was that it seemed impervious to goings-on in the outside world. High dollar or low dollar, detente or evil empire, booming Asia or stumbling Asia, Japan just kept rolling on. The 1973 oil shock did knock it over for a year, but it clambered upright more quickly than any other developed economy. It did have to make appropriate foreign-policy noises at appropriate moments to please the Americans, but without any great effort. In 2000, however, it will be acutely vulnerable to events in the outside world. Its fate in the coming few years will depend, more than anything else, on what happens in three other countries: the United States, China and North Korea. 
The reason for this is more than just the banal reality of international interdependence. As the world's secondlargest economy and as Asia's most developed and richest country, you would expect Japan to have more control over its own fate than this. When, in the late 1980s, it looked destined soon to overtake America, it was widely assumed that political power-which, really, means the ability to influence events-would soon follow. It hasn't, because Japan's economy has stagnated for a decade. That stagnation has exposed the inability of any political party to take effective charge of domestic policy. Which, in turn, has left foreign policy dangling in the wind. 
The very thing that seemed to explain Japan's success-that politicians stayed out of the way of bureaucrats and businessmen-has in the 1990s prolonged its weakness. Businessmen became burdened with debts, and throttled by a collapsed financial system. Bureaucrats were discredited by corruption, and by their own initial attempts to lie about the financial crisis in the hope that it might soon mend itself. For once, politicians were needed, to make the hard choices that financial and economic restructuring required, and to restore control over the bureaucracy. By and large, however, they failed to rise to the occasion. 
That was why Japan was hit so hard by the East Asian financial crisis of 1997-98. At the time its economy was just struggling back to its feet, but without having had any proper financial restructuring. So this new blow, which would have bounced off the Japan of the 1970s or 1980s, toppled it back over. Its exports were hit, its banks' bad-debt burden increased, the nervousness of its consumers merely heightened. In 1999, its economy has again been struggling to its feet. But, again, there has not yet been any fundamental reform. So a new financial crisis, especially one sweeping across the Pacific from the United States, would knock it down again. 
Meanwhile, short of any clear political leadership, this rich but vulnerable country is living in an increasingly tense neighbourhood. China, Japan's traditional rival for regional leadership, is going to pass through some sort of economic and thus political crisis as the strains in its fairlyfree-market economy put pressure on its very-unfree communist dictatorship. That will mainly be a domestic affair. But it is bound to have repercussions for Taiwan, which is the cause celebre of Chinese nationalists, especially those in its armed forces. If so, that will affect us all but especially Japan, which has been Taiwan's strongest supporter in the region. 
A new nationalism 
Japanese politicians, particularly in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, are quite hawkish about Taiwan. It is the one topic on which Japan's foreign policy could reasonably be called brave in recent years. Will they remain brave if, in the next few years, China steps up its rhetorical attacks on Taiwan, imposes a blockade or even invades? One cannot know in advance, but it looks quite likely. Domestic economic weakness may even make a hawkish response more probable. Japanese politicians have their idiosyncracies, but in one way, they are similar to their counterparts elsewhere: in the face of trouble at home, they are likely to be tempted by a unifying cause abroad. 
North Korea is the other possible such cause. Already, in 1999, the threat of North Korean missiles suddenly made it possible to break a long impasse over co-operation with the United States in developing and deploying (around 200710) a theatre missile defence shield. The North Koreans are past masters at using brinkmanship as a negotiating ploy. Japan's problem is that the Koreans, to make this ploy work, need to keep coming up with new threats. It is Japan that is the obvious target for such threats, be they from terrorism, or missile tests, or something new. 
The upshot of all this is an apparent paradox. Once-proud, independent Japan enters the 21st century in a vulnerable state, its fate worryingly in the hands of outside forces. The paradox is that this, at last, could well stir the politicians into life, offering them a unifying cause. 
That cause will be nationalism, and much of the Japanese public will be susceptible to it. Is that a scary prospect for the outside world? Nationalism is the sort of brew that can always boil over into something unpleasant. But in today's and tomorrow's Japan, that is unlikely. It is much likelier to be positive: finally waking Japan up to play its proper role as a regional power. 
Bill Emmott: editor, The Economist.  1999 Remember the books that predicted the dawning of an Asian century that would eclipse the western world? Pull them down again. One day it will happen. In another 25 years Asia will dominate more than half the world's economy. By then the financial crisis that began in 1997 will be seen as no more than a downward blip in a long period of sustained growth. Instead of the decade of gloom that many feared lay ahead, East Asia will be bouncing back in 2000. Some of the tigers will again roar. But the sound they will make will be different, and in many ways more frightening to westerners. 
The shocks to the financial and business environment over the past three years have been so enormous that the region's economies will not resume all of their old exuberant ways. Consumer spending will be the thing to watch. It accounts for more than half the region's economic activity. Increases in consumer spending will show that the recovery is sustainable. But the details will be important. Although some people will be splashing out on new Mercedes-Benzs and Gucci handbags, much of the growth in spending will come from more modest purchases that reflect an end to the belttightening. People will want to do up their homes, replace worn out domestic appliances and perhaps take an overseas holiday. These are mostly things put off for the past two years. 
So growth will be tempered and might top out in 2000. One of the most important factors is that many East Asians remain worried. Two generations have grown up only ever knowing their incomes grow. Now they have experienced declining standards of living, or even unemployment. This has come as a shock and, as Asia recovers, many will be cautious. They will not borrow so much money-especially in foreign currencies-or invest so haphazardly. Caution, the result of hard lessons, is not necessarily a bad thing in the short term. 
Of course some people will desperately cling to the worst features of Asian business: a lack of transparency with too much cronyism and corruption. This is why there are good reasons for caution. Many problems have been hidden. This is particularly so with bust banks and debt-laden companies that have not restructured or closed down. The cracks have simply been papered over in the hope that, as the good times return, the difficulties will not seem so large and may even fade away all together. Some banks and firms will be unable to keep up the pretence. Companies that have put their houses in order will provide increased competition and attract the most interest from local and foreign investors. This will put more pressure on problem firms, and some will fail in 2000. 
The tremors from the banking world will be particularly strong. Many banks are still sitting on frightening amounts of bad loans which, even in improving economic conditions, are never likely to be repaid. One reason for this is that the speed of the recovery has meant that tougher bankruptcy provisions planned by some governments have not been fully implemented. If companies cannot be easily wound up, their debts pile up and their assets cannot be put to use by others. Scandals, wrangling over who is to blame for past problems and political interference will also continue to take its toll on the Asian recovery. 
Meanwhile the chant of reformasi, the rallying cry of the Indonesian students that brought down President Suharto in May 1998, will echo around the region. Indonesia, the giant in SouthEast Asia with a population of 200m, will continue on the path to democracy under its new president, Abdurrahman Wahid. As East Timor struggles to become an independent nation, it will stir fears about a break-up of the sprawling archipelago. Politicians from some of Indonesia's neighbours, in particular the generals who run Myanmar, will try to present the problems facing Indonesia as evidence that only strong governments work in the region. This view will sit even more uneasily with a group of increasingly democratic and open governments led by South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines and Thailand. 
None of these headwinds will be lost on Singapore, which proved to be one of the most resilient economies throughout the crisis. Although it is virtually a oneparty state, Singapore's leaders have well-tuned antennae. They will liberalise the island's economy even further and try to attract higher-value industries. At the same time, Singapore's leaders will allow the boundaries of personal freedom to be pushed wider than ever before. The reasons go beyond simply allowing Singaporeans to do more before they demand more: the government wants to encourage more entrepreneurial activity, but cannot orchestrate that without dismantling the nanny state. The lesson that Singapore can teach the rest of the region (and also China) is that capitalism has to be an honest system to work. A lack of corruption, transparent accounts, Anglo-American corporate governance-these are the things that will create wealth in Asia. 
Even where democracy has a firm hold people will demand a greater say in running their country. In South Korea, one of the leaders in reform, there will be pressure on the president, Kim Dae Jung, to deliver more accountable government. Mr Kim will have his hands busy battling to reform the chaebol, the conglomerates that have increased their grip on the nation's economy during the financial crisis. 
The one thing that was always true about East Asia will be more true than ever: it is a region of very different economies and policies. This will become more apparent in 2000. Those who have reformed the most will do best. 
Paul Markillie: Asia editor, The Economist.  1999 India enters its 50th anniversary as a republic in high spirits. Its people take pride in having humbled Pakistan in Kashmir, in the stunning success of Indian businessmen overseas, in recent breakthroughs in literacy and population growth, in respectable though not tigerish economic growth and in the slow sloughing off of socialist regulation. Yet they will rightly moan about worsening governance, growing corruption and crime, and shortages of basics like water and electricity. 
The jingoism generated by the confrontation in Kashmir, which flared after Pakistani-backed separatists crossed the ""line of control"" into Indian territory and occupied heights near the towns of Kargil, will resonate in 2000, and keep the subcontinent an area of tension. Expect defence spending to rise officially from 2.5% of crrr in 1999 to 3.0% in 2000 (3.5% if you include some secret purchases). Kargil exhausted much of India's stock of artillery shells, and showed how difficult it was to throw back even a modest number of infiltrators. So India's venal politicians will strike big new arms deals, combining patriotic fervour with lucrative kickbacks. 
Expect the Indian film industry, the biggest in the world, to churn out several movies depicting heroic Indian soldiers thrashing slimy Pakistanis. Expect Pakistan to produce its own movies depicting courageous Kashmiri freedom fighters being gunned down by slimy Indians. Expect the two countries to jam one another's satellite broadcasts of these propaganda efforts. 
According to some official estimates, the billionth Indian was born in 1999. But most demographers believe the event will take place only in 2000, thanks to India's success in slowing population growth over the past generation. Contraception has reduced the birth rate from 48 per 1,000 50 years ago to 27 per 1,000 now, but improved health care has simultaneously reduced the death rate just as rapidly, so for decades the population kept growing at 2.0% per year. However, the death rate is levelling off while the birth rate continues to fall. So population growth is now down to 1.6% annually, and could fall to 1.0% by 2010. 
Expect continuing improvement in literacy too. In 1991, adult literacy was only 52%, well below the level in many African countries. But new political awareness of the importance of primary education has helped the literacy rate to shoot up to nearer 64%. Both the urbanrural gap and male-female literacy gap have shrunk faster than the national average. Education will become a hot political topic in coming years, now that the information revolution is reaching villages through the extension of telecoms and the Internet. 
With the 50th anniversary of India's birth as a republic on January 26th, there will be many long speeches on the country's success in staying democratic in the face of huge strains. Yet critics will say this deserves maybe two cheers but not three. Fifty years ago politicians were viewed as heroes who had won India independence. Today they are viewed as corrupt and criminal. Expect researchers to celebrate the anniversary with fresh data on the number of criminals in the country's many legislatures. (The last estimate, made two years ago by a member of the Election Commission, put the number of criminals at 40 in Parliament and 700 in the state legislatures.) The judicial system is so slow and the police system so incompetent that not a single politician has been convicted of corruption through all stages of appeal. A former prime minister, Narasimha Rao, is still defending a case of alleged cheating in 1984: the complainant has already died of old age. 
When India became a republic, politicians declared that Indians could at last succeed in ways that were impossible under white rule. But today Indians are achieving stunning success not at home, but abroad. Ron Dutta has become head of the world's biggest airline, United Airlines, and Rakesh Gangwal is boss of us Air. Sabeer Bhatia invented Hotmail, the most popular form of Internet based email, and sold it for $400m to Microsoft. Silicon Valley overflows with Indian entrepreneur millionaires. None of these gentlemen would have fared anywhere near as well in India, where talent does not take you far. Fifty years after becoming a republic, Indians are faring better in countries ruled by whites than in their own. Expect politicians to do absolutely nothing about it. 
Swaminathan S. Anklesaria Aiyar: consulting editor of the Economic Times, India.  1999 It will be another tense year. The ruling military junta has promised to hold an election once a new constitution is finished, but progress will remain painfully slow. In the meantime, the junta will continue its efforts to smash the main opposition party, the National League for Democracy (NLD). Tensions will be particularly high in late May, the tenth anniversary of the NLD's 1990 election victory-a result that the military rulers never implemented. Opposition, which comes not just from the NLD but from student, religious and ethnic groups as well, could turn violent. 
But the junta should retain control. It has a vast military and intelligence network, backed by its political wing, the Union Solidarity Development Association. It is unclear how much real support the junta enjoys even within these groups. However, its oppressive tactics have resulted in what the leader of the NLn, Aung San Suu Kyi, has termed a ""blanket of fear"" settling over the country. 
Desperate to break the deadlock, foreign governments will repeat their calls for dialogue between the junta and the opposition. American sanctions will be up for renewal once again in May 2000, and there is also the possibility that the multilateral institutions will again offer to release aid in exchange for steps towards political reform. If the junta grasps the nettle, Myanmar's economic prospects will improve considerably. 
But a change of heart is unlikely. In the absence of reform, efforts to boost agricultural output will be hampered by a shortage of fuel, pesticides and fertiliser, while a dearth of foreign investment will hurt industrial output. The free-market exchange rate will depreciate further. 
Myanmar is a country that, like Cuba and North Korea, has turned its back on the world. As a result it will be 2000's most needlessly miserable country.  1999 When the Queen of England visits Australia in March, she will find that the ex-- colony's recent vote to keep her on as head of state, and not to declare a republic, has left the nation republican in spirit but monarchist in form. The failed vote for a republic was the result of political division (extraordinarily, Prime Minister John Howard advocated a ""no"" vote) and a high level of public disdain for politicians, rather than enthusiasm for the British monarchy. It leaves Australia with a 19th-century constitution. The big debate for the future will be whether, when the matter eventually comes back on to the agenda, Australians should be considering a much more radical model in which the public would directly elect the head of state. 
This political matter aside-and many Australians clearly do dismiss it as mere politics-Australia is in a confident mood. The economy is strong, its recent reforms have cleared the decks for a prosperous few years as Asia's economies recover. And the advent of the Olympic games gives most Australians the feeling that anything the world can do, they can do as well, if not better. 
The general mood of confidence has its shadows, and these come mostly from abroad. The chaos of nearby Indonesia and the Australian intervention in East Timor have caused immediate concern to Mr Howard. Suddenly defence policy, on which spending had fallen to well below 2% of GDP, has become an issue. A bigger defence spend will mean less money for other priorities if the coalition wants to preserve the healthy budget surpluses that have been the pride of the government, elected in 1996. 
Australia's relationship with Indonesia, the cornerstone for decades of foreign policy, has deteriorated sharply, as both the government and the Labor opposition elevated East Timor from the bottom to the top of their international priorities. Bipartisan pragmatism had dominated relations with Indonesia; suddenly policy is getting a ""moral"" base. This new foreign policy will be dramatically and possibly dangerously tested if the fears of the pessimists are realised and Indonesia starts to break up, with parts such as Irian Jaya pressing for their independence. 
Australia enters the next century economically prosperous and confident. Despite dire predictions, it survived the Asian economic crisis with scarcely a scar. Economic restructuring in the 1980s and early 1990s-financial-sector reform, reducing tariffs and privatisation-will stand the country in good stead for 2000 and beyond. It is now inclined to lecture the Asia region on economic and financial rectitude. Growth continues to be strong; unemployment remains around 7%: only a few years ago it was 11%. 
In mid-2000 a new goods and services tax will begin operating. If the government wins the 2001 election it will have made dramatic tax history, having won an election (1998) on the promise of a new tax and then survived to tell the tale of implementing one. Now decisions are being made on a major overhaul of the business tax system-including reducing capital-gains tax and the company tax rate-to attract extra international capital, especially venture funds. 
There is a mood of optimism in the nation. Sydney's 2000 Olympic Games and the 2001 centenary of the six states joining in a federation will make for two years of world attention and local partying. The only other time Australia hosted the games was the 1956 Melbourne Olympics. Then, too, Australia was on a high, enjoying post-war prosperity and building a booming economy on a wave of migration. Now migration is at a low level, but Australia has become a truly multicultural nation, with the ""White Australia"" policy long abandoned, and with Sydney and Melbourne having large Asian communities. 
The raucous and racist One Nation Party, which signified the deep discontent of regional Australia in 1998, will have faded to a minor group by 2000. But the rural areas still feel squeezed and politically alienated, as population and services have drained away from the bush. Primary production, traditionally a big slice of Australia's wealth (especially export wealth) has become riskier. Australia has a touch of the two classes about it, based on geography. 
And on race. The plight of many Aborigines is the national shame, with blacks having high levels of infant mortality and shorter longevity than the general population. Too many Aborigines live on welfare. There are some bright spots: the increasing number of Aboriginal graduates; the election of Aden Ridgeway, an Aboriginal senator; and at the games, the nation's heart will be with Aboriginal athlete Cathy Freeman. 
Michelle Grattan: chief political correspondent, Sydney Morning Herald.  1999 After the corruption scandal that surrounded Salt Lake City's bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics, the Olympic movement can count itself lucky that the sports-mad Australians will do everything in their power to ensure that the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games (September 15th-October 1st) will be a success. One million Australians have already bought tickets. They can expect the 2000 Games to be a superbly organised, highly photogenic event, which will draw a worldwide television audience of 3.5 billion. 
By Olympic standards, the completion of Stadium Australia in the Sydney suburb of Homebush, over a year before the opening ceremony, was unprecedented. Once the Olympic flame finally gets to Sydney after its travels around the Pacific region, the stadium will be packed to its 110,000 capacity. In Atlanta 1996, the gold medal count was, United States: 101, Germany: 65, Russia: 63, China: 50, Australia: 41. As hosts, Australia will again excel, conforming to the formula for home success that is one part inspiration, two parts state injection of finances into sport. Australia is the most successful sporting nation in the world, if you measure its results against its 19m population. Sydney 2000 will act as the stage for established stars such as the women's 400m gold prospect Cathy Freeman and newcomers like the 16year-old wonderboy Ian Thorpe, who has a chance of three swimming medals. Watch out for the triathlon, though the swimming leg may be less exciting now that the authorities have guaranteed that there are no sharks in Sydney Harbour. 
Expect stirring performances from the Greeks where athletics has improved greatly since they won the Olympic bid for Athens in 2004. In the javelin, Mirela Manjani-Tzelili and Kostas Gatsioudis are stars in the making. Conversely, China has scaled down its athletic efforts since its rejection as host for 2000, but should at least achieve one ""track"" gold in the 50km walk. 
American sprinters and African distance runners will provide the classic excitement. The United States sprint trio of Michael Johnson, Maurice Greene and Marion Jones in five events (100m, 200m, long jump, and the 100m and 400m relays) will peak in Sydney. Ms Jones intends to go for a record five to better Karl Lewis's record of four sprint golds at Los Angeles 1984. She has already endeared herself to crowds everywhere and will be the face of the games. 
In the men's middle and distance events, the North and East Africans will carve up the medals between them. Classy Kenyan runners are plentiful and would win any long-distance relay race, but don't bet against the constantly improving Hicham El Gurrouj of Morocco in the 1,500m and the peerless Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie in the 10,000m. For students of Olympic history, however, the place to be is at the rowing regatta, where the British oarsman Steve Redgrave, this time in the coxless fours, will be vying for his fifth gold medal in consecutive games, an unmatched achievement in any Olympic sport. 
Sydney's best advertisement is in the number of athletes who will decide to seek residence in the country. Already, four young Romanian wrestlers in Sydney for an Olympic test event have claimed asylum. Olympic officials say they are powerless to prevent athletes from trying to stay in Australia: ""The security fence at the Olympic Village is to keep people outnot to keep athletes in."" 
Matthew Glendinning: freelance sports and business writer.  1999 The Middle East enters the new century with the mould of the past generation cracking, if not yet breaking. Long years of Arab-Israeli conflict, involving five major wars since the foundation of the state of Israel in 1948, may now be drawing to an end, following the election in Israel of Ehud Barak and the relaunch of the regional peace process. A generation of Arab rulers-autocrats to a man even if their despotism has occasionally been benign-has started giving way to a new one, more susceptible to change and less burdened by the failures of their fathers. 
So why is there so little optimism to be found in the region? Mainly because no Arab country has lost its fear of, and innate hostility towards, Israel. This includes Egypt and Jordan, which have peace treaties with the Jewish state that emerged in their midst just over half a century ago. Paradoxically, only among the Palestinians-the people with most reason to resent Israel-can one find significant numbers of people who react with equanimity towards the Israelis. But Israelis themselves are in the main still deeply suspicious of Arabs in general and their Palestinian neighbours in particular. 
All this will be held mercilessly under the spotlight in the coming year. During that time, Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) have undertaken to reach a ""final status"" treaty. Mr Barak also aims to reach peace with Syria by withdrawing from the Golan Heights-captured in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and held against fierce counterattack in the 1973 war-and thereby allow Israeli troops to pull out of south Lebanon, where Israel has been trying to hold a buffer since 1978. 
Mr Barak, a former army chief-of-- staff at the head of a revamped Labour-- led alliance, plays the role of the thinking man's thug-tough on security, but thoughtful about the causes of Israel's insecurity. He believes, for instance, that Israel is weakened by its continuing occupation of Arab land. 
However, he did oppose the 1995 Oslo agreement on interim autonomy for the Palestinians; he is no peacenik. The PLO wants all of the West Bank and the Gaza strip-only 22% of Mandate Palestine-for an independent Palestinian state with occupied Arab east Jerusalem as its capital. Mr Barak has signalled he intends to hand over about 60% of the West Bank-little more than a tenth of historic Palestine. He has declared that none of Arab Jerusalem will be handed back, and no Palestinian refugees-3.6m registered by the urr in the occupied territories, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, and 4.5m worldwide-can return. 
Scepticism about an enduring settlement with the Palestinians-- the heart of the Arab-Israeli conflict-is therefore amply justified. Doubly so, when the Syria-- Lebanon ""track"" of the peace process is likely to overtake the Palestinian ""track"". Negotiations with Damascus and its client in Beirut are essentially about security; Israel has no ideological claims on the Golan and south Lebanon, whereas religious Jews regard the West Bank as part of the Land of Israel given to them by God. Once the deal is done with the Syrian president, Hafez Assad, Yasser Arafat and his PLo will be isolated. Except in one explosive respect: the truly millennial issue of Jerusalem. 
Mr Barak wants this off the negotiating table, as though Arabs and Muslims could acquiesce in Israel's continuing occupation of the third holiest site in Islam, the Haram ash-Sharif in the Old City, with the Dome of the Rock and the ancient al-Aqsa mosque, a stone's throw from the Wailing Wall. Mr Arafat, great survivor though he is, could not give away Jerusalem-nor could any Arab or Muslim leader. 
Israel's initial plan was to make three Arab monarchs custodians of the holy sites, while retaining sovereignty: King Hussein of Jordan and King Hassan of Morocco, both of whom claimed descent from the Prophet Mohammed, and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, protector of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. King Hussein and King Hassan died in 1999, while King Fahd like many of his Arab peers is seriously ill. There was, in any event, no indication that the three would have co-operated. To have done so would have undermined their legitimacy. 
Legitimacy is, in any case, in short supply, highlighted by Arab leaders' seeming need to reassure themselves with 90-99% majorities in spurious plebiscites in countries that include Syria, Iraq, Egypt, Tunisia and Yemen. Republican regimes in the region, paradoxically, appear to have worse dynastic problems than the absolute monarchies most of them replaced. The successions in Jordan, Morocco and Bahrain, and the incipient succession in Saudi Arabia, appear to be going fairly smoothly. By contrast, there are doubts about who will succeed the republican masters of Syria and Iraq. President Assad appears to be grooming his young and untried son, Bashar. Saddam Hussein has long given free rein to his murderous and racketeering sons, Uday and Qusay. Even if there were a peace settlement with Israel, these problems of legitimacy in the Arab world would remain. 
David Gardner: Middle East editor For the Financial Times.  1999 With the aged King Fahd so obviously ill and incapacitated, the transfer of power to the elderly, but less frail, Crown Prince Abdullah will be eagerly watched. He will take over a kingdom not yet in crisis but facing serious economic and social problems that oil earnings-greatly reduced from a decade ago-can no longer disguise. He will need to respond to the discontent of a generation of young people which has grown up amid oil wealth and for which the prospect of unemployment or low-paid work comes as a shock. The Kingdom's young will grow steadily more vocal. 
But those hoping for bold reforms will be disappointed. Fear of popular anger will ensure that the authorities delay the reforms needed to place the economy and state finances on a sustainable footing, and reduce the kingdom's overwhelming dependence on oil. The strength of oil prices in 2000 will provide some, albeit temporary, financial leeway, curbing the current-account deficit and boosting growth. Rather than liberalising the economy and wooing foreign investment, the government will concentrate on mobilising private Saudi capital to invest in new projects. 
Such caution will stem from the royal family's concern that cuts in state welfare could prompt disaffected Saudis to rally behind calls for a brand of Islamist nationalism that blames the country's ills on its political system. This potential will be accentuated by Saudi's increasing access to information on the Internet, and to the controversial talk shows broadcast by Qatar's uncensored Al-Jazeera satellite television channel. On this channel contentious issues, such as the foreign military presence and the state of the economy, get freely aired. The social liberalisation that is so apparent in the Gulf states will put serious pressure on the kingdom's moral rectitude. Yesterday's threat was Islamic extremism, tomorrow's will be a burgeoning young population that wants western-style reforms.  1999 For much of Latin America it will be a year of economic recovery. Growth for the region as a whole should reach 3-4%. This marks an improvement on 1999's sharp recession, which saw output fall by perhaps 1%, the worst performance in a decade. In South America, recovery will be steady rather than swift. Mexico escaped the recession because of its links with the United States' economy, but that in turn makes it vulnerable to any sharp slowdown north of the border. 
The region's economic performance will not be strong enough to sweep away the creeping political disillusion with market economics. But neither will the broad liberal reforms of the past decade be abandoned wholesale: some, such as privatisation, will continue, as will (Venezuela perhaps excepted) openness to foreign trade and investment. And as fiscal constraints ease somewhat, governments will pay more attention to social spending. 
The pace of recovery depends partly on outside factors, such as renewed growth in Europe and Asia offsetting a slowdown in the United States, and thus helping to boost prices for Latin America's commodity exports. Any sharp rise in American interest rates would hurt South America, too. But the key to recovery lies with Brazil (which accounts for two-fifths of Latin American cnr). President Fernando Henrique Cardoso faces the challenge of holding his fractious coalition together despite his own deep unpopularity (prompted by the January 1999 devaluation) and the distraction of October's municipal elections. 
That means the government will make little progress with structural reform in taxes, pensions and public finances. But a strong rival to Mr Cardoso is unlikely to emerge. Instead, Brazil will muddle through (as it has done for much of the 500 years since the Portuguese arrived there, an anniversary it will commemorate in April). The government should manage to keep reasonably tight control over public spending. That, together with improvised revenue-raising measures, will allow it to meet, more or less, the fiscal targets agreed with the iMF, and its own target of 4% growth, helped by an increase, at last, in exports, as they respond to devaluation. 
Recovery in Brazil will help its neighbours in the Mercosur trade block. Presidential elections in Argentina, Chile and Uruguay in the final months of 1999 were likely to usher in presidents of the centre-left in each country. Of the three, Argentina's Fernando de la Rua, a cautious radical, inherits the trickiest challenge. Argentina's rigid exchange-rate peg to the dollar was the cause of its rollercoaster economic progress during the 1990s under Carlos Menem. But if the arrangement is to survive (Brazil and Chile abandoned their less rigid currency pegs during 1999), Mr de la Rua will have to move quickly to lower business costs through fiscal, labour and anti-monopoly reforms. For these, he will need Mr Menem's support, since he will lack a congressional majority. Even if he fails, a weaker dollar might still let Argentina off its self-imposed hook. Otherwise it will face an unpalatable choice: adopting the dollar outright, or a devaluation that would be more traumatic than Brazil's. Each would constrain growth. 
The main threat to Latin American democracy will remain in the northern Andes. Colombia's civil wars will escalate. The army's new anti-drugs battalion, trained and financed by the United States, will enter combat against the leftwing guerrillas (but not the right-wing paramilitaries, even though both groups have links with the drug trade). America will pump money and, perhaps, military advisers, into helping President Andres Pastrana's government, but will not send in its own troops. The guerrillas may respond by using missiles against government aircraft. Peace talks will not be formally broken off, but will get nowhere. Slowly the guerrillas will start losing the war. 
In Venezuela, President Hugo Chavez will win a referendum approving his new constitution, and go on to get himself reelected in a fresh presidential election, in the sixth national vote in 18 months. Higher oil prices mean the economy may temporarily recover, prolonging Mr Chavez's popularity. But his regime will be marked by populist gestures and creeping militarism. In Ecuador, general political chaos could see President Jamil Mahuad not only unable to nail down the iMF's support but overthrown by Congress, with a subsequent search for a strongman in the Chavez mould. Yet even so, constitutional appearances would probably be preserved. That is the fashion pioneered by another elected authoritarian, Peru's Alberto Fujimori, who since 1990 has successfully reformed his country's economy in a way Mr Chavez seems unlikely to do. Having brushed off legal objections to his candidacy, Mr Fujimori will try for a third term as president in April. Renewed economic growth, his government's influence over the media and the opposition's weakness ought to guarantee Mr Fujimori victory. But Peruvian voters, often unpredictable, may suddenly decide they have tired of him, and turn to Luis Castaneda Lossio, a canny centrist. 
In Cuba, Fidel Castro does not allow such uncertainties. His dictatorship will survive yet another year. The United States will relax its 40-year trade embargo against Cuba, allowing food and medicine sales into the country. But do not expect any liberalising gestures from Mr Castro in return. 
Michael Reid: Americas editor, The Economist.  1999 Chile's reborn democracy is limbering up for its tenth birthday in March 2000, battered and bruised from hefty blows in the previous two years. The extradition proceedings against General Augusto Pinochet, a former dictator, have reopened old political wounds. And the economy is still suffering from the effects of the emerging markets' crisis and the adverse weather that accompanied El Nino. In an attempt to revive output and employment, the government has allowed the fiscal accounts to slip into the red for the first time in 13 years. 
There is work to be done if Chile is to shake off its recent grogginess. The new government, which takes office in March, following an election in December, will have little time to enjoy the anniversary celebrations. Continued co-operation between the right and left will be crucial to maintain the consensus which has formed the cornerstone of Chile's economic success during the 1990s. Whatever the outcome of the Pinochet extradition saga, complete national reconciliation will be achieved only once the past is revisited without fear of recrimination. 
On the economic front, the first set of challenges for the new government appears straightforward. Given an improving external environment, relaxed monetary conditions and a low basis of comparison, GDr growth could reach 5% in 2000, while moderate import prices and spare capacity will restrain inflation. 
But to convince investors that it has truly returned to winning ways, Chile will need to overcome two stronger challenges: rebalancing the fiscal accounts; and restraining consumption to keep the currentaccount deficit at a sustainable level over the medium term. Success in both these areas would pave the way in 2000 for faster growth and development, and confirm Chile's (unofficial) status as Latin America's top-rank performer.  1999 Africa will amble through 2000 with an uneven gait. Its athletes will sweep up plenty of medals at the Olympic Games, again showing their world calibre. African footballers will score many goals in the Euro 2000 football championship. But many African economies will barely hobble past the starting line, compared with their competitors in Asia and Latin America. The brave hopes for an African economic revival have foundered as several regions' conflicts-in Ethiopia-Eritrea, Sudan, the giant Democratic Republic of Congo and Angola-have drawn in many of their neighbours. 
A tough triumvirate of African leaders will try to end the chaos. South Africa's Thabo Mbeki, Nigeria's Olusegun Obasanjo and Algeria's Abdelaziz Bouteflika will cajole Africa's warring states into negotiations and peace deals. They will dominate Africa's continental club, the Organisation of African Unity (oAU). With their good political and diplomatic track-records, the three will be taken seriously in Africa and in the West. 
Their priority in 2000 is to consolidate a tentative peace in Congo. Closely related to this is the need to put new pressure on Jose dos Santos's government and Jonas Savimbi's UNITa rebels to end the latest round of Angola's 25year civil war. But progress here requires them to convince the uN Security Council to send international troops to Angola alongside local African peacekeepers. Angola and Congo will be the weariest of the world's warring states by 2000, and therein lies hope. 
Apart from diplomacy, Mr Bouteflika and Mr Obasanjo will be busy at home. Both are veterans of their countries' Byzantine politics; both returned to power in 1999, inheriting deeply fractured societies and weakened states. Algeria and Nigeria have enough gas and oil to finance much of their own economic recovery and to bring in foreign capital for the rest. They will be helped by the upswing in oil prices. Along with South Africa, they will be the key countries to watch for signs of any genuine African revival. 
Another prominent African, the urr secretary-general, Kofi Annan, will spend much of 2000 thinking about his troubled continent. The scheduled referendum on Western Sahara's independence in July will be a major test. Can the urr prevent a re-run of East Timor in North Africa? Certainly Morocco's new King Mohammed VI is no more eager to countenance losing the referendum than was Indonesia's General Wiranto in East Timor. The most likely outcome in Western Sahara is, therefore, continued Moroccan obstructionism. Perhaps the Libyan leader, Colonel Muammar Gadaffi, who talks to both Morocco and the pro-independence Polisario Front, will offer to mediate. Either way, expect to hear plenty about Western Sahara in 2000. It will be on every foreign editor's list. 
Egypt, Africa's fourth heavyweight, will grow at some 5% and its stockmarket even faster. A parliamentary election must be held in Egypt by November 2000. But do not expect much change as a result. To little surprise, President Hosni Mubarak was elected to a fourth six-year term by a familiar huge majority in September 1999. Exuding a pharaonic interest in the rest of Africa, President Mubarak will host a grand Europe-Africa summit in Cairo in April which promises to go beyond the usual pious hopes. Britain and France will make much of their new entente cordiale in Africa. 
Mr Mubarak is also keeping a close watch on Sudan and Somalia. Much as he distrusts the Islamist regime in Khartoum, which backed an attempt to kill him in 1995, Mr Mubarak does not want to see it forced to concede an independent Southern Sudan. That would challenge Cairo's control of the Nile. But the Khartoum regime will face a new wave of regional and international pressure to end its war with the south that has claimed more than 2m lives in 30 years. In Somalia, there will be almost no outside pressure, except from regional predators such as Egypt and Ethiopia. The rest of the world is still faintly embarrassed by the failure of the multi-billion-dollar efforts to intervene in the country. Somalia will show the world one thing in 2000: that it is quite possible to have a nation without any semblance of a government to run it. Across the continent, Charles Taylor's regime in Liberia is also a proponent of small government and big militias. Mr Taylor and his ally Blaise Compaore of Burkina Faso will show that gangster politics is still pervasive in Africa. 
Democracy spreads 
A trio of more constitutionally minded governments along West Africa's coast-Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana and Senegal-face elections in 2000. Incumbents Henri Konan-Bedie and Abdou Diouf are odds-on favourites to win in Cote d'Ivoire and Senegal. Ghana's poll is harder to read. Jerry Rawlings, an ex-military leader and elected president, may confound the sceptics and step down after his statutory two terms. If he does such an unAfrican thing, he will set an example to the continent and his well-resourced National Democratic Congress Party should win. 
Successions will also dominate politics in Kenya and Zimbabwe where presidents Daniel arap Moi and Robert Mugabe must leave by 2002. Neither leader seems inclined to go. Neither has yet indicated successors. Both have aged badly. For the first time since independence in 1980, Mr Mugabe will face a serious opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change, in parliamentary elections in mid2000. Most hopefully, both countries have a bright new generation of African entrepreneurs-working in information technology and telecommunicadons-who are launching companies on western stock exchanges. 
Both Tanzania and Namibia are on the up. They go to the polls in 2000 and will probably re-elect the incumbent parties of presidents Benjamin Mkapa and Sam Nujoma (even though Mr Nujoma had to change his country's liberal constitution to squeeze in a third term for himself). Promised elections in GuineaBissau are more problematic. The regime came to power after a coup. But elections in nearby Niger, which has a similar history, passed off in 1999 without trouble. 
Africa's coup-makers will find life tougher in 2000. Under Algerian President Bouteflika's chairmanship, the onu is to expel all regimes which come to power through force of arms, discreetly casting a veil over the political history of most of the continent's governments. 
Patrick Smith: editor, Africa Confidential.  1999 On July 2nd Mexico will hold a presidential election that will be the most hotly contested-and fairest-in its history. For the past 70 years, under the rule of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), power has changed hands through backroom deals; before that, it was often by the passage of arms. Now, the voters will be the arbiters. And they will probably choose to keep the PRi in power for another six years. 
Such an outcome is far from automatic. Thanks to the setting up of an independent electoral authority, and Mexico's slow but steady democratisation, the opposition has its bestever chance of winning. But the opposition is divided, between the socially conservative freemarketeers of the National Action Party (rAN) and the left-of-centre Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD). Efforts to unite them behind a single candidate will fail. 
Even without an opposition coalition, the PAN's Vicente Fox, a charismatic campaigner and former manager for Coca-Cola, could still mount a powerful challenge. Even so, provided the ruling party avoids splits, a narrow PRI victory is the likeliest outcome, not least because the party's influence over the media and its scope for making handouts to poorer voters still give it a residual advantage. 
But assuming it does win, which Par will it be? Certainly not the party of old, in which the outgoing president named his successor, whose victory was then assured. In November 1999, the PRi chose its candidate in its first-ever open primary election. 
The intense power battle within the rai could spark violence (as in 1994, when its presidential candidate and general-secretary were both murdered). The election will strain the stability of Mexico's still-evolving democracy and market economy. The defences look stronger than in 1994 (when for the fifth time in a row, presidential succession was accompanied by devaluation), but talk of Mexico gaining an investment-grade credit rating sounds premature until the next presidency is well settled. 
The economy will be hurt by any slowdown in the United States. It could still be badly shaken by political turmoil. But for all these caveats, Mexico in 2000 will start to look (not before time) like a modern, democratic country, driven by a powerful (and even fairly free) economy. In a country whose capacity for cruelty and chaos is greater than most, there is every reason to believe that 2000 will be a cathartic year of change. 
Students of Mexico quickly learn to enjoy paradox. There will be plenty about. A party that was often hated when it ruthlessly clung to power may now be popularly and freely returned to office. Mr Zedillo, who came to office as a colourless technocrat by the chance of a bullet, will have delivered far more radical reform than his macho predecessors. And a country that for many years relied on a folkloric hatred of America for its social cohesion will discover that it has surreptitiously learnt the gringo's tricks of capitalism and democracy, to its own considerable advantage. 
Whoever he may be, Mexico's next president will be weaker than his predecessors, forced to deal (as Mr Zedillo has been for the second half of his mandate) with a Congress in which no party has a majority. He will have to grapple, too, with intractable social inequalities. 
After a decade of warmth, Mexico's relations with the United States could become decidedly cooler, if economic problems north of the border were to spill over into trade disputes, adding to the rising tensions over the illegal drug trade. But NAFTa will survive. Indeed, it is steadily changing Mexico in ways that are already bordering on irreversible.  1999 As with human health, so with national conflict: prevention is better and cheaper than intervention, argues Kofi Annan, secretary-general of the United Nations. 
In the past 20 years we have understood the need for military intervention where governments grossly violate human rights and the international order. In the next 20 years we must learn how to prevent conflicts as well as how to intervene in them. Even the costliest policy of prevention is far cheaper, in lives and in resources, than the least expensive intervention. 
This is why we have been pressing the international community to take prevention more seriously. In cost-benefit terms the case for doing this is compelling. A recent study by the Carnegie Commission on Preventing Deadly Conflict estimated that the cost to the international community of the seven major wars in the 1990s, not including Kosovo and East Timor, was $199 billion. Add in these two conflicts and $230 billion seems a likely figure. 
Effective prevention could have saved most of this huge sum. More important, it could have saved hundreds of thousands of lives. 
Time and again, differences are allowed to develop into disputes and disputes allowed to develop into deadly conflicts. Time and again, warning signs are ignored and pleas for help overlooked. Only after the deaths and the destruction do we intervene at a far higher human and material cost, by which time there are fewer lives left to save. Only when it is too late, it seems, do we value prevention. 
There are, in my view, three main reasons for the failure of prevention when prevention so clearly is possible. First, the reluctance of one or more of the parties to a conflict to accept external intervention of any kind. Second, the lack of political will at the highest levels of the international community. Third, a lack of integrated conflict-prevention strategies within the uN system and the international community. Of all these, the will to act is the most important. Without the political will to act when action is needed, no amount of improved coordination or early warning will translate awareness into action. 
The founders of the uN drew up its charter with a sober view of human nature. They had witnessed the ability of humanity to wage a war of unparalleled brutality and unprecedented cruelty. They had witnessed, above all, the failure of prevention, when prevention was, throughout the 1930s, still possible and every signal pointed to war. 
Of course, as realists we must also recognise that in some cases the sheer intractability of conflicts and the obduracy of the warring parties will make intervention unlikely to succeed. But even wars that cannot be stopped once started might well have been avoided with effective preventive policies. 
We are under no illusion that preventive strategies will be easy to implement. For a start, the costs of prevention have to be paid in the present, while its benefits lie in the distant future. And the benefits are not tangible-when prevention succeeds, nothing happens. Taking such a political risk when there are few obvious rewards requires conviction and considerable vision. 
Second, there are real institutional barriers to the institutional co-operation that prevention requires. In national governments and international agencies, departments responsible for security tend to know little about development or governance; those responsible for the latter rarely think of them in security terms. Identifying such constraints is not a counsel of despair. It is a necessary, if not sufficient, condition for progress. 
The UN has long argued that good governance, democratisation, respect for human rights and policies for equitable and sustainable development are the best form of long-term conflict prevention. The changing patterns of global conflict and governance in recent years, particularly with respect to democratisation, provide ample evidence to support our conviction. 
More votes, less war 
During the 1990s there has been a remarkable and little-noticed reduction in global warfare. More old wars have ended than new ones begun. Between 1989 and 1992 on average eight new ethnic wars began each year; today the average is two a year. Between 1992 and 1998 the scope and intensity of armed conflict around the world declined by about a third. The number of democratically elected governments increased by about the same proportion. 
We cannot leap to the conclusion that the increase in the number of democracies has caused the decrease in warfare. Other factors, such as the end of the cold war, surely also played a role (although the two are obviously related). 
But the evidence is in line with the well-established, if little publicised, finding that democracies have far lower levels of internal violence than nondemocracies. This is not really surprising. The non-violent management of conflict is the very essence of democracy. In an era when more than 90% of wars take place within, not between, states, the import of this finding far conflict prevention should be obvious. 
Prevention is no panacea. It requires that governments act in good faith and place the welfare of citizens above narrow sectional interests. But we know that some conflict-prone governments see prevention policies, particularly those which stress democratisation and good governance, as a threat to their own power and privilege. For that reason, they are likely to reject them. 
The fact that prevention will not work everywhere is an argument against naive optimism, but not against actively supporting democratisation, good governance and other preventive policies. These are not only important goods in their own right. They are also among the most potent and costeffective antidotes to the scourge of war.  1999 Water shortages will grow ever more serious; the stuff of future wars. Levels in aquifers, the underground layers of porous rock which hold most of the world's supply of fresh water, are dropping. By 2025, there will not be enough water to supply the basic needs of 18 nations, including Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Israel, Jordan and the Palestine area. Look out for tension between Turkey, Syria and Iraq over the Euphrates and between Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia over the Nile. With 3.5 billion people affected by water shortages by 2050, conditions are ripe for a century of water conflicts. Curiously, these may well begin in the rich world. Canada is getting upset about losing its water to America. And within America quarrels between the states will grow more acute.  1999 Five main issues will dominate European Union business in 2000. The first will be trade. A new millennium round of world trade talks, launched in Seattle in November 1999, will mean a fierce and deserved assault on the Eu's protectionist farm policies. America, Australia and New Zealand will lead the attack. 
The Eu has no good arguments left to justify its farm subsidies, which cost taxpayers about $50 billion each year (half the Eu budget). They survive mainly because governments fear to offend riotprone Mediterranean farmers. All eyes will be on the defensive tactics devised by the Eu's newly appointed trade commissioner, Pascal Lamy, a Frenchman. France is the most instinctively protectionist country in the Eu. It is the staunchest defender (and, not coincidentally, the largest recipient) of farm subsidies. But Mr Lamy may yet surprise. Some say the new president of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, gave him the trade job because it will take a Frenchman to persuade France to accept a farm deal that includes the necessary cuts in subsidies. 
Second on the agenda is the need for administrative reform. The owlish Mr Prodi has promised to purge the European Commission of sleaze and waste, following the shamefaced resignation in March 1999 of the previous commission led by Jacques Santer. Reform is also necessary to cope with new members, mostly from Central and Eastern Europe. The Eu institutions-mainly, the European Commission and the Council of Ministers-were designed for six member states. A few tweaks have helped them accommodate a current membership of 15. But with the prospect of at least a dozen more countries joining the Union in the coming ten years, changes of substance will be needed. 
This will mean a new au treaty. To prepare it, governments will send ministers or ambassadors to a constitutional conference that will begin in the first half of the year, when Portugal holds the Eu presidency, and which will end in the second half of the year, when France is in charge. The talks must agree to cap the number of European commissioners at the present 20 (or less), however many more countries join the Union. The commission is the Eu's civil service. The commissioners who head it also have a strong policymaking role. At present, big countries send two commissioners each to Brussels and small countries send one. The big countries are resigned to losing their second commissioners as part of the effort to cut numbers. The question is how to persuade the small countries to accept a new system in which at least some of them may have no commissioners at all. 
A way must also be found to allocate voting power more fairly in the Council of Ministers. This body (and not the European Parliament, despite its name) is the Eu's legislature. Big countries have more votes in the council than small ones: the minister representing France has ten votes, his counterpart from Luxembourg has two. But additions to the council down the years have been dealt with ad hoc, and inequalities have accumulated. Governments need to agree on general rules for voting power when any new country joins. 
A new treaty must also widen qualified majority voting in the Council of Ministers. The more countries join the Eu, the more national vetoes may be wielded. That argues for taking more big decisions by qualified majority voting. (Qualified means that more than a simple majority is needed to pass a law. The present formula demands 62 votes out of a possible 85.) But opinions differ sharply as to the areas where more majority voting should be used. 
The Eu must keep sight of its third big bit of business in 2000: the enlargement process itself. Of the 12 countries recognised as possible new members (13 if Turkey is added), the six most promising will complete a first phase of negotiations with the European Commission by the summer. Each will have measured its national legislation minutely against all Eu legislation, and will have drawn up a plan for dealing with shortfalls. But each will have a few last points on which it wants special treatment-a waiver to run a heavily polluting power station, or permission to bar foreigners from buying farmland. These differences are meant to be settled in the second half of the year. 
The closer the first candidates edge towards readiness (Estonia, Poland and Hungary will probably be the leaders), the greater the pressure on Eu governments to give firm dates for entry. Even the most polite countries in the queue are losing their patience. They say that the longer entry dates are withheld, the harder it becomes for them to keep up the momentum of reforms needed to deliver on their side of the bargain. 
The fourth big Eu project for 2000 will be a charter of fundamental rights for all Eu citizens. This will be drafted by a diverse committee of worthies and reviewed by national leaders at a summit in December 2000. It is hard to say in advance how much impact this document will have. It may be just flimflam. It may have all sorts of practical consequences if the rights it enshrines are enforceable directly in law. In Brussels jargon, the charter of rights is meant to bring the Eu closer to the citizen. And too bad for the citizen who craves only the right to keep his distance. 
The final theme for 2000 will be that of European defence, a theme so important that it is dealt with separately in the article that follows. 
Robert Cottrell: EU correspondent for The Economist.  1999 In the coming year, the European Union will move decisively on to new terrain: it will adopt a common and assertive defence policy. In December 2000, at the Eu's Paris summit, heads of government will endorse a plan to give the Eu a military organisation. The Western European Union, a defence club of ten states that is currently semi-detached from the Eu, will be merged with it. The Eu will then be able to undertake small-scale military missions in its own name. 
The rationale of these plans is that Eu diplomacy would carry more weight if underpinned by the ability to deploy force. The initiative is not only about new European institutions, but also more capable armed forces. The Kosovo war reminded Eu governments that they cannot do a great deal without American support. They lack sophisticated command, control and communication systems; enough ships and aircraft for transporting men and equipment; precision-guided weaponry; and the airborne surveillance systems which can monitor events on the ground. 
Thus in the autumn of 1999, when the British government proposed that the Eu should adopt ""defence performance goals"" as a means of improving military capabilities, most other Eu governments welcomed the idea. The point of these performance goals would not be to get Eu states to increase defence budgets, since that is not politically feasible. It would rather be to encourage governments to spend their defence budgets more wisely. 
At present, for example, the combined defence budgets of the Eu governments amount to about half of the $290 billion that the United States spends on defence. But their ability to project force, away from home, is perhaps 10% that of the United States. Too many European governments spend their budgets on large conscript armies, rather than modern equipment and training. Governments need to keep their soldiers at a higher state of readiness; to provide them with the means to be mobile; and to be able to sustain them at a distance. 
Thus Eu defence ministers will agree to set goals (both for the Eu as a whole and for individual countries) on, for example, the numbers of soldiers they could deploy outside the NaTO area, and the length of time for which the force could be sustained. The Eu will not attempt to enforce these targets through centrally set rules. But there will be a process of peer review and exchange of best practice, perhaps supervised by the Eu's new high representative for foreign and defence policy, Javier Solana. 
Britain and France (which is introducing a professional army) already perform quite well; many other Eu countries do not. The Germans have a particular problem, with a large, ill-equipped conscript army that is geared to territorial defence. The leading role of Britain's prime minister, Tony Blair, in this defence initiative is crucial, for the British will have to convince the Americans that European defence is good for the Atlantic alliance. The British must point out to the Americans that the initiative is not designed to weaken NATO. For the Eu is unlikely to act on its own, unless the Americans do not wish to take part in a military enterprise. For example, if the Europeans wished to rescue Eu nationals from a civil war in North Africa, or to deploy peacekeepers in part of the Balkans, Americans might easily decline to take part. The Eu would then take political responsibility for such a mission, while using some of NATO's assets and command structures. 
The French like to talk about the Eu acting ""autonomously"" (a word that annoys the Americans), but even they do not want the Eu to build military organisations that duplicate what NATO does; they know the Europeans do not have the money. Many American policymakers admit to being in two minds about European defence. On the one hand, they would welcome a Europe that could do more militarily, and thus be of more help to the United States when it tries to sort out world crises. On the other, they worry that a more effective European foreign and security policy would sometimes oppose American interests. 
In practice the United States has little choice but to support this European defence initiative, while asking that its particular concerns be addressed (for example, that Turkey, in NaTO but not the Eu, should not be excluded from the new European defence arrangements). For if it opposed European defence in general, or vetoed the use of NATO assets to support the Eu on a particular occasion, this would prompt the Europeans to build military structures that were independent of NaTO, rather than closely linked to it. The United States will almost certainly bless the new European defence arrangements, when they are unveiled in Paris in December 2000. 
The role of individual politicians in making a success of this initiative will be crucial. George Robertson, NATO's secretary-general, Mr Solana, the Eu's high representative, and Chris Patten, the European commissioner for foreign policy, are all pro-European and committed Atlanticists. They will have to make the ""Common Foreign and Security Policy"" effective. And they must convince European governments, as well as Washington, that a strong European security policy is compatible with a solid Atlantic alliance and could even strengthen it. 
Charles Grant: director of the Centre for European Reform.  1999 France will enter a new century as convinced as ever of ""the French exception"", that blend of history and revolutionary culture which the French believe makes them unique-or, as foreigners sometimes reckon, simply awkward. The result will be a year of frequent irritation between France and its allies: there will be rows with America over the ""millennium round"" agenda of the World Trade Organisation; and with the European Commission and fellow members of the European Union over state aids, market access, institutional reform and the pace of the Eu's expansion eastwards. 
Indeed, when France assumes the Eu's rotating presidency in the second half of the year, its central role may increase rather than lessen the frictions. Yet it would be wrong to exaggerate France's awkwardness. On defence, for example, France is well aware, especially after the wars in the Gulf and in Kosovo, of its deficiencies, and so will lead the drive for a co-ordinated European capability. In this, it will build on the agreement reached with Britain at St Malo in December 1998. 
Moreover, many of the irritants in France's outward behaviour will stem from the histrionic nature of its domestic politics, in particular the campaign for the presidential election due in May 2002. President Jacques Chirac, a conservative, is determined to win a second seven-year term; the Socialist prime minister, Lionel Jospin, is determined to thwart Mr Chirac by winning the election for himself and his left-wing coalition. 
This ""cohabitation"" of a president and prime minister in opposition to each other is something French voters have seemingly grown fond of. A charitable explanation is that it forces politics to seek a middle ground; a cynical explanation is that it forestalls much needed reforms-of the tax system, for example, or education or trade union powersthat voters might individually find uncomfortable. 
Whatever the explanation, one of the big tests for Mr Jospin in the coming few months will be the implementation, from January 1st 2000, of a programme that helped win the left's surprise victory in 1997: the 35-hour week for firms employing 20 or more people (smaller firms will have to implement it from 2002). Rather than taking on new workers-the purpose of the programme-employers have tended to react by investing in productivity-raising technology. The consequence is that unemployment has stubbornly remained at over a tenth of the workforce. 
Mr Jospin claims this will change as robust economic growth (forecast at perhaps 3% in 2000) continues. If he is wrong, however there is likely to be a severe backlash from disappointed workers-and damage to several political reputations, especially that of the left-wing labour minister, Martine Aubry. By contrast, the influence of France's employers would increase. In any event, more follies of this kind are unlikely from the Jospin government. 
The debate, however, somewhat misses the point. France remains one of the most state-dominated nations in the Eu, with a costly welfare state (obligatory social charges are around 45% of GDP, compared with about 35% in America), a large public sector and a generous provision of public services. It is this structure, with its rhetoric of ""solidarity"" between social classes, that helps identify the ""French exception"". 
Yet the truth is that France is becoming less exceptional. The nationalisations of the early Mitterrand years have been transformed into a sustained programme of privatisation from which few state firms-not even France Telecom-have been exempted. Indeed Renault, once an emblem of the state sector, has become a private-sector leader confident enough not just to take control of Japan's Nissan but to cut a swathe through its workforce. Meanwhile, hostile takeover bids are no longer inconceivable. French companies, such as Vivendi, seize markets overseas; and stock-options are the required reward of a new generation of senior managers. 
In other words, for all the strikes-by the left, by the students, by the farmers, and by other interest groups-that are a commonplace of French politics, and for all the populist rhetoric against business, France, it seems, is stealthily adopting some Anglo-Saxon habits.  1999 The Germans are in a paradoxical mood. They say they want reforms, but then rebel against the measures needed to achieve them. Most of them understand that public spending is too high. They have been told over and over again that the public debt has tripled since the fall of the Berlin Wall, and is now above the limit imposed by membership of the European currency union. But presented with a tax-and-spending reform package designed to take DM30 billion ($16.5 billion) off the budget for 2000, they have demonstrated their distaste at the ballot box. In a string of regional and local elections in the autumn of 1999, they have given a mighty drubbing to the ruling Social Democrats and their coalition partners, the Greens. Worse could be to come if the voters in North Rhine-Westphalia abandon their long-standing support for the Social Democrats in key regional elections in May 2000. With nearly 18m people, this state has nearly a quarter of Germany's population. Cassandras are already muttering that if North Rhine-Westphalia goes, then so must the chancellor, Gerhard Schroder. 
It all looked very different in September 1998 when Mr Schroder won a famous victory over the Christian Democrat Chancellor Helmut Kohl, a veteran heavyweight who had lasted 16 years in office. True, in order to get a working majority Mr Schroder had to enter a coalition with the small Green Party, a combination that had never before been tried at federal level, and was clearly going to involve some compromises. Fortunately, the Greens' star turn, Joschka Fischer, who demanded and got the foreign ministry, turned out to be both more reasonable and more capable than many of his new colleagues had feared. He also proved a hit with the public: he is now well ahead of the chancellor himself in opinion polls. Unfortunately his party's popularity with the public is on the wane, casting doubt on the coalition's long-term viability. 
The main problem for Mr Schroder so far, however, has come not from the Greens but from the ranks of his own party. In March 1999, only six months into the new government's term of office, Oskar Lafontaine, the finance minister and Social Democratic Party chairman, resigned from his post after a series of stormy disagreements with the chancellor. But out of office has not meant out of sight or mind: Mr Lafontaine has styled himself as the defender of his party's traditional left-wing values, and continues to snipe at the chancellor from the sidelines. His successor as finance minister, Hans Eichel, is a less mercurial character, and much closer to Mr Schroder. He is widely thought to have made a good start in his job, but his detractors maintain he has the charisma of a paper clip. 
Mr Schroder came to office on the promise of delivering a ""new centre"", a somewhat vague concept apparently similar to the ""third way"" successfully pursued by Britain's prime minister, Tony Blair. The two leaders seem to enjoy slapping each other's backs in public, but many of their similarities are only skin-deep. Mr Blair took over as leader of the Labour Party well ahead of the election that brought him to power in May 1997, which gave him time to shape it in his image. Mr Schroder, by contrast, was chosen as the Social Democrats' candidate for the chancellorship only a few months before the 1998 election, so his party remained unreformed and his relationship with the trade unions unresolved. Large chunks of his party are uncomfortable with his attempts to get closer to business, and disapprove of his reform plans. 
For good measure, Mr Schroder is also having more trouble with the Christian Democratic opposition than his majority in the lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, seemed to indicate. The regional-election defeats the Social Democrats suffered during 1999 have lost them the majority they held in the upper house, the Bundesrat, which matters because Bundesrat approval is required for all major financial legislation, including the proposed budget-reform package. 
So will the Christian Democrats play hard to get? They must be tempted. After all, in their last few years in power they themselves were trying to introduce similar reforms, and were thwarted by the Social Democrat opposition which at that time had a majority in the Bundesrat. In blocking these reforms, the Social Democrats introduced a new word into the German vocabulary: Reformstau (reform logjam). The Christian Democrats, having publicly acknowledged the need for reforms, may not want to cast themselves in such an obstructionist role, so the chances are that they will allow through at least some of the budget reforms (but extract concessions in return). 
If he can get his budget through, Mr Schroder's fortunes may yet improve. The German economy, after growing by less than 1.5% in 1999, looks set for 2.5% or more in 2000, thanks partly to strong exports. Despite Germany's image as an economic tortoise-slow to abandon excessive regulation and introduce market reform-a great deal of restructuring has been going on behind the scenes that is beginning to make industry leaner and fitter. Investment looks set to pick up. Inflation has almost disappeared from the radar screen, but private consumption will remain hesitant, because unemployment-which today's Germans care more deeply about than any other economic issue-is likely to remain above 10%. And that figure is an average for Germany as a whole. In former East Germany, which remains stubbornly poorer and less productive than former West Germany, unemployment is double that in the west, at over 17%. 
There is more cheer to be had from contemplating Germany's place in the wider world. During NaTO's intervention in Kosovo in the spring of 1999, Mr Schroder reassured his partners by his clear commitment to the cause and by his ability to keep his pacifist-minded Green coalition partner on board. Looking ahead, Germany is expected to play a prominent part in the negotiations for enlarging the European Union to the east that are now getting under way. More broadly, the Germans> after decades of trying to live down their recent history, are becoming more self-confident: twothirds of them think that the past is becoming less important and that their country, with 82m people and much the biggest economy of any Eu member, should play a leading European role. With the government's move from Bonn to Berlin now more or less complete, 2000 will be the first year in half a century when a German government has operated from a ""permanent"" rather than a ""provisional"" capital. 
If there were to be an election next Sunday, the Social Democrats would probably see their share of the vote plummet well below that of the Christian Democrats, and their coalition partners, the Greens, might be consigned to electoral oblivion. But the next federal election is not due until the autumn of 2002. Mr Schroder clearly cannot afford to be complacent but nor, as yet, should he allow himself to become unduly depressed. When his predecessor, Mr Kohl, first became chancellor, he slipped on so many banana skins that critics doubted he could last his full term. He went on to become Germany's longest-serving chancellor since Bismarck. 
Barbara Beck: surveys editor, The Economist.  1999 The biggest single happening in 2000 will be the World Exposition that opens in Hanover Germany, on June 1st. Some 40m people will visit it before it shuts at the end of October, over 250,000 a day. The World Exposition movement-now shortened to Expo-was started in London in 1851. Then it was held in the Crystal Palace which was erected by Prince Albert, Queen Victoria's German husband, in Hyde Park. When it came to Paris, the Eiffel Tower was built. In Hanover there will be nothing so spectacular, except the statistics: Expo 2000 will generate $1.7 billion; 191 countries will display their wares, mostly in their own pavilions. This will be the first major international event held in Germany since unification. You can be sure that will be worth the visit: a better bet than London's Dome.  1999 Many people have come to see the Netherlands as a model country. It is the most successful of the core Eu countries. Its economy, which combines market liberalisation with social fairness, remained buoyant when several of its Eu partners struggled in the face of the world's economic troubles. But for how much longer can this social and economic ""bed of roses"", to use a popular Dutch expression, stay in full bloom? 
Paradoxically, flourishing economic conditions seem to present the greatest danger. The Netherlands owes much of its success to its tradition of effective negotiation and consensus between the government, the employer federations and the trade unions. This has produced some excellent policies in recent years, such as restraints on public spending, reforms of the labour market and the social-security system, and wage moderation. But these measures were taken in less rosy economic times. Now the 15-year-old consensus is eroding. 
In boom times corporate profits have risen strongly and trade unions are increasingly unwilling to accept wage restraint for the sake of the international competitiveness of Dutch firms, when executives are rewarding themselves with huge pay rises. Unbridled consumer spending and spiralling house prices have cast further doubts on the sustainability of the Dutch model. 
A period of economic belttightening may be just what is needed. Employment growth, which has been a source of envy for the country's Eu partners, will come to a halt in 2000, weakening consumer confidence and dampening the economy. Meanwhile, spirits could be raised if, as many expect, the Dutch national team wins the European soccer championship, which it is co-hosting with Belgium. The Orange feel-good factor tends to work wonders for Dutch morale and community spirit.  1999 Although they live in a divided country, Belgians have a talent for showing solidarity in times of crisis. When faced with an emergency (not a rare occurrence: a string of scandals has entangled the country in recent years) feuds between the Dutchspeaking Flemish and French-speaking Walloon communities are put on hold and people unite. When an outrage involving an outbreak of food contamination through the mixing of dioxin with animal feed erupted in May 1999, Belgians of all kinds responded by being uncharacteristically decisive. They showed their discontent through the ballot box by throwing out the government and putting an end to 40 years of political domination by the Christian Democrats. 
The question now will be: can the new government, an untried combination of Liberals, Socialists and Greens, pull the country out of its doldrums? It is helped by the fact that the previous government did bring public finances under control. After the setback from the food scare, Belgium is back on track to benefit from a general au-wide and global economic recovery. cnr growth will accelerate to a respectable 2.6%. Inflation will pick up slightly but remain safely below the price stability target set by the European Central Bank. 
But the danger is that, once the initial enthusiasm for change has faded along with the latest scandal, the country's underlying divisions will resurface. The new coalition could split not only as a result of the reemergence of linguistic divisions but also over important policy issues such as privatisation, working time, taxation or social benefits. Above all it will want to avoid another major setback and to improve the international image of Belgium in a year when Brussels will be a European city of culture and Ghent will celebrate the 500th anniversary of Charles V's birth.  1999 Several million pilgrims will pour into Rome during the course of 2000 for the Jubilee of the Catholic Church. Catholic parishes around the world are independently preparing their own groups of pilgrims to St Peter's, making the numbers that will come difficult to predict. No other city, except perhaps London, is taking the millennium so seriously, with many museums being renovated and events planned by no means only at the Vatican. Rome's ability to cope with the crowds will be tested well beyond its limit. So, if you have no religious motives to visit Italy's capital, wait for 2001. 
Waiting may prove difficult, though, for Massimo D'Alema, whose centre-left government does not have to face a general election until 2001. His parliamentary majority is a rowdy bunch which includes Catholic militants and greens, free-marketeers and hard-line communists, former socialists and disgruntled faithfuls of Romano Prodi, the current president of the European Commission, who consider Mr D'Alema responsible for Mr Prodi's abrupt dismissal from Palazzo Chigi (the prime minister's residence) in 1998. This is not new, of course, in a country that has had 56 governments since the second world war. 
Yet Italians are growing impatient with short-lived administrations; they want stability. If the current centre-left majority dissolves because of internal squabbles-and it might-the centreright, led by tycoon-cum-politician Silvio Berlusconi, will easily win the next election, despite its leader's legal tangles (three convictions, appeals pending, more trials coming up). 
Youth unemployment and crime will be the most heated political topics. A short-sighted immigration policy and an uncomfortable geographical position-- the Balkans are just a few miles across the Adriatic-have allowed many illegal immigrants to sneak into the country. Unlike the law-abiding million-odd immigrants, many of these clandestine have set up criminal rings that compete or cooperate with the local mob. 
The economy will grow rather slowly but will become more competitive and transparent. Within the European Monetary Union, export-oriented Italy does not have the advantage of a weak currency; and Mario Monti, the commissioner for competition in Brussels, watches severely over his own country. Some will moan as more of Italy's top brands are snapped up by foreign companies. As outgoing investments are five times higher than incoming ones, nobody should care. The complaints of foreign investors will help to cut down the forest of red tape, still the primary problem for Italy's economy. A guess: Fiat, Italy's largest private group, will find the global partner it is looking for. 
Reform in Italy cannot be delayed, despite years of successful resistance. The list of things needing attention is almost universally agreed: 
Justice. The average time between indictment and a court judgment is ten years; eight out of ten convictions that involve prison terms never take effect. 
Defence. The armed forces are outdated, apart from a few elite corps. 
Transport. There are too many strikes in the public-transport system; the motorway system has become obsolete. 
The health service. Hospitals in big cities are run down; there are too many doctors everywhere. 
Welfare. Pensions eat up too much of Italy's public finances and will bankrupt the government unless there are further reductions. 
Each of these will provide plenty of scandals and general unhappiness in 2000. But ferocious lobbying will prevent much from happening. A small piece of legislation, a magistrate, a political party, a street rally: weapons are not hard to find in Italy if you want to stop something from happening. 
The improvements needed in Italy's civic society are also universally acknowledged; and they will also be slow in coming. Too many Italians will avoid paying taxes in 2000. According to one estimate, 30% of all incomes are hidden from the taxman, and up to 50% in the south of the country. Too few will wear seat belts. On average, according to Automobil Club Italiano, only 20% do, compared with 80% in the rest of the Eu. Stopping at zebra crossings will still be considered bizarre behaviour. 
Nonetheless, a generation of professional people, which travelled and studied abroad in the 1980s, is coming of age, and will leave its mark. English will be more widely spoken. And although several north European countries fear creeping ""Italianisation"", Italy will pick up some northern habits. Some good (a less emotional attitude; more attention to the environment; a desire for more stable government). Some less so (more television-watching, more heavy drinking and violence among young people). 
An easy prediction: il calcio (football) will dominate 2000. The amount of money spent by the teams, the television time and newspaper space devoted to the sport will be staggering-even those Vatican pilgrims will notice that Italy has at least another, more mundane, faith. 
Beppe Severgnini: columnist for Corriere della Sera and Italy correspondent for The Economist. His latest book is ""Italiani si diventa"" (Rizzoli).  1999 Adjourn nowadays to one of the Dublin pubs immortalised by James Joyce for some of that famous chat and Guinness, and there is a fair chance that your barperson will be from Brisbane or Barcelona, unskilled in the great art of pulling a good pint of the black stuff. Ireland's prolonged boom is bringing the world to its doorstep. 
The republic is about to enter the sixth year of a cycle in which Irish economic growth rates have outstripped all Eu and oECD states. In 1999 the economy grew by 6-7%, compared with a eurozone average of 2% and an oECD average of about 2.4%. In 2000, Irish growth will probably be around 6%, with unemployment between 4% and 5%, and a surplus of perhaps IRL2 billion ($1.4 billion) for the exchequer. 
The visitor will hear of Monte Carlo-scale prices for houses in the south Dublin suburbs and sonorous tales of delivery delays for new luxury cars. Friday's Irish Times will come weighted with pages of,job offers for computer engineers, investment analysts and financial-services specialists. And, invariably, the visitor will hear the question posed, ""How long will it last?"" 
The answer in terms of living standards is probably indefinitely, although future growth is not going to be maintained at near double-digit figures and the staggering rise in house prices will tail off. The industries that sustain the Irish economic wonder-computers, electronics, pharmaceuticals and financial services-are well-embedded. Membership of the euro will ensure tight fiscal controls, low interest rates and modest inflation. The biggest threat may be the shortage of skilled employees. Ireland's wealth per head may have edged ahead of the United Kingdom but it still lags behind that of France, Germany, the Benelux and the Scandinavian countries. There should be nothing too remarkable about a small state of 3.5m people, by and large well-educated, achieving mainstream European levels of earnings more than a quarter-century after joining the EEC. But there are more searching questions to be asked. 
Dublin is not Ireland. And the elegant villas of Killiney and Howth are not Dublin. Serious problems of regional imbalance remain, with the midlands and the Atlantic seaboard counties trailing well behind the capital and the eastern towns. There are evident problems. The rail system is poor and unreliable. Modern motorways peter off into two-lane country roads. Dublin's daily traffic tangles are the stuff of urban legend. Under pressure from increasingly impatient business and industry sectors, the Fianna Fail-led government of Bertie Ahern will start a IR33 billion programme of infrastructural investment in 2000 to stretch over seven years. 
The republic's middle classes are doing better but the poor, according to the latest OECD figures, are faring proportionately less well. Almost half a million investors made paper profits-at least in the short term-out of the privatisation of the national telecom company in 1999 and something similar is likely to happen, probably towards the end of 2000, with the flotation of Aer Lingus, the state airline. Notwithstanding the emergence of this new shareowning class and the huge increase in jobs, a core of almost 100,000 long-term unemployed will remain in 2000. In certain bleak suburban wastelands the recurring cycle of poor education, crime, drugs and poverty has yet to be broken. 
The priority for the government in 2000 will be to renew the successful national pay partnerships which have set the framework for economic growth. The unions will probably agree if the government can find ways in which to reduce, rather than exacerbate, social and economic inequity and to even out the growing imbalances in regional development. Efforts to date have not been notably successful. Runaway house prices and speculative investment will see many young couples-even those with good jobs-still unable to buy a home in Dublin. 
Mr Ahern's government depends on the support of the Progressive Democrats and a number of independents in the Dail. Two judicial tribunals, sitting at Dublin Castle to investigate (among other things) the allegations of corruption against a former prime minister, Charles Haughey, will be reporting within the next year. So too will be a special committee of the Dail, investigating the role of the banks and the revenue authorities in tax-evasion. The political and business establishments, many of whose leading lights have been in and out of the witness box, await the tribunals' reports with trepidation. So far, Mr Ahern has remained largely untouched by the tide of sleaze but if this were to change it is certain that his coalition partners would insist on a switch of leadership. In that event, watch for the rise of Charles McCreevey, the finance minister, or the clean-cut, not-yet-40, education minister, Micheal Martin. 
There is also something new in the Irish air. The country's once-undiluted enthusiasm for Europe is on the wane. Ireland will shortly become a net contributor to the Eu coffers, bringing the gravy train, which has undoubtedly contributed greatly to the recent years of prosperity, to a halt. Simultaneously, the government's decision to make a military commitment to NATO's Partnership for Peace initiative will provide a focus to the debate over the increase in these international links, and their threat to Ireland's longstanding and sacrosanct tradition of neutrality. 
The slow, painstaking search for a settlement in Northern Ireland will continue. Few expect a breakdown in the form of a return to full-scale violence. The IRA's political wing, Sinn Fein, has discovered that not all power grows from the barrel of a gun-and will be busy during the year, seeking to build its future electoral base, north and south. A working settlement in Northern Ireland would greatly enhance Mr Ahern's political prestige. As ever, in 2000, the Irish both north and south will recognise that they are obliged to share life on a very small island. With peace confirmed in one part and prosperity in the other, 2000 will be a year of promise. 
Conor Brady: editor, Irish Times.  1999 Outside observers tend to imagine that the Nordic countries share common ""Nordic values"" and have the same attitudes towards most issues. But neighbourliness does not mean uniformity. Take the crucial issue of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), which reveals striking differences between the countries. 
Sweden and Denmark, which have so far opted out of the single currency, will grapple with the issue of joining. Goran Persson, the pro-EMU Swedish prime minister, faces powerful opposition to participation from within and outside his party, making a Swedish move towards membership unlikely. Mr Persson will hope that a party congress in early 2000 will at least lead his party to back his policy wholeheartedly. So much euroscepticism in Sweden makes Denmark, which nearly derailed the Maastricht treaty with its infamous ""no"" vote in 1992, look positively pro-European. Its prime minister, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, can expect a majority in favour of EMU membership in a referendum, which could be held in late 2000. 
Finland, by far the most proEuropean Nordic country, was a founder-member of EMU. Finns can therefore worry about other issues, such as electing a new president in early 2000. Elisabeth Rehn looks set to become the first female Finnish president. By contrast, Norway is not even an Eu member (and with oil revenue recovering nicely in 2000 after the 1998 price collapse, Norwegians will be in no hurry to change their minds on Eu membership). That rules out the EMU possibility altogether. 
Whatever the stance on EMU, and despite varying growth prospects (1.8% in Denmark, 4.5% in Iceland), there will be one common Nordic theme in 2000: budgetary virtue. Iceland's budget will be close to balance. And the other four will be able to report a surplus on the general government balance.  1999 An uncanny silence, punctuated by the occasional roar, will fall over Europe for two hours in the early evening of Sunday July 2nd. The continent's lOOm football fans will be glued to their television sets watching the final of the European Championship being fought out in Rotterdam. 
This championship, second only to football's once-every-four-years World Cup, is being hosted by two nations: the Netherlands and Belgium. Ironically, these neighbouring countries have a particular enmity towards each other on the football field; recent matches between them have seen players on both sides sent off, as well as an onpitch brawl. 
For stylish play look to Italy, which boasts the world's costliest player, the 90 billion lire ($50m) Christian Vieri. France, which in a typically centralised French way has a well-financed and well-subsidised development programme for young players, will do well. Not well enough though to beat the Dutch, whose big-name players such as Edgar Davids (Juventus), Japp Stam (Manchester United) and Patrick Kluivert (Barcelona) play in foreign leagues. They have the look of favourites.  1999 The year 2000 will mark the 25th anniversary of the death of General Franco, the autocrat who governed the country for nearly four decades, after scoring a cruel and bloody victory in the Spanish civil war (1936-39). A quarter of a century after the death of the man who dubbed himself ""Caudillo"" (""Fuhrer""), the Spain governed by the children and grandchildren of the civil war bears few signs of the Franco legacy. More than 20 years of parliamentary democracy and a growing openness to the rest of the world have changed the face of Spain. 
Spain in 2000 will be curiously certain as to the role it wants to play: there will be none of the European doubts that there are in Britain> none of the tentativeness about foreign policy still to be found in Germany. Since June 1985, when Felipe Gonzalez, the socialist prime minister, signed the Spanish accession to the Eu, through to its current participation in monetary union, as ratified by the right-wing Jose Maria Aznar, each government has followed the same policy. All political parties have worked for a nation with a capitalist economy, firmly integrated into the institutions of the western world, and all want Spain to be an enthusiastic partner with Europe and with Latin America. The few remaining doubts about the inevitability of these policies have been raised, paradoxically, by more conservative thinkers, the heirs to Franco's power, rather than by Social Democrats. Indeed, the current ruling right-wing party abstained in Mr Gonzalez's referendum on entry into NaTO. Only a few months before coming into power, Mr Aznar had no qualms about declaring his opposition to the euro. Yet today he has emerged as one of its greatest supporters. 
Spaniards seem to feel that international alliances are the best antidote to the devils at home. Spain is anxious to anchor itself in other people's liberalism, lest the ghosts of 25 years ago return. The 20th century started badly for Spain with the loss of the remnants of its colonial empire and its defeat at the hands of the United States. A dogged introspection came into vogue, and Spain distanced itself from Europe. This exaggerated gloom of the past is the intellectual precursor of the equally exaggerated exuberance and internationalism of 2000. 
The enthusiasm shown by some Spanish business executives for globalisation has at times reached ridiculous extremes, with near neo-imperialist overtones. Spain, for example, has become one of the major international investors in Latin America. This has led to considerable resentment from the ruling classes in the so-called sister republics. They welcome the investment, but resent the arrogance of companies such as Telefonica and Endesa. Spain might be their mother country but mother is often best kept 3,000 miles away. 
Spaniards have exploited the unquestionable power of Castilian as the unifying language of more than 20 countries. The cultural unity of Latin America rests largely in the power of Spanish as a common language, in which there are none of the differences or divergences which, for example, separate American from British English. The growth of the Spanish-speaking population north of the Rio Grande gives rise to the hope that Spanish business people and intellectuals may now have an opportunity to flourish in the United States. A number of Spanish media companies are firmly ensconced on the other side of the Atlantic. Seeing this move, many companies from the Eu are now coming to Spain in order to gain a foothold there before leaping across the Atlantic to Latin America. Publishers provide a good example: Bertelsmann, Pearson, Havas and Hachette have all invested in Spain with an eye to the new world. 
The new Spain's global spirit has strange facets. While, for instance, it is considered a sign of modernity to admit to being a Basque, Catalan or Galician nationalist, the old Spanish nationalism hardly dares lift its head at home. It only shows its face, with the arrogance of old, in the American subcontinent. 
Juan Luis Cehrian: founder and publisher of El Pais  1999 After the natural disaster of 1999, a man-made recovery in 2000? Turkey will begin to get its inflationridden economy in order, helped by its first formal iMF agreement since the previous one collapsed in 1995. It cannot afford to do otherwise. 
The 1999 fiscal deficit ballooned into double digits as the economy went into recession and spending ran ahead of plan-first because of government largesse before early parliamentary elections, then as reconstruction got under way in the aftermath of the devastating August earthquake. Spending will have to be checked, but not at the expense of rebuilding the 60,000 homes that were destroyed or damaged in the earthquake. 
Only with speedy reconstruction can the government hope to take the edge off public anger over the authorities' ineptitude revealed by the earthquake. If this does not appear to be working, the government will not hesitate to resort to old-fashioned censorship. With many journalists, politicians and intellectuals already behind bars for no more than voicing their differences with the state, Turks are likely to get on with rebuilding their lives and leave politics to the same tired leaders who have been running the country for years. 
The justice system will come under further scrutiny as Abdullah Ocalan, the head of the Kurdish guerrilla movement, the Kurdistan Workers' Party, faces execution following his June 1999 conviction in a Turkish court. Before the death sentence can be carried out, parliament must approve it. The Turks have not executed anyone for 15 years. Mr Ocalan is, therefore, more likely to rot in jail. Not least, this would help Turkey's relations with the Eu to improve over the coming year. Formal accession talks will not start until human-rights problems are solved. Greece's long-time animosity will fade, but will not disappear altogether.  1999 In 2000, the countries that once loyally orbited the Soviet Union will have much to celebrate. A decade on from communism's demise across Central and Eastern Europe, they have firmly locked on to a new orbit around Brussels. Although hardly paragons of democracy and transparency, they have steered clear of the virulent crony capitalism that has infected Russia and most other former Soviet states. And, for the most part, their economies have proved resilient enough to pull through the Russian crisis and the war in Kosovo relatively unscathed. 
There is still far to go. Even among the frontrunners, such as Poland, Slovenia and Hungary, economic reforms are half finished at best and it is the most socially sensitive of these that have been postponed. Meanwhile, hopes for early entry to the Eu will be dashed again in 2000 despite renewed efforts to speed up the process. As a result, anti-western voices will grow louder. 
The economic picture is mixed, but generally positive. The Czech Republic, the region's fallen star, will start to grow again after two years of painful recession. Now that some of the past governments' sillier plans have been overhauled-including a botched privatisation programme that left insiders, or worse, no one, in control of companies-the economy should emerge more competitive and less prone to currency crashes than before. Still, it will be years before the Czechs can again claim star status in the eastern part of the continent. Overdue corporate restructuring may yet push unemployment over 10%. 
Poland will once again put in an impressive performance. After years of tigerish growth, the economy slowed in 1999, weighed down by the emergingmarkets' crisis. The pick-up it will experience in 2000, registering growth of 5%, will be a testament to its success in moving its trade towards the eurozone, where growth is once again reviving; one-third of Poland's exports now go to Germany alone. 
There is no call for smugness, however. Not even Poland is close to hitting the sort of growth rates that might bring living standards up to European Union levels within another 20 years. Moreover, 2000 will be the year that those countries at the front of the pack have to start grappling in earnest with the second stage of post-communist reform. 
Selling thousands of stateowned companies, cleaning up financial regulation and bringing inflation down to single digits are no mean feats, to be sure. However, the next stage will be even tougher. The region is still full of very big companies in heavy industries that make no profit but absorb plenty of public money. Now that political heads are finally emerging from the sand, the task will be to restructure these, at great cost to jobs, leaving smaller but more competitive industries in their wake. The list stretches from mining (a particular worry in Poland and Romania) to steel and defence. Such restructuring will strain some national budgets to breaking point: for all its economic dynamism, Poland cannot rule out a currency wobble in 2000. 
As governments tackle the most sodaily sensitive areas of economic reform, and jobs disappear in their thousands, public resentment will grow. This will manifest itself in increased scepticism towards integration with western clubs that are seen as driving those reforms, in particular the Eu. For ministers in Prague, Warsaw and Budapest, Eu membership remains the main foreign-policy objective. However, ordinary Central and East Europeans increasingly see the Eu as a protectionist clique that wants to prise open its applicants' markets but is prepared to concede little in return. 
Their distrust of Brussels will spread in 2000, as opponents of membership or those who want it delayed persuade voters that quick accession amounts to economic prostitution. Unease will also grow as it becomes clear that accession talks will get thornier as they advance. Although much ground has been covered, the rockiest areas-in particular agriculture-are yet to be properly discussed. The talks may not founder on farm trade, but they are certain to get heavily bogged down: one reason, perhaps, why the Eu remains reluctant to set firm admission dates for any of the six leading applicants (five from Eastern Europe, plus Cyprus). 
Economic nationalism will grow loudest in Poland. Support among Poles for joining the Eu is dwindling fast, down from 80% in 1996 to 55%. During 2000 that figure will keep falling, to below 50%, as parties that oppose Eu membership, such as the Christian Nationalists in the ruling coalition, strike a chord with the growing number of voters who worry that their country is rushing into a bad deal. The debate over whether Poland has let in too much foreign capital sparked by the sale of most big banks to foreigners, will also intensify. Foreign supermarket chains will come under fire for undermining small local shops. Politicians may be forced to listen. 
Anti-EU sentiment will not be limited to Poland. In Hungary too, there is strong opposition to selling land to foreigners, largely based on fears of German money flooding the market. In the Czech Republic, a kind of cultural nationalism is taking root as intellectuals increasingly criticise the ""mindless"" western films and television programmes that now dominate. Nor is the frustration directed solely at Brussels: in 2000, Eastern Europe's main stockmarkets will lose much of their best business to Frankfurt. 
Some good may come of this. In the mid-1990s, governments in Central and Eastern Europe were able to push through painful economic reforms by blaming them on the iMF. (""Not our fault. Either we do this or we don't get the money,"" and so on.) With the Eu becoming something of a bogeyman in Eastern Europe, the same governments might now be able to use it as a scapegoat for the latest bout of reforms. Take that too far, however, and the reward is entry to a club that your electorate is loth to join. 
Matthew Valencia: Eastern Europe correspondent, The Economist.  1999 Russia will look different next year, but not where it matters. By the end of 2000 Russia will have a new president, a new government, a new parliament and a new image. Its problems, however, will be much the same as before. (This will not bother the stockmarket-at least at first. Expect Russian asset prices to surge in the second half of the year, as outside investors start convincing themselves that the new political leadership makes this vast and cheap emerging market irresistible value.) 
It is true that Russia will sound and feel more consistently governed. The new lower house of parliament, elected (war and bombs permitting) on December 19th 1999, will prove less cantankerous and silly than the one elected four years ago. It will almost certainly get on better with the country's new president, due to be elected on July 3rd. That will avoid some of the crassest squabbles and confrontations of recent years. It will make it easier, for example, to adopt a more rational tax code (the current one offers a bleak choice between insolvency, if followed, and bribes to the tax inspector, if not). Other laws on, say, corporate governance, bankruptcy, or even private ownership of land could all go through. 
There will be other bits of good news. Foreign creditor countries, always willing to give Russia one last chance, will probably negotiate new terms (even a write-off) of the $42 billion state-to-state debt inherited from the Soviet Union. Coupled with a continued high oil price, and perhaps even a new Eurobond issue, that could make Russia's finances look misleadingly rosy. Foreign direct investors, in industries ranging from consumer goods to forestry, will reckon that Russia's 140m population and wealth of raw materials are worth a punt-especially if their investments are underwritten by western governments. 
But the boomlet will be deceptive. Although international goodwill, solvency and sensible laws may be necessary conditions for Russia to prosper, they are certainly not sufficient ones. The biggest problem, of ingrained lawlessness, is the result of centuries of bad government (first feudal, then communist) and will take a generation or more to change. 
This will continue to hit Russia at three levels. First, an alarming overlap between corrupt officials, gangsters and industrialists will remain the central feature of political and economic life. The growth-killing idea that a guaranteed big slice of a small pie is much better than a possible small slice of a much larger one is deeply rooted-and in Russia's dismal condition quite reasonably so. Russia's market will remain oligopolistic-meaning that there is competition of a sort, but only among the limited number of companies willing to bribe their way in. 
Second, Russian banking will remain stunted, unable to channel the country's savings into its industry. A legal system in which a bank can reliably collect the collateral on a bad loan, regardless of the debtor's location or political clout, is still many years away. Timid, underpaid judges inevitably favour powerful local interests. While that continues no sane bank is going to lend much long term. 
Third, everyday life in Russia will remain miserably backward and inefficient. You want a passport? Then go and queue for a couple of days (or slip someone a bribe). You want a driving licence? The same. Or to register your car, pass an exam, avoid military service, start a business? The same. In both the public and private sectors, promises and deadlines are for the most part unenforceable. Every minor inefficiency is somebody's livelihood. In happier coun tries, the public complains by writing to lawmakers or the newspapers-or there may even be an ombudsman, free legal advice or easily accessible courts. Not much sign of that starting in Russia. 
It was these problems that wrecked Russia's economy in 1998. This time the cycle of illusion and disillusion will be shorter. The new authorities will certainly proclaim that a new law-abiding era has begun. There will probably be some show-trials for those figures from the past who have failed to make the necessary arrangements (emigration or switching sides being the two most obvious). But soon enough-by 2001 at the latest-it will be clear that the changes are superficial, and that Russia remains, at heart, as morally and financially bankrupt as before. Investors, remembering how badly they were caught out in 1998, will stampede for the exit. 
Does it matter? Yes. Another crash will underline Russia's isolation from the rest of the world and highlight the gulf opening up, seemingly inexorably, between the eastern and western halves of the post-communist world. 
Edward Lucas: Russia correspondent, 
The Economist.  1999 Like Russia's economy, foreign policy will be deceptive. Under a new president, whether it is the portly Yevgeny Primakov or the steely Vladimir Putin (the latter was President Boris Yeltsin's favourite in late 1999), or some other candidate, the style will be more vigorous and assertive. Alcohol, illness and old age made every public appearance by Mr Yeltsin risky, and sometimes outright humiliating. 
President X will have foreign policy ideas of his own, and will take to the world stage to promote them. This will be something of a shock for western policymakers, used to Russia's role in recent years as a grumpy, unreliable but largely untroublesome force in world affairs. Where Russia still has a few cards to play-with nuclear weapons, or against its even weaker neighboursexpect tough bargaining. The biggest tussle will be over the future of the former captive nations, especially in Central Asia and the Caucasus, and possibly the Baltic states. 
Bad news? Not really. Although some alarmists will talk of a new cold war whenever a row flares up, Russia is so weak that it can advance its interests only if the West loses its nerve. Money matters most to Russia's rulers. Sound and fury are all very well (and so is friendship, although there are few takers on the western side for that now) but making sure that the country stays integrated into the world economy, so as to sell oil, gas, gold and diamonds, to borrow and launder money, and to pay for imports of consumer goods, is most important of all. 
Look beyond the central authorities' stroppiness, and another trend-the decentralisation of foreign policy-will become more visible in 2000. GovernorsRussia's powerful regional barons-are often unsavoury or incompetent (or both). But the brighter ones have already begun to realise the benefits of foreign investment. 
The scores of regional commercial representatives already based abroad will grow in importance. If you want to deal with the men who matter in a country, you end up talking to their representatives. The regions have no nuclear weapons, but on most other questions, the governors' words will count for more, and the central government's for a lot less.  1999 Decommissioning of Ulster's terrorist weapons should be completed by May. Completed? The question is whether the IRA will have started. 
Tony Blair in 2000 will preside over the final destruction of the traditional British constitution. Neither he nor anyone else knows what will emerge in its place. 
The old constitution was highly centralised. In contrast to most democratic countries, there were no autonomous centres of political power. The prime minister and cabinet controlled the legislature. The absence of a written constitution and a bill of rights meant that the courts lacked the power to strike down acts of parliament. Local government was a creature of central government. There was no regional or provincial tier of government at all. 
Centralisation on this scale exhibited all the usual vices: delay, rigidity, excessive uniformity and a tendency towards ""the universalisation of error"", but it had one virtue. Centralisation of power meant centralisation of responsibility. The buck stopped at Westminster. When things went wrong, the British people knew who to blame. If they wanted to throw the rascals out, they knew precisely who the rascals were-as John Major discovered the hard way in 1997. 
No longer. National governments will still come and go, but they now have rivals. The last year of the old millennium saw the setting up of a largely autonomous Scottish parliament and a less autonomous-but still potentially pesky-Welsh assembly. The first year of the new millennium will see the process taken further. 
In early May, London-which has not had a metropolis-wide political authority since Margaret Thatcher abolished the Greater London Council in 1986-will elect for the first time its own executive mayor as well as a representative city council. The new authority's powers are limited; education, for example, will remain in the hands of the capital's 32 boroughs. But from May 2000 onwards London, like Paris, Berlin and Brussels, will have a highly visible presence in national politics. 
The practice of electing executive mayors, new to Britain, will begin to take hold in 2000 as big cities start to hold referendums to decide whether to adopt a mayoral system. Several will conclude that they should elect prominent local boys and girls whom non-locals, especially in Whitehall, will take seriously. The effect will be the rise of a new class of subnational politicians with large budgets and, more important, ample street cred. Britain will soon have its own Brandts, Chiracs, Daleys and Giulianis. 
The missing tier of regional government is already being partially filled in by Scotland and Wales. In 2000 the English regions will move, cautiously at first, in the same direction. All the regions now have development agencies and indirectly elected regional chambers or assemblies, representing local authorities, business and the trade unions. Some of them will be content for now to remain talking shops, but at least three-those in the north-east, north-west and southwest-will press for direct elections and substantial powers. 
At Westminster, the House of Commons, never one of the world's more powerful legislatures, will continue to dwindle in importance. Prime minister's question time-always more highly regarded by viewers of America's C-Span than by the folks back home-will continue to provide light entertainment on Wednesday afternoons. (Both the prime minister and the leader of the opposition, if no one else, will continue to take it seriously.) Elsewhere in the Palace of Westminster life will ebb away, with Mrs spending longer and longer weekends in their constituencies, the chamber itself mostly empty and Commons committees influential, if at all, only at the margins. 
The House of Lords, a charming but normally sleepy body, is going to provide Mr Blair and his colleagues with their one serious in-house headache. The Lords, already shorn in 1999 of most of their 600-strong hereditary element, will require in 2000 to be ""reformed"". The government is committed to reform and by January 2000 will have received a royal commission report detailing proposals for change. How the government deals with the commission's report will constitute a major test of its modernising credentials. 
But the biggest single constitutional change of 2000 will occur on Monday October 2nd. On that day, the Human Rights Act, effectively incorporating the European Convention on Human Rights into Britain's domestic law, will come into force. The immediate effect will be to enable British citizens who believe their rights have been violated to litigate in the United Kingdom instead of Strasbourg; but the more significant longterm effect will be to tilt the balance of power in the British system towards the courts. Much litigation under the new act will be aimed directly at the government itself. Moreover, although the courts will not, strictly speaking, be able to strike down acts of parliament, they will have the power to embarrass ministers by pointing to discrepancies between the new act and all existing and future legislation. 
Mr Blair thus sees power slipping away from Whitehall to Scotland, Wales, the courts and the various new regional and local institutions. The House of Lords in its new guise-whatever that turns out to be-is bound to become more assertive. The Eu already acts as an effective check on British ministers. 
Unsurprisingly under the circumstances, Mr Blair will use 2000 to consolidate his hold on what remains-quite a lot-of British central power. Ministers will have to take even more notice than they already do of the views of the Cabinet Office and the Downing Street policy unit, which, taken together, already constitute a prime minister's department in all but name. 
The British constitution used to look like an elegant pyramid, with power supported at the base but exercised at the top. By the end of 2000 it will look more like an unfinished building designed by a slightly dotty architect. 
Anthony King: professor of government at Essex University: election commentator for the eec and regular contributor to the Daily Telegraph.  1999 The British economy is looking more invincible with each month that goes by. Britain used to stagger like a drunken sailor from crisis to crisis, but now it has by far the strongest public finances in Europe. Its monetary arrangements are singled out by the tMF as a model for other European countries. The financial markets apparently share the IMF's confidence in Britain's macroeconomic stability. Sterling has been the world's second strongest currency since 1995 and 30-year interest rates are now lower in Britain than they are in Germany or the United States. 
At first sight this all seems too good to be true. Most people in Britain are natural sceptics. As they survey the state of the British economy, the natural inclination is to wonder whether things can really be as good as they seem. After all, Britain has an unemployment rate second only to America's among the G7 countries. Inflation has been within 0.5% of the government's chosen target throughout the past two years. There ic a cast-iron fiscal position and a universally admired monetary framework. 
All this means that the British economy will continue to do well in the next few years. What is more doubtful is whether it will continue to outperform almost all other oEcD countries as impressively as it has done since 1994. For Britain is now entering the phase of the economic cycle in which performance depends less on the skilful management of monetary and fiscal policy than on the economy's underlying structural strengths. And contrary to widespread belief, it is in macroeconomic management that the British economy has lately been particularly successful, whereas Britain's underlying competitive structure still leaves a lot to be desired. 
Let us begin with the good news. Britain has done extremely well since 1993 by the standard criteria of economic analysis. And, just as it was possible to predict that Britain would cope in 1998 and 1999 with the challenges of the strong pound and the emerging markets' crisis, it can now be said with reasonable confidence that Britain will remain one of the healthiest economies in the world in 2000 and beyond. 
The economy will grow by at least 3% in 2000, pushing it even further up the league of industrialised nations to a position very close to that of France. Interest rates will doubtless rise in the year ahead-perhaps to a level somewhat higher than the 7% currently discounted in financial markets. Inflation will remain very subdued because of a structural upsurge of price competition in many British markets which have been cartelised for decades. 
In the second half of 2000 the pound may retreat a bit against the euro as a result of the widening deficit in the balance of payments and the accelerating recovery in Europe. But any such move should be modest, since the deficit itself is likely to stabilise at around 2% of cDr and then shrink gradually as domestic demand in Europe expands. Moreover, the pound's retreat will probably come after a period of even greater strength. In fact, before the upswing that began in 1996 is over, the pound should test its 1988 high point of DM3.25, equivalent to =L0.60. 
Sitting pretty on a fence 
The strength of the pound, along with the public's ambivalence towards Europe, will ensure that Tony Blair will continue to sit on the fence with regard to European Monetary Union (EMU) as he prepares for the next general election in early 2001. Thus a decision on abolishing the pound and joining the single currency is unlikely to be made in the period immediately after the 2001 election. More probably, the whole question of EMU membership will be put off again until Mr Blair's third parliamentary term, from around 2005 to 2009. Given the time required for a referendum and then to make practical monetary arrangements, Britain seems very unlikely to join the single currency for at least another seven years. For practical purposes, therefore, EMU should probably be ignored as an operative factor. Interestrate decisions in Europe will not have much influence on monetary policies in Britain. Speculation about an entry rate for the pound in ENtu will have less and less impact on currency investors. And prudent businesses should make their decisions on investment and trade with Britain on the assumption that the pound will continue to float. 
This freedom from arbitrary constraints on economic policy should be helpful to Britain. Since there is no reason to believe that the Bank of England and the Treasury will suddenly lose the skills in demand management which they have developed since the mid1990s, Britain should outperform its more constrained European neighbours-especially Germany-when it comes to keeping both unemployment and inflation under good control. 
Having said all this, however, there must now be some serious questions about how long Britain can keep its economic lead, especially as other European countries learn from Britain's successes and start to adopt more active monetary and fiscal policies to manage demand. Once this begins to happen the great irony of the British economic miracle may start to be understood. Britain's economic success is usually attributed to its flexible labour markets, its competitive markets, its strong entrepreneurship and its dynamic, liberal financial sector. But this image of humming efficiency in the supply-side engine room of the British economy does not accord with the country's relatively poor statistics on productivity growth. The truth is that the transformation of Britain's economic performance has so far been due mainly to skilful demand management. The widely discussed improvements in Britain's supply side have been less apparent. 
Productivity growth has hardly accelerated in Britain since the mid-1980s and has continued to lag far behind the rates achieved in Germany and France. That this is not just a statistical illusion is suggested by anecdotal comparisons of market structures and corporate performance in Britain and other countries. Far from being a free-market entrepreneurial paradise, Britain actually seems to suffer from more cartelised markets with much higher prices than the rest of Europe. It has fewer small businesses than other European countries; and the City of London, even though it remains the world's leading centre for international finance, is notably weak in supporting financial innovation within Britain. British-owned companies, in sectors ranging from engineering, chemicals and computer services to retailing, entertainment, banking and insurance, have generally proved weak competitors in global markets. More and more have succumbed to foreign takeovers. The undoubted strength of the economy in 2000 will not disguise the many weaknesses that remain. 
Anatole Kaletsky: columnist on The Times and director of Kaletsky Economic Consulting.  1999 There will be a great effusion of what passes for British warmth and emotion on August 4th 2000, when Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother turns 100. Unlike the media hype that will go with it, this warmth will be genuine. The Queen Mother is Britain's ""favourite royal"". She has served her country well, most notably standing by her notoriously shy and uncertain husband, King George VI, during the second world war. More recently she has developed the image, with a bright smile and flowery hat, of being everybody's perfect grandmother, or rather, great grandmother. She will be one of about 8,800 Britons to be 100 or over; a reminder of today's longevity. Like all of them she will receive a message of congratulations from her daughter at Buckingham Palace.  1999 Rising crime, hopeless transport, declining services, agricultural crisis-why would anyone want to live in the English countryside? And yet people do: in such large numbers that house-building has become another in the litany of woes afflicting rural areas. According to government calculations, 3.8m new homes must be built in England by 2021 to keep pace with the changing pattern of domestic life. Fine. But nobody has yet solved the question of where to put them. 
On the face of it, it may seem strange that this demand should exist when the British population is more or less stable at 59m. But government demographers base their calculations on changes to the way we live. More and more young people pursue higher education, choosing, in the curious British tradition, universities that are often far away from the parental home. When they finish their studies, they do not return to the nest. Later in life, a third of them will marry and divorce, forcing one partner to set up in a new home. Even the otherwise happy fact that people are living longer has its downside: fewer properties are being released back on to the market through death. Added to these internal changes in demography is the potentially explosive issue of immigration. Official statisticians used to assume that net immigration would fall to zero. Recent figures allow for immigration to rise to an annual net level of 65,000, remaining at that figure until 2036. This alone would create the need for half a million new homes by 2016. Though ministers are loth to discuss such a sensitive matter, and it has generally escaped public attention, the newcomers put extra pressure on the stock of available housing. 
For most of the 1990s, the British domestic property market has been in the doldrums. This has allowed successive governments to put the issue of building new homes from their minds. Building companies were more likely to go bankrupt than embark on ambitious new projects. But in 1999 low interest rates set house prices in southern England fizzing. Soon, no doubt, the chancellor of the exchequer will want to put the cork back into the champagne bottle, but he will find the task even more difficult than did his predecessors if interest rates decline towards European levels. In 2000 prices will probably continue to gush higher, particularly in and around millennium-mad London. House-builders will push hard to be allowed to provide the new homes that are said to be needed, because of the big money to be made from them. The controversial Crow report supports plans to build 1.1m homes in the south-east by 2016. Ashford, Crawley, Milton Keynes and Stansted are targeted for expansion. Councils have vowed opposition. What has been done to ready the planning system for the onslaught? 
The last housing boom came in the early 1980s, when the then Tory government mistakenly believed that the free market would solve the problem. There is not, however, a free market in housing. As a mature country, England and Wales have been subject to planning restrictions since the Middle Ages. By selectively relaxing certain planning controls, the To
ries permitted a rash of low-quality developments, crammed into or around the edges of villages, left floating as detached blobs in the countryside or scrambled into the urban chaos of London's Docklands. 
Margaret Thatcher, when prime minister, had a faith in the motor car as an expression of personal freedom, which meant that many of these 1980s 
developments were inadequately served by public transport. Some ministers of the environment encouraged developers to create new settlements that would provide a large number of dwellings, but they met such public 
resistance that no significant example was actually built. In planning, Thatcherism was a disaster. 
Now, John Prescott, as Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, is attempting to promote a new vision. Ironically, given that he is a Labour minister and Old Labour at that, many of his ideas were pioneered by the Prince of Wales, who persuaded the Duchy of Cornwall to create the model settlement of Poundbury Farm, on the edge of Dorchester. Poundbury Farm is an attempt to rediscover the pleasure of urban living, with a far higher density of people per acre than the suburban norm. Residential, commercial and public buildings are mixed together, so that nothing should be more than a stroll away. These blessings could be conferred on some of our existing towns, Mr Prescott and his team believe, if more of the derelict land that makes them disfunction could be developed. On coming into office, he boldly announced that two-thirds of the 3.8m new homes would be built on these brown sites. 
Enter Richard Rogers, newly ennobled architect of the Pompidou Centre, the Lloyd's building and other monumenu to a whizzy technological future. Made chairman of an ""Urban Task Force"", he was charged with quantifying the amount of brown land that exists and has not found enough of it. He judges that it could not accommodate more than half the required homes. Furthermore, it is often in the wrong place-plentiful in Sunderland and the other post-industrial towns of the north, scarce in popular and scenic retirement counties such as Devon. The Rogers solution is to promote a vision of urban renaissance, strikingly similar to that of the Prince of Wales's guru, Leon Krier. It may be no coincidence that Lord Rogers is partly Italian and Mr Krier comes from Luxembourg. Both want to persuade the British public to behave more like continentals, for whom vibrant city culture is more fulfiling than rural isolation. The key to it is forcing motor traffic-particularly commuter cars-out of towns. Unfortunately for the urban idealists, Tony Blair gives every sign of being unimpressed. Voters like cars. Middle England is not yet ready to exchange its invincible green suburbs for a Barcelona-style existence. The pressure for house-building exists in the traditionally Tory and Liberal heartlands of the home counties and the south-west. Labour finds the instincts of the people who live in these areas difficult to fathom. In the year ahead, however, it will hear their complaints mounting in volume and anger.  1999 Dogs and cats from Europe will finally be allowed to walk straight through immigration into Britain-passport in paw. 
Will Britons be healthier, wealthier, wiser or happier in 2000? Patterns of social and economic change are rarely obvious to the anecdotal observer from one year to the next. Yet statistics constantly remind us how much we differ from our former selves in family life, work, leisure and the issues that concern us. Rising prosperity, technological progress, the breakdown of traditional social structures and the influence of (often Americanised) media are stealthily turning many of us into new people. But they are also creating new divides, between those who are changing and those who are left behind. 
Take health, for example: awareness of the health implications of diet and exercise rose steadily through the 1990s, and will continue to grow. More hours will be spent in the gym by both men and women, and health club chains will remain a fast-expanding business sector. With concerns about the safety of beef lingering in the consumer's mind (even after most scientists have withdrawn their reservations) we will eat more chicken and less red meat; more fruit and less dairy produce. Food retailers will compete to emphasise the ""naturalness"" of their produce, and the absence of anything genetically modified. Yet obesity-an indication both of rising affluence and of dietary ignorance-will also continue to rise, afflicting more than 20% of adults: more than four women in five will admit to a wish to lose 10kg. 
Smoking will continue to decline among the middle classes, and will become almost universally unacceptable in offices, restaurants and public buildings. Political correctness will rule on this and many other matters (even extending to the suppression of the word ""British"" by the sBC in favour of ""UK diversity""). Yet incorrectness will manifest itself in just as many ways. Smoking will remain prevalent among young working-class women, who will also drink more alcohol than they used to. Influenced by ""laddish"" role models such as radio presenter Zoe Ball (whom 86% of teenage girls in a recent poll identified as the person they would most like to be, even though Ms Ball herself may be taking time off in 2000 to be a wife and mother), young women will increasingly see it as their right to behave as badly as young men. And incidences of ""road rage"" and other forms of in-your-face aggression-perpetrated by both men and women-will continue to rise. 
As for family life, there will be less than half as many first marriages in 2000 as there were a generation ago, and two marriages out of five will be remarriages. More than a quarter of adult women under 50 will be cohabiting. More than a third of all children will be born out of wedlock (four times the number of a generation ago) and in some ethnic minorities more than half; more than six births in a hundred will be to teenage mothers. Perhaps reflected in those statistics are some other measurable trends: more women will be ""economically active"" in 2000 (though many will be working only part-time) but the number of men in any form of work will be in long-term decline. People in all forms of office work will tend to work longer hours (and take shorter lunch breaks) and more people in all kinds of work will be subject to the pressures of being selfemployed, rather than collecting a company wage. 
As a result of all these factors, more than 50% of men will consider themselves, at some time in their lives, to be suffering from stress or depression. Meanwhile, more than half of the population will go through the year without any participation in religious activity. By choice or otherwise, modern Britons will have to fend for themselves with much less in the way of family, corporate or spiritual support. 
Will children suffer from this disintegration of traditional structures? The statistics do not tell us directly, but they do show that the children of 2000 will spend ten times as much time watching television as reading books, and that 15% of them will leave primary school unable to read or write. Yet school test results will almost certainly continue to improve, and 2 1/2 times as many of the youngsters of 2000 as in their parents' generation will go on to university. 
Britons will abide by at least some of their old faiths in 2000. One is football, for which it will be ever more fashionable for the professional classes to display an enthusiasm. The other is bricks and mortar: relatively low mortgage rates combined with rising earnings will fuel a property boom, and ""equity withdrawal"" will continue to fund other kinds of consumer spending-on foreign holidays, electronic gadgetry, exotic eating out and Manchester United season tickets, for example. Reflecting rising wealth, there will be more second homes-many of them in France. The success of socalled ""makeover television"", in programmes such as ""Changing Rooms"" and ""Ground Force"" will fuel a continuing obsession with home improvement. 
In summary, Britain in 2000 will be richer, fitter and more sophisticated in its technology and tastes. In many fields, women will be in the ascendant. But it will also be a lonelier, more atomistic society, in which traditional pillars of support are atrophying away. And it will be divided: the gulf of incomprehension will widen between the wired and the unwired, the made-over and the unreconstructed, the young and the old. Most significantly in political terms, a gulf will widen between rural and urban Britain. Economically disadvantaged farming and village communities, devoted to the old-fashioned pursuits of fox-hunting, church-going and family life, will see themselves as threatened and shunned by self-confident, second-home-owning, mobile-phone-equipped, politically correct townies. That division, stridently expressed, will be the clearest of all illustrations of the changing nature of the Britons of 2000. 
Martin Vander Weyer: associate editor of The Week.  1999 Chris Patten, Europe's new commissioner for external relations, reflects on the lasting strength of liberal ideas. 
The countdown to the millennium has been accompanied by list-making on an heroic scale-best of these, worst of those. Who, for example, have been the greatest thinkers of the century, or the full thousand years? Who has shaped the world, or rather who has shaped it for better, not worse? 
Most of the lists try to balance the political philosophers, economists and leaders of the left against those of the right. Ideas, apparently, have to be served up on the basis of ""on one hand, on the other"". But if we are concerned about ideas that have survived and prospered, why include Marx and his progeny of Socialist divines? 
The totalitarianism of the left, so frequently investing the mad wickedness of tyrants with a spurious intellectualism, has earned its place in the history books by the death, misery and poverty it caused. Modern scholarship has shredded what were once argued to be the modest triumphs of Leninism. 
So who from the left deserves to be garlanded on the grounds of continuing relevance? The Marxist empire whether of ideas or of military occupation-has collapsed in Europe. 
Socialism in Asia has transmuted into the robber-baron capitalism of China. Those British prophets of socialism, Tawney and the Webbs, are no longer the intellectual godparents of Africa's development economists. Where guerrillas and terrorists still breed in jungles and slums, they are more likely to be motivated by ethnic hatred, nasty populism and the ideals of the Mafia than by the ideas of the old left. 
Even the contribution of social democracy-Dick Crosland, Willy Brandt and all those who sought to civilise rather than overthrow capitalism-is today a questionable commodity. In Britain, the Labour Party's makeover signals the death of any attempt to justify a programme of public ownership and redistribution. New Labour and its Third Way (in one American critic's phrase, ""opportunism with a human face""), recognises that policies and ideas that once promoted social solidarity now help produce social alienation. The challenge in a Europe where the jobless queues stretch around the block is how to strip away the regulation and limit the state intervention that have helped to gum up our economies. 
My own chance progress from Hong Kong to Brussels has strengthened my sense that the intellectual survivors of this century are the champions of the liberal order that was born in the last, those who understood the strong and comprehensive relationship between political pluralism and open markets. 
I lived through a time, when governor of Hong Kong, in which some Asian leaders and many of those who invested in their myth, claimed that the liberal order was not universally valid. It was, they asserted, a western cultural import, rendered irrelevant and out of date by the rediscovery of a value system that drew allegedly on Confucius and justified crony capitalism and authoritarian government. 
The Asian miracle was the cocky answer to the democratic activists and the advocates of transparency and clean government. Question the so-called Asian values and you were pointed towards the cranes, the towering office blocks and the marbled hotel lobbies. 
I was lucky to sail away from Hong Kong the day before the Thai baht crashed, the Asian economies tumbled, and the vanities of authoritarians and their business buddies were deflated. One conventional wisdom arrived as rapidly as its predecessor departed. From Seoul to Bangkok, governments and others understood the relationship between political and economic reform. 
Clean financial regulation, openness and the rule of law became Asia's watchwords. The Asian crash and subsequent recovery have reasserted the validity of classical liberal ideas everywhere. 
Europe can't boast 
That is not a bit of western bragging, less still a European crow. Europe's miserable history for too much of the past century has been the story of liberal values trampled in the mud. No European politician can claim that a belief in markets and moderation is distinctively and uniquely associated with our own conduct of political and economic affairs. 
But despite our own apostasy, liberal values did survive in our continentthanks in part to the generous and visionary leadership of the United States, and to the huge success of Europe's evolving Union. When I left Asia, it seemed to me that a main challenge to the Eu would be how much we would be prepared to stand up for and support proponents of the market economy and democracy in Asia. But now I wonder whether our main challenges may not be rather closer to home. 
How are we to respond to the Europe beyond the Union's boundaries, where many nations desire to join the Brussels club precisely because it best exemplifies the liberal order? How are we to rescue the Balkans from irreversible descent into ancient hatreds and future miseries? How can we assist Russia, Ukraine and the other new independent states to build open societies under democratic government. How do we associate the poor countries to our south, along the Mediterranean's shore, with our economic success and political stability? 
What is plain is that we will not be guided philosophically in any of these tasks by the gurus of the left. If we want to know who are likely to be the most influential thinkers of the 21st century, we need look no further than the writers of this century who did most to defend and promote the liberal agenda of the recent past. They have been vindicated. Hayek and Popper, for example, will be of more use during the adventures ahead than any of Socialism's advocates, who will lie forgotten as the millennium turns.  1999 Britain in 2000 will again play host to the world's most exuberant non-stop classical musical festival. The festival has no headquarters, no organisation and no name, but it also has no rivals. Musicloving Brits take it for granted. But foreigners are amazed by it-and increasingly book their tickets from Berlin and Bergamo. 
Pick a date in 2000: say, February 2nd. There is nothing at all special about that date (which happens to be a Wednesday). But that is the whole point. 
On February 2nd the London Philharmonic Orchestra and Emanuel Ax will perform the Brahms D minor piano concerto in London's Royal Festival Hall, followed by a suite from William Walton's score for Laurence Olivier's wartime classic, ""Henry V"". Meanwhile, across the Thames in the Barbican Hall, the London Symphony Orchestra under Pierre Boulez will be playing Boulez's own music together with Stravinsky's Petrushka,the Schoenberg piano concerto (with Daniel Barenboim as soloist) and the world premiere of a new work by the British composer George Benjamin. Anyone not in the mood for orchestral music that night can opt instead for Mitsuko Uchida's piano recital at the Wigmore Hall. 
Opera-lovers are also spoilt for choice on February 2nd. At the newly reopened Royal Opera House, Gianluigi Gelmetti conducts a performance of Otello-no, not the one by Verdi, the much more rarely performed version by Rossini. Less than a mile to the west, at the London Coliseum, the English National Opera that evening will perform another Italian opera-Puccini's La Bohemebut this time in English translation. 
Needless to say, no one planned February 2nd's lush musical offerings. No higher authority decreed which works should be performed or where. Autonomous opera companies, orchestras and impresarios took autonomous decisions. The result will be, as usual, a joyous-and unrivalled-cacophony. An equally wide range of offerings will be available on every evening save one in 2000. Only on December 25th will the national score read tacet. 
Moreover, Britain's year-long festival without a name is not confined to London. Despite Sir Simon Rattle's move to Berlin, the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra will continue to flourish in 2000 under its new Finnish conductor, Sakari Oramo. Birmingham's six-yearold Symphony Hall boasts acoustics as fine as any in Europe. 
Further north, Manchester's Bridgewater Hall is home to the city's Halle Orchestra, which fell on hard times during the 1990s but will enjoy a revival in 2000 under its new music director, Mark Elder. Mr Elder is the most experienced of a generation of able British conductors that includes Mark Wigglesworth, Paul Daniel and the young Daniel Harding as well as Sir Simon. 
Opera in the English north will be served in 2000 by the Leeds-based company Opera North, Scotland by Scottish Opera, Wales by the Welsh National Opera, the whole of Britain by Glyndebourne Touring Opera. The ssc maintams orchestras in the north of England, Scotland and Wales as well as the ssc Symphony Orchestra in London. One of the ornaments of Glasgow's cultural life is the Royal Scottish National Orchestra with its Russian conductor, Alexander Lazarev. Another Russian, the violinist Dmitry Sitkovetsky, leads the Ulster Orchestra in Belfast. 
England was once famously dismissed as ""the land without music"", Das Land ohne Musik. England-Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland-will all in 2000 be alive to the sound of music.  1999 In May, on the south side of the Thames, the Tate Gallery will open in the transformed Bankside Power Station. A dramatic home for the Tate's collection of 20th-century art. 
Linking the new Tate with St Paul's Cathedral and the Globe Theatre in Southwark will be the first pedestrian bridge to span the Thames in central London for over a century. It will feel the weight of 4m pairs of feet a year. The British Museum, which attracts some 6m visitors a year, completes a startling renovation with its entire inner courtyard under glass. London's museums have long looked tattier and less loved than their American counterparts. Here, at last, is an improvement. 
Watch out for the arrival of the Gilbert Silver Collection to the newly restored Somerset House (itself a marvel). The gift of Sir Arthur Gilbert, born in London in 1913, the collection, which until recently was on loan to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, comprises some 800 works. It will be permanently on view as of May. 
The world's largest observation whee and the city's fourth-tallest structure will open; it will sweep the skyline at 135 metres, allowing visitors unrivalled bird's eye views of London and beyond. 
Oh yes, the Millennium Dome. It will open amid much hullabaloo. Some of its displays will be intriguing, some tawdry. But this is not something that will swell Londoners' pride. 
There will be a newly elected mayor. Less expensive than the dome but perhaps as big an eyesore.  1999 The 2000th anniversary of Christianity should give ample opportunity for Catholics and Protestants to be encouraged to renew their faith, as church attendance levels around the world continue to fall. Moreover, the year is also the 26th Holy Year, or Jubilee, for Roman Catholics. Holy Years have been announced every 25 years since 1300. 
Many of the religious plans to celebrate the millennium are overt in their commercialism. Some of the projects endorsed by religious leaders have been unorthodox to say the least. Take, for example, the ""Clean the Slate"" campaign in the United Kingdom, endorsed by the Chief Rabbi and the Bishop of London among others, which aims to have a million sins confessed by the end of the millennium. People of all faiths are asked to send details of their transgressions to a post office box in Oxford, or confess them on radio chat-shows. 
In the Vatican the plans are more high-tech. Catholic organisers hope that 13m credit-card devices will be sold to millennium visitors, which will store credit for a wide range of uses from entry to events to phone calls. But then arrangements in the Vatican need to be very slick to cope with the 30m pilgrims expected to visit the holy city. L5 billion ($8 billion) has been spent on preparations for the millennium. 
For Protestants around the world, June will see the millennial version of the annual ""March for Jesus"". Expect 30m Christians on the streets but little media coverage. They will be happy celebrants, in contrast to the thousands of pilgrims suffering ""messianic madness"" in Israel. The year is so significant that many pilgrims will be expecting the Battle of Gog and Magog, and even the second coming of Jesus. A security unit to deal with such problems has been set up and includes agents from Shin Bet and Mossad. 
Health permitting, the pope plans to visit the Holy Land. This will be the first papal visit since 1964. However, it is likely to stir up old conflicts about the status of the cities in the Holy Land. The Vatican believes that Jerusalem should have special status as a religious centre under international guarantee, a proposition which offends Israelis, who see Jerusalem as the country's eternal and undivided capital. The pope will probably visit Nazareth, also an Israeli city, and Bethlehem, part of the Palestinian self-rule territories. 
The problems of the Church of England-worrying about where to find 35,000 bell-ringers for January 1st and the wording of the service in the Millennium Dome-pale in comparison.  1999 It is always dangerous to proclaim that companies from one particular country are on top. In 1989 a Japanese member of parliament, Shintaro Ishihara, bragged ""There is no hope for the United States."" At the same time, various American academics lauded Japan's tradition of industrial planning. The Harvard Business Review hailed the country's ""unsurpassed"" financial regulators. And a rash of books seemed to imply that most of California would end up as a subsidiary of Matsushita. Since then, Japan's share of the world's stockmarket capitalisation has shrunk from 40% to around a tenth. 
Nowadays the same air of invincibility surrounds American companies. ""Dot.com"" books with pictures of T-skirted geeks have taken the place of all those worthy tributes to kaizen. Flexibility, speed, inventiveness, ruthlessness are just a few of the virtues that are deemed to be innately American. In Fortune's annual list of the world's most admired companies, the top ten firms in 1999 all came from the United States; and there were only three non-Americans-Sony, Toyota and DaimlerChrysler-in the top 25. 
Has everybody got it wrong again? The broad answer is no. Even if you think that the American stockmarket is overvalued, even if you are sceptical about the ""new economy"", American firms are still, by most measures of competitiveness, beating the Bejesus out of their peers. Yet there are a few signs in Europe (and to a lesser extent in Japan) that firms are beginning to learn how to fight back. To paraphrase Winston Churchill, the coming year may not be the beginning of the end of American domination; but it might just be the end of the beginning. 
Start with the presumption that in business, even more than politics, the only constant thing is change. One method by which American firms caught up with their Japanese peers (assuming that they were ever behind in the first place, which is another debate) was by copying them. All those books about total quality management and lean production had an effect. Can the Europeans and Japanese catch up too? Today, the superiority of the Americans is evident but it is not universal. There are a few industries (luxury goods, for instance, in the case of Europe; consumer electronics for Japan) where the Americans are still behind. And in some ""neutral"" geographic territories, non-Americans are also doing pretty well. Japanese firms have a strong position in developing Asia, European ones in Latin America. 
The Americans are ahead overall because, first, they are leaner than their peers; and, second, they have embraced new technology. Buoyed by fads like re-engineering, American firms spent much of the early 1990s slimming not just their blue-collar workforce but also their managerial ranks; and they have kept on slimming and outsourcing jobs to other places. By contrast, in Europe and Japan, companies have, depending on your point of view, been kinder, lazier, unfairly restrained by their governments or simply true to their stakeholder principles. Although sales growth in Europe has broadly kept pace with America, profit margins in continental Europe are roughly half those in America. 
But there are signs of change. Already investment bankers are talking about European firms taking a much more aggressive, ""American"" approach to mergers and acquisitions. Certainly, European giants such as Daimler-Benz (now DaimlerChrysler) and Fiat that might once have considered themselves invulnerable, have begun to lop off ""noncore"" operations. Shareholder activism is on the rise in Europe; so is performancerelated pay. 
American firms have always been able to sell to 250m people on their doorstep. Now, thanks to the single market and the single currency, European firms should be able to reap similar economies of scale. Compared with America, Europe has twice as many car makers, eight times as many rail-engine manufacturers and ten times as many tractor and battery makers. 
Ten years ago there was much talk about how Japanese firms had a technological edge over the West. That now seems laughable. Not only do American firms dominate most of the well-known high-tech industries like computers, biotechnology and software, but even in more humdrum industries, like plastics and construction, American companies have been quicker to embrace both the Internet and e-commerce. 
But Europe in particular is not without hope. In pharmaceuticals, the continent is America's equal. There are a few parts of the continent-Finland for instance-that are actually more wired than America. And in one increasingly crucial technology, wireless telephony, Europe enjoys a sizable lead, thanks to firms like Nokia, Ericsson and VodafoneAirtouch, and the pervasiveness of the GsM standard. Europe and Japan, which is also ahead of America, will be the first two markets to introduce a common global standard. As the Internet migrates to ""smart"" hand-held devices, that could give the non-Americans a spur. 
Continental Europe is a morass of interfering regulators, high taxes and inflexible rules. Even were a French business leader to emerge who had the technological brain of Bill Gates and the restructuring zeal of Jack Welch, what could he or she do to get round the country's new 35-hour week? Or the Eu's social charter? 
These rules have long been the American businessman's best friend. European leaders like to insist that the shackles are coming off-even in Paris ""regulation"" has become something of a dirty word-but there is a need to hurry. The consultants at McKinsey reckon that only a fifth of world output, or $6 trillion out of $28 trillion, is at present globally contestable-that is, open to global competition in products, service or ownership. But within 30 years, as various economies (for example, China and India) and industries (retail and financial services) open up, four-fifths of the world economy will be global. That is the prize that the rest of the world's business leaders need to try and wrest away from American companies. But they had better get a move on. 
John Micklethwait: New York bureau chief, The Economist. Co-author, ""A Future Perfect: The Essentials of Globalisation"". published in 2000.  1999 It will be a bruising year for car companies, which are still the mainstay of manufacturing industry in most countries: a time of profitless prosperity. And as car companies go, so may go many others. They will have to cope both with a normal cyclical downturn in the market in most countries, and with the need to reinvent themselves. Expect more mergers to mop up excess capacity: the merger of Daimler and Chrysler has already triggered Renault's fusion with Nissan and Ford's purchase of Volvo. The ways in which cars are made, distributed and sold will also change. New forms of propulsion are being developed that might one day replace the internal combustion engine. And the vehicles themselves are becoming more complex, with more niche products, cars that no longer fit into simple categories. 
The long boom in America, which will see record sales of more than 17m cars and light trucks in 1999 (up from the previous 1986 record of 16.2m), is coming to an end. The huge market in minivans (an odd name for vehicles that look like bungalows on wheels), beloved by Americans, is weakening. Europe's record sales of 16m surprised the industry in 1999. Most companies think the market will fall in 2000, putting further pressure on their slim profit margins. In Japan there is no end to the stagnation that has hurt all the manufacturers. And Brazil is going from bad to worse, racking up losses for the global car companies that have piled billions into new factories there, in the hope of riding the surge in car sales that goes with rapid economic development. Tight credit and high interest rates have wrecked the car market as the government struggles to stabilise the economy after the crisis that began in 1998. 
Outside the special case of Brazil, the market problems are most acute in Europe. There is a basic 30% over-capacity in the European market. Features such as air conditioning, electronic brakes and suspension control are now becoming standard even in small, inexpensive cars, whereas ten years ago they were confined to executive models. European prices have been slipping by about 2.5% a year, enough to swallow improvements in productivity. 
Only DaimlerChrysler and Volkswagen are making decent profits. General Motors and Ford are barely making money on their huge European sales. Fiat is actually losing money. All this will get worse in 2000. Growing consumer resistance to high prices in Britain (estimated to be about a fifth higher than continental markets) is spurring the European Commission to scrutinise ""block exemption"", the system that permits car makers to restrict sales to exclusive dealer networks, thus enabling them to keep prices high. When the exemption expires in 2002, it is unlikely to be renewed. So expect car prices in Europe to edge down, especially as the euro promotes transparency and makes for a regional single market. In Britain both Volkswagen and Ford, faced with customers waiting for prices to fall, have had to promise to reimburse customers for any cuts that take place after their purchase. 
The consolidation that started with DaimlerChrysler will continue in Europe and in Asia. General Motors gets ever closer to absorbing Daewoo, a bankrupt South Korean manufacturer. Fiat and Psn Peugeot Citroen are the two European companies most likely to be absorbed by bigger groups before the end of 2000. Car companies need to have sales of around 4m-5m a year to benefit from economies of scale. This is the strategy that has made Volkswagen so successful in recent years: it is now twice the size of Fiat or Peugeot. In a sense, being global does not matter in itself; it just happens to be the best way to reach the right size. 
As for the predators, both Ford and DaimlerChrysler are on the prowl again. Daimler will probably snap up Peugeot. Ford is renewing its interest in Fiat as a way out of losses in its medium and small cars in Europe. General Motors has been studying a proposal to buy a stake in Fiat's car division and pool its operations with GM Europe. Neither of these American giants can sustain the slim pickings they earn in the European market these days. 
After dithering about it for some time, car companies-especially in America-are waking up to the fact that the Internet will have a big impact on retailing. That is why they are rushing to shorten the order-to-delivery time as customers increasingly want to specify the options and colour from information on a website (after taking a virtual test drive) and then nip round to a local showroom to pick up the keys in a couple of weeks. If car companies can master this, each vehicle on an assembly line will be customised for the buyer; rather in the way Dell Computers does with personal computers. 
Another change comes from manufacturing: Audi is launching a new small car built on a sort of ""space frame"", which amounts to clipping together stressed lengths of aluminium, giving the car its strength, rather than relying on a body shell. The impact of this technology is to permit small production runs. 
Watch out for new types of vehicles in 2000 that are impossible to categorise. For example, Ford's biggest minivan, the Lincoln Navigator, is also a luxury vehicle; likewise the startling rT Cruiser that DaimlerChrysler launches in the spring can either be seen as one of those old ""woody"" American station wagons or as a roomy saloon car that converts into a multi-purpose vehicle. Toyota's revolutionary hybrid Prius model, already selling well in Japan and coming to America and Europe in the summer, is also a new type of vehicle. It runs off a battery electric motor in town to cut pollution and uses a small petrol engine on the open road or to charge the battery. Fewer fumes and fewer companies-the future of the car industry becomes a little less foggy in 2000. 
Iain Carson: industry editor, The Economist.  1999 What exactly do sexy technologies like Internet links and solar-energy panels have to do with petrol stations, the grimy watering holes of the Industrial Age? At face value, nothing. Yet you will see both technologies spread like wildfire across the retail petrol outlets of some of the world's biggest oil companies in 2000. The reasons behind this explain why Big Oil is in big trouble, and suggest an early, if still hazy, outline of the energy industry of the next century. 
The upheaval that traumatised the oil industry in 1999 will continue in 2000, though not for the reason that some suspect. Many have pointed to the roller-coaster ride that oil prices have taken of late, bouncing between $10 and $25 a barrel, as the reason for the merger frenzy that produced the marriages of Exxon with Mobil, Br with Amoco and Arco, and TotalFina with Elf. Yet the price of oil is less important than it seems. 
This is because two forces much more powerful than the fickle oil price are driving the restructuring: the rise of markets, and growing public alarm over global warming. These twin forces are already beginning to transform petroleum from the world's most strategic asset into just another commodity; in time, they may even make it yesterday's fuel. 
To see why, consider an experiment with the first of those two sexy technologies. In America, sr intends to offer some customers who pump their own petrol Internet information, such as weather, road conditions and area maps. The reason companies want to do this is to control costs. Such technology will make pumps so smart that they can re-order petrol as they are about to run out or e-mail for help as things go wrong. 
The pressure to cut costs in the oil industry will only increase as institutional shareholders clamour for better returns: oil shares have had the worst total returns on investor capital of any major industrial sector in the 1990s. It is precisely such pressure that is making the dinosaurs of Big Oil dance so nimbly. While no new colossus the size of Exxon Mobil can emerge, look for the consolidation to continue in 2000 among the mid-sized players like Chevron, Texaco and Eni. 
Get ready too for a fire sale. In addition to merging like mad, firms of all sizes will shed peripheral assets in a desire to convince investors that they will stick to their knitting. Others will sell assets under orders from anti-trust authorities. The big winners will be the nimble entrepreneurs and businesses who could become serious competitive threats to the oil majors. For example, look for firms such as PetroPlus in Europe to expand in refining (ar is one to watch for big disposals in that area), and expect Dow Chemical in America to gobble up speciality chemicals units (as Shell and TotalFina-Elf hive off petrochemicals). The few oil companies that still have some coal assets, such as Exxon Mobil, are also likely to dump these soon. 
Green Giants? Another factor that will transform the oil business in 2000 is growing concern over the environment. At one level, environmental concern is propelled by the Kyoto protocol on global warming, a treaty signed in 1997 that commits the developed economies to make cuts in carbon emissions. This treaty is not just un fluff: it might prove to be the death knell for those oil and coal producers that do not change their ways. 
Government negotiators are due to meet in late 2000 at a follow-up summit to Kyoto in order to hammer out details. It is likely that the Clinton administration, preoccupied with the presidential election in November and fearful of the anti-Kyoto Republican Senate, will push for a postponement of the gathering. But, even if America succeeds, public concern will ensure that global warming stays on the minds of oil bosses. 
That is why they will make big investments in 2000 in cleaner technologies. Natural gas, which is much cleaner than coal or oil, will attract the lion's share of investment. Demand for gas is forecast to grow twice as fast as that for oil over the next decade. A big spur to this dash for gas will be the progressive liberalisation of the gas and electricity markets in Europe and America in 2000. Indeed, the two markets are fast converging in America and in Britain; this will accelerate through ever freer international trading of power. This coming liberalisation will drive some oil companies, in particular Shell and Texaco, to build a bigger presence in power generation. One may even gobble up a big power company during 2000. Watch too for the more adventurous oil giants to venture into the thorny retail gas and electricity game. The European Commission has ordered Eu countries to allow their biggest electricity customers free choice of supplier. In 2000, gas markets will be thrown open. 
The Kyoto treaty is changing the rules of oil in a broader sense too. Markets are already beginning to accept that the aims of Kyoto, if not the terms of the treaty itself, are inevitable. The result has been a flurry of voluntary schemes by companies and national governments to reduce emissions and encourage carbon trading. The result could be that the aims of the Kyoto treaty may well be achieved by a more market-friendly means, than if the politicians forge ahead with a heavy-handed accord. 
Some energy companies will even begin investing heavily in renewable technologies like fuel cells. DaimlerChrysler, Ford and Toyota promise to bring zero-emission fuel-cell cars to market as soon as 2004. As fantasy fast approaches market reality, look for oil companies to invest in rival fuel infrastructure, ranging from methanol to hydrogen to ""clean"" petrol. Oil companies will also increase investments in forestry for biomass energy, and wind power. One scenario that Shell is contemplating is that half of the firm's revenues will come from renewable energy by 2050. 
If that sounds implausible, consider the curious sight of solar panels popping up on top of BP and Shell petrol stations. Why in the world are the biggest purveyors of petrol exposing exactly how filthy their fuel is by installing clean, green solar panels? The reason is that they have already figured out what the rest of Big Oil will begin to realise in 2000: that the rise of greenery, Kyoto or not, spells bad news for those who refuse to embrace cleaner technologies. Small wonder, then, that sr has become the world's biggest solar-power company. 
Vijay Vaitheeswaran: environment and energy correspondent, The Economist.  1999 Still in swaddling clothes at the start of the century, the telecoms industry now feels itself prepared to dominate our lives in the next. Yet 2000 will see the industry's confidence sorely tested. In particular, the telecoms industry's ability to buy its way out of trouble or into new markets is increasingly in doubt: this despite the fact that the stockmarket capitalisation of the industry worldwide is in excess of $1 trillion. 
The primary issue-half opportunity, half threat-is ""convergence"". The term refers to the elision between once-distinct telecoms technologies-the conventional fixed telephone and the newer mobile variety or the public switched telephone network (PSTN) and the Internet. But it also applies to the industrial meshing of the telecoms sector with the worlds of IT, media and entertainment. 
The phrase most commonly used to describe the convergence process to date is ""a blurring of distinctions"" between technologies and industries. Those likely to prosper in 2000 will be those who are able to see things with pin-sharp clarity. 
On paper, the traditional telephone companies are well-placed to operate on all three fronts. Building on their traditional dominance of fixed telephony, they were among the pioneers of mobile services and were only slightly late in arriving on the Internet scene. For most old-style operators, the growth in mobile-telephone and Internet revenues has obscured the rapid decline in traditional telephone revenues, which followed the introduction of competition in developed markets in the second half of the 1990s. These companies were able to buy into the Internet and mobile-phone markets thanks only to the streams of profits from standard wired-phone networks. 
As these funds dry up or disappear, a question mark hangs over the ability of these companies to sustain their assaults on newer markets. Their war chests are not yet empty, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to see how they will replenish them the next time around. 
Events in 2000 will show the way. Far from attempting to create converged companies capable of satisfying custourer requirements in telephony, mobiles and the Internet as a ""one-stop shop"", many major players will seek to spin off their mobile and Internet arms as separate entities. This would enable these operating divisions to raise muchneeded investment capital and to prune costs to levels nearer the ""leaner and meaner"" upstarts they face. 
Although sound, this strategy raises two questions. First, what becomes of the ancient parent, left only with a dwindling share of a fixed telephony market whose profitability is in steady decline? Second, what if the world's tech-obsessed bourses lose their appetites for telecoms and Internet shares before separate subsidiaries can be floated? 
The second question concerns new and old carriers alike. Outside the United States, there are still billions of dollars to be released in government-held equity in the old national telephone companies. Added to this, 2000 will see repeated calls on the world's markets for cash-raising bonds, capital enlargements and loans. Much of the planned expansion in fields such as mobile phones and the Internet has been predicated on the ready access to such funding. 
These cash calls are not getting any lighter. Take mobile phones: the nextgeneration wireless networks are set to be licensed in 2000 in most big countries. Whether or not we witness a stampede for these so-called ""3G"" licences-for a technology supporting mobile access to voice, data, the Internet and video-will depend on whether would-be bidders believe capital will be available to build these new networks. 
This is an important point. Ahead of the commercial launch of 3G networks-- due in 2002-existing cellular networks will become more and more able to support the needs of an information-hungry population. Expect routine e-mail access and the ability of mobile users to ""surf' stripped-down versions of web pages from their handsets to gain prominence in 2000. Given the current growth in the cellular market-which should see a staggering 70% of the populations in the Nordic region owning a cellphone in 2000-there is a risk that 3G systems will be obsolete before they are off the ground. 
Jim Chalmers: editor, Public Network Europe.  1999 The gadget of choice for children of all ages-especially well-heeled ones in their 30s and up-is going to be Sony's new video-game machine. With a graphics engine capable of generating 75m polygons (the basic unit of 3D models) per second, PlayStation2 has five times the power of today's most powerful graphics workstations. But what makes PlayStation2 a natural winner is that it is not simply a videogame console. Apart from being able to play video games on discs with frighteningly realistic graphics and even download new games from the Internet, it can double as a DVD movie and CD audio player. Expect to see PlayStation2 being used as much for downloading and playing movies as for zapping aliens. When? The new Sony game machine hits the Japanese market on March 4th with a price tag of Y39,800 ($370). The rest of Asia will see it during the summer, while America and Europe will have to wait until the autumn. And fast on its heels will come the new Nintendo console, to be called Dolphin. 
The portable video phone will finally be coming to a shop near you. Kyocera has been selling its tiny VisualPhone VP-210 in Japan since May 1999. With its built-in video camera and screen, the portable phone allows a person to see who he or she is talking to, while being seen as well as heard in return. Kyocera's handset weighs a mere 165 grams and has a recommended price of 40,000. Orange, a. British cell-phone company, plans to go one better when it launches its as-yet unnamed wireless video phone-cum-pocket organiser this summer. Its touch-screen can recognise and transmit handwriting as well as let the user download e-mail and surf the Internet. The pocket-sized gizmo can send and receive video phone calls as well. 
The most politically correct form of private transport is going to be the hybrid car. Since launching its little Prius model in December 1997, Toyota has surprised everyone (including itself by selling 30,000 of these part-petrol, part-electric cars that get nearly 80 miles to the metric gallon. Honda has now gone one better with a hybrid called Insight that does 100 miles per gallon-and will soon be coming down your road soon. 
Pocket-sized digital cameras have been around since Casio shook the photographic world with its nifty little QV10 five years ago. But it had only 350,000 pixels (picture elements) per frame against photographic film's millions. Now Japan's digital camera makers are introducing ""mega-pixel"" models. These produce images with a lifelike 2m-3m pixels. Canon's PowerShot SlO costs Y89,900.

The Economist.  1999 Chief executives of America's top 200 companies will take home 400 times the wage of the average factory worker, if share options hold up. 
More and more large corporations will get into the venture-capital business in the years ahead. Is this an oxymoron? Can an established company take the risks and spare the management to invest in start-ups? Unequivocally the answer is yes. In an era when many large firms are questioning the productivity of their investments in traditional R&D laboratories, venture organisations represent an intriguing alternative. 
Much of this interest is being stimulated by the recent success of independent venture-capitalism: for example, the rapid growth of capital under management and the spectacular returns of many funds in recent years. Although total disbursements from the venture industry over the past two decades have been far less than the R&D spending of either isNt or General Motors, the economic successes of venture-backed firms-such as Intel, Microsoft, Yahoo, Genentech and Cisco Systems-have been profound. As a result, several hundred corporate-venture programmes have been established over the past three years to invest in entrepreneurial ventures, whether in spin-outs of internal concerns or in entities outside the firm. Although American and Japanese corporations have taken the lead, European companies-including France Telecom, Reuters and Siemens-are becoming increasingly active as well. 
In the excitement about the current surge of corporate venture-capital activity, it is easy to lose sight of the fact that similar programmes have existed in the past. The first corporate funds began in the mid-1960s. These corporate efforts were spurred by the successes of the first private venture-capital funds, which had backed such firms as Digital Equipment, Memorex, Raychem and Scientific Data Systems. Intrigued by this success, large companies began establishing divisions that emulated venture capitalists. But in 1973, the market for new public offerings-the primary avenue through which venture capitalists exit successful investments-abruptly declined. 
A relaxation of the rules allowing pension funds to invest and an increase in the number and strength of independent venture capitalists attracted big corporations back into the business in the 1980s. By 1986 corporate funds managed $2 billion, or nearly 12% of the total pool of venture capital. After the stockmarket crash of 1987, however, corporations scaled back: by 1992 the number of corporate venture programmes had fallen by one-third and their capital represented only 51 of the venture pool. 
These patterns have led many to conclude that corporate venture-capital is inherently unstable, and unlikely to be successful. In order to test this criticism, we examined over 30,000 investments in entrepreneurial firms by venture-capital organisations in the VentureOne database of private equity financings. Far from being outright failures, corporateventure investments in entrepreneurial firms appear to be at least as successful (using such measures as the probability of a portfolio firm going public) as those backed by independent venture organisations. 
But success is not uniform. The success of the corporate programmes is particularly pronounced for investments in which there is strategic overlap between the corporate parent and the portfolio firm. The success of investments when there is no overlap is much lower. Similar patterns emerge when the duration of the corporate programmes themselves is examined: the empirical evidence suggests that corporate programmes without a strategic focus are less stable than those of independent funds. The programmes frequently cease operations after only a few investments. Corporations with a strong strategic focus are almost as stable as independent funds. These insights are corroborated by field-based research. Corporate-venture managers can select higher quality firms in related industries, and then more effectively add value to these firms afterwards. This is more difficult when the portfolio company is in an industry far removed from that of the parent corporation. 
Why did corporations invest in areas that they did not know well in the first place? The diffuse nature of unsuccessful programmes appears to have reflected internal dissension about the programmes' goals. In many cases, important segments of the corporation, such as the legal department or R&D personnel, were uncomfortable with the programme and sought to restrict it to investing in areas where the corporation had few competing operations. In other instances, senior executives had inflated expectations about how rapidly widely dispersed investments could affect corporate profitability. 
Corporations will come under growing pressure to rethink their innovation plans. The enormous surge in venture-financing, the success of these firms in creating market value, will make corporate venture-capital programmes part of the tool kit for major corporations around the world.  1999 The need for management development has never been more pressing. The world is awash with money but short on the talent needed to meet the combined challenges of globalisation, new technologies and an increasingly entrepreneurial culture. If capitalism is to be democratised through more and more small and medium enterprises, the engines of employment growth, then we can no longer afford good-quality management education to be accessible only to a privileged few. This is a matter of national competitiveness. 
But to serve the boardroom of the multinational, management education must also change. The profile of the successful corporate leader grows ever more complex. The ideal chief executive in 2000 has to be global in perspective yet willing to sweat over the details. He or she must be entrepreneurial yet also be a team player; able to articulate a vision, yet flexible enough to change the strategy whenever necessary. 
Can the businessschool industry, invented in the United States around 100 years ago, foster such new and diverse talents? The robust new insights to guide and frame management practice still flow primarily from academics at the leading schools. But corporate leaders in future will be more likely to cherrypick the ideas of individual academic gurus than adopt the overall intellectual leadership of a particular academic brand. In addition, many good ideas are flowing from the very consultants whom the top business schools trained. Independent-minded academics are not always as inclined as consultants to team up and tackle the really big problems. 
A second strength of business schools is that fast-growing knowledge businesses, including consulting firms, investment banks and high-tech companies, remain heavy recruiters of MBAs. The business schools have done the screening for them. But, increasingly, industrial firms are being priced out of the MBA market at the top schools. In future more companies will turn to talented BA graduates and put them through in-house training programmes. At Motorola, British Aerospace and many other leading multinationals, training can lead to MBA degrees in their own corporate universities. This is the fastest-growing segment of the management development market. 
To retain their premium status, the top business schools will have to attract top faculty talent. A continuous flow of new ideas and a community that fosters creativity are the lifeblood of any academic institution. As in any other industry, business schools need a clear positioning in the marketplace. 
Most business schools do not develop important new ideas but, acting as metoo competitors, repackage the ideas of others at lower prices. Most are in fact training and thinly veiled consulting organisations. The barriers to entry are minimal; a warm body and a chalkboard and you have a business school. There are well over 100 MBA programmes in the United Kingdom and the accreditation process to provide some modest quality control cannot keep pace. However, the demand for management education is burgeoning and, although some of the MBAs granted may not be worth much, not everyone can go to one of the top schools. 
Internet delivery of management training promises to expand the market further. The virtual University of Phoenix has more MBAs enrolled than any other university in the United States. For basic skills training in subjects such as accounting, finance and quantitative methods, distance learning may be feasible. 
But for those softer skills in human resources management, leadership and team-building, face-to-face interaction among students and faculty will remain essential to the learning process. 
The top business schools will use Internet delivery and study groups connected by email to supplement on-site coursework in their part-time or executive MBA programmes. However, there will always be a market for the full-time MBA among bright twenty-somethings who want to take time out to take stock of their career path, brush up on the latest thinking, perhaps develop a business plan for a start-up, and become a member of a global alumni network. But, if Internetdelivered management education develops further, will the quality gap close to the point that the higher prices charged by the traditional business schools are no longer sustainable? 
Recalling the famous case-study on Japanese Honda's entry into the United States motorcycle market, the relative indifference of the top business schools to the virtual MBA is reminiscent of HarleyDavidson's unfortunate smugness. Could the virtual University of Phoenix be today's academic equivalent of the Honda motorcycle of 1965?

For today's bosses there is nothing more shaming than appearing not ""to get"" the Internet. When Oracle's Larry Ellison proclaims that ""the Internet changes everything"" or Intel's Andy Grove warns that in five years' time ""all companies will be Internet companies or they won't be companies at all"", few dare to disagree. But what is it that they are agreeing with? What kind of industrial revolution are they suddenly so desperate to embrace? 
Between 1995 and 1997, when the World Wide Web began emerging as a mass market platform, interest in the Internet as a business opportunity was focused on its potential as a marketing tool and an additional, low-cost distribution channel. Pioneers, such as Dell Computer, also showed that for some companies it could offer a more direct way of reaching customers, cutting out middlemen and resellers who didn't add much value. But if that was interesting for many (and alarming for a few), it was not yet truly compelling. While most media attention was on the glamorous consumer side of the web-content and shopping-and on the gravity-defying share prices of upstart Internet firms such as Amazon.com and Yahoo!, serious, grown-up businesses appeared to be biding their time. 
But no longer. The Internet is beginning to turn mainstream business upside down and inside out. It is fundamentally changing the way many companies operate, most obviously in high-tech, but even in metal-bashing industries. And web-based transactions-buying and selling over the Internet-are only the tip of a massive and expanding iceberg. While some companies are indeed using the Internet to deal directly with their customers for the first time, others are using the Internet's reach and ubiquity to intensify relationships with trading partners, request quotes or liquidate surplus inventory by auction. 
The Internet is making it possible for companies to lower costs dramatically across their supply-and-demand chains, take customer service to undreamed-of new levels, enter markets from which they were previously excluded by geography, create new revenue streams and ultimately redefine the very nature of their business. Entirely new companies are appearing in industries ranging from advertising to road haulage to chemicals. Using the connectivity of the Internet, these ""infomediaries"" create super-efficient electronic marketplaces, bringing together buyers and sellers who previously could not find each other. 
Although limelight-hogging consumer e-commerce is growing fast, it is as nothing compared with both the speed and the absolute amount of intercompany trade in goods over the Internet. Forrester Research, a technology consultancy, reckons that whereas business-to-consumer e-commerce in America (still the most ""wired"" country by some way) will go from $8 billion last year to $108 billion in 2003, business-tobusiness e-commerce will surge from $43 billion to $1.3 trillion in the same period. Forrester expects Britain and Germany to go into the same ""hypergrowth"" stage of e-business about two years after America, with Japan, Italy and France a further two years behind. 
And just as countries are moving towards e-business hyper-growth at slightly different paces, so too are industries. Unsurprisingly, computing and electronics adopted and evangelised the Internet first and are therefore already well on the way to achieving critical mass. But aerospace, telecoms and the car industry are also undergoing massive Internetdriven change and are not far behind. The same is true of other industries, such as financial services, that have appropriate systems-integration skills and have invested heavily in the right kind of iT infrastructure. 
While nimble Internet start-ups are a ceaseless source of business model innovation and have been responsible for giving established giants a nerve-jangling wake-up call (one that rang worryingly late in some boardrooms), it is big companies with real financial and market heft that are now providing the main traction for e-business. Lou Gerstner, the head of IBm, likes to describe the new ""dot.com"" firms as ""fireflies before the storm-all stirred up, throwing off sparks."" According to Mr Gerstner, the storm that is now arriving is ""when the thousands and thousands of institutions that exist today seize the power of this global computing and communications infrastructure and use it to transform themselves. That's the real revolution."" 
Mr Gerstner may have a prejudice in favour of big companies. After all, he runs one of the biggest in the world. But he is right. When a Ford, a Wal-Mart, a BancOne or General Electric (GE) turns itself into an e-business, it is an event that reverberates. Traditionally, IT investments have been inward-looking, concentrated on making each enterprise more efficient in isolation. By contrast, the Internet is all about communicating, connecting and transacting with the outside world. With e-business, the benefits should come not just from speeding up and automating one's own internal processes, but from extending those efficiency gains to suppliers and customers. 
When a really large company, at considerable cost in terms of both money and upheaval, moves some or all of its operations to the web, it puts its trading partners under intense pressure to do the same. Suppliers, and even some customers, who insist on continuing to trade the old-fashioned way will get frozen out, while those that make the effort will win more of the available business. 
And that effort involves more than just iT spending: it is cultural too. No longer can any business see itself as a more or less free-standing entity. It must become part of an e-business ecosystem in which firms that trade with each other use the Internet to allow their partners and customers to enter deep into their internal systems and processes. To reap the rewards of a truly integrated value chain requires a degree of openness and flexibility that comes naturally to few firms. As an executive at Cisco Systems, the dominant supplier of networking gear that many regard as the ultimate ebusiness, puts it, ""You have to be ready to open the kimono."" 
That in turn may mean radically reappraising what your company does or even is. Jack Welch has put ""dyb.com""destroyyourbusiness-teams into every one of GE's operating units to force the Internet revolution through the huge firm. Ford is giving serious consideration to outsourcing all its manufacturing, stripping the company down to its essentials of product development, brand management and customer service. Others will follow. software as a service to be paid for. Another booming sector will be industry portals and hubs. For more than a decade, multinationals have been investing billions of dollars in complex systems designed to automate their internal inventory, sales and supply-chain operations. The hardest part has been bringing their business partners-suppliers, customers, service providersinto the loop: the cacophony of different technologies and data formats is too much for most to bear. The Internet has become the great mediator: the largest single barrier-connectivity-disappears; hubs will emerge in industry clusters to provide a lingua franca for sharing data, from product and price lists to shipping information. 
The aim of this is not so much to help companies sell more goods, but to lower the cost of doing so. This will change the economic shape of the industry. From a race between speedy start-ups to capture new consumer markets, it will become a battle of titans as large, established firms in everything from manufacturing to accounting try to use the Internet to gain advantage over their competitors. The new companies that arise will be those that help companies do this best, whether by providing software, services or a marketplace. A slowing stockmarket will leave scars, but the amount of money available for Internet ventures will remain huge: this is an industrial revolution, not a tulip bubble, and good investors always knew that supernormal capitalisations could not last. 
The other technology trends of the year will all stem from the Internet. Mobile phones using the Wireless Application Protocol will hit the streets of Europe, Asia and America, bringing web access, e-mail, even banking to pocket-sized devices. This is the first big step towards the emergence of handheld devices, from personal digital assistants to smart phones, as a rival to the rc for the Internet throne. Sony's PlayStation2 will mark the rise of the consumer-electronics industry as the rc's other competitor. While the rc will improve and become more popular, this is no longer a one-box game. 2000 will be the year when the seeds of something bigger begin to sprout. 
All new American Ns will have V-Chip technology allowing parents to block undesirable programmes. 
Matthew Symonds: IT and communications editor, The Economist.  1999 Peter Drucker, the grand old man of management science, predicts an unlikely twist that e-commerce will give to every business. 
Traditional multinationals will, in time, be killed by e-commerce. The ecommerce delivery of goods, of services, of repairs, spare parts and maintenance, will require a different organisation from that of any multinational today. It will also require a different mindset, a different top management and, in the end, different definitions of performance. Indeed, the very way performance is measured will change. 
In most businesses today delivery is considered a ""support"" function, a routine to be taken care of by clerks. It is taken for granted unless something goes 
dramatically wrong. But under e-commerce delivery will become the one area in which a business can truly distinguish itself. It will become the critical ""core competence"". Its speed, quality and responsiveness may well become the decisive competitive factor even where brands seem to be entrenched. And there is no existing multinational and altogether very few businesses which are organised for it. Very few yet even think that way. 
The railway, invented in 1829, mastered distance. This explains why, more than any other of the inventions of the industrial revolution, the railway changed every nation's economy and workforce. It changed humanity's mindset, its horizon, its ""mental geography"". 
E-commerce does not merely master distance, it eliminates it. There is no reason why, under e-commerce, the vendor has to be in any particular place. In fact, the customer as a rule does not know and does not care where the ecommerce vendor is located. And the ecommerce vendor in turn, for example Amazon.com, today the world's biggest book seller, neither knows nor cares where the purchase order comes from. 
If the purchase is itself electronic information-a software program or a trade on a stockmarket-there is no delivery problem. The ""product"" itself is, after all, only an entry in a computer memory. It has a legal but no physical existence. (There is, however, a considerable tax problem with this type of trade in electronically delivered goods, which will give the world's tax authorities a headache in 2000. The intelligent ones will drop such taxes, the unintelligent ones will devise nonsense rules of control.) 
If the purchase is a book, there is still not much of a delivery problem. Books ship easily, have high value-toweight ratios and pass without much trouble across national boundaries and through customs. But a tractor has to be delivered to where the customer is and it can neither be delivered electronically nor by parcel post. 
Delivery also seems to be needed for newspapers and magazines, that is, for the carriers of printed information. At least, none of the attempts made so far to sell an ""on-line"" edition to be read on the subscriber's computer or ""downloaded"" from it, has been a great success. Subscribers want their paper delivered to the doorstep. 
Medical diagnosis and test results are increasingly being put on the Internet. But practically everything to do with sickness care-from the physician's examination to surgery, medication and physical rehabilitation-has to be delivered where the patient is. And so does all after-purchase service, whether it is servicing a physical product, for example, a machine or a bicycle, or something as non-physical as a bank loan. 
Cars by e-mail 
But at the same time any business, and indeed any institution, that can organise delivery can operate in any market anywhere, without having any physical presence there. 
One example: one of the fastestgrowing businesses in the United States today is an e-mail seller of new passenger automobiles: CarsDirect.com. Based in a Los Angeles suburb, it was founded as recently as January 1999. CarsDirect.com became in July 1999 one of the 20 largest car dealers in the country, operating in 40 of the 50 states of the Union, and selling 1,000 vehicles a month. It does not owe its success to cheaper prices or to particular prowess in selling cars; in fact in these areas it still lags well behind such older and bigger e-commerce automobile dealers as Autobytel.com or CarPoint.com, a Microsoft subsidiary. But CarsDirect, unlike its competitors, has organised a unique delivery system. It has signed up 1,100 traditional dealers throughout the country to deliver CarsDirect's sales to the local purchaser, with a guaranteed delivery date and with quality-controlled service. 
Delivery is equally important-it may indeed be more important-in e-commerce between businesses. And by all indications e-commerce between businesses is growing even faster than e-retail commerce and is becoming transnational even faster. 
But e-commerce separates, for the first time in business history, selling and purchase. Selling is completed when the order has been received and paid for. Purchasing is completed only when the purchase has been delivered and actually not until it satisfies the purchaser's want. And whereas ecommerce demands centralisation, delivery has to be totally decentralised. It needs ultimately to be local, detailed and accurate. 
Just as e-commerce separates selling and purchasing, it separates making and selling. Under e-commerce, what we now know as ""production"" becomes procurement. There is absolutely no reason at all why any e-commerce facility should limit itself to marketing and selling one maker's products or brands. 
In fact, as both Amazon.com and CarsDirect.com show, the great strength of e-commerce is precisely that it provides the customer with a whole range of products, no matter who makes them. But in traditional business structures, selling is still seen and organised as a servant to production, or as the cost centre that ""sells what we make"". In the future e-commerce companies will ""sell what we can deliver"".  1999 By February the Y2K bug will already be fading into memory, having left a lot less damage than many had feared, but having cost a lot more to eliminate than anyone predicted. Companies that had frozen new IT projects for most of 1999 will now be free to invest in the future, not the past. And for them the future is business-to-business e-commerce. This e-business boom will shift the centre of gravity of the Internet industry towards, well, more gravity. Whereas the Internet stock boom of early 1999 was fuelled by fun consumer companies-Amazon, Yahoo!, AOL-many of the rags-to-riches stories of 2000 will be cast from far more serious stuff: industrial trading communities, web-based outsourcing services, business software providers. Although a new crop of e-business darlings will capture the headlines, most of the real ""start-ups"" will not be new companies, but entrepreneurial efforts within big companies, helping each to shift internally in time with the outside revolution. The best firms will find clever ways to encourage this, by creating in-house incubators, corporate venture-capital funds, even stock-option programmes linked to e-business results. 
Why this shift from consumers to companies? Because that is where the infrastructure is, to say nothing of the money. Assume a ""web lifestyle""-having near-constant access to computers with high-speed Internet connectionsand suddenly all sorts of services, from television to finance, naturally move to the web, where they are cheaper, faster, more efficient and far more flexible than the systems they replace. No big population is closer to a web lifestyle than America's office workers, who are sitting on a decade's investment in rcs, software and corporate networks that has never quite paid the dividends promised. The Internet brings it all together, triggering a second wave of corporate automation and the emergence of a host of business-to-business e-commerce companies and services. 
""Application hosting""-paying outside companies to run your huge databases and supply-chain software-will be one such booming e-business market. Its boosters may pitch it as ""free"" software, but in reality it is the shift from software as a product to be bought to software as a service to be paid for. Another booming sector will be industry portals and hubs. For more than a decade, multinationals have been investing billions of dollars in complex systems designed to automate their internal inventory, sales and supply-chain operations. The hardest part has been bringing their business partners-suppliers, customers, service providersinto the loop: the cacophony of different technologies and data formats is too much for most to bear. The Internet has become the great mediator: the largest single barrier-connectivity-disappears; hubs will emerge in industry clusters to provide a lingua franca for sharing data, from product and price lists to shipping information. 
The aim of this is not so much to help companies sell more goods, but to lower the cost of doing so. This will change the economic shape of the industry. From a race between speedy start-ups to capture new consumer markets, it will become a battle of titans as large, established firms in everything from manufacturing to accounting try to use the Internet to gain advantage over their competitors. The new companies that arise will be those that help companies do this best, whether by providing software, services or a marketplace. A slowing stockmarket will leave scars, but the amount of money available for Internet ventures will remain huge: this is an industrial revolution, not a tulip bubble, and good investors always knew that supernormal capitalisations could not last. 
The other technology trends of the year will all stem from the Internet. Mobile phones using the Wireless Application Protocol will hit the streets of Europe, Asia and America, bringing web access, e-mail, even banking to pocket-sized devices. This is the first big step towards the emergence of handheld devices, from personal digital assistants to smart phones, as a rival to the rc for the Internet throne. Sony's PlayStation2 will mark the rise of the consumer-electronics industry as the rc's other competitor. While the rc will improve and become more popular, this is no longer a one-box game. 2000 will be the year when the seeds of something bigger begin to sprout. 
Chris Anderson: Asia business correspondent, The Economist.  1999 The future of advertising? Seemingly, an enviable one. For the past five years, growth rates have consistently outpaced the general growth of SDP in all developed economies. And forecasters predict another decade of expansion, at an average of 8% annually. This is more than respectable for a business that saw global advertising expenditures top out last year at over $400 billion. 
Yet the compelling issues surrounding marketing and communications do not concern the size or long-term viability of our industry. The key questions grow out of the fact that mass marketing, though still the mainstay of our business, will be on the wane. Our future will involve direct interactions linking producers of goods and services to their customers. This is being mandated by digital technology and the Internet, which are driving the convergence of every form of media. And-in our almost overwhelmingly complex landscape of consumer choice and technological changethere will be an increasingly prominent role for brands and for communications initiatives with measurable results. 
So much for the short answers. To understand and unravel their implications, however, it becomes necessary to take a broader look at major developments in the recent history of consumer marketing. 
For some years now, technological innovation has been shifting the balance of power in all areas of marketing. By leading the way in the capture and manipulation of consumer data, retailers wrested a great deal of marketing clout from manufacturers. This, in turn, gave retailers a major influence on a product's success or failure, as well as an important voice in shaping new product development. 
More significant still were the shifts which empowered consumers. Overcapacity has become the rule in industry after industry, creating a glut of goods in most every product category. An increasingly outdated approach to brand management has leaned too heavily on incremental marketing strategies, such as an over-reliance on online extensions and rudimentary demographic targeting. True product differentiation-the critical ingredient of brand building-has become increasingly rare. As if those challenges were not enough, the proliferation of media has created hundreds of channels through which to reach consumers, all but sealing the fate of mass marketing. 
And yet, these changes pale in comparison to the online tsunami we are just beginning to experience. The size of today's Internet economy has been estimated at over $500 billion, and growing fast. Analysts in our business expect American online advertising revenue to grow from under $3 billion this year to more than $30 billion in five years. That is a conservative estimate, because new media, once they pick up steam, tend towards explosive growth. In 1950, Procter & Gamble spent less than 5% of its advertising dollars on a new medium called television; five years later, it was committing 80% of its budget to television. 
But the Internet is more than a medium in the traditional sense. For the first time ever, message delivery has been linked to distribution, as well as to a consumer who can make purchase decisions-at the click of a mouse. 
This explains why consumers are flocking to the web in greater numbers than anyone expected. Online purchases are accelerating, particularly in the business-to-business area. As a result, marketers are being forced to shift their priorities and come to grips with this new reality. It's not hard to see why the opportunities, and the potential pitfalls, of e-commerce are immense. 
From our point of view, what distinguishes the Internet are a number of unique and sustainable attributes. It is available whenever and wherever you want it. It is incredibly affordable. And it is interactive, That is a combination that cannot be found anywhere else in the marketing universe-which is why the Internet will fundamentally change how companies take their products and services to market in the 21st century. 
The web's combination of attributes also gives consumers unprecedented access to information, as well as leverage in shopping for price and demanding specifically customised products and services. Everyone seems to agree, for once and forever more, the customer is king. 
But the provider is also gaining an important new foothold with the customer. Because in the online world, sellers can identify individual consumers and amass considerable data regarding each and every one of them. Soon, the web will also provide even more sophisticated tools with which to discern and analyse a person's purchase patterns and behaviour. 
Those are the areas in which marketing communications will have the most to offer. As the customer perspective increasingly becomes the key driver of a company's overall business strategy, the role of marketing professionals will become more significant. After all, our key talent is in understanding and motivating consumer purchasing behaviour. We are best equipped to build relevant differentiation for brands. And people will increasingly rely on brands as qualifiers and guarantors in a world in which there is too much information and not enough time. 
Clients, also faced with an increasingly complex marketing environment and tremendous constraints on their resources, will look to us as the conductors of their marketing symphonies-choosing the optimal mix from among the persuasive disciplines, for dozens of product lines, in scores of geographies. 
So, while we still need to draw on advertising, direct marketing, public relations and design, the new campaigns we create will increasingly have to incorporate two important new online components: database marketing services and e-commerce solutions. The Internet makes knowing your customer more important than ever. 
Tom Bell, president of Young & Rubicam, sees the advertising Indus try changing beyond recognition.  1999 The first year of the new millennium will set a new and more cautious tone in financial markets-even if it starts with a Y2K bump. The party of the 1990s had been a wonderful one for most markets: in the developed world Japanese equities were the only serious casualty of the decade. But by the final months of 1999 there was already an awareness that no party lasts for ever and that at some stage it would be time to step out into the night and head for home. 
Looked at globally the great monetary achievement of the 1990s had been the conquest of inflation, the scourge of the second half of the 20th century. Markets celebrated that. They also tried to find a way of celebrating-or at least coming to terms with-the burst of innovation in communications of the past five years. Yes, the new technologies will change the performance of the world economy, lifting it a notch or two, just as other bursts of technical advance have done in the past. But how do you price such innovation? And finally the 1990s saw the world economy become steadily more global, a shift in which markets themselves played a crucial part, but which sometimes brought uncomfortable surprises when one bit of the world did not play by the global rules. 
So 2000 will set the markets three tasks. The first will be to judge the broad levels of inflation that will rule during the first part of the century. Are we talking about the present range of central-bank targets of 0-2.5%? Or will inflation reach the 3-5% region? Or will global prices decline? The second task is to price innovation. Financial markets have a lot of experience of coping with technical change, but have found it tough to price the Internet-related technologies: the volatility of prices during 1998 and 1999 represents a market failure. Markets need to do better in 2000. And the third task, most obviously for the currency markets, will be to figure out how global the world really has become. One obvious question is, ""Do current accounts still matter?"" At the beginning of 1999 they thought they didn't; by the end of the year they had reconsidered that view, particularly with regard to the dollar. 
Expect then for 2000 to see markets the world over stumble towards the view that global deflation in the next half century is as likely as global inflation. Sure, there will be peaks and troughs, and the short-term concern about rising inflation will push up short-term interest rates: first for the dollar, then the euro and by the end of 2000, the yen. But global bond yields need not rise and by the end of 2000 the long-term downward trend in yields should be evident again. 
Falling bond yields will underpin equities, which may well have a rough first half of the year. Bear markets happen, bubbles burst, and American equities in particular spent much of 1999 at stretched valuations. The key to ensuring that a bear market does not damage the real economy is to give share prices an anchor. The obvious anchor will be the prospect of continued price stability. So provided the central banks retain the confidence of the markets, share prices will put in an adequate performance. If they fail, expect a difficult year for all major equity markets. 
As for the second test, expect by the end of 2000 markets to be able to price high-technology stocks with much more confidence. The shake-out will render some of the go-go valuations of mid1999 absurd, but the markets will also realise that the new technologies will lift the productivity of the entire business sector. As markets appreciate that profits will come more from clever application than from cutting-edge development, they will begin to look for the substance rather than the hype. So expect a more mature approach to valuing technology: investors will start to look for profits rather than growth. Maybe they will not demand jam today, but they will want jam tomorrow, rather than jam at some indeterminate date in the future. 
Third, assessing global pressures on currencies: in the dim and distant past (like ten years ago) markets thought a current-account deficit was a sign of economic weakness. Recently they came to see it almost as a sign of strength-a current-account deficit equals strong growth and a capital inflow, which in turn indicates confidence both at home and abroad in the economy. If markets are now becoming more cautious they will want to see deficits start to be corrected, and if the United States does not pull back its current-account deficit, expect the dollar to be hit. If that happens, the other ""Anglo"" currencies, including sterling, will be hit with it. The euro, after its sickly birth, will become a healthier but more troublesome two-year-old. It will be healthier because the European recovery will appear more secure. It will be troublesome because the ""one-size-fitsall"" interest rate will mean that twothirds of Europe has the wrong rate. Tensions between the slower growing core and the fizzing fringe will grow. Elsewhere, expect the yen to have unexpected stability and the gradual recovery of confidence in most emerging markets to continue. 
So 2000 will be a more thoughtful, more mature year in the financial markets than 1999 turned out to be. Expect bond yields globally to end the year lower than they were at the beginning; expect share prices to be steady and recovering, whatever happens in the meantime. Expect technology companies to be rated by a cool assessment as to how soon they are going to be profitable rather than how big they might become. And expect currency stability if, and only if, current-account imbalances start to shrink. As for the wild card of Y2K-the great news will be that by the end of 2000 it will have become a distant memory. But so too will the 1990s party: welcome to a more sober decade. 
Hamish McRae: author of ""The World in 2020"" and associate editor of The Independent.  1999 In most countries central banks now have more power and independence than ever before. Alan Greenspan, chairman of America's Federal Reserve, is probably the most revered central banker in world history. However, as a result of some serious monetary policy mistakes, central banks will face an uncomfortable year in 2000; some are likely to come under fierce political attack. Their prominence will start to decline. 
Central banking as we know it today is in fact a relatively recent invention. At the start of this century there were only 18 central banks; today there are 173. (When economies were on the gold standard or a dollar standard, they did not need a central bank to set interest rates.) Not only have they increased in number, but central banks have also gained independence from governments. Ten years ago, most central banks (the Fed and the Bundesbank being two main exceptions) were still firmly under the thumb of finance ministers, who told them when to change interest rates. But shortsighted politicians were often tempted to engineer a pre-election boom, which pushed up inflation. So today most central banks have been given independence and full control of the monetary reins. The new European Central Bank (ECa) has been set up as the most independent and powerful central bank in the world. Even the Bank of Japan, which has been widely blamed for Japan's prolonged slump after the bursting of its bubble, now has independence in setting interest rates. 
As well as power, many central banks have also won increased respect. This is partly due to their success in crushing inflation-now at its lowest level for almost half a century in the rich economies. But it is also partly thanks to the stunning success of Mr Greenspan in steering the American economy through almost nine years of uninterrupted, low inflationary growth-the longest peacetime expansion in American history. Mr Greenspan is worshipped almost like a god by investors who believe that he has eliminated the business cycle and so ensured ever-rising share prices. 
What might go wrong? Financial markets and the general public have excessive faith in what central banks can achieve. Their ability to steer economies with precision is much more limited than commonly realised. The immediate danger is not that inflation will return to its double-digit levels of the 1970s, for central bankers will be quick to raise interest rates if consumer prices accelerate. Instead there are new hazards to which central bankers, brought up on the idea that their sole job was to defeat inflation, have not yet woken up. Their new enemies are asset-price inflation and deflation. 
Judged by the test of low inflation, both the Fed and the Bank of Japan might be seen to have done a good job. But look closer and America's economy shows alarming signs of excess. By most standard measures, share prices look overvalued; firms and households have been on a borrowing binge; the broad M3 measure of money has been growing at its fastest rate in real terms for a quarter century; and the current-account deficit is nearing record levels. These are all classic symptoms of a bubble. The Fed has made a big mistake in ignoring share prices and these other imbalances. For history suggests that rapid increases in the prices of assets, such as shares or property, can be just as dangerous as consumer-price inflation. 
This does not mean that central banks should abandon the long-term goal of price stability, or try to target share prices. However, they should remember that price stability is not an end in itself, but only a means to the real objective of steady growth. In 2000-as America's bubble goes ""pop""-central banks will come to accept that they must widen their vision to take account of other signs of excess in setting monetary policy, such as asset prices, excessive growth in money and credit, and widening external deficits. 
The Bank of Japan's error lies at the other extreme. It has failed to realise that deflation can be even more dangerous than inflation. Since Japan's bubble of the late 1980s burst, the bank has consistently ignored the economic lessons of the 1930s and been too slow to ease monetary policy to support the economy. Although output has started to recover, Japan still shows many signs of deflation. Prices and wages are declining and output remains well below productive capacity. It is true that Japanese interest rates are close to zero, but when prices are falling, that still leaves real rates painfully high. The recent surge in the yen, which threatens to choke off Japan's fragile recovery and to worsen deflationary pressures, confirms that monetary policy is too tight. Even if the bank cannot push interest rates any lower, it can still push down the yen by, in effect, printing money. Yet the Bank of Japan has stubbornly refused to ease policy to halt the yen's rise. Its official reason is that it believes that policy is loose enough. What really holds it back, however, is that it wants to preserve its newly won independence and is therefore loth to cave in to politicians calling for monetary easing-even if they may be right. 
It may be too late for both the Fed and the Bank of Japan to escape blame. If America's stockmarket bubble bursts painfully, fickle investors, consumers and businessmen will quickly see Mr Greenspan in a rather less favourable light. Expect Congress to try to curb the Fed's powers. If the Bank of Japan continues stubbornly to refuse to ease monetary policy and thereby chokes the economy's nascent recovery, it too will face a political backlash. The problem with increased power is that you get all the blame when things go wrong. 
expected the share behaving ethically to double, to 47%. 
Such changes are thanks partly to investors. Those who want an easy conscience have plenty of choice. A survey of ""ethical"" investment in America, by Wiesenberger, a firm that tracks mutual funds, includes no fewer than 183 such funds in equities and bonds, domestic and foreign equities, small-cap and midcap, you name it. But will the investors see a decent return? The idea that virtue can be consistently more profitable than vice sounds too good to be true. Yet there is some evidence to support the claim. The Wiesenberger study, for example, found that what it calls ""socially screened funds"" had, on average, done consistently better than other funds (although they tended to be more risky and slightly more expensive). 
In the autumn of 1999 Dow Jones published a new index, the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (nasi), which it had drawn up with Sustainability Group, a Swiss firm that specialises in ethical financial services. ""Sustainability"" is defined according to a range of criteria measuring a firm's performance in economic, environmental and social terms. The index is composed of 229 firms, with a market value of $4.3 trillion, that are the 10% most sustainable companies in 68 industries across the world. 
At first sight, the strikingly good financial performance of the index is evidence that the ethical crowd are on to something. The companies in the index, which includes names such as Honeywell, Unilever, Skandia and Fujitsu, had on average produced higher shareholder returns over five years than other firms in their part of the world; on the whole, they also did better than the rest of their particular industry. 
Yet if lousy firms conclude that they can solve their problems simply by being nicer to their workers, they may be in for a shock. Which comes first, sustainability, profits or good management? Remember the old maxim that a clean factory is an efficient factory. Able managers tend to avoid waste, prevent accidents and motivate their staff, whether they are setting out to be sustainable or not. Few of the firms contained in the n,rsi satisfy the enthusiasts' call for a ""triple bottom line"" that would elevate social and environmental reporting to the status of financial reporting. 
Arguably, business ethics is as much about protection as opportunism. After damaging scandals, firms such as Nike and Mattel have felt obliged to pay closer attention to, say, working conditions in their suppliers' factories. Yet poor old Shell, which had spent a lot of money on trying to be a good corporate citizen, encountered a storm after it said it would dump the Brent Spar oil-platform in an ocean trench-even though the idea eventually proved reasonable. Similarly, Monsanto, an American firm that has shown a keen interest in the triple bottom line, is now a bogeyman in Europe because it makes genetically modified organisms. Ethical behaviour offers some insurance against public-relations disasters, but it is by no means a guarantee. 
sions, and without a bid-offer spread, will be launched in the second half of 2000. Smaller broker-dealers will find it particularly hard to cope in this new environment. They may have to slim down services, such as research, which is traditionally paid for through trading commission, in order to trim costs. Posit, a similar system, which allows institutional investors to deal with each other blindly-thus lessening the risk that the market will move away from them when they place a large order-will further develop and expand its young business. Other electronic networks, such as Island, one of the best-known American ECNS, will consider expanding into Europe. 
European exchanges will struggle to establish a viable alternative to America's NASDAQ, where Microsoft is listed, for young European high-tech companies. NASDAQ's listings of European equities have stalled since the launch of Frankfurt's Neuer Markt in March 1997. The Neuer Markt faces new competition from techMARK, the London Stock Exchange's new market for technology stocks, and reinvigorated rivalry from its four fellow euro-zone partners in Euro NM, an alliance of markets for young high-tech companies from EASDAQ, which was also set up as a direct copy of NASDAQ. 
Europe's 31 depositories will come under pressure to consolidate from Europe's banks, which are irate at being asked to pay for overlapping and incompatible systems. Smaller depositories will be encouraged to sign up for one of three models of integration on offer. Euroclear, the international bond clearing house, while it has the support of the big international banks for its ""hub and spokes"" model, will struggle to gain the co-operation of other European clearing houses, until its ties with operator J.P. Morgan are finally severed in 2002. That may give its rival, Cedel, time to make progress in its establishment of a ""European Clearing House"". London's Crest will also tie up a few more countries' clearing systems, along with Ireland's and Switzerland's, into its network. By the end of 2000, Europe will not have a single market for European equities, but the shape of the new market will become clearer. 
Goodbye to Glass-Steagall, the law that kept American 
financial services apart. Now banking-braking-insuring conglomerates will form rapidly. 
More strength to Wall Street. 
Pam Woodall: economics editor, The Economist.  1999 ""Goodness is greed."" Such would be the text of Gordon Gekko, the beastly broker from Wall Street, were he today to preach how firms should conduct themselves in 2000. Companies increasingly seem to think that being ""ethical"" will make them rich. Groups as different as Electrolux, a Swedish white-goods firm, and DuPont, an American chemicals giant, have taken to the idea that the best way to be nice to your shareholders is to be nice to your workers and your environment too. 
The ethics of self interest is not a new philosophy, but it is moving inexorably from the campaigners' den to the boardroom. Firms that once attracted the fury of non-governmental organisations (NGOS) have crossed the barricades. Rio Tinto and Placer Dome, two mining companies, are part of a consortium that is setting out to advise firms on how to provide health care for the people living around their mines. Similar guidelines are being drawn up by a body that sets standards for a group of oil companies, including Royal Dutch/Shell and BP. The World Health Organisation, under its new head, Gro Harlem Brundtland, a former prime minister of Norway, has for the first time begun to work closely with private companies. In 1999 De Beers, another mining firm, paid $2.7m to help eradicate polio in Angola. 
Such collaboration is becoming almost fashionable. A survey of 133 NGOS, published by PricewaterhouseCoopers, an accountancy firm, found that their attitudes to business are rapidly changing. NGOS currently take a dim view of multinational companies, with 41% describing relations as ""antagonistic"" and 62% believing that capitalists do not much care about ethics. But the same NGOS thought that in the future (the survey did not specify when) the share of multinational companies that want to co-operate with NGOS will increase fivefold, to 61%; they expected the share behaving ethically to double, to 47%. 
Such changes are thanks partly to investors. Those who want an easy conscience have plenty of choice. A survey of ""ethical"" investment in America, by Wiesenberger, a firm that tracks mutual funds, includes no fewer than 183 such funds in equities and bonds, domestic and foreign equities, small-cap and midcap, you name it. But will the investors see a decent return? The idea that virtue can be consistently more profitable than vice sounds too good to be true. Yet there is some evidence to support the claim. The Wiesenberger study, for example, found that what it calls ""socially screened funds"" had, on average, done consistently better than other funds (although they tended to be more risky and slightly more expensive). 
In the autumn of 1999 Dow Jones published a new index, the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI), which it had drawn up with Sustainability Group, a Swiss firm that specialises in ethical financial services. ""Sustainability"" is defined according to a range of criteria measuring a firm's performance in economic, environmental and social terms. The index is composed of 229 firms, with a market value of $4.3 trillion, that are the 10% most sustainable companies in 68 industries across the world. 
At first sight, the strikingly good financial performance of the index is evidence that the ethical crowd are on to something. The companies in the index, which includes names such as Honeywell, Unilever, Skandia and Fujitsu, had on average produced higher shareholder returns over five years than other firms in their part of the world; on the whole, they also did better than the rest of their particular industry. 
Yet if lousy firms conclude that they can solve their problems simply by being nicer to their workers, they may be in for a shock. Which comes first, sustainability, profits or good management? Remember the old maxim that a clean factory is an efficient factory. Able managers tend to avoid waste, prevent accidents and motivate their staff, whether they are setting out to be sustainable or not. Few of the firms contained in the DJSI satisfy the enthusiasts' call for a ""triple bottom line"" that would elevate social and environmental reporting to the status of financial reporting. 
Arguably, business ethics is as much about protection as opportunism. After damaging scandals, firms such as Nike and Mattel have felt obliged to pay closer attention to, say, working conditions in their suppliers' factories. Yet poor old Shell, which had spent a lot of money on trying to be a good corporate citizen, encountered a storm after it said it would dump the Brent Spar oil-platform in an ocean trench-even though the idea eventually proved reasonable. Similarly, Monsanto, an American firm that has shown a keen interest in the triple bottom line, is now a bogeyman in Europe because it makes genetically modified organisms. Ethical behaviour offers some insurance against public-relations disasters, but it is by no means a guarantee. 
Edward Carr: business editor, The Economist.  1999 Emerging markets are back on line. Net private inflows of capital into the emerging economies will total around $120 billion in 2000, a 75% increase on 1999 levels. Latin America will receive the major share, the result of having rich old Uncle Sam next door and a relatively well-established rule of law. Although flows into Asia are looking healthier, the region will suffer a net outflow as loans are repaid. A return to the 1996 inflow of $100 billion is unlikely for at least the next three years. Problems in Indonesia and China will get worse before they get better. And investors know it.  1999 In a few years' time our e-wise grandchildren will wonder how on earth a market worked without the Internet. Such is the sublime ease with which it brings buyers and sellers together, transfers information-everyone's favourite commodity-and allows you to buy and sell any time, any place, that real markets seem hopelessly clumsy in comparison. 
You may well want to disabuse these youngsters over their cyber-naivety, but when it comes to trading shares on the Internet they will definitely be on to something. The trick with equity trading is simple: the Internet allows far more people into the market, settlement can be made just by switching a few digits around in cyberspace and you can trade when you want, where you want. The Internet and share-trading are, in short, what the word synergy was invented for. 
So prediction number one: massive growth. Jupiter Communications, an IT consultancy, estimates that by 2003 online brokerages will be managing assets worth $3 trillion. That is roughly equivalent to what the top three investment banks held in 1998, a sizable slice of the international asset pie. Forrester, another IT consultancy, predicts that the number of households with online accounts will more than quadruple over the next three years from 5m in 1999. In Japan, investors will use their games consoles to trade. 
For many, the obvious winners of the current trend are the big discounters such as E*Trade (the largest Internet-only broker), Datek and Ameritrade, which stack trades high and sell them low. These are the brokers of choice for America's 5,000 day-traders. 
Yet, for all the radical new dynamics at the core of the e-brokerage business model lies an old-fashioned economic conundrum-the pay-off between price and value. Low prices are not everything-many people would prefer some advice too. That is why even after 20 years of deregulated commission rates, American discounters have cornered only 25% of the retail market. With ""free trades"" probably arriving in 2000 (paid for by those guys in advertising), revenues will undoubtedly fall. Thus prediction number two: price wars will lead to largely pyrrhic victories for a few discounters. 
In reaction, many companies will attempt to add value to lowish prices. Traditional discounters are moving upstream to become ""mid-tier"" firms. Charles Schwab and Fidelity will seek to sell advice, portfolio management and even banking services to their clients. Forrester estimates that assets managed by the mid-tiers will grow tenfold by 2003 to $1.5 trillion. 
Prediction three is cataclysmic: the end of fullservice brokering as we know it. Many analysts believe that the current 20% of all the retail trade done on the Internet will rise to 50% by 2001. And the Internet, already awash with financial information, is quickly undermining the rationale for paying high prices-$100300 per transaction compared with $15 from a discounter-for informed trades. This means pain for the full-service brokers such as Merrill Lynch over the next five years. Until now they have remained confident that the quality of their research would keep customers loyal. They also feared that by going online they would cannibalise their traditional business. Led by Prudential, many took their first steps online in 1999. Yet 2000 will be the year when they begin successfully to evolve, or have their fates sealed as financial dinosaurs. Watch them travel downstream with Internet operations, lower prices and brand-based advertising campaigns to do battle with the mid-tier firms. 
And now the bad news 
So prediction four appears obvious: cheaper prices, better information and wealthier individual investors. Only that it is not. Share prices go up and down even in cyberspace. The problem is that someone somewhere has to lose money; it does not matter whether the information you have bought is good-it has to be better than your competitors'. That might encourage you to pay a premium for top-notch research. Or, if you know about the efficient-market hypothesis, it might cause you to despair. 
The hypothesis, a basic plank of finance theory, dirties an otherwise rosy picture. It holds that you cannot beat the market since all the information available to you is already reflected in the share price. And with a thousand other online investors better informed and a few seconds quicker than you are, what hope is there of consistently making a buck? 
Research in America shows that three in every four daytraders make a loss. And that is in a bull market. Calls to provide new regulations for a newish industry will only get stronger with any future sustained market fall. Those instant-riches advertisements look naive now-with a big fall they may appear criminally irresponsible. And in America, you know what that means. 
Thus to cater for the more cautious investment generation who prefer mutual funds, the Internet will provide two key services: ease of transaction and price transparency. Internet buying of mutuals will boom. Financial planning sites will proliferate. Fund companies who present their products in the best possible statistical light will have their products compared using common standards. This transparency is a good thing and will lead, the fifth prediction, to better-value funds. A help, no doubt, in paying for educating those e-wise descendants.  1999 Europe's stock exchanges will have to fight three battles in 2000. First, their strategy to consolidate trading across borders to create one pool of liquidity will be countered by the emergence of electronic communications networks (ECNS); these will offer cheaper, and often anonymous, ways of doing business. Second, the new European markets for high-growth companies will each vie to be seen as the NASDAQ of Europe, as will NASDAQ itself. Third, Europe's clearing houses, the Cinderellas of the trading world, will fight it out to see which becomes the leader. All of this will take place against a shift towards equities across Europe as governments make clear that individuals must provide for most of their own retirement costs. 
The failure of the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and the Deutsche Borse to produce the truly unified trading platform that they promised when they unveiled an alliance in July 1998 has left a void in European trading. Paul Roy, head of equities at Merrill Lynch, an American investment bank, says the substitute proposal, to link brokerages to a number of exchanges electronically, is not enough. However, others argue that modern technology makes this the obvious shortterm solution. Bengt Ryden, head of Stockholm's stock exchange, which itself is a listed company, boycotted the eightcountry alliance headed by London and Frankfurt, preferring instead to let foreign brokerages connect electronically to Stockholm. 
Europe's exchanges will realise that their main competition is no longer from each other. New scNS will make an attractive bid for trading volume, promising what London-Frankfurt failed to deliver: a single platform for pan-European stock trading. Tradepoint, which failed to make an impression against London when first launched, looks better positioned following a refinancing which has included most of the big investment banks. True, its owners will continue to gain more from trading through traditional exchanges, but they know that their own clients, the ""buy-side"" asset managers and pension funds, may bypass them altogether if they do not move with the times. E-Crossnet, a mechanism for fund managers to buy and sell shares without having to pay broker commissions, and without a bid-offer spread, will be launched in the second half of 2000. Smaller broker-dealers will find it particularly hard to cope in this new environment. They may have to slim down services, such as research, which is traditionally paid for through trading commission, in order to trim costs. Posit, a similar system, which allows institutional investors to deal with each other blindly-thus lessening the risk that the market will move away from them when they place a large order-will further develop and expand its young business. Other electronic networks, such as Island, one of the best-known American sots, will consider expanding into Europe. 
European exchanges will struggle to establish a viable alternative to America's NASDAQ, where Microsoft is listed, for young European high-tech companies. NASDAQ's listings of European equities have stalled since the launch of Frankfurt's Neuer Markt in March 1997. The Neuer Markt faces new competition from techniK, the London Stock Exchange's new market for technology stocks, and reinvigorated rivalry from its four fellow euro-zone partners in Euro NM, an alliance of markets for young high-tech companies from EASDAQ, which was also set up as a direct copy of NASDAQ. 
Europe's 31 depositories will come under pressure to consolidate from Europe's banks, which are irate at being asked to pay for overlapping and incompatible systems. Smaller depositories will be encouraged to sign up for one of three models of integration on offer. Euroclear, the international bond clearing house, while it has the support of the big international banks for its ""hub and spokes"" model, will struggle to gain the co-operation of other European clearing houses, until its ties with operator J.P. Morgan are finally severed in 2002. That may give its rival, Cedel, time to make progress in its establishment of a ""European Clearing House"". London's Crest will also tie up a few more countries' clearing systems, along with Ireland's and Switzerland's, into its network. By the end of 2000, Europe will not have a single market for European equities, but the shape of the new market will become clearer. 
Margaret Doyle: financial correspondent, The Economist.  1999 Will the dramatic expansion of global stockmarket capitalisation from $9.3 trillion in 1990 to about $25 trillion hold? As a result of the bull market on Wall Street, the United States now accounts for about half the world's stockmarket capitalisation compared with only about 30% in 1990. Japan, by contrast, has shrunk from 40% to only about 11%, its lowest share since the early 1950s. The growth of America's stockmarket capitalisation has played a decisive role in powering the growth of both consumer spending and capital investment. But with stockmarket capitalisation at 150% of cDr compared with an average of 49% over the previous 60 years, there is a risk that a correction will have a more depressing impact on domestic spending than previous bear markets. This inflation of asset values-and the knock-on effect that a correction of, say, 25% would have on the real economy-will be Alan Greenspan's greatest single preoccupation in 2000. 
The driving force in the expansion of the American equity market has been the spectacular performance of the technology sector. It has expanded to a market capitalisation of over $2.7 trillion. It now accounts for about a quarter of America's overall stockmarket capitalisation compared with 10% in 1990. The changing composition of the equity market reflects the fact that information technology now accounts for about 20% of American capital stock compared with 18% in Britain, 14% in Sweden, 11% in Germany and 8% in Japan. The leader in this process has been Microsoft, which enjoys a market capitalisation of some $500 billion. If Microsoft can sustain the growth performance of 1998 and early 1999 for another year, it will soon qualify to join the Group of Seven rich countries by boasting a market capitalisation larger than Canada's GDr. But whereas technology has boomed, the value of traditional sectors such as mining and heavy industry has slumped. In mid1999, the total market capitalisation of the global metals industry, including steel mills, gold mines, copper mines and other mineral companies, was only about $320 billion, or just over 60% of the market capitalisation of Microsoft. Watch for the ability of high-tech stocks to deliver profits in 2000. But note how this huge change will likewise change society in the years ahead. Nowhere will change more in 2000 than Japan. In the modern era, Japan has had a system of stakeholder capitalism in which profits played a less decisive role in corporate decision-making than concerns about sales, asset size and employment. The result is that Japanese firms have a return on equity of only 2%, compared with 20% in the United States and 15% in Western Europe. But the collapse of profitability has triggered a stockmarket decline which is setting the stage for a revolution in the relationship between management and shareholders. As a result of depressed equity-market returns, Japanese firms have an unfunded pension Liability of 80 trillion ($730 billion). They will probably correct it by injecting into the pension pot a large share of the corporate crossshareholdings, which have been the financial counterpart of stakeholder capitalism. When this adjustment occurs, Japan will have a powerful constituency demanding that firms focus more attention on profitability for the first time in its modern history. Ironically, the ageing of Japanese society will compel the private sector to introduce a more dynamic form of capitalism in order to satisfy the income needs of the growing population of retired people. 
Look for dramatic change in Europe. Take Germany's rapidly growing marketplace, called the Neuer Markt, with over 125 small technology companies and an aggregate market capitalisation of about $40 billion. Software companies account for 22% of the market while Internet service providers and other Internet companies make up another 20%. The rise of the new market represents the most dramatic breakthrough in the development of a popular equity culture in Germany since the second world war. This is not just a new market, it is a new mind-set. It bodes well for Frankfurt and ill for the City of London. Indeed, whereas the German stockmarket once experienced trading pauses on Jewish holidays, volume now slumps when student holidays occur. 
2000 will see large chunks of the world with new-and much improvedbanking systems. Latin America has opened up its financial system to foreign investment so much that over half of all bank assets now belong to foreigncontrolled institutions. Argentina has gone the furthest because its use of a currency board means that its central bank can no longer be the lender of last resort. And as a result of the ownership changes since 1995, Argentina's banks now depend upon lenders of last resort in London, Madrid, Hong Kong and Washington, not just Buenos Aires. Due to the recent financial crisis, Asia is also opening up to foreign investment in the financial system. In another 12 months, foreign institutions will probably control at least 40% of the banking systems of Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia compared with nothing five years ago. In Eastern Europe the story is the same. German, Dutch, Irish and Austrian banks now control over half of all bank assets in Poland, and in Hungary foreigners have almost a 90% market share. Estonia, another currency-board country, has sold about 80% of its banking system to the Swedes. Future banking crises will be lesser, more controllable, phenomena as a result. 
Will emerging markets upset the apple cart? Their stockmarket capitalisation declined by several hundred million dollars during 1998 after expanding from $488 billion to $2.2 trillion between 1988 and 1996. The developing countries' share of global stockmarket capitalisation is now only 8% compared with 14% in 1996. But the contraction has created the potential for a tremendous catch-up. After all, these same countries will account for 45% of world output, 70% of the world's land area, 85% of the world's population and 99% of the projected growth in the global labour force during the early decades of the 21st century. 
Popular share ownership has grown dramatically in many countries as a result of the 1990s stockmarket boom. The United States mutual-funds industry now has assets larger than the banking system. It is estimated that 45% of Americans are in the market either directly or through mutual funds, compared with 5% in the 1950s. Australia now has more shareholders than trade-union members. The collapse of interest rates which resulted from monetary union in Europe has also encouraged a dramatic growth of the mutual-fund sector in countries such as Italy and Spain. During 1998 Italian mutual funds attracted over 35 billion ($37 billion) of retail-savings flows while Spain's mutual funds received nearly 10 billion. Many developing countries are introducing pension funds in order to promote wider share ownership and help finance privatisation of state enterprises. Singapore began the process during the 1960s. Chile went further during the 1980s. Today, there are several Latin American countries with pension funds which have an aggregate market value of over $150 billion. When the cold war ended, there were probably only 100m people on the planet who owned a share or had a pension plan. By 2000 there will be over one billion shareholders in both the industrial and developing countries. The resultant change in world politics is palpable-and wholly for the good. 
China is now so anxious to stimulate consumer spending that its government has begun to talk up the stockmarket. There were editorials in the People's Daily during the summer of 1999 calling upon investors to buy equities. The government is liberalising its rules for bank lending to brokerage firms. Officials also say that private firms, not just former state enterprises, will be able to list on the market. But policy will have to remain supportive of the market for some time if rising equity prices are to buoy the economy. China's market capitalisation is only about 25% of GDP there are only 35m shareholders. 
The growth of retail-share ownership has not reduced the role of institutional investors in the market. In the case of the United States, the expansion of mutual funds to $6 billion of assets has increased the power of large institutions. Firms with more than $100m under management now control equities worth about 51% of America's market capitalisation, compared with 27.6% in 1980. The result of this increasing concentration in market share has been to produce an institutional bias in favour of large companies, which has caused them significantly to outperform smaller companies during the 1990s. This is an unhealthy development. Watch for the start of a correction in 2000. 
The new role of stockmarkets as storehouses of personal wealth and engines of capital formation suggests that they will play a far more important role in the formulation of public policy than ever before. Governments everywhere are being compelled to give their citizens more options for their retirement savings than just government debt. Central banks are increasingly being forced to make judgments about equity markets when determining whether monetary policy should be adjusted. 
There is little doubt, for example, that the Federal Reserve would welcome a modest stockmarket correction in the United States in order to slow the growth rate of domestic consumption. Every January, the Wall Street Journal conducts a survey of United States forecasters to find out their predictions for the year ahead. Since 1994, the consensus has been a projection of only 2.3% output growth compared with an actual outcome of 3.5% a year. 
The task confronting the Federal Reserve in 2000 is to engineer a soft landing in which equity prices do not fall too far. The challenge is unique because the United States has a huge currentaccount deficit. America's households have been on a buying spree that has kept the rest of the world from recession. But this deficit has been financed only by foreigners buying American equity. If the stockmarket were to fall sharply, there is a risk that the dollar could also collapse, with destabilising consequences for bond prices and all financial assets. As a result, both the United States economy and the global economy are now more dependent upon the performance of the New York equity market than at any other time in history. 
David Hale: chief investment analyst, Zurich Financial Services, Chicago.  1999 After a run of several thousand years, it is entirely fitting that 2000 will be marked as the year the tide turned against taxation. Clay tablets recall the taxes of Hammurabi in the Babylon of 2000BC, but the practice is certainly older. People in power have always tried to divert some of the proceeds of economic activity in their own direction. Lords took feudal dues from their vassals; landowners took tolls from merchants; gangsters took protection money from small businesses; governments took taxes from their citizens. Despite the different names, the principle has remained constant: those who do not produce take resources from those who do, and spend it on altogether different things. 
The tide is turning because of the convergence of several factors. In the first place, taxes are becoming harder to collect. Capital is more mobile than ever, and inclined to fly from places that tax to places that do not. Governments do not move their boundaries and jurisdictions as rapidly as companies can change locations. Attempts to establish trans-national tax powers are almost certainly doomed by international competition to attract economic activity. Many businesses will choose to stay out of reach. 
The global economy and the Internet mean that purchases can now cross frontiers. People buy books, clothes and cars from abroad, and any finance minister who likes to tax these items finds his tax base diminishing. It is not only capital and goods which are harder to pin down. Even wages are crossing frontiers. The rise of the service sector means that many income-generating activities can take place across frontiers, causing yet more headaches for overstretched public treasuries. Furthermore, the pace of electronic, hard-to-trace activity is accelerating. 
No less important has been the rise of political resistance. The past quarter century has been marked by a movement led in Britain and America towards tax limitation. It announced itself in California's famous tax-cutting referendum Proposition 13, but saw its fullest expression in the Thatcher and Reagan tax cuts of the 1980s. Britain's Tories entered office in 1979 with the top rate of income tax at 98%, and left office 18 years later with a top rate of 40%. Indeed, their Labour opponents became electable only after a firm promise not to raise it again. In the United States, George W Bush would not make his father's mistake of increasing taxes despite a ""read my lips"" pledge. The plain fact is that electorates these days will not stand for it. They recognise, correctly, that governments spend their money less carefully and less efficiently than they can spend it themselves. 
One of the greatest uses of tax money is to provide pensions. And here a revolution-as important and pervasive as privatisation-is sweeping the world. Fully funded personal pension plans, based on an individual's savings, are sweeping away the poorly funded public pensions promised by governments. The latter take taxes from the young to support the old. The former invest savings from the young to support themselves when old. 
A lead all will follow 
Singapore blazed the trail in the 1950s with individual provident accounts, but it was when Chile pioneered the replacement of state pensions with private funds in 1981 that the world took notice. Their lead set a pattern which has increasingly been followed in South America and, more recently, Poland. Britain itself has largely converted to private 
personal funds, whose total value, well in excess of $1 trillion, exceeds that of all of its EU partners combined. Britain's vestigial state pensions are of ever-diminishing significance. 
Tax-transfer schemes are vulnerable to demographic changes. If the numbers of old people increase, if they require support for more years, or if the numbers in work decrease, the adverse balance can impose unacceptable tax burdens on the young. Belgium, France, Italy and Germany most of all, have yet to face the tax consequences of their profligate promissory notes. Their expensive attempts to do so will provide one of the main economic dramas of the next decade. It is also the case that funded pensions give better value. The fund grows with the economy, aiding it in turn with investment, and achieving better returns than can be relied on from governments. 
Taxes are thus being squeezed from three directions: the increased mobility brought by globalisation, electoral resistance to taxation, and a movement away from tax-funded schemes. All of this will make life difficult for finance ministers. The solution in Britain has been to opt for ""stealth"" taxes which do not show, but few suppose this will be more than a temporary expedient. A more permanent solution will be for finance ministers to recognise their limitations and for governments to live within their means. Money-laundering becomes easy in Brazil with the arrival of 250m plastic banknotes in April.  1999 Uncle Sam's commercial domination is only in its infant stage, asserts Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP, an advertising giant. 
Theodore Levitt may have got it wrong. In 1983 he wrote an article in the Harvard Business Review saying that we were all going to market global products and services in the same way everywhere. Twenty years on, the thesis seems wrong in one particular respect: there is not a global way of marketing, rather there is an American way. America's business methods have become the world's. 
If you are going to run or develop a business of global significance, domination of the American market is critical. In almost every category of industry or services, the real winners will be those companies that have strong franchises rooted in the United States. In advertising and marketing services, for example, approximately 45% of the expenditure in this $1 trillion industry originates in the United States. About two-- thirds of this expenditure is controlled or, to be more politically correct, is ""influenced"" from there. 
The same is true of many other industries, particularly for those companies that seek to share information efficiently around the world. Chief executives may devolve power to regional or brand-based business units, but they also want to ensure that wheels are not being needlessly reinvented in international organisations. The controls they put in place are usually rooted in America. 
This economic power and the relative homogeneity of the American market are being exploited ruthlessly as American corporations push their products and services around the world. Thus there is not a global standard, in the Levitt sense, but an American one. It is a standard driven by the need to hit financial targets demanded by shareholders. 
If you tell the Street or the City that you intend to increase your profits or earnings per share or return on capital, by 5% to 15% a year, you can do it only by taking share from a competitor or expanding globally. Expansion is probably easier and more profitable. 
But a decision to expand internationally faces every chief executive with three problems. And the answer to each of these reinforces the conclusion that to be global it is necessary to be American. 
The first is brand. To gain marketshare companies need to brand products ever more strongly; and many of the most powerful brands, of course, are American. 
The second is the web, which threatens to shake up every product and service without exception. The web may be global but its culture and driving force is American. 
The third is the need that every business has to communicate its strategic changes internally as well as externally; if the people within the organisation don't understand policy, then external communication will obviously suffer. This internal communication often follows, or reinforces, an American mind-set. 
If you thought this trend was welldeveloped, just reflect on the fact that the average American-based multinational still derives only 20% of its sales or profits from outside the United States. The average corporation is more like Pepsi-Cola, which still has 80% of its business inside the United States, rather than Coca-Cola, which has 80% outside. So there is still a long way to go. 
If all this were not enough, the dominant position of a strong American market is being reinforced by a strong capital market. Despite a narrowing recently, stockmarket valuations on the American side of the Atlantic are still generally higher. In almost every category this gives American-quoted companies a lower cost of equity capital and hence a lower average cost of capital. As a result, stronger organic growth is being reinforced by stronger growth through acquisitions. Again, this trend will have a long way to go in 2000 and beyond. European-only mergers do not solve the problem. They are purely defensive. If Deutsche Telekom and Telecom Italia had been brought together, what would this have done in the United States, the largest telecoms market in the world? Nothing. 
Similarly, what does the marriage of Carrefour and Promodes do offensively? Defensively, it may be a way of dealing with the arrival in Europe of America's Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, but for it to succeed it must exploit the advantages afforded it in Latin America and China. 
Europe isn't global 
A more cohesive European market will risk encouraging European-based multinationals to focus too much on Europe and too little on the United States and beyond. Despite a market of 350m people, 100m greater than the United States, Europe's union lacks the homogeneity of the American market. 
What is the answer? The development of global businesses which are rooted in the strongest and most vibrant market in the world-the United States. You only have to review the car industry, any packaged-goods sector, the computer industry, the new technologies and web companies, high-tech and telecommunications, entertainment, media, and health care. Nor is this confined to making things. It also applies to services. Look at the consultancy industry, investment or commercial banking. 
There are companies that understand. sr Amoco and Vodafone lead the way in the United Kingdom. Vivendi leads the French invasion of the United States as does DaimlerChrysler from Germany. Telefonica looks like it will do the same from Spain although it is focusing on Latin America initially. 
The only reason for caution is that we were talking about Japan in the same terms only a decade ago, and look where Japan is now. Trends such as these can go the other way. Historically, they usually do so. Economic and political domination by one state does not usually last long. 
Reading on paper is so much a part of our lives that it is hard to imagine anything could ever replace inky marks on shredded trees. Since Johannes Gutenberg invented an economical way to make movable metal type in the 15th century, making it possible to produce reading matter quickly, comparatively cheaply and in large quantities, the printed word has proved amazingly resilient. So how could anyone believe that sales of electronic books will equal those of paper books within a decade or so? 
First, it is worth remembering that paper is only the latest in a long line 
of reading ""technologies"" that were made obsolete each time an improved solution emerged. Pictures drawn on rock gave way to clay tablets with cuneiform characters pressed into the clay before it dried. Clay gave way to animal skin scrolls marked with text, and then to papyrus scrolls. By 100An the codex had arrived, but it was not until the ninth century that the first real paper book was produced. In Europe, paper was rare until after Gutenberg's breakthrough. 
It took a few more centuries for ebooks to emerge. They were first envisioned in 1945 by Vannevar Bush, director of the United States Office of Scientific Research and Development. In his classic essay, ""As We May Think"", Bush described a gadget he called a ""memex""=`a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications... Most of the memex contents are purchased on microfilm ready for insertion. Books of all sorts, pictures, current periodicals, newspapers, are thus obtained and dropped into place... Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready-made with a mesh of associative trails running through them..."" 
Although science-fiction writers eagerly adopted Bush's ideas-notably on the television show ""Star Trek"", where portable electronic books featured regularly-the real world has remained loyal to paper. Only in the encyclopedia market, which was transformed by CD-ROMS in the mid-1980s, has the e-book made real progress. Far more encyclopedias, from Microsoft's Encarta to Encyclopedia Britannica, are sold on cn-ROM than were ever sold on paper, because they cost a fraction of the price and are easier to search. But attempts to broaden the appeal of e-book technology to ""ludic"" (or pleasure) readers have been unsuccessful. Since the late 1980s the electronic publishing world has seen several failed e-book ventures. 
Why? Most of them used devices that were either too bulky to carry around, or forced users to ""stock up"" their electronic library in inconvenient ways. (One required visits to a ""book bank"", an ATM-- like machine that was to be located in bookstores.) Before widespread adoption of the Internet, there was no universal way to download new reading material. But the most fundamental problem was the lack of a display technology that could compete with paper when it came to ludic reading. 
For paper books, readability depends on many factors: typeface and size, line length and spacing, page and margin size, and the colour of print and paper. But for e-books there are even more factors, including resolution, flicker, luminance, contrast and glare. Most typefaces were not designed for screens and, thanks to a limited number of pixels, are just fuzzy reproductions of the originals. The result is that reading onscreen is hard on the eyes and takes a lot more effort. People do it only for short documents. The longer the read, the more irritating and distracting are all the faults in display, layout and rendering. 
Most of these problems are now being solved. The World Wide Web offers an amazingly flexible way to deliver books in bits-and as investments in broadband infrastructure increase, it will get even easier to stock an e-library. And dozens of companies-including e-book pioneers and established publishing firms such as R.R. Donnelly, Penguin Putnam, Nokia, Barnes & Noble and Microsoft-have joined to create an open e-book standard, so that book-lovers will be able to read any title on any e-book. 
There have also been some incredible technological breakthroughs that will make it much easier to read long texts on a screen. Microsoft has developed a font display technology called ClearType that, by manipulating the red, green and blue sub-pixels that make up the pixels on an Lcn screen, improves resolution by up to a factor of three. Coupled with the latest e-book reading software and hardware, this provides an on-screen reading experience that begins to rival paper. 
But why would anyone prefer an e-- book to a p-book, regardless of improved readability? Because e-books have many other advantages. You will get instant delivery from your web bookshop to your e-book, and be able to store hundreds of novels on a device the size of a paperback. E-book technology enables you to have an entire library in your pocket. Or you can keep it on your PC-a modern laptop can hold more than 30,000 books. You won't have to wait for out-of-stock books to be ordered, and books will never go out of ""print"". Your children will be able to listen to unfamiliar words pronounced for them as they read. You will have unabridged audio synchronised to the text, so you can continue the story in situations where you are unable to read-for example, while driving. 
In addition, e-books promise to revolutionise the way the world reads. Whereas paper books are stand-alone entities, e-books can include hypertext links to additional content, whether it is in other books, databases or web sites. So e-books will not be restricted to a linear structure that is the same for everyone-every reader will be free to make use of the links, images and sounds dif ferently. You will also be able to customise e-books by adding your own notes, links and images. In a paper book, content is fixed; with e-book technology it is flexible. Finally, you will be able to get sound and moving images to support the text, creating an entirely new multimedium. 
The e-book will also revolutionise the economics of the industry. The cost of publishing books will fall dramatically, the result of savings on materials, labour, manufacturing and distribution. In the process, a lot of trees will also be saved and even the most obscure author will be able to self-publish, which means more choice for readers. The retail price of books will fall; sales will explode. 
It is hard to imagine today, but one of the greatest contributions of e-books may eventually be in improving literacy and education in less-developed countries. Today people in poor countries cannot afford to buy books and rarely have access to a library. But in a few years, as the cost of hardware continues to decline, it will be possible to set up ""virtual"" public libraries which will have access to the same content as the Library of Congress. 
An asteroid probably wiped out 
the dinosaurs. Do humans have a 
similar fate? NASA's Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous spacecraft will start orbiting Asteroid ""433 Eros"", the first of our efforts to know the enemy.  1999 European corporate finance is mid-way through a vast change. The past few years have brought what seemed like a wave of Americanisation. In fact, it was a trickle. The tidal wave arrives in 2000. In the coming years, Europe's biggest companies will swap their equity for debt, changing the whole profile of European finance. 
As with much else in modern economics, the root cause is disinflation. Over the past 30 inflationary years, investors have been interested in little besides equity, because dividends, being variable, can be adapted to rising prices. But equity is risky. Holders are the last to benefit in the event of a liquidation. It is a post-tax cost. It is therefore an expensive form of finance. Debt, by contrast, is less risky and a fixed, pre-tax cost. So the supply of equity is drying up. Companies are either taking themselves off the stockmarket or buying in their equity. 
What about demand? The demographic bulge created by the baby boom after the second world war has generally had a prosperous and satisfying life. It is now approaching the age of retirement. If you wanted to swap a lump sum in savings for a regular cash income, how would you do it? 
The stockmarket? Lucent Technologies, a key supplier of hardware to the Internet and a darling of the stockmarket, produced a capital return of nearly 80% in the 12 months to September 1999. That's a sweet profit. But Lucent's yield-the amount it returns in dividend income per dollar investedis currently a tenth of a cent in the dollar, 0.1%. Microsoft, an even better known success story, yields nothing. 
These cases are exceptional, of course. But they illustrate the lie of markets as a whole. The average British equity yields 2.5%. In the United States it is 1.3% and in Japan 0.7%. Moreover, average equity yields are falling. High-yield stocks are the ones switching to debt. In the United Kingdom in 1999, with few exceptions, new equity was issued exclusively by low-yield, highly valued, new technology companies, the Lucents and Microsofts of the future. 
What about government bonds? They still carry a yield and in many leading markets they are near enough to riskfree. True, but with the end of inflation government yields are increasingly reflecting that lack of risk. The difference in yield between a three-month American dollar deposit and a 30-year Treasury bond is scarcely more than one percentage point. In the United Kingdom, the yield on a 30-year government bond is, crazily, 0.5% lower than the interest rate on a three-month deposit. Meanwhile, a 30-year Japanese government bond currently yields 2.7% in total. 
Over the medium to longer term the yield on government stock is likely to continue to decline. This is because the supply is drying up. With the Republican bill to cut taxes having run into the presidential veto, it seems all but certain that the federal surplus that is currently accumulating in the United States will be used to pay down public debt. More important, the word on the campaign trail is that this is what voters want. The resuit will be a reduction in the Treasury market of nearly a third over the next ten years. Excepting Japan, a similar story can be told of most other rich countries, even including Italy. 
Compare the following. A bond issued by the Halifax, a British mortgage lender, paying interest at 9.4% and with 21 years to run, now yields 6.3%. This is 1.3 percentage points higher than the equivalent government bond and three percentage points above the Halifax's own dividend yield. The Halifax has a double-A credit rating, not much below that of a government. Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB, with a triple-B rating, yields 8.1% on its ten-year bondnearly three percentage points more than the equivalent government bond and 7.6 points above BSkyB's dividend yield. 
The spreads in the United States are equally attractive. A ten-year bond issued by Ford yields 7.3%, compared with less than 6% for the comparable Treasury. A 20-year bond issued by Sprint, a successful telephone company with a credit rating equivalent to BSkyB, yields 9.3%, against the 6% current yield on the 30-year Treasury. But buy Sprint's equity on the stockmarket and you will only get a dividend of about 1%. 
In the first nine months of 1999 some $30 billion went out of the British equity market by way of share buybacks, while about $45 billion was raised in new capital through issues of sterling corporate bonds. This is but a pointer for 2000. The figures for the United States are in similar proportion, but it is in Europe as a whole that there is the potential for enormous growth. Corporate gearing in the United States is above 60%, three-quarters of which is obtained through the bond markets. In Europe, gearing is below 30%, with less than a third of debt sourced through the bond markets. So expect changes in 2000. Less equity. More debt.  1999 Reading on paper is so much a part of our lives that it is hard to imagine anything could ever replace inky marks on shredded trees.

Bill Gates: chairman of Microsoft.  1999 If you take the game of life seriously, if you take your nervous system seriously, if you take your sense organs seriously, then, over the course of this coming year, you must turn on, tune in and drop out. And buy up too, if you are one of millions of patients now heeding Timothy Leary's advice and turning to complementary medicine. Over two-fifths of Americans will use some sort of unconventional therapy, according to David Eisenberg, at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre. Almost half of all Germans and perhaps a third of Britons will also try acupuncture, chiropracty, herbal remedies or some other complementary treatment for relief. 
Leary, who knew a thing or two about drugs, would have been pleased. So too are the growing ranks of complementary practitioners and firms producing dietary supplements and herbal compounds. Dr Eisenberg's surveys estimate that Americans paid 629m visits to complementary therapists in 1997, a 46% increase since 1990 and almost two-thirds more consultations than mainstream primary care doctors performed. Americans will spend some $30 billion on complementary treatments, much of it out of their own pockets. In Britain, France and Germany, there will be a similar boom. 
This hardly surprises William Haskell of Stanford University's Complementary and Alternative Medicine Research Programme. Although the popularity of complementary treatments differs from country to country (the French, for example, are keener on homeopathy than Americans, who favour chiropracty), their general success is driven by much the same forces. Patients are increasingly frustrated with the limitations of mainstream, western medicine to deal with their complaints. Conventional medicine is only starting to come to grips with ill-defined chronic ailments, such as memory loss, and lifestyle complaints, among them impotence, which will increasingly plague the world's ageing population. 
Much of complementary medicine, however, from spinal alignment to traditional Chinese herbs, is pitched at just these long-term imbalances; users see them not only as a means of relieving disease in the sick, but of promoting health in the worried well. As America's private medical providers, the health maintenance organisations, try to live up to their name and reduce their costs, Dr Haskell believes they will start to include complementary medicine in their basic coverage, further enhancing its popularity. Although fiscal pressures are forcing some countries, such as France, to question the state's subsidy of complementary therapies, consumer demand is likely to increase government reimbursement in the coming years. 
Of course, the appeal of complementary medicine lies not only in the counter-culture, but in the over-thecounter-culture as well. Many patients, better informed about health and keen for a greater say in their medical treatment, choose complementary therapies precisely because they have the freedom to do so without prescription. In America, almost half of all complementary medicine is do-it-yourself care. When patients do visit a complementary practitioner, many find the interaction far more rewarding than a trip to the general practitioner. Since much of complementary medicine focuses on broad holistic factors, such as diet or emotional state, consultations are usually longer and wider-ranging than a busy primary care physician can afford. 
Western medicine, however, is very nimble in adopting tricks from other disciplines and from different cultures. In America, mainstream multinational prescription-drug companies, such as American Home Products and Bayer, have launched brands of herbal supplements to take advantage of the $2.6 billion market, which is expected to more than double by 2003. Almost two-thirds of American medical schools now teach courses in complementary medicine and older practising physicians, while perhaps not embracing complementary medicine, at least no longer dismiss it. Even in China where traditional and western medical practice have existed side-by-side for years, Dr Eisenberg notes growing moves among practitioners to combine the best elements of both. Indeed, where once complementary medicine was known as ""alternative"" (or worse), watch for the spread of ""integrative"" medical clinics in the coming year. 
Science will drive many complementary therapies into mainstream clinical practice, and others into the bin. At the moment, there are few authoritative clinical trials or laboratory tests to assess the claims of such treatments. That is set to change as a number of large clinical trials, co-ordinated by America's National Centre for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, take place in 2000. They will establish whether, say, St John's Wort is better at relieving mild depression than Prozac or if shark's cartilage is any good for lung cancer. 
Such proof will come in handy as complementary remedies confront the regulators. Unlike conventional drugs, dietary supplements can be sold in America without prior approval from the federal Food and Drug Administration, which strikes many critics as an unsound, unsafe arrangement. 
Some firms, among them Britain's Phytopharm, are trying to rescue herbal mixtures from the hinterland of dietary supplements and establish them as a new class of drug with full regulatory approval. As the ancient Chinese proverb says, ""Real gold is not afraid of the hottest fire."" In 2000, complementary medicine will have to prove its mettle. 
Britain's University for Industry begins full operations. It will run a nationwide network of 1,000 learning centres. 
Shereen El Feki: health care correspondent, The Economist.  1999 And you thought there was only one Internet? Internet2 (I2) is an American university-led venture, which is being used to create the Internet infrastructure of the future. In 2000, campus networks will gain access to a vastly improved form of multicasting and the revolutionary Quality of Service (Qos). What is more, companies will soon begin to enjoy the fruits of these high-tech endeavours. 
The 12 network is named ""Abilene"", after the railhead that opened America's west. It is based on a new protocol, IPv6-you currently use IPv4-and currently wires up 150 universities. This protocol has massive capacity, is super-reliable and is much, much faster than today's congested info-highway. Abilene can transfer data at 2.4 gigabits a second, 45,000 times faster than a typical modem; imagine ten encyclopedias sent around the world in less than a second. 
Multicast technology allows the same packet of information to be sent to multiple locations. It is already used by 3,000 radio stations, which multicast their audio over the Internet. The magic of IPv6 is that it guarantees image and audio transmission without delay, jerkiness or the odd frame getting lost. It opens the way for web-based television. 
IPv6 also lifts the curtain on Qos. This solves an important part of the net congestion problem by guaranteeing reliable broadband width. Crucially, traffic can be prioritised and delivered almost instantly. Abilene may also soon be transmitting holographic images and its creators are working on a sense of touch. 
In 2000, multicasting will be rolled out on to the campus for further testing. Of course, keeping America's big corporations off the systeman Internet purist's dream-is impossible, not least because they are partially funding the experiment. AT&T, Microsoft, isM, Cisco, MCI WorldCom/Sprint and others are contributing around $50m to the project in the hope that they can use the technology in building company intranets. This will ensure America's decisive lead in Internet technology for another decade.  1999 The first ""working draft"" of the human genome-the digital recipe of our genes -is scheduled to be published early in 2000. It represents a critical milestone in the mammoth international project to decode the entire genetic sequence of man. It will also mark the beginning of a new era in personalised medicine in which a patient's genetic make-up is used to predict and treat illnesses with drugs tailor-made for an individual's inherited predispositions. 
Competing organisations are racing to be the first to sequence and decipher the three billion letters that make up the complete genetic code of human DNA. On one side is the combined might of the American government and the Wellcome Trust, the world's largest medical research charity, which are stumping up most of the $3 billion being spent on the Human Genome Project. On the other is a small, select band of privateers who, with highly specialised equipment and computers, are able to carry out ""fast and dirty"" decoding, which they hope to protect with patents and so reap vast sums from pharmaceutical companies that will need the data for the development of new drugs and medicines. 
One such private operation is run by Craig Venter, a maverick scientist who became disillusioned with the official genome project and so established his own operation with the help of venture capital. His company, Celera Genomics, and its sister operation, the Institute of Genomic Research, in Rockville, Maryland, are the most serious competitors to the publicly funded sequencing project. 
Dr Venter has pioneered a quick method of decoding the genome that was famously derided by James Watson-the co-discoverer of the nrra helix and founding father of the Human Genome Project-as work that ""any monkey"" could do. Celera, however, has already sequenced the entire genetic code of several micro-organisms and has promised a full sequence of the human genome by 2001, two years ahead of the final completion date fixed by the Human Genome Project. In order to recoup the investment in the vast number-crunching operation, Dr Venter intends to charge a fee for organisations to access his genetic database of DNA sequences. 
However, in a deft move aimed at undermining the threat posed by Dr Venter and others, the Human Genome Project has established a consortium which over the next couple of years will throw enormous effort into finding the crucial bits of the human genome that are set to become vital elements of the medicine of the 21st century. The Wellcome Trust is spearheading the consortium along with four of America's most prestigious genetics centres- the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Washington University School of Medicine, Stanford Human Genome Center and the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. The backers that will finance the project's initial $45m include the leading pharmaceutical businesses. 
The main goal of the consortium is to find the genetic signposts of disease and to publish them on the Internet as soon as they are decoded, thereby preventing others like Dr Venter from patenting the same information. These particular signposts are known as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPS, pronounced ""snips""). They represent the smallest change possible in a gene and as such the genetic difference between one person and another is in effect the result of the differences in their stirs. For every 1,000 ""letters"" in the code of a human gene, there is typically one stir. This means that two unrelated people have, very roughly, a million stirs to distinguish between them. 
SNPS are the ultimate genetic landmarks and will enable scientists to navigate the vast open spaces of the human genome. They are the fine-grained physical features that enable the genetic mapmakers to locate their precise position and, in doing so, to decide whether that particular region of human DNa is medically useful or important. 
SNPS have the advantage of being highly stable. They don't change from one generation to another like some other genetic markers. They are evenly and frequently spaced through the genome (a prerequisite of any good signpost), and they are simple (representing the smallest form of genetic change possible). The consortium believes that building up a map of sNPs will be at the heart of personalised medicine, shifting the focus of treatment from what works best for the majority to what works best for each individual, based on their unique genetic inheritance. 
Conventional genetic tests are used on disorders caused by defects in single genes-such as cystic fibrosis or Huntington's disease. New tests based on patterns of stirs will enable doctors to estimate a person's predispositions to a range of other disorders, from asthma and cancer to diabetes and senile dementia, where a number of predisposition genes are thought to be influential. If heart disease tends to run in your family, there should be a set of SNPS that could be used to estimate your risk of heart attack. 
Another, more intriguing, function of an SNP map is in the design, development and use of new drugs. It is well established that some people, for no apparent reason but probably related to their genes, suffer serious side-effects to drugs. sNPS might prove useful in helping to identify those people who will respond best to a certain drug. The new science of pharmacogenomics should make drug prescription less of a hit-or-miss affair. It opens the way for doctors to prescribe more tailor-made medicines that recognise our unique genetic individuality. 
Research under way promises a revolution in medicine. The race between the competitors should, by the end of 2000, decide who picks up the glittering prizes. 
Steve Connor: science editor of The Independent.  1999 Astronomers are currently enjoying a construction boom. The white and silver domes of new telescopes have been popping up like giant mushrooms on otherwise barren mountain-tops in Hawaii and Chile. Many of these will open for business in 2000, causing astronomers' productivity to rise sharply. In the southern hemisphere, in particular, the new observatories will increase the amount of light that astronomers can study by a factor of five. 
It might seem ill-advised, then, to predict that the most surprising (and therefore important) advances in astronomy in 2000 will not be made by studying light. Nevertheless, it is a safe bet. The headline discoveries will belong to those astronomers who study light's shorter-wavelength cousins: x-rays. 
This is not to belittle the new Hawaiian and Chilean telescopes-they are huge. The bigger a telescope's mirror, the dimmer the objects it can see. Each of the new observatories has a primary mirror eight metres in diameter. This makes the previous generation of four-- metre telescopes look puny. 
They are also equipped with the very latest stargazing gadgetry, including the ability to deform their mirrors under computer control, to cancel the blurring and twinkling effects of the atmosphere. This combination of bigness and sharpness makes the new 8-metre class wellsuited to study the remotest objects visible from Earth-the universe's oldest galaxies. By revealing the differences between these ancient galaxies and present-day ones, the new telescopes will help astronomers learn how galaxies change over billions of years, and how galaxies were formed in the first place. 
Impressive as that may be, the new machines are simply bigger and more numerous versions of instruments that already exist. They do not even break any size records-the twin Keck telescopes already sitting on Mauna Kea in Hawaii each measure 10 metres across. 
The real surprises in 2000 will come from celestial x-rays, since two new xray telescopes are about to enter terrain that is almost completely unexplored. An x-ray telescope must be perched in space, rather than on an arid mountaintop, because the atmosphere does not merely blur x-rays; it devours them. This is lucky for humans, who would otherwise be zapped by the sun's x-rays, but it means that x-ray astronomy lags behind that of ordinary light. Each x-ray mission is risky and expensive, but potentially very significant. 
The Chandra X-ray Observatory was launched in July 1999 into a high, lazy orbit taking it one-third of the way to the Moon and back. Throughout 2000 (and for five or ten years more) it will be taking x-ray pictures of the universe with unprecedented clarity. In that sense, Chandra is the x-ray equivalent of the Hubble Space Telescope (and also in the sense that it was paid for by NASA, America's space agency, to the tune of $1.4 billion). Not to be outdone, in early 2000 the European Space Agency will launch the X-ray Multi-Mirror (xMM) telescope, which will have even bigger mirrors than Chandra. 
Many different things in the universe emit x-rays, but they all share one common attribute: they are outrageously hot. Well past red-hot and blue-hot, to be x-- hot requires a temperature of tens or hundreds of millions of degrees. X-rays are produced, for example, when a particularly large star runs out of fuel and explodes. Or, if a black hole is close enough to a star to suck away the star's outer layers, the ripped material gets hot enough to emit x-rays. In short, x-rays mark the spots of celestial violence. 
Chandra and XMM will provide much sharper images of all these phenomena. What appear presently to be nebulous blobs of emission might turn out to contain filaments or spots that will reveal what is really going on. 
Joshua Winn: doctoral student in astronomy at hnr.  1999 Global warming will preoccupy the next generation, predicts Sir John Houghton, of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. 
One hundred years ago Claude Monet painted scenes of London through its smoggy atmosphere. That was local pollution. What is relatively new and more worrying is global pollution-that is pollution emitted by people locally that has global effects. The first example to emerge was damage to the earth's ozone layer. International action was promptly taken through the Montreal Protocol to phase out the use of the chemicals responsible. Although full recovery of the ozone layer will now happen, it will take at least a century. 
Another example is pollution that leads to global warming and climate change. Carbon dioxide and other ""greenhouse"" gases such as methane are released into the atmosphere through the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) and also through deforestation. These gases absorb ""heat"" radiation emitted by the earth's surface that would otherwise be lost to space, so maintaining the surface and the lower atmosphere at a warmer level than normal. 
The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has already increased by over 30% since 1750 and, if no action is taken to stem the increase, it will reach double its preindustrial value during the second half of the 21st century. As a result, the average rate of warming of the climate is expected to be greater than at any time during the past 10,000 years. This is not of itself necessarily bad; some communities will experience a net benefit. But many ecosystems as well as humans will find it difficult, if not impossible, to adapt. 
Although there is a lot of uncertainty concerning the detail, the basic science underlying global warming and climate change is well understood. It is not in question. Hundreds of scientists from over 50 countries have contributed as authors or reviewers to the assessments of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (trcc). Because of the uncertainties it is easy either to exaggerate the possible impacts to calamitous proportions or to suggest that too little is known to justify any action. What the iPCC has done is explain clearly what is known together with the major uncertainties. Then, taking account of all relevant scientific data, best estimates have been provided of climate change and its impact over the next century. Here are a few of the ipcc's main findings and an outline of the agenda for the years ahead. 
First, largely because of the thermal expansion of ocean water and the accelerated melting of glaciers, sea levels are likely to rise by approximately half a metre by 2100. Therefore, sea defences in many coastal regions will need to be improved, albeit at considerable cost. However, adaptation is just not possible for countries with large river deltas such as Bangladesh, Southern China and Egypt, and for many island states in the Pacific. 
A second major result of global warming will be, on average, a more intense hydrological cycle leading to impacts on water distribution and availability. In many areas heavy rainfall will tend to become heavier while some semi-arid areas will receive less rainfall. There will be more frequent and more intense floods or droughts, especially in sub-tropical areas. Since, in many places, water is rapidly becoming a critical resource and since floods and droughts are the natural disasters that already cause most deaths, misery and economic damage, these could represent the most damaging impacts of global warming. When combined with the rise in sea levels, a recent study has estimated that this could lead to 150m environmental refugees by 2050. 
Three widely accepted principles will govern the international agreements needed to meet this threat. The first is the ""Precautionary Principle"", already clearly imbedded in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change agreed at the Earth Summit in Rio in 1992. This states that the existence of uncertainty should not preclude the taking of appropriate action. The reason for such action is simply stated as the stabilisation of the concentrations of greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide) in the atmosphere in ways that allow also for necessary economic development. The second principle is the ""Polluter Pays Principle"", which implies the imposition of measures such as carbon taxes or carbon trading arrangements. The third is the ""Principle of Equity (both Intergenerational and International)"" which is the most difficult to apply. However, a proposal of the Global Commons Institute that is being widely discussed applies the second and third principles by allowing eventually for the allocation of carbon emissions to nations on an equal per capita basis while also allowing for emissions trading. 
The action agreed at Kyoto in 1997 is a first step. Necessary post-Kyoto action, however, will be more demanding. The rate of increase of global emissions must first be substantially slowed; then there must be reductions in these emissions to well below 1990 levels before the end of the next century. Many of the required technologies to bring about these reductions are already available, but they require adequate resources for investment and development. Studies show that the necessary action may cost around 1% of the total world product, much less than the likely cost of damage and adaptation if there is no action. 
If human communities are to be fulfilled and creative, they not only need goals related to their economic performance but also moral and spiritual goals. Care for the overall health of the planet is such a goal. It demands action by scientists to provide better information about likely climate change, by governments to set the necessary frameworks for change, by business and industry to seize the opportunities for innovation and the introduction of new technologies, and by all world citizens to support the action being taken and contribute to it.  1999 President Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives on two counts-perjury before a grand jury and obstruction ol justice-arising from his concealment of his affair with Monica Lewinsky. Yet the public continued to support the president: in November's elections, his party, the Democrats, gained House seats midway through a Democratic term for the first time since the 1930s. 
Governor George Bush of Texas won thunderous reelection to position himself for the Republican nomination for president in 2ooo. The worst natural disaster in modern history hit Central America when Hurricane Mitch swept through the region, killing thousands and shattering the economies of Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala. 
General Augusto Pinochet, Chile's ex-dictator, was arrested in London at the request of a Spanish magistrate, who is seeking to put him on trial for murder, torture and genocide. The general's arrest made legal history, dividing Chileans and provoking protests from their government. 
In Brazil, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso comfortably won a second term in an election in October despite, or because of, a financial crisis which threatened to undermine the country's new-found price and currency stability. Six years after staging a bloody but failed military coup in Venezuela, Hugo Chavez won his country's presidency through the ballot box, on a populist platform. The separatist Parti Quebecois retained power in provincial elections in Quebec But a lower share of the vote reduced the prospects of a third referendum on independence. 
Bloody street riots caused Indonesia's President Suharto to step down after 32 years. He was replaced by his protege, BJ. Habibie; unrest soon returned. 
A veteran opposition leader, Kim Dae Jung, became president of South Korea and freed 2,300 prisoners. Malaysia's prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, sacked his deputy, Anwar Ibrahim, and had him tried for corruption and sexual crimes. Mr Anwar claimed it was all a conspiracy. 
A Hindu-nationalist party, the BJP, formed a new government in India. Soon after, both India and Pakistan conducted nuclear tests and tension in Kashmir grew. John Howard was re-elected in Australia with a mandate to introduce a new goodsand-services tax. 
Pol Pot, leader of the Khmers Rouges, died in Cambodia. Devastating floods in China, Bangladesh and South Korea displaced millions. A tidal wave in Papua New Guinea killed 2,ooo people. 
Little change 
After an i8-month IsraeliPalestinian impasse, Bill Clinton stage-managed an interim deal between Binyamin Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat at an American summit in October. Mr Clinton then visited Mr Arafat in Gaza. But opposition to the deal in Israel's cabinet led Mr Netanyahu to decide on an early election next May. 
Two crises between Iraq and the UN arms inspectors were resolved just ahead of American bombing raids. A third one, in December, was not, and the Americans and British carried out a four-day air attack. Saddam Hussein said the inspectors would not be allowed back. 
Congolese rebels, backed by Uganda and Rwanda, set out from eastern Congo to overthrow Laurent Kabila. Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia sent troops to protect the president. Peace efforts failed and the war became a stalemate. 
The American embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam were bombed, killing 250 people, nearly all African. America blamed Osama bin Laden, a Saudi dissident, and bombed his camps in Afghanistan and a pharmaceuticals factory in Sudan. 
Sani Abacha, Nigeria's military dictator, died of a heart attack. His successor, Abdulsalam Abubakar, released political prisoners and announced elections next February at which new political parties would compete. 
Leftward bent 
By the end of 1998 left-ofcentre parties were in power, usually in coalitions, in 13 out of the European Union's 15 countries. Right-of-centre governments ruled the roost only in Spain and Ireland. 
In Germany Helmut Kohl and his Christian Democrats were beaten in a general election by Gerhard Schroder and the Social Democrats, who formed a coalition government with the Greens. 
Politics and the economy in Russia became ever more chaotic. An ailing Boris Yeltsin sacked two prime ministers and said he would stay as president until mid-2000. Voters north and south of the Irish border approved an agreement intended to bring peace to Northern Ireland But rows continued. 
A fragile peace survived in Bosnia, but its people continued to vote for leaders along largely ethnic lines. Civil war broke out in the south Serbian province of Kosovo, where the ethnic-AIbanian majority demanded independence. 
The Greek-Cypriot government of Cyprus decided not to deploy Russian surface-toair missiles, which Turkey had threatened to blitz. The Basque separatist guerrilla group ETA declared peace in Spain.  1999 To the brink 
Global GDP growth fell by half to less than 2% and the world teetered on the edge of the worst financial crisis since the 193os. Russia defaulted on its domestic debts in August; Long-Term Capital Management, a big hedge fund, nearly collapsed. Fears of a global credit crunch were eased only after America's Federal Reserve cut interest rates three times. 
Deflation surfaced. In dollar terms, commodity and oil prices sank to levels not seen since 1986. In real terms, The Economist industrials commodity price index fell to its lowest since the 193os and oil prices to their lowest in 25 years. Even the prices of finished goods fell in several countries, squeezing the average inflation rate in the G7 economies to a 4o-year low. 
As international capital flows dried up, the emerging economies submerged. Much of East Asia plunged into deep recession; Russia's economy imploded; and, by the end of the year, Brazil's economy was shrinking, after $30 billion had been spent defending its currency. Such was the demand for financial rescues that the IMF almost ran out of money; but at the last minute America's Congress approved new funds. 
Japan's economy went from bad to dreadful. By October, it had contracted for four quarters in a row, despite umpteen fiscal-stimulus packages. The Nikkei average tumbled to 12,880 in October, its lowest level for 13 years. 
Most of the other rich economies flourished. America's economy expanded by an estimated 3.5%, driven by falling import prices and rampant consumer spending on the back of stockmarket gains. Wall Street plunged by 20% during the summer, but it then recovered, to leave the Dow up 17% over the year. 
Asian banks wobbled. In Japan, the passage of a Y60 trillion ($500 billion) bank-aid package allowed the government to nationalise LongTerm Credit Bank and Nippon Credit Bank, two of the duffest lenders. The two insolvent banks had assets equal to 7% of Japan's GDP. In China GITIC, a big investment group, collapsed. 
The urge to merge 
It was the world's biggest ever year for mergers and acquisitions: they surpassed $2.4 trillion, 50% above 1997's total. American companies made two-thirds of the deals. Biggest of all in value terms was the union of two oil giants, Exxon and Mobil, announced in December: it will create the world's biggest company in revenue terms. 
About a quarter of deals by volume were cross-border. Daimler-Benz, a German car maker, joined Chrysler in the largest foreign takeover of an American firm. In drugs, parts of the biggest French and German firms, RhonePoulenc and Hoechst, merged; as did Britain's Zeneca with Sweden's Astra. 
Big banks got even bigger. Citicorp joined Travelers in the largest ever financial-services merger. A week later came news of another whopper: the merger of BankAmerica and NationsBank to form America's second biggest bank. Germany's Deutsche Bank paid $io billion for Bankers Trust, America's ninth biggest, which had been driven into loss by the emerging-markets crisis. 
In the digital world, convergence continued Compaq, a hungry Pc-maker, gobbled Digital Equipment Corporation; and America Online, the best-known Internet service provider, paid $4.2 billion for Netscape, populariser of the web-browser. In telecoms, WorldCom merged with MCI, a long-distance company. A re-energised AT&T bought TCI, America's leading cable operator, and linked with Britain's BT. 
Media mergers went transatlantic. Canada's Seagram, which owns Universal Studios, bought PolyGram, Philips's music-and-films arm, for $10.6 billion. In doing so it destroyed the nearest thing Europe had to a film studio. Bertelsmann, Germany's media giant, bought Random House for a rumoured $1.5 billion, thus becoming the world's largest Englishlanguage publisher. 
Europe came closer to having a single stockmarket when the Frankfurt and London stock exchanges decided to trade jointly Europe's top blue-chip shares. Other European exchanges said they were keen to join. 
Sic transit 
Robert Crandall, tough boss of American Airlines for three decades, stepped down. Alex Trotman, boss of Ford (and now a lord), quit earlier than expected. So did Anna Murdoch, who left her husband Rupert and the board of News Corp. 
Pfizer launched Viagra, a cure for impotence, but later had to attach a warning about side-effects. Gillette launched a sharp new razor, but later had to cut jobs. America's tobacco companies fought suits from state governments in court, but then settled their legal rows and took large charges. 
America's Department of Justice launched an epic antitrust case against Microsoft. Whatever the verdict, an appeal is certain, and the case is doubtless destined for the Supreme Court. 
Switzerland's two largest banks, UBs and Credit Suisse, buckled under a mounting pile of class-action suits and agreed to pay Holocaust survivon $1.25 billion. 
Hong Kong and Malaysia opened new airports, among the world's largest, just as the region's economic crisis cut back air travel. Both suffered expensive teething troubles.  1999 The Economist, 25 St James's Street, London swi iec FAx : 0171 839 2968 E-MAIL : [email protected] 
No apology necessary 
SIR-I have never been able to accept what many Japanese opinion makers never tire of telling us to do: to ""apologise"" to the Chinese for ""crimes"" our fathers and grandfathers committed in China (""Japan in the right"", December 5th). Conveniently they forget to tell us that China's communist leadership far outdid the Japanese imperial army in the killing of their people. They did so to stay in power and, in my view, would not hesitate to do so again. 
Also, they do not discuss how the present Japanese army, just 150,000 strong, could become an aggressive threat to our neighhours, China included. Your point that the Chinese leadership, by seeming outraged at the non-apology of Japan's leaders, is putting Japan on the defensive and extracting a financial concession is clear to see. But again, our opinion makers seem not to see such a simple truth. 
Osaka NAOMI HAGA 
SIR-I disagree strongly with your support of Japan in its refusal to apologise to China for colonial atrocities. Your main argument is that China's rulers are a nasty bunch with no right to lecture anyone about abusing the Chinese people. In some cases it can be hard to separate attitudes towards a government from feelings about the people it represents. But surely this is not such a case. The issue pre-dates the governments and indeed governmental systems of both countries, and is one on which the Chinese leaders do speak for many of their people. 
Japan does recognise and deal with the Chinese regime, in no way regarding it as a pariah state incapable of normal relations. So if we say the Chinese get no apology because we dislike their leaders, we might as well say no one anywhere gets recognition of past wrongs unless we like their government.

Family values 
SIR-Your article on the sale of Icelandic family data (December 5th) clearly summarises the ethical problems. However, some matters need clarifying. Iceland is not inbred: inbreeding occurs when individuals preferentially marry known relatives. The effect is to lose genes, especially rare ones. This makes the remaining genes easier to find but it has little effect on common genes, whose collaborative efforts influence the risk of common disorders. Rather than its depth of ancestral documentation, the value of Iceland in these disorders is that its environment is unusually homogeneous, as are standards of living and standards of medical provision. 
In relatively rare disorders due to single genes, such as cystic fibrosis and the inherited form of breast cancer, deep ancestral studies allow a single common ancestor to be found and the position of genes to be defined through nearby genes. In common disorders many genes are usually involved and these genes may be derived from as many ancestors. 
It is difficult to see how defining more ancestors can provide much information on the common disorders whose decipherment is the main commercial attraction. It was largely the impossibility of making pedigrees both confidential and informative that led the Ethical Committee of the Icelandic Medical Council to state that it was ""completely opposed to the present bill and will advise Icelandic physicians not to participate in the setting up of the data base.""

In the pipeline 
SIR-Your article on Caspian energy (November 28th) asserts that prospects for building a main export pipeline from Baku to Ceyhan in Turkey have rarely looked so doubtful. In fact, prospects for this project have never looked better. 
In the past, many observers thought a pipeline between Baku and Supsa in Georgia could provide the optimal route for exports from offshore Azerbaijan. But during the past 12 months, companies and regional governments have realised the importance of some broader considerations. These include long-term energy security, the viability of shipping large volumes of oil through the Bosporus, and the attractiveness of a large-diameter pipeline to a port like Ceyhan, which is able to handle exports from both sides of the Caspian. 
The contention that the bulk of output from eastern Caspian producers will flow to a Russian terminal on the Black Sea may be true, but only for a limited time. Significant potential exists for boosting the proven oil reserves of Kazakhstan, both offshore and onshore. If fully realised, these additions could exceed the capacity of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium's first- and secondphase pipelines to the Russian Black Sea coast. 
In early December, Kazakhstan and three companiesChevron, Mobil and Shellagreed to study the feasibility of creating a unified system of oil and gas pipelines from western Kazakhstan to Turkey. This will be an important step towards aggregating Caspian output and enhancing the viability of the Ceyhan export route. The Azerbaijan International Operating Company, meanwhile, has said negotiations are continuing with potential transit countries. These developments, plus the likelihood of incentives from regional governments, will ultimately make Baku-Ceyhan the optimal route for Caspian oil exports.

Case for the defence 
SIR-Your special on defence (December 12th) confuses cause and effect. You say that ""the chances of aerial dogfights or naval battles"" are declining and, therefore, large industrial war machines such as ships, submarines and tanks are not worth purchasing. But why are the chances of mechanised land wars, dogfights and sea battles receding? Is it because of a fundamental change in the nature of warfare or because the overwhelming superiority of western militaries makes confrontation impractical? 
It is arguable that there is overinvestment in traditional areas but equally arguable that it is crucial to maintain an overwhelming advantage in these areas, to deter the most destructive forms of warfare. The situation is analogous to the maintenance of a nuclear deterrent to make nuclear attack uneconomical. Tacoma

The Economist, Ill West 57th Street, New York, NY 10019-2211.  1999 WITH every day that passes, matters get worse. The country is drifting along in a state of neglect. Legislative programmes are unheard of. Reformist debate has stopped. The political atmosphere is as poisonous as it has been since the 196os. Iraq is bombed, and half America-as well as much of the worldwonders at the president's motives. When Russia collapses, when markets stumble, when China gets aggressive, when the next terrorist atrocity occurs, the world still hopes America will take the lead. But how can it, when Bill Clinton is about to go on trial before the Senate? 
Everyone wants this horror-and horror is not too strong a word-to end. Had Mr Clinton resigned in August, when he was forced to admit that he had lied to his family, his colleagues and the American people, he could have finished it there. He could still do so; and would do so, if he were capable of shame or had any sense of honour. But Mr Clinton is even less inclined to resign today than he was before his impeachment. The vote to impeach was so partisan that it has rallied even wavering Democrats behind him, and has hitched the polls a few points higher in his favour. Where even the intimation of impeachment shattered Nixon, it has strengthened Bill Clinton. He will cling on to the last. 
How then can the paralysis be broken? At this point, only in two ways. The first would be a quick trial in the Senate which would probably end in acquittal but would not rule out criminal proceedings once Mr Clinton had left office. The second would be a motion of censure: constitutionally doubtful, but not objectionable, as long as it did not include immunity from future prosecution. Two things are vital here. The first is speed, to get America back to work. But more important is the second: that the president should be made to face the consequences of his perjury before the grand jury. He must be made to feel the weight of the damage he has done. 
Penance all round 
To be fair, blame for the damage should also be laid at other doors. America has been so convulsed by this scandal, and the public so revolted, because the process of bringing Mr Clinton to book has been tainted at every stage. The president was dogged by an independent counsel whose powers were excessive and whose tactics were sometimes suspect. The Supreme Court caused much of the paralysis by ruling that the Paula Jones suit against a sitting president should proceed. That suit itself was encouraged by the president's political enemies. The press-including The Economist-leapt into the Monica story with both feet. As a result, although the machinery of impeachment was gleefully cranked up, it soon felt wrong. The sense of shame and sadness that now engulfs many thoughtful Americans comes not so much from sympathy with this particular president-whose lying defiance deserves noneas from worry at the precedents that have been set for political vendettas against elected presidents in future. 
As the newyear dawns, there is some hope that the damage done will not be lasting. In the Senate, at least, there is a desperate urge for civility to undo the grandstanding rudeness shown by Republicans in the House. If the Senate performs its duties with dispatch, and above all with bipartisanship, some of the wounds may start to heal; though it may take months, and even a trouncing in next year's elections, before the Republican zealots in Congress start to grasp the havoc they have caused. 
On a point of detail (though a large one) Congress should review, and consider abolishing in its present form, the office of the independent counsel when the statute comes up for renewal this year. At present, an attorney-general has little choice but to appoint such a counsel when there seems to be evidence of executive-branch wrongdoing. But his brief is open-ended, his funding and his subpoena powers almost limitless. The present statute, a reaction against the powerless prosecutors of the Watergate era, did not envisage a Ken Starr figure let loose on the White House. The office has diminished the importance of Congress (as was seen most clearly in Watergate) in checking the excesses of the president and his men. 
The Supreme Court, too, has not emerged without bruising. As soon as a pretext arises (though America might well hope one would not arise soon), the court should revisit its ruling that sitting presidents are liable to prosecution in civil suits. The justices, like the House Republicans in turn, have sometimes seemed blustered into hardline positions by their distaste for the president's stonewalling. If calmer tempers can prevail, the three main branches of government may be able to deal with each other reasonably again. 
Yet that may take years. Although every arm of government, not merely the president, has behaved in ways they are now beginning to regret, dangerous precedents have been set. The presidency is a weakened and unattractive office, impeachment has become a purely partisan instrument, and marginal groups in Congress will now feel they have the power to overturn the mandate of the people. It is high time everyone drew back, reviewed the damage, and began to restore some of the rules and conventions that have kept America free of such traumas in the past. But the first essential is the brisk, fair and appropriate punishment of the man who, many months ago, might have spared his country all this agony by behaving as an honourable president really should.  1999 Historians may well count January 4th 1999 as an epic moment 
IT WILL happen over a holiday weekend, and in a way which leaves ordinary citizens more or less unaffected, as new notes and coins will not replace old national currencies for a further three years. But the nature of its launch on January 4th should not let anyone underestimate the importance of the creation of the euro, the new single currency for ii European Union members, nor miss its genuinely historic nature. It is the biggest risk the Eu has ever taken, but also an adventure that could transform the economic and political landscape of the continent. It is the first time that countries of anything like this number, size or global economic weight have gathered together to share a currency, and thus to pool their monetary sovereignty. It is arguably the most momentous currency innovation since the establishment of the United States dollar in 1792. 
The superlatives could go on. But is the euro to be welcomed? Yes, it is, and all should hope that it will be a success. The European Union is an imperfect creature, with some of its actions based on fine principles of political economy and some on poor ones. The intentions behind the euro fall clearly into the first category. The EU was founded in 1957 on the desire to avoid war, and many of its best achievements have also been based on another sort of disarmament: policy disarmament. For external trade, for state aids, for the singlemarket rules and others, countries have handed over powers that seemed (though generally weren't) individually desirable but were in practice mutually harmful. A similar transfer is happening now with monetary policy. The ii euro members' rights to inflate, to finance budget deficits by printing money, to boost exports temporarily by currency devaluation are being handed over to the new European Central Bank (ECB) in the most powerful way possible, by treaty. 
As with the other forms of policy disarmament, the transfer of powers to a supra-national body does not guarantee they will be used well. In trade, national protectionism has too often merely been replaced by pan-European protectionism. But the Treaty of Maastricht, which in 1991 paved the way for the ECB and the euro, gives cause for hope. The ECB has a strict and simple task: price stability. It is forbidden by treaty from bailing out a profligate government. Its independence from political interference is well entrenched. 
That said, the risks associated with the euro also begin with the treaty. To paraphrase Keynes's criticisms of the Treaty of Versailles after the first world war, treaties often solve one problem but cause the next. In the case of Maastricht, one risk is that the ECB's task will be carried out too strictly and inflexibly. But the most worrying legacy lies in the treaty's strictures about national budget deficits and in the cementing of those concerns in the later Stability and Growth Pact. As our article argues on pages 19-zz, this deprives governments of the one power which, under a monetary union, they most need: the ability to use national fiscal policy to counteract recessions which affect one member state more than the others. They have not lost this ability altogether, but it will be severely constrained. 
The danger that this raises is that in the event of a sharp recession in one or more countries, there will then be a political reaction against the EU itself The Union as a whole, and other euro members, will be blamed for the victim's inability to moderate its recession. Given that public support for the euro has been thin, to say the least, in most of the member countries (and is unlikely to grow much during the absurdly long, three-year period before people actually get hold of euro notes and coin), this is one helluva hostage to fortune. 
A United States of Europe? 
Such an outcome, if it happens, could cause a political bustup; or it could lead to more power being transferred to the EU in the worst possible circumstances, namely when the Union is deeply unpopular. But there is also a happier way to think about things. Perhaps this nasty outcome will not occur, either because no such ""asymmetric"" recession takes place or because governments, meanwhile, have dismantled the stability pact. In that event, the euro will have proved a success: its members will have achieved low inflation, and the currency will have ridden out the ups and downs of the economic cycle without itself becoming politically unpopular. That is the outcome for which everyone should be hoping during the next decade. 
What then? The answer, most probably, is that a successful euro would give a big impulse to political union between the constituent countries, something close to the founding fathers'-and Winston Churchill's-original dream. The policy disarmament of monetary union would have been shown to have worked, would by then be justifiably popular, and would have encouraged governments to seek new ways to transfer their powers to common institutions. Such a union is not inevitable. And on a decade or two's timetable it would be unlikely to be as full a union as today's United States of America. To those who hate federalism, the very thought of political unity will anyway be anathema. But this would be the right way to arrive at a closer union: after a positive experience, and with popular support. 
Even this Elysian vision must, however, take account of other likely changes. By then the EU will be bigger, with 20-3o members rather than the current 15. That fact, let alone the current division between the ii euro countries and the four, led by Britain, that have not joined, is likely to mean that the Union should become a multi-system entity, with some countries signing up to everything and others opting for a different blend. It may well prove perfectly rational, in the long term, for some EU countries to stay out of even a successful euro. But that, too, is a happy thought: a Europe that is broad as well as deep, that takes account of national differences and is not thought of as a federalising bully. If the euro succeeds in creating such a Europe, its launch on January 4th 1999 will be looked back on as really quite a moment.  1999 Not even Tony Blair can put a positive gloss on the scandal that has just claimed two of his senior ministers 
TONY BLAIR is one of the world's most admired politicians. In Britain, too, his personal popularity has remained unusually high well into the second year of his New Labour administration. But even Mr Blair will find it difficult to emerge unscathed from the scandal that led over Christmas to the abrupt resignation from the cabinet of Peter Mandelson, one of his closest political friends, along with the resignation of Geoffrey Robinson, the paymaster general, who had secretly lent Mr Mandelson 373,ooo ($630,ooo) on easy terms to buy a swanky home in London's Notting Hill. Mr Blair seems genuinely to have been kept in ignorance of this arrangement between his friends. But he has connived in letting Mr Mandelson make light of what he did. 
A letter of resignation is often the last chance politicians have to put a favourable spin on an unfavourable turn of events. If their careers are finished, it does no great harm to let them get away with it. But Mr Blair has told Mr Mandelson that his career is far from over, that he will achieve ""much, much more with us"". To drive the message home, the undisgraced former minister has been consoled by an overnight stay with the Blairs at Chequers. He is to retain various special responsibilities, such as strengthening Britain's relations with Germany. In short, his career is still very much alive. That is why he and Mr Blair cannot be allowed to get away with a truly breathtaking bit of resignation spin. 
To judge by his letter to Mr Blair, Mr Mandelson is a victim of fate, a loyal lieutenant who did nothing seriously wrong in borrowing some money from a friend, but who would sooner fall on his sword than allow the faintest hint of impropriety to taint the high ethical standards which supposedly sets New Labour apart from its Tory predecessor (see page 49). Tojudge byhis letter to Mr Mandelson, Mr Blair sees his former trade and industry secretary as a loyal chum who made a ""misjudgment"" but insisted on doing the honourable thing, paid a heavy price, and so forth. This is not just the usual humbug politicians are expected to spoon out when they get into this sort of fix. It is hypocritical nonsense. 
Far from being a willing martyr, sacrificing a glittering career for a higher cause, Mr Mandelson resigned only after the failure of an energetic attempt to brazen things out, and in the light of further disclosures that he may have been economical with the truth when applying for a mortgage. Above all, it is nonsense to portray Mr Robinson's loan as if it were only something that might look wrong to suspicious minds. It really was wrong-which is why Mr Mandelson strove so hard to keep it secret. 
Consider the sequence of events. Mr Robinson made the loan, on favourable terms, when Labour was in opposition and Mr Mandelson was at the centre of Mr Blair's inner circle. In these circumstances, Mr Mandelson must surely have wondered whether Mr Robinson's generosity was an attempt to buy position in the new government. And yet he said nothing about the loan to Mr Blair. He said nothing after the election, either, when he was made responsible for presenting government policy and Mr Robinson was made paymaster general. He said nothing when Mr Robinson's business affairs later became the stuff of controversy and the subject of scrutiny by Parliament. And, amazingly, he continued to say nothing when, as trade and industry secretary, his own department started an investigation into Mr Robinson's affairs. Not at all holier than thou 
Many people will look at this affair and wonder whether Mr Mandelson's belief that the pursuit of greatness requires a flashy house will set back the modernisers in the Labour Party. That is another story (see Bagehot, page 52). What is already clear is that the party that entered office promising to set higher standards in public life has let itself off far too lightly. Mr Mandelson pretends to see nothing wrong in failing to tell Mr Blair about his personal indebtedness to the beleaguered Mr Robinson. Mr Blair pretends to believe him. As for Mr Robinson himself, Mr Blair says that a blameless minister has been ""hounded out"". But if Mr Robinson is blameless, why did Mr Blair let him go? And if Mr Mandelson had to go, why is he promised a glittering future? It is almost enough to make you nostalgic for John Major.  1999 Taking part, it is said, is just as important as winning. This rule apparently applies as much to economic statistics as to sports 
WHEN a country competes for the first time in the Olympic games or the World Cup, it unleashes a wave of national pride-even if its athletes come last. A less well known mark of national esteem is whether a country is included in The Economists economic indicator pages (see pages 88-90). Our power to delete countries at the mere click of a mouse can, it seems, provoke international disputes. 
Disgruntled government officials and businessmen often demand to know why their country is left out. The answer is simple. New Zealand's economic policies have been more exciting (and more commendable) than Belgium's, but (given our space constraint) the criterion for inclusion in our pages on developed countries is size: Belgium may be uneventful, but its GDP is almost four times that of New Zealand's. 
Some governments wince if their country is listed among the emerging economies. Portuguese officials were cross to see their country in our emerging-markets table. Their yelps, and the fact that Portugal is now part of Europe's single-currency area, persuaded us to move it into the developed world. The unfortunate result is that Portugal has now completely disappeared from our tables. ""Why?"" demands the country's foreign minister. Because although Portugal was important in the emerging-market league (its stockmarket is relatively developed) its economy is too small to include in our league of developed countries for which we publish much more detailed economic statistics. 
Let that be a warning to Greece, which also claims that it is no longer an emerging economy. Better, perhaps, to be a big fish in a pond than a tiddler in an ocean. In the real world, promotion can sometimes lead to an even more serious fate. The IMF promoted South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan from developing to advanced economy status in May 1997-only months before East Asia's financial collapse. 
Behind such disputes lies a deeper issue: the labels given to countries are out-of-date. So ""industrial economies"" are misnamed now that industrial production accounts for only one-quarter of their output-much less than in the emerging economies. And the ""emerging market"" label-itself created to provide a more positive image for the ""third world""-also looks tarnished. It once conjured up the image of dynamic economies and stockmarkets; now, with countries from Thailand, to Russia, to Brazil in deep recession, cynics have renamed them ""submerging"" markets. 
Name dropping 
Four years ago, The Economist suggested a new set of labels for country groupings: the ""paralysed"" (poor economies, such as those in Africa, that have been standing still); the ""progressing"" (emerging markets); and the ""paranoid"" (the rich countries that are terrified of competition from the progressives). But since then many progressives have become paralysed, and some, such as Malaysia, risk becoming paranoid too as they shelter their economies from global forces. 
Perhaps we should group countries according to their chances of gaining entry to our indicator pages: the puny (too small, no hope) the persistent (governments which pen the most letters of complaints and the persuasive (those with good arguments, of course, not frenetic phrases). But the only sure winners will be the patient: economies that expand by following sound policies.  1999 Only poets can now save mankind from millennium buggery 
SCARCELY a year to go, and still no one can be confident that the stroke of midnight next December 31st will not release a plague of little green bugs to usher in the new millennium. Panic is rising. Every household in Britain has been told to stock up with two weeks' supplies, presumably of spam, margarine and vindaloo curry, the national dish. Some people foresee the lights going out all over the world, as power stations crash. Others say aircraft will go demented, along with cars, trains, traffic lights, hospital equipment and the numberless other bits of high-techery that make modern life worth living (all those computer games of Christmas past). Launch-on-warning missiles will be released, nuclear weapons will start spontaneously to fizz and, if any life at all continues, stockmarkets will go into sullen decline, as a bug-induced recession of apocalyptic proportions takes hold. 
Admittedly, the bugs are not going to have it all their own way. A working-group of ""informatics"" experts, known as Y2K chiefs, has just been convened at the United Nations in New York. They have been instructed to ""address the difficulties, and facilitate a useful exchange of experiences."" 
Reassured? Of course not. It is nerds and geeks and informatics experts who got us into this fix in the first place. With the clock ticking, it is no good looking to them to get us out of it. Bring on the people who really get things done-""the trumpets which sing to battle and feel not what they inspire . . . the unacknowledged legislators of the world."" Yes, Shelley's poets are now the only ones likely to be able to make the world safe for computerised civilisation as we know it. 
And how? Well, by stopping the ticking of the damned clock. Smart-Alicks have come up with their silly ideas, such as telling your computer or microchip that 2ooo is really 1972, the most recent year to have matching dates and days of the week. If it worked, that would buy 28 years in which to solve the problem, or at least address the difficulties, and facilitate a useful exchange of experiences. An alternative would be to say, ""All right, computers, listen up: the calendar has been wrong from the start. Jesus Christ was actually born around 6Bc, so we've really passed the dreaded 2ooo mark and you didn't even notice. It wasn't so bad after all."" Or you could do a Pope Gregory, or at least a variation of his trick, which was to skip the ten days after October 4th 1582 in order to tidy up the Julian calendar, which had been losing a day a century. But whether you go forward or back, you meet this difficulty: why should computers respond any more readily to being fooled about the date than to being told the truth? 
So over to the poets, those unacknowledged legislators of the world and, of course, to those they write about: 
Your face would stop a clock, For it's so passing fair That time itself would like to stop And linger there. 
Forget other proposals, the stopped clock is the only solution to the millennium-bug problem. A pause will do everybody good: the world has been in a dreadful rush for far too long, and in many respects people are really getting ahead of themselves. Properly equipped, the poets can avert something that might be quite unpleasant. Only one thing is missing: the face they need to arrest the ticking. Let the search begin. The world has just 12 months (no little green gremlins need apply.)  1999 Europe's monetary union is neither bound to succeed nor doomed to fail. Leadership, circumstances and luck will combine to decide its fate 
THE architects of the euro, looking back this weekend on what they have achieved, are entitled to feel pleased with themselves. As recently as ten years ago, the idea of merging the European Union's national monetary systems seemed fantastic. A plan for doing it was drawn up nonetheless. Then, with the ink on this blueprint hardly dry, the forerunner of the single currency (the exchange-rate mechanism of the European Monetary System) collapsed, casting new doubt on the whole enterprise. No matter. The prime movers, Helmut Kohl in Germany and Francois Mitterrand in France, carried on regardless. On January 4th their remarkable vision becomes a reality: the currencies of the it participating members of Europe's Economic and Monetary Union will be ""irrevocably"" fused. 
To have come this far is in itself an amazing political feat. Nobody can claim that EMU was forced upon Europe's governments by force of events, still less by popular demand. Events have, if anything, conspired to wreck the plan. Europe's voters, perhaps reflecting the weight of official pro-euro propaganda, are by and large in favour, and opinion has moved further in this direction of late (see table i) However, the balance in Germany, which could prove decisive, is still quite narrow. And it is disturbing that so few voters anywhere consider themselves ""well-informed"" about the project. 
This is an initiative of extraordinary ambition, given that it is to be carried through despite quite shallow support in popular opinion. EMU is an elite project. Europe's governments are saying: Our people may not be convinced of the euro's benefits just yet, but once it is in place and they come to understand it, they will change their minds. Europe's leaders had better be right. Otherwise, when the system comes under strain, its political foundations may prove too weak to sustain it. 
Even before construction of the euro is complete, governments can point to one notable success. The past year has seen extraordinary turmoil in global financial markets. Rich-country stockmarkets and currencies have not been spared. Yet Europe has been, comparatively speaking, a safe haven. Intra-European movements in exchange rates have been tiny. This is something that the euro-ii governments had committed themselves to, but their success could not have been taken for granted a year ago. The fact is, at a time of unprecedented financial turbulence, the foreign-exchange markets regarded the promise to stabilise intra-European exchange rates as credible. Currencies have held steady and interest rates have converged: it augurs well for the transition to the new system. 
The next few years are, after all, transitional. National currencies will continue to circulate until the end of zool, albeit at permanently fixed parities. In the meantime, the European System of Central Banks undertakes to defend those parities. In principle this means that if, say, Italians decide to switch all their lire into D-marks, the supply of D-marks will be expanded without limit to accommodate them. Even now there must be some small doubt as to whether, if push comes to shove, this will happen. But if the markets continue to regard the parities as credible-as they did throughout the exceptionally severe test of the past year-then Germany's offer to finance the early retirement of Italy's currency is unlikely to be called upon. 
That danger aside, and for the moment considering EMU only in its economic aspect, two principal risks remain. The first, which will be most acute during the project's early years, is that economic policy in the euro area as a whole will be ill-judged, leading to a recession that discredits the whole venture. The other, which will remain a threat into the medium term, is that the system will prove too inflexible to cope with local (in the jargon, ""asymmetric"") economic shocks. Consider each in turn. 
Independent to a fault 
In designing EMU, the architects laid great emphasis both on the independence of the European Central Bank (ECB) and on the simplicity and severity of its anti-inflation objective. In statutory terms, at least, the ECB may well be the most independent, and most single-minded, central bank in the world. America's Federal Reserve, for instance, is required by law to take output and employment into account alongside inflation, for which no numerical target is set. In addition, the Fed is accountable to Congress, which periodically questions its top officials and sometimes tries to influence their views. The restraint that Congress and the White House show in this regard is a matter of custom, reflecting the standing which the Fed has won for itself in financial markets over many years, and not a matter of law. 
The position of the ECB is quite different. The Maastricht treaty allows for no clear accountability to any other arm of national or European government. In fact the treaty explicitly forbids the ECB and its decision-making bodies to ""seek or take instructions from Community institutions or bodies, from any government of a member state or from any other body"". It also stipulates that the proceedings of the ECB council's meetings will remain confidential. If he chose, Wim Duisenberg, the first chief of the ECB, could nonetheless announce the outcome of its deliberations, together with a commentary and forecasts justifying it. Mr Duisenberg says he is not against this sort of openness. Time will tell. The point is, everything is left for the ECB to decide: this is independence with a vengeance. 
As to aims, the treaty further stipulates that the ECB'S goal is ""price stability"", leaving the bank to decide what that means. In many other countries with ""independent"" central banks-in Britain, for instance-the government sets a target for inflation and reserves the right to change it as circumstances, in its judgment, dictate. EMU has no such escape-clause. Moreover, the bank is forbidden to balance the goal of price stability against other aims. The treaty directs the ECB to ""support the general economic policies of the Community"" but, crucially, it is to do this ""without prejudice to the objective of price stability"". 
The ECB has now defined ""price stability"" to mean inflation of less than 2% a year. In modern times, no major economy has hit such a target consistently over a run of years. America's inflation rate has averaged 3.3% over the past ten years; Germany's, despite the mighty Bundesbank, has averaged 2.8%. In short, a radically undemocratic institution has been charged to achieve, without compromise, an exceptionally demanding goal of virtually zero inflation. 
Strong evidence suggests that centralbank independence is indeed a good idea: any given level of inflation can be achieved more cheaply, in terms of forgone output and employment, if firms and workers believe that monetary policy is free from undue political pressure. The danger is that En,cu'S architects have gone too far. The European Union, with its weak parliament, is acknowledged in any case to have a ""democratic deficit"" at its centre; the powers of the new central bank will make that deficit all the greater. In economic terms, the danger is simply that the ECB will take its instructions literally-and will try to screw inflation down to nothing regardless of wider economic repercussions. 
As it happens, the circumstances seem likely to prove favourable. Forecasters at the OECD expect that output in the euro zone will grow by 212% in the coming year, with inflation remaining at about its present 12% (see table 2). This assumes that short-term interest rates in the euro area will average 3% in 1999, their current level, a full percentage point lower than the average for 1998. All that would presumably suit the ECB pretty well. But more awkward eventualities cannot be ruled out. 
One is that governments, after years of post-Maastricht squeezing and fudging of budget deficits, will ease fiscal policy too much (despite the rule forbidding it, of which more in a moment). That could put upward pressure on inflation and lead the ECB, with little headroom beneath its inflation target, to assert itself at once and raise interest rates (or delay cutting them). An early conflict of this kind between loose fiscal policy and tight monetary policy would be an extremely discouraging start. 
Another even more awkward possibility for monetary policy in EMu'S first year or two is that the OECD'S forecasts for output may prove too optimistic. This is not implausible. The health of the world economy is far from robust. With Wall Street overvalued on every historical measure, the danger of sharp falls in global equity prices in 1999 needs to be taken seriously. That in turn might prompt a worse slowdown in demand than is allowed for in the OECD's central-case forecasts. The question would then be whether the ECB would cut interest rates soon enough and far enough to avoid recession in Europe. 
If the bank waited for inflation to fall before acting, that would be too late. Yet the bank might be reluctant to act more promptly, responding to forecasts of lower inflation rather than to out-turns, as it should, for fear of undermining its credibility with the markets. 
Mr Duisenberg will prefer to err on the side of caution (that is, on the side of lower inflation and higher short-term unemployment) in any case; he will want to be judged by the euro zone's inflation record, maintaining that unemployment is none of his concern. Adding to his desire to establish a tough reputation at the outset will be his memory of the fiasco surrounding his appointment. France wanted to appoint its own candidate to the job; the other countries resisted. The absurd compromise that was settled upon allowed France to say that Mr Duisenberg will step down early in favour of its man, while Mr Duisenberg says that no such promise was made. When Mr Duisenberg comes to be tested, the price of that squabble may well be higher interest rates and fewer jobs. 
A shocking possibility 
In principle, however, a recession that threatens the euro-ii as a group is not the most difficult scenario for the ECB. Once its reputation is established and any teething troubles overcome, a system-wide problem of that kind can be dealt with perfectly well by the system-wide response of a change in interest rates. Indeed, a single central bank is arguably better equipped to deal with such a case than would be ii separate national banks, acting in an unco-ordinated way. That is why, beyond the transitional period, the larger challenge for the new system will be to deal with fluctuations that are not system-wide. 
The euro zone is not what economists call an ""optimum currency area""-that is, it is not a region whose constituent parts are affected in broadly the same way by typical economic disturbances, or among whose constituent parts labour moves freely. If it were, then no economic purpose would be served by retaining sub-European currencies. Admittedly, few if any national economies meet that ideal standard: regions within the United States often suffer asymmetric shocks because of local concentrations of particular industries, and although American labour migrates comparatively smoothly from one state to another, these shifts are by no means costless. 
The point, though, is that the euro zone is very much further from being an optimum currency area than is the United States. Disparities in relative prices (after allowing for exchange-rate fluctuations) are greater among the euro-ii than among American states; and the mobility of labour within Europe is, according to one study, only one-third of the mobility of labour within America. 
Advocates of monetary union argue that the euro will itself narrow the gap, by encouraging closer economic integration. This is quite true. However, even with the euro, the barriers of culture and language are likely to remain stronger in Europe. One perverse consequence of the euro may be that, precisely because it encourages closer integration, it will also promote greater local specialisation-increasing the chance of asymmetric shocks from that source. In sum, for many years to come, persistent national divergences in growth and unemployment are likely to recur from time to time. 
Europe's governments all acknowledge that one way to reduce the costs of these divergences is to improve the supply-side flexibility of their economies. The price of European over-regulation is a both a higher unemployment rate over time, and a greater susceptibility to a further upward ratcheting of this average or equilibrium rate of unemployment with each serious recession. The trouble is, governments have so far proved better at paying lip-service to the need for deregulation than they have at dealing with the problem. The recent shift to the left in European politics makes this remedy all the less likely to be adopted. 
That leaves macroeconomic policy. When a country with its own currency suffers a recession, it is free to cut interest rates. This stimulates demand twice over: first by lowering the cost of credit, and second by causing the currency to depreciate (which spurs exports). Countries in the euro zone will not have this option. Emigration cannot help much (as it would in the case of Michigan, say). And since Europe has only a tiny central budget, net assistance from faster-growing countries (in the form of bigget inflows of public spending and smaller outflows of taxes) will also play a far smaller part than the equivalent fiscal transactions in the United States. 
All that remains is national fiscal policy. The recession-struck economy is still free to borrow on its own behalf, thus stimulating demand and speeding its recovery. Or it would be, except for EMU'S ""Stability and Growth Pact"". This is a rule that governments agreed to at Germany's insistence, requiring budget deficits to be held to 3% of GDP or less. Violators will be fined, subject to a vote of governments, unless output has fallen by 2% or more in the year in question. 
Despite this purported flexibility, the regime (like the rules defining the ECB's aims and freedoms) is exceptionally severe. Falls in output of 2% or more are extremely unusual; far smaller downturns would cause unemployment to rise quickly and be universally regarded as ""recessions"". And the restriction is too tight in another way: governments that tried to anticipate a downturn by relaxing fiscal policy early, thereby breaching the 3% limit before output fell by 2%, would also face fines. The German doubts that led to the adoption of this procedure were exaggerated, albeit not entirely groundless. The concern was that chronic overborrowers would become even more fiscally irresponsible once they had adopted the euro, because they would no longer face the financial-market sanction of higher interest rates and (in the end) a depreciating currency. Moreover, this overborrowing would henceforth be at least partly at the expense of Germany and the other euro countries, because they would bear some of the cost of default, if it came to that. 
The fear is exaggerated because the Maastricht treaty rightly insists that the central bank cannot bail out national governments. Provided that promise is believed, and so long as the no-bail-out rule applies to other finance ministries as well as to the ECB, the markets would attach a risk premium (in the form of a higher interest rate) to borrowing by heavily indebted governments. That is as it should be-and no further discipline should be necessary. As it is, the stability pact calls that promise into doubt, by making budgets a collective responsibility. Worse, in the meantime it rules out counter-cyclical fiscal policy of the sort that will often be necessary, and for which there is no longer any plausible national substitute. 
The crucial question regarding the stability pact, therefore, is the same as for the ECB: given that the design is so bad, how might it work in practice? Today, budget deficits in many euro economies (including the three biggest) stand at more than 2% of GDP (see table 3). If demand in Europe grows more slowly in 1999 than the forecasters expect, those deficits may rise. (In some cases they will tend to rise regardless, as assorted post-Maastricht fudges are unwound.) Governments may soon be faced with the stability-pact requirement to raise taxes and/or cut public spending-even as their economies slide toward recession. Again, therefore, the hope must be that the rules will be bent, or scrapped. If this does not happen, and one or more countries encounter a downturn that the ECB cannot remedy by means of system-wide monetary policy, there are only two alternatives. 
One is that the countries concerned endure a deeper and longer recession than they are used to, or is necessary. This plainly runs the risk of calling forth mounting protests against EMU itself The other is that the fiscal powers available to the centre-the money gathered and spent by Brusselsmust be greatly enlarged. This would allow automatic fiscal stabilisers to work within Europe as they do within the United States of America. Many in Europe would regard this second alternative as desirable in any case, which (if the stability pact survives) makes it the more probable outcome. In any event, this seems likely to be the issue on which Europe's political future turns. 
Ever closer union 
Judged strictly as an economic venture, EMU will be a success if, over the coming years, the participating countries benefit from closer integration (measured by growing trade and investment in the euro area), satisfactory growth, declining unemployment and low inflation. If the single-currency project had been better designed, the chances of achieving this would have been good. Closer economic integration seems assured in any case. A plan that created a properly directed, properly accountable central bank and provided for adequate freedom in national fiscal policy would have done as much as macroeconomic policy can do to take care of the rest. To be sure, that would still have left governments to carry a heavy burden of supply-side reform-without which Europe cannot expect to cut its unemployment to the levels seen in America. Still, the outlook would have been promising. 
As it is, the chances of success are no better than fair. The central bank will have to rise above its flawed design-winning the popular regard it will one day need both by explaining what it is up to, and by balancing the short-term demands of low inflation, on the one hand, and growth in output and employment, on the other, more intelligently than its statutes require. And governments will have to find a way to make fiscal policy respond far more flexibly to economic circumstances than the Maastricht rules allow. 
Ideally this will be done by changing the rules-perhaps to require that budgets are balanced over the course of the economic cycle, but leaving them free to run further into deficit at times of slowing demand than the 3% of GDP allowed by the stability pact. Needless to say, in this case too, efforts to liberalise Europe's markets for goods, services and labour far more determined than governments have made so far will also be required. 
If EMU can overcome the flaws of its design and prove an economic success after all, Europe's governments (and, preferably, their citizens as well) will be able to weigh the coming political choices on their merits. If it fails in economic terms, those political choices may be severely constrainedand, as a result, far more divisive. Closer political integration built on the solid foundation of an EMU that worked would be one thing. The same course adopted in distress to save EMU from failure, or even outright collapse, would be an entirely different, and much more dangerous, enterprise.  1999 PERHAPS the biggest omission in the Maastricht treaty was the failure to clarify the status of the ""outs""-the countries that decline to take part. (Britain, Denmark and Sweden have chosen to stay out; Greece would love to join but is nowhere near satisfying the Maastricht criteria for membership.) This was not an oversight but a deliberate gap, much in accord with the way Europe's architects have tended to proceed. 
The EU'S members are pledged to move towards ""ever closer union"". Implicitly, the idea is that they will approach this goal (as yet undefined) at about the same speed-so the four countries not taking part in Emu at the outset are expected to join as soon as they can. To have designed a durable relationship between the ins and outs might have encouraged further delay. 
It often happens in European politics that if you do not want a contingency to arise, you ignore it, hoping it goes away. Sometimes it does-and this time-honoured approach may also work in the case of EMU'S outs. If monetary union is a success, the qualifying outsiders will warm to the idea. But the collapse of the ERM in 1992-93 showed that the head-in-the-sand method is not infallible. If EMU works badly, outsiders such as Britain are likely to become even more reluctant. 
There is also the question of EU enlargement. Prospective new members in Eastern Europe may not be ready, or may not choose, to join EMu at the beginning. Indeed, they would be wise to be cautious. Their economies are still struggling with the legacy of socialism. For many years yet they are likely to remain structurally different from their western neighbours, leaving them more exposed to the danger of asymmetric economic shocks. This only adds to the case for lasting arrangements allowing Eu countries to opt out of EMU indefinitely. 
The main economic problem posed by a permanent division of the EU into EMU and non-EMu countries is that the outs will be seen by the others as cheats. It is easy to imagine circumstances in which the euro will strengthen against other European currencies, putting euro countries at a competitive disadvantage in trade. If this happens (as well it might) at a time of slowing growth in the euro zone and briskly expanding output elsewhere in the EU, the euro-zone governments will be obliged to object. 
In due course, therefore, some form of monetary co-operation"" will probably be required of the outs, if only as a mark of good faith. One possibility would be a revived ERM, albeit a looser arrangement than the one that collapsed. (For instance, governments might promise to limit variations in their real, as opposed to nominal, exchange rates: this would preserve a measure of monetary discretion while ensuring that governments did not use it to pursue a policy of competitive devaluation.) Failing some such accord, the discussion may move to other ways of correcting the ""unfair"" advantage of the noneuro countries' depreciated currenciesand that is a discussion that could endanger the EU itself 
A permanent union of ins and outs would also raise a host of day-to-day political difficulties. The outs' great fearand what eventually may force them into EMU-is that the centre of decision-making for the EU as a whole will move to the committee of euro-zone finance ministers. This seems certain to happen if EMU runs into trouble, and the euro-zone countries adopt remedies such as collective fiscal policy and/or increased harmonisation of taxes and economic regulations. Even if all goes well, though, a diminution of the outs' political sway seems likely. The ins will surely want to punish the outs, with or without a show of regret. How better to encourage the laggards to change their minds?  1999 Europe's single currency is here, and out goes the ecu. The euro will operate in tandem with local currencies in ii EU countries (four don't want to know), and the new European Central Bank will begin to flex its muscles-but national central banks will still play their parts. Germany takes on the rotating presidencies of not only the European Council and the Western European Union but also the Group of Seven, and New Zealand takes the chair of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) forum.

But is anything in the world of Bill Clinton, the only elected president in America's history to have been impeached by the House of Representatives, truly straightforward? The president's advisers study every nuance of the opinion polls; his lawyers, like grandmasters with a chess board, plot the consequences of this admission or that; fellow Democrats cringe at his sexual shenanigans, but bask in the glow of his impeachment-defying popularity. Meanwhile, the country prays for an end to the saga. 
At some point the Senate will oblige. Just when is still an open question. The momentum that led to the president's impeachment on December 19th remains remorseless. When the new House meets on January 6th, it must first confirm in office Henry Hyde and the 12 other Republican members chosen to manage Mr Clinton's trial before the Senate. When these worthies present themselves and the articles of impeachment to the Senate, the Senate must meet at 1 pm the next day to consider them. Assume that no witnesses are called, and in theory Bill Clinton's (and the country's) ordeal will be over in a matter of days. 
Maybe so. This week the Republican leader of the Senate, Trent Lott, siad he and Tom Daschle, the Democrats' leader, were agreed that there is no need to hear witnesses. Mr Lott's argument is that ""the record is there to be reviewed, read, presented"" in any way the House prosecutors choose, ""and I think that would be sufficient."" Follow Mr Lott's schedule, and the articles of impeachment will be read in the Senate on January 7th; the trial will begin the following Monday, January ith, and last ""a week or two"". 
Will practice be quite so neat? Perhaps not. After all, most of the House Republicans are gung-ho to see the president squirm; their managers are said to be preparing themselves in the ""expectation"" that witnesses will be called; and in the end many senators may not want to snub the House quite so obviously. 
Moreover, if Mr Clinton chooses to fight, Mr Lott's schedule looks otherworldly. True, the president's team seem to have dropped the idea of a time-consuming challenge against the legality of the incoming House being bound by the decisions of its predecessor. But to accept the trial and plead innocence could likewise exhaust the calendar and the nation's patience: the president could reasonably ask the Senate to grant him time to prepare his defence, and this defence-and Henry Hyde's prosecution-would surely involve the calling of witnesses. 
But what if Mr Clinton does not fight? The president may have struck a defiant tone immediately after his impeachment, but he also talked of ""a reasonable, bipartisan, and proportionate response"" that could be ""embraced in the Senate"" as a ""constitutional and fair means of resolving this matter in a prompt manner"". In other words, the president, having expressed contrition ad nauseam, is willing to accept the public censure of Congress, a solution advocated in various forms over the months by senior members of both parties. 
The attractions of censure are many. For Democrats, it provides an escape from the embarrassment of a trial. For Republicans, given the arithmetic of the Senate, it offers a measure of retribution that a trial would in the end deny (a guilty verdict would need the approval of 67 of the loo senators, an unlikely outcome given that the Senate has 55 Republicans and 45 Democrats). 
But censure on whose terms? Robert Byrd, the Senate's senior Democrat and its leading historian, is adamant that-censure or no censure-a trial must be started. It is commonly agreed that it could be ended at any point on a vote by 51 senators, and the Senate could then vote to censure. Indeed, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the senior Democratic senator from New York, suggests a subtle refinement: let the continuation of the trial be kept in reserve, ready to be invoked if Mr Clinton suddenly decides not to play ball on censure-and let Mr Clinton give censure the force of law, by signing a censure bill sent to him by both House and Senate. Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, believes the Senate has a duty to carry a trial to its end and only then, assuming neither article of impeachment garners the support of 67 senators, do ""you sit down and you negotiate the censure alternative."" 
All of which is probably more easily said than achieved. The Republicans and a great many Democrats are adamant that the president must admit that he committed perjury, lying under oath to a grandjury. The president is so far unwilling to admit anything of the sort, mostly for fear of legal consequences (the talk persists of indictments awaiting both him and the First I adv once he has left the White House). From the president's perspective, censure must surely be accompanied by a binding forgiveness, however reluctantly given. 
Is such a bargain impossible? For some idealists, perhaps. But Mr Clinton may well assume that Congress has at least as many pragmatists and that they, like him, can read opinion polls that show his ratings rising as the Republican Party's fall. Meanwhile, it does no harm to gently remind voters and Congress alike that his state-ofthe-union message is due on January 19th; and that, despite Kenneth Starr and the impeachment votes in the House, the state is still looking pretty good.  1999 THE accused has a seemingly simple choice: to fight it out, or to accept his punishment.

IN A sealed room in sprawling Camp Pendleton, a Marine Corps base in California, a young corporal is mastering the use of the most formidable weapon in his arsenal: his brain. A CD-RoM-based simulator takes him through a variety of crises in which he must make split-second decisions and issue instant orders to cope with anything from a sudden burst of enemy gunfire to the approach of a band of thirsty refugees or a roving CNN crew. 
The Camp Pendleton programme is one example of how America is changing the way it trains its armed forces, so that they can handle a post-cold-war world in which charging tank divisions are less common than the chaos of ""low-intensity conflicts"", the jargon for peace-making and peace-enforcement operations. In this new world, the decisions taken by a lg-year-old crouching behind a bush with his finger on the trigger of an M-16 rifle or a laser-aimed missile can have enormous consequences for the foreign policy of the West. 
The Marine Corps, smaller in size and less bureaucratic than its larger cousins of the army, the navy and the air force, is help ing to shape these new training techniques. The 12-day, still-experimental course, of which the CD-ROM simulator is one component, aims to give the young leaders of 12-man sections the decision-making skills and killing authority previously reserved for company or even battalion commanders. Some of the things the marines learn, such as how to stay under cover, are standard military fare. Others, including the counselling skills taught by psychologists, seem to come straight from the world of New Age management gurus; but the young section leaders seem to relish it. 
One aim of the new training system is to enable American soldiers of the 21st century to handle the ""three-block war"". The phrase describes an operation in which they would simultaneously be distributing food and medicine to frantic civilians in one part of a city, quelling rioters and maintaining order in another, and fighting guerrillas in a third. 
Americans have already seen variations of the three-block war in Haiti, Somalia and Bosnia. Memories of the ill-fated rescue operation in Somalia in 1993 still haunt the military planners, especially the ""Ranger ambush"" in which a combined force of Rangers and Delta Force commandos was trapped by Somali gunmen for 18 hours; 18 men were killed and 73 wounded. Although the marines were not involved in that debacle, it is with an eye on the lessons of Somalia that the corps is now putting new emphasis on urban-warfare tactics and the need for first-class leadership of small units. 
The new training goes hand-in-hand with the use of new military instruments, such as the ""non-lethal munitions"" that will help to give American troops a wider range of options when dealing with an adversary than just trying to kill him. At one demonstration held for Camp Pendleton's senior officers, the arsenal of weapons on show included bean-bag projectiles fired from shotguns and grenade-launchers, blinding pepper sprayed from devices the size of fire-extinguishers, ultra-powerful flashlights that can find and dazzle potential snipers, and grenades which explode into a mess of adhesive foam that can block a doorway or goo up a suspected guerrilla. 
But what Americans peering into the future of warfare call the Revolution in Military Affairs, the RMA, also employs sterner weapons than these. In future wars of the Bosnia sort, for instance, small numbers of highly trained men with sophisticated weapons under their control will be ableit is hoped-to defeat much bigger armies of the conventional sort with little or no loss to themselves. Hidden on a hillside miles from the enemy, their fingers on precision-aiming devices, and helped by eyein-the-sky satellites and reconnaissance aircraft, they will be able to steer long-range missiles on to the enemy's tanks or guns; and the enemy will not be able to fire back, because he cannot see them and, even if he could, they are probably out of range. 
In such a fight, the weapons used by the warriors of the RMA will by no means be confined to bean-bags and gluey foam. A look at the equipment on display in Camp Pendleton makes the point. Most of them have two barrels and two triggers: one for firing non-lethal projectiles, the other for delivering the old-fashioned, deadly kind. A switch of the trigger and the kinder, gentler marines of the 21st century instantly become lethal. The advocates of the xn,tR are determined to make sure that America and its allies remain ahead of the rest of the world not only in the military technology they possess but also in the skills needed to use these weapons. 
And what happens when an adversary manages to manufacture, buy or steal a collection of similar weapons, as he doubtless will? Why, by then, say the confident optimists of the RA, America and its trusted allies will be deploying even newer devices that can be fired with equal accuracy from still farther away. 
Some American officers, especially older ones, have their misgivings. They say that a system of war built upon a wish to destroy the enemy without yourself suffering any significant number of casualties is inherently dangerous. Remember that 1993 disaster in Somalia. New kinds of weapons, instructed by satellites and computers, may be able to win future firefights of this sort more swiftly and at less cost to your own men; but the men will still need to be there, to occupy some vital hilltop or essential building, and they will have to be prepared to take the consequences. 
In the end, your soldiers must face the risk of being wounded or killed. Clever and brave guerrillas, fighting in places where they are hard to detect-forests or mountains or city side-streets-have to be pursued by soldiers who are not only expertly trained for such warfare but are also willing to engage the enemy at close quarters. Any adversary, when defeated, leaves behind a region which has to be occupied by your own side, to make sure he does not start the war all over again; and your occupying force is bound to suffer casualties. 
An army that believes it can avoid standing in harm's way is, say the sceptics, liable to prove perilously fragile. The coming century is going to provide plenty of crises in which deadly force, working in both directions, cannot be avoided.  1999 NATURE abhors a vacuum. So do American entrepreneurs. Consider a firm called Autopsy/Post Services (1-800-AUTOPSY), founded in 1988 by Vidal Herrera. The frequency with which autopsies are performed in America has been falling steadily for over three decades, and Mr Herrera has made his mark by leaping in to fill the void. 
Mr Herrera charges $2,000 for a complete autopsy, more if the body has been exhumed or if extra tests are ordered. Many of his customers suspect foul play or malpractice. Others have medical questions that a hospital or insurance company would not pay to have answered. Mr Herrera expects to perform roughly 800 autopsies this year; he has turned away thousands of others across the United States, and in other countries, because he could not handle them from his Los Angeles base. That problem will soon be over; in January, Autopsy/Post Services will begin selling franchises in 72 American cities and 16 countries. 
The success of 1-800-AuTOPSY aside, public-health experts are alarmed by the falling number of conventional autopsies. In 196o, roughly one in two deaths in Chicago area hospitals was followed up with an autopsy; that rate is now about one in ten. Federal data collected since 1972 show the same trend. Indeed, experts note that autopsy rates are falling around the world. 
Autopsies can be used to determine the effectiveness of surgical procedures and drug treatments. They provide accurate vital statistics, teach medical students, uncover new diseases and spot old ones that may be spreading. All the while, they sniff out incompetent medical care and the odd murder that might have passed for a slip in the bathtub. George Lundberg, editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association (AMA), points out that medical conditions such as toxic shock syndrome and congenital heart disease (as well as many others) were discovered by autopsy. Toxic shock has now been pretty much stamped out; congenital heart disease can be treated successfully with surgery. 
An autopsy is perhaps the onlyway for the dead to speak to the living. Why are Americans listening less? One reason is cost. An autopsy can run up a bill from several hundred dollars to several thousand, depending on the methodology. In the days before the health-care system began slimming down, most insurance policies covered the procedure. If not, hospitals politely picked up the tab. No longer. As Hmos, insurance companies and hospitals struggle to distribute scarce resources, they tend to favour the living over the dead. (State and local governments have the right to demand an autopsy in any case where foul play is suspected or the cause of death is unknown.) 
Autopsy, like organ donation, is a difficult subject to broach with grieving families (though the public good associated with both can help the grieving process The attending physician is the logical person to suggest a post-mortem exam; yet all too often a doctor's primary concern is covering his own gluteus maximus. An autopsy may prove a doctor wrong, or even negligent. 
Doctors with better intentions may simply believe that more sophisticated laboratory tests and imaging technology have made the autopsy redundant. Alas, they have not. A study by researchers at Louisiana State University Medical Centre used autopsies to determine that doctors missed 44% of cancerous tumours while patients were alive. Another study at the University of Pittsburgh found a 45% discordance between what clinical doctors diagnosed as the cause of death and what an autopsy later showed it to be. 
In 1988, the JAMA ran an issue round the theme: ""Declaring war on the non-autopsy"". So far, it has been more of a slow retreat. Last month, the Journal took up the torch once again. An editorial proposed a minimum autopsy rate as a condition for hospital accreditation and/or Medicare reimbursement. Meanwhile Mr Herrera, looking ahead to a bulge of dying babyboomers, foresees endless opportunities.  1999 ON AUGUST 15th, Timothy Boomer fell out of his canoe. Naturally, he cursed, using ""loudly and repeatedly . . . a most offensive vulgarity"" together with ""various derivatives"". He was in the middle of nowhere at the time, in a wilderness area of the Rifle River near the Jack Pine Trail in Michigan. Imagine his surprise, therefore, when a deputy sheriff from Arenac County promptly issued him with a ticket for swearing. 
Mr Boomer had failed to note that besides the sheriff, Kenneth Socia, and his buddies sitting on the bank, there were also a woman and two children enjoying the rustic scene within earshot of his oaths. He had therefore infringed a Michigan obscene-speech law, more than a century old, which reads: 
Sec. 337: Indecent, etc, language in presence of women-Any person who shall use any indecent, immoral, obscene, vulgar or insulting language in the presence or hearing of any woman or child shall be guilty of a misdemeanour. 
And being guilty of a misdemeanour, he faces a 90-day jail term or a $100 fine if convicted. Mr Boomer argued for dismissal of the charges, but failed, and now he is about to stand trial. 
The American Civil Liberties Union has leapt in to support him. It argues that cursing is a form of free speech, and that what was unacceptable to delicate 19thcentury ears is now commonplace; so commonplace that, Mr Boomer argues, the four women canoeing with him didn't turn a hair. The prosecutors are less forgiving. Cursing, they say, does not express an idea or a thought. What? Not even the thought that Hell! This water's cold!? Or Damn! The girls are watching!?  1999 THE scholar warms almost instantly to his theme: ""We have been so stable, apart from the Civil War, that we think it natural. Britain and the us are the only countries since 18oo not to have had their form of government changed by violence. You take stability as a given, when in fact it's a rarity."" In other words, let the Senate be wary when it sets about the trial of Bill Clinton. 
It is a good point, seldom heard in the impeachment blather that has filled America's airwaves for the past year. But the scholar is Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the senior Democratic senator for New York, and perhaps his voice, his manner, his lateral leaps of creative reasoning are a shade too eccentric to make him a talk-show regular. True, he has made more than two dozen appearances on NBC's ""Meet the Press""-but over 31 years. Most recently, just after Christmas, he managed to quote off-the-cuff not just from Shakespeare's ""Troilus and Cressida"" (""Lechery, lechery; still, wars and lechery: nothing else holds fashion"") but also from Dr Johnson. These are not the sound-bites of normal television. 
But Mr Moynihan is not a normal politician. Michael Barone, one of America's finest political pundits, describes him as ""the nation's best thinker among politicians since Lincoln and its best politician among thinkers since Jefferson."" Of the thinking, there is no doubt. Most senators stuff their offices with photos of themselves meeting other important people. This senator stuffs his with books-not just his own (18 at the latest count) but also the Encyclopaedia Judaica, the International Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences, bound volumes of the Public Interest, back issues of Political Science Quarterly, and so on. On the mantlepiece is a lunch invitation from the Maharajah of Jodhpur(Mr Moynihan is, after all, a former ambassador to India, as well as to the UN). In short, the office is a don's delight, and Mr Moynihan-large sherry glass in hand, jaunty bow-tie not quite matching the breast-pocket handkerchief-suits it perfectly. 
But what of the politics? In the age of the professional politician, can the Barone superlative really fit a man whose working life has been spent flitting back and forth between academia (Tufts, Harvard, Oxford, the London School of Economics) and public service (posts under Presidents Kennedy,Johnson, Nixon and Ford)? Is Mr Moynihan not just a clever, witty Jack-of-alltrades, with all that the cliche implies? 
Actually, no. One simple reason is that the best politicians are those who get re-elected, and Mr Moynihan, even though he ""hates"" raising campaign money and presses to reform the system, is now in his fourth term in the Senate. They are also those who get things done, which in Mr Moynihan's case means not just some solid environmental and social legislation but also what is now known as ""Ice-Tea"", the 1991 Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, which-not by coincidence-has channelled billions of dollars of public spending to New York's road and rail systems. 
But the best justification for the Barone superlative is that, despite appearances, there is an unbroken thread running through the Moynihan career: an interest in governance. The senator is a policy wonk with the political skills, regularly applied across party lines, to put ideas into practice. Witness his far-sighted study of 1965, ""The Negro Family"", in which he emphasised the connection between fatherless families and increased welfare rolls. Although it was largely ignored at the time, that study led to the 1988 Welfare Reform Act, which for the first time recognised a father's duty to support his children (and a mother's responsibility to find a job). 
What, then, does he think of the 1996 ""welfare-to-work"" reforms, which limit federal handouts to a lifetime total of five years? Not a lot, is the short answer: no one knows what will happen when people fall off the ""five-year cliff"". Perhaps his fears of social distress-he points out that 97% of births to teenage mothers in Washington, Dc, are out of wedlock-will prove groundless. But perhaps not. After all, the reason the eccentric Mr Moynihan is so respected is that he has so often been right. He was, for example, the first to mock CIA assessments of the strength of the Soviet Union, arguing that it was bound to disintegrate under the pressure of its ethnic differences. He was possibly the first to apply epidemiological theory to drugs policy (noting that their illegality promotes crime, he coined the phrase ""iatrogenic government"", comparing government to a doctor whose intrusion only makes a patient worse). And he was an early critic of the Clintons' abortive 1993 effort to reform health care, arguing that with five out of six Americans covered by health insurance, and with free or subsidised care provided for the poor and elderly, the true crisis was not in the health system but the welfare system. 
So is he right in his warnings about impeachment? Is it true, as he told ""Meet the Press"", that ""we could so easily mutate into a president of the month"", with a congressional majority ""routinely removing presidents"" and House speakers therefore becoming presidents? He admits the prospect is hard to imagine, but it is still wise to assure institutional stability. The voice rises in volume and, with an exaggerated roll of the ""r"", the senator points out that the founding fathers talked of ""treason"" as a reason to remove a president from office, not the sins of Mr Clinton. 
But it is getting late; the tutorial must end; the second tumbler of sherry must be regretfully declined. Outside, Pennsylvania Avenue-beautified at the senator's initiative-is almost deserted. What a pity, thinks the student, that the professor, risen from a fatherless childhood in New York's Hell's Kitchen to become a seemingly permanent star of the Senate, should be intent on retiring in 2000. Mr Moynihan roars with laughter: ""Good God, man. It's my teeth, my lower back, and it was understood with my wife at the last election that I wouldn't stand again."" But what a pity, all the same.  1999 Forty years of revolutionary fervour have left Cuba's economy in ruins and its future uncertain. But Fidel Castro remains unchallenged 
ON JANUARY 1st, Cubans celebrated not only the beginning of 1999, but the 40th anniversary of Fidel Castro's revolution. There does not seem much to celebrate. The economy is in a mess. Corruption is rife. Prostitution is rampant. Despite police or neighbourhood watchdogs on every street corner, crime is rising. The country's infrastructure is crumbling. The grand promises of the past 40 years are in tatters. In some ways, Cuba seems worse off in 1999 than it was in 1959. And yet, curiously, the chief author of these misfortunes, Mr Castro himself, still retains a place in the heart of most Cubans. 
Mr Castro claims he has no power, only great authority. This is bogus. Outspoken critics end up in jail or exile. And yet Fidelas he is almost universally known-is not loathed as are most other dictators. There are no statues to him, no buildings named after him, no Saddam-style posters. Instead, Fidel's monuments are six-hour speeches and television and radio coverage of his every public word, thought and deed. Most Cubans are inured to this constant stream of bombast, tolerating it with a shrug. Many feel affection for the man who has stood up for so long to the United States. In the countryside, he is even loved by some, especially by older Cubans, despite their country's impoverishment, which can at least be partly blamed on the Yanqui blockade. 
Most people know that Fidel's original socialist dream has long been dead, and they want changes. But they are also wary of what full-blooded western capitalism might bring. They do not want to lose the ""gains of the revolution""-a welfare state, free education and health care. These are real achievements for such a relatively poor country, although the country's dismal economy has now crippled all three. Many would like to see Fidel retire gracefully. Few are keen on a violent overthrow. 
Intelligent, capable, capricious, Mr Castro retains almost total control over every aspect of government-which is the biggest reason why the country is in such a mess. In the words of one restaurant owner: ""As soon as something begins to work, it is halted. As soon as anything becomes profitable, it is stopped."" 
After a series of crackdowns on private sector activity, Cubans have become wary and secretive. Most do not keep bank accounts (because the government would then know how much money they have). The black economy is huge, and more efficient than the state sector. But it corrodes certain values and is undermining the public sector itself. Doctors steal drugs from hospitals to sell for dollars. State stores and markets are surrounded by people selling pilfered goods. 
The sugar harvest in 1998, beset by a series of weather disasters, was 3.zm tonnes: the smallest crop in 50 years. Hit by low prices for sugar and nickel, Cuba's main products, the country's overall exports fell by ii% while imports grew by 6%. Its trade deficit was over $2 billion in 1997. Once the final figures are calculated for 1998, the total trade deficit is likely to be far worse. 
When Mr Castro took power, he based development on the ""three pillars of the Cuban revolution"": health, education and industrialisation. The Cuban economy now rests on just two pillars: tourism-Cuba's biggest hard-currency earner-and Miami. Money sent by Cuban exiles to relations in Cuba is now estimated to bring the island over $1 billion a year in cash alone, more than Cuba earns from sugar exports. 
As the 40th-anniversary speeches drone on, two questions will be on most Cubans' minds: how will the reign of Fidel come to an end, and what will happen when he goes? Of course, most people want a peaceful change of power. This is most likely if Mr Castro hands it over willingly. The ""Pinochet scenario"" is often discussed sotto voce, but it is unlikely to happen largely because Mr Castro is not the kind of man to stand aside. Moreover, General Pinochet's detention in Britain shows that it may no longer be safe to be a former dictator, at least a travelling one. 
It is more likely that Mr Castro, now aged 72, will die in harness, ranting and speechifying to his last breath. Unfortunately for Cuba's future, he is in good health, despite rumours to the contrary. If he does die in office, with no effort at a transition to democratic rule, Cubans could face the violence and political chaos they fear the most. The designated heir is General Raul Castro, Fidel's brother and head of the armed forces. But he is not popular, and is only five years younger than Fidel. Few think he would be able to hold on to power for long. A small group of technocrats who have occasionally succeeded in persuading a reluctant Mr Castro to loosen economic controls might gain power and then ease Cuba towards democracy. But the chances ofthis happening do not look high. With Fidel's passing, such technocrats are likely to lose all authority. 
However Mr Castro departs, his successors will immediately face not only pentup demands at home, but also demands for the return of property seized by the Castro government, or for compensation. Ownership of oil refineries, hotels, farmland, nickel mines-all currently run by foreign investors-is claimed by American citizens or Cuban exiles. Many houses, now occupied by several families, and many buildings that have been turned into schools or hospitals, once belonged to people who are now living in Miami. For this reason alone, the return of the exiles from Miami is dreaded by many Cubans. Their anxiety has been ruthlessly exploited by the regime, but it is real nonetheless. 
Forty years of being dominated by one loquacious, erratic man has left Cubans with a ruined economy, disintegrating public services and an uncertain future. With no plausible political heirs in sight, no credible opposition and an exile community itching not only for return, but revenge, Cubans are right to fear chaos or even civil war after Mr Castro goes. Not much of a legacy, nor much to celebrate.  1999 IT WAS not supposed to be like this. When Fernando Henrique Cardoso persuaded his country's Congress to overturn a constitutional ban on incumbents seeking reelection, he seemed to have the credentials to enter history not just as the man who had vanquished his country's chronic inflation, but as a great modernising leader of a kind Brazil had not seen for three decades. 
He may yet achieve such stature But, as he starts his second term on January 1st, Brazil's prospects are gloomy, and fraught with risk. Mr Cardoso had once hoped that his second term would be devoted to social and political reform-the president is, after all, a social democrat in an unequal and unjust country. Instead, Mr Cardoso must grapple with the pressing unfinished business of his first term: shoring up the country's precarious economic and financial stability. 
That involves swiftly completing the task of getting Congress to approve a huge fiscal squeeze, involving tax increases and spending cuts amounting to 28 billion reais ($23.5 billion) and aimed at cutting the fiscal deficit from 8% of GDP in 1998 to around 4.7% in 1999. That is the main condition of the $41.5 billion rescue package which the IMF agreed to in November, and which the government hopes will restore confidence in Brazil's economic policies. 
Success would mean that in a year's time Brazil might emerge from recession with its economy fundamentally strengthened. Failure would mean not just a forced devaluation of Brazil's currency, but would also damage Mr Cardoso's credibility, perhaps irreparably. Since August, his government has spent over $30 billion in reserves defending the real, and its defence was the platform on which he won the presidential election in October. But even if Mr Cardoso succeeds in making fiscal austerity stick, Brazil is clearly facing a hard year in 1999. 
As expected, Mr Cardoso's team has not radically changed. Of 31 ministers and secretaries, 23 served in the first administration. The dozen front-line ministers to keep their jobs include Pedro Malan, the finance minister and architect of the IMF agreement, whose position has grown steadily stronger as the economy has weakened. 
A sign of this is Mr Cardoso's choice of Celso Lafer to head a new Ministry of Development, which will handle industrial policy. The creation of this ministry is intended to make fiscal austerity more politically palatable. It is seen as a potential source of alternative policies by those, such as FIESP, the Sao Paulo industrialists' federation, who dislike Mr Malan's orthodoxies and would prefer devaluation, lower interest rates and higher tariffs. Yet Mr Lafer is unlikely to oblige them. Though once a director of a family metal-bashing firm, and the cousin of FIESP'S energetic new chairman, Mr Lafer is an academic whose last job was as Brazil's ambassador to the World Trade Organisation. He lacks the political clout, and probably the inclination, to challenge Mr Malan. 
Mr Cardoso has left the main social ministries in the hands of his own Social Democratic Party. Paulo Renato de Souza stays as education minister, a job he has held for four years-a rare and effective example of continuity in a crucial area that is often poorly administered in Latin America. Like Jose Serra, the health minister, his task is now to make a smaller budget go further. A dozen other ministers owe theirjobs to Mr Cardoso's need to satisfy his allies in his four-party, centre-right coalition. The president has made it plain that to keep their jobs they have to deliver votes in Congress for the austerity measures. 
Marshalling its broad but unreliable majority in Congress remains the government's biggest challenge. According to David Fleischer,a political scientist at the University of Brasilia, the big winner in the new team (apart from Mr Malan) is Clovis Carvalho, the presidents chief of staff. A plan to set up a new Ministry of Government, which would have handled political liaison and encroached on Mr Carvalho's turf, has come to nothing. 
But Mr Carvalho is widely disliked in Congress. Already, the government's failings in this area have cost it dearly. Poor liaison with Congress was the main reason for two setbacks in the implementation of the fiscal package. The first was the defeat last month of a law increasing civil servants' pension contributions, an unpopular but essential measure. The second was the government's delay in presenting a bill to extend and increase a tax on bank cheques. These setbacks could cost the government up to to billion reais in 1999, and they have already set off a new round of jitters in the financial markets. 
All is not yet lost. On December 3oth, the government announced emergency tax rises and spending cuts aimed at raising 6.7 billion reais. The new Congress elected in October, which starts work in February, may be more tractable. Mr Fleischer points out that about 50 of the more notorious backsliders in the ruling coalition will not be returning. In due course, the government will try again to get approval for higher pension contributions. 
But time is short. At the end of February, the In.iF will make its first check on Brazil's progress. The financial markets will make their own, and probably more rigorous, judgment. By then, the government must take credible steps to make austerity stick. Otherwise, Mr Cardoso risks going into history as the leader who, by failing to give firm fiscal underpinning to the real, squandered Brazil's best development opportunity in more than a generation.  1999 Facing a strengthened opposition, India's ruling party confronts progress 
MOTHER TERESA was no saint but a Christian zealot who terrorised those who refused to convert. Amartya Sen was slightly more deserving of his Nobel prize (for economics), but the mass literacy he champions would seduce Hindus away from their religion. These startling views come from Ashok Singhal, president of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (World Hindu Council). That Christians make up a tiny (2.3%) share of India's population makes the remarks even more bizarre. But they count for something. At virtually the same time Mr Singhal was sounding off, Hindu militants were attacking Christians and their churches in the western state of Gujarat. Mr Singhal's group is an influential associate of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), which leads a family of Hindunationalist groups to which the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), India's ruling party, also belongs. 
The sJP seems embarrassed. It governs Gujarat and the attacks are continuing. On December 3oth mobs set fire to two Roman Catholic prayer halls. Though far from communal violence at its worst, the attacks undermine the party's boast that minorities are secure where it rules and feed the claim of a resurgent opposition that the sJP is the party of intolerance. The sJP-led government has sent officials to Gujarat to investigate. 
All great political parties have wings and fringes, sJs-men point out. Look at New and Old Labour in Britain and America's Republican Party, which encompasses flat-taxers and fundamentalists, internationalists and isolationists. But there is a difference. Most successful parties suborn ideology to the achievement of power. The BJP, on the other hand, is the creation of an ideological brotherhood that regards politics as the handmaiden of culture and religion. It is as if the Republican Party were the political wing of a less benign version of the Christian Coalition. That deformity is hobbling India's government. 
So far, mostly in economic policy. Following the BJP's humiliation in three state elections in November, it briefly looked as if the party's pragmatists would tame the ideologues of the RSS. The prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, shuffled his cabinet and appointed allies not beloved ofthe Rss. The winter session of Parliament was supposed to show that the BJP could govern in spite of tensions within the Rss and among the 18 parties in the ruling coalition. 
It proved no such thing. The government had wanted to pass some 40 bills; in the event just 17 were introduced to the lower house of Parliament and just 14 were passed. Among the casualties were two much-touted economic reform bills, one to open insurance to competition and foreign investment, the other to curb piracy of patented products. Both measures attracted opposition, some of it from trade unionists, who regard competition as a threat to jobs, some of it from left-wing parties allergic to liberalisation. But the opposition that mattered most came from the BjP's own swadeshi (buy Indian) lobby, which takes its cue from the Rss rather than from Mr Vajpayee. Both bills stalled. Though the government now talks of starting the next session of Parliament early to get them passed, it remains to be seen whether the swadeshi lobby will allow this. 
The BJP has had more luck keeping the blandishments of Mr Singhal and people like him from becoming national policy. The large number of parties in the coalition, in most respects a hindrance to good government, have supplied Mr Vajpayee with an excuse. The coalition's governing manifesto drops significant portions of the Hindu-nationalist wish-list, such as the call to end the autonomy granted under the constitution to Jammu & Kashmir, India's only Muslim-majority state. Proximity to power has mellowed even the home minister, LK. Advani, the ideologues' most powerful friend in government. On December 6th, six years after the Babri mosque in Ayodhya was demolished by Hindu militants, he called its destruction ""singularly unfortunate"". His regret is an affront to the RSS'S saffron brigades, whose dearest wish is to build a temple on what they believe to be the birthplace of the god Ram. 
To Christians such sentiments ring hollow. Yet the BJP must at least pretend to disavow the ideologues to retain power. It is not that Hindus reject Hindutva, the notion that India is defined by its Hindu way of life. According to a recent poll in India Today, most Indians support Hindutva nostrums, such as the compulsory singing in schools of ""Vande Mataram"", a patriotic song offensive to some Muslims. But not fervently enough to overlook the BJP's failings in government. Indians fault the BJP for the blundering of the hydraheaded coalition it leads and a rise in the price of onions and other staples. They think the opposition Congress party would provide more stable and competent government. The poll suggested that if an election were called now, Congress would trounce the BJP. 
The BJP cannot recoup by fanning communal tensions. One reason Congress did well in November's state elections was that minorities, especially Muslims, returned to their traditional support of the party after a period of disenchantment. A BJP-inspired outbreak of communal violence would drive many Hindus in the same direction. Most of the party's leaders, though not Rss die-hards, realise that it would confirm the B's inability to govern. 
Achieving such enlightenment on economic reform is harder. There are few votes in promoting the interests of foreign insurers and pharmaceutical firms, the most ob vious beneficiaries of insurance and patent legislation. When the executive committee of the BJP meets in Bangalore on January 2nd and 3rd, Mr Vajpayee will try to persuade his colleagues that such reforms also belong to the compulsions of power. The Hindu-nationalist family is being made to swallow a show of tolerance in Delhi, if not in Gujarat. Can it be forced to swallow progress as well?  1999 YET another government has collapsed in the Himalayan kingdom of Nepal. The latest political crisis arose when the prime minister, Girija Prasad Koirala, resigned after one of his partners pulled out of the ruling coalition. Though Mr Koirala has put together a new coalition and was reappointed to the prime ministership by King Birendra on December 23rd, the new government-the sixth since the last general election in 1994-will not last long either: Mr Koirala hopes to win approval from parliament on January 14th for an election in April. 
Nepal has been struggling to establish a stable form of multi-party government since April 199o, when a pro-democracy movement obliged King Birendra to end his almost absolute rule and become a constitutional monarch. Since no single party has been able to count on a majority, all sorts of ideologically incompatible coalitions have been formed. In order to encompass a wide range of parties, they have often been burdened with huge cabinets (one had 48 ministers). 
Mr Koirala's latest coalition includes one of Nepal's two main communist parties, the United Marxist Leninist Party (which is not really much to the left of the prime minister's centrist Nepali Congress Party). The outgoing partner in the previous coalition was the other main communist group which, confusingly, also calls itself the Marxist Leninists. The coalition also includes the Nepal Sadbhavana, a regional party. The prime minister has managed to keep his cabinet to just ni members-one of them, for the first time in eight years, a nominee of the king. 
Since Nepal has seen so much political paralysis, the euphoria that accompanied the end of the king's rule in one of the world's poorest countries has long faded. ""We are just muddling through,"" says Sridhar Khatri, a professor of political science at Tribhuvan University in Katmandu. ""There is no political architecture emerging."" Some blame a Supreme Court ruling that has prevented several prime ministers from dissolving parliament and holding an election. That has obliged politicians to stay in power on the basis of opportunistic agreements. 
Will the new poll produce a clear winner? Opinion differs. Some people argue that the Nepali Congress Party has a good chance ofwinning a majority because it is now more united. Others foresee yet another hung parliament. 
The result may well depend on how Nepal's communists divide their votes among the various parties. A Maoist group could also disrupt the election. It is involved in an increasingly bloody insurgency, which has claimed over 400 lives since it began in February 1996.  1999 SENIOR Khmer Rouge leaders have apologised, for the first time, for the suffering they caused between 1975 and 1979 when some 1.7m people are reckoned to have died during the movement's reign of terror. Speaking to reporters in Phnom Penh, Khieu Samphan, aged 67, the former nominal leader of the Khmers Rouges, was asked if he had regrets about what they had done. He replied, ""Yes, sorry, very sorry."" Sitting alongside him, looking uneasy, was Nuon Chea, aged 71, the movement's chief ideologue, and Brother Number Two to Pol Pot, who died in the jungle in 1998. Silent for most of the 3o-minute press conference, he offered a rather bizarre apology: for the deaths of animals as well as people. ""They all died because we wanted to win the war,"" he said. 
Suggestions that the pair should stand trial before an international tribunal for crimes against humanity were brushed aside. Mr Samphan said the outside world should let Cambodia solve its own problems. ""Let bygones be bygones,"" he said, repeating the dismissivewords used byprevious Khmer Rouge defectors. He did, however, acknowledge the bitterness felt by many Cambodians whose families had been murdered. He had experienced their anger at first hand in 1991 when he narrowly escaped lynching after returning to Phnom Penh from a meeting in Paris to bring a formal end to the civil war. 
This time there was no lynch mob. The casual observer might have been forgiven for thinking the two men were diplomats enjoying vip treatment. They were warmly welcomed by the prime minister, Hun Sen, on December 29th at his residence on the outskirts of the Cambodian capital, and treated to lunch. They have been staying at a luxury hotel, equipped with a swimming pool, tennis courts and golf range. 
Mr Hun Sen indicated that it was unlikely that the pair would have to face trial for crimes against humanity. He said such a trial would be divisive and might mean a return to civil war. His argument has not been well received by many Cambodians. Allowing rank-and-file former Khmers Rouges to make new lives without punishment is mainly accepted. But there is opposition to such tolerance being extended to Pol Pot's henchmen. Many Cambodians say they are not concerned so much about retribution. But they believe a trial might throw light on why the Khmers Rouges sought to bring such misery to the country. 
King Sihanouk, sensing growing public anger over the soft treatment of the pair, has now said that he would not be willing to grant an amnesty to the two men. In part, that is academic. Neither man has yet been charged with anything. For his part, King Sihanouk has said he believes any international court would have the ""perfect right"" to take up the case of genocide in Cambodia. Two years ago, the king, under pressure from the Cambodian government, pardoned leng Sary, who had once been Pol Pofs foreign minister, but had more recently become a useful go-between in arranging defections. In 1979 he had been sentenced to death, in his absence, for genocide. Prince Sihanouk, as he was, briefly held the office of head of state under the Khmers Rouges. He was virtually a prisoner in his palace but may be embarrassed by the connection to the regime. 
Human-rights groups also believe that Mr Samphan and Mr Nuon Chea should be brought to trial. They bear responsibility for many of the Khmers Rouges' misdeeds, and the groups say it is important to break Cambodia's ""culture of impunity"", where killers go free while petty thieves without protection from powerful people are jailed.  1999 China was supposed to be growing more tolerant of dissent. It isn't 
THE authorities dithered for months, then showed their mailed fist. Orga-, nisers of the first, open opposition to Communist rule, the Chinese Democratic Party, which declared itself last summer by attempting to register in 14 provinces and big cities, were rounded up in late November. On December 21st, Xu Wenli, a veteran of the Democracy Wall movement of 1978-79, began a 13-year sentence for ""attempting to overthrow the state"". At least he was allowed a lawyer, through whom he smuggled out a note declaring that his ""so-called open trial was in truth nothing more than a means for political persecution"". 
Qin Yongmin and Wang Youcai were denied legal defence. Mr Qin, another Democracy Wall veteran, was jailed for 12 years and Mr Wang, a student leader at the time of the Tiananmen protests in 1989, got ii years. In case the message of Communist intolerance was still not clear, on December 27th, Zhang Shanguang was sent to prison for ten years for giving Radio Free Asia, financed by America, details of farmers' protests in central Hunan province. 
Western governments have delivered unusually forceful protests. But anger is overlaid with embarrassment. After all, the same Chinese leaders who decided upon the stiff sentences are those whose backs are slapped at international gatherings for their economic sophistication. And much has been made by Bill Clinton's administration of the new policy of engagement rather than confrontation with China over human rights. For a time, success appeared to be at hand. China's two most prominent jailed dissidents were released into American care, Wei Jingsheng in 1997 and Wang Dan in April 1998. A third, Liu Nianchun, was released on medical grounds to America on December 22th. 
Mr Clinton's state visit last June seemed to coincide with a new air of tolerance in China, a thaw warm enough to be termed a ""Beijing spring"". Just last October China signed (but did not ratify) the United Nations covenant on civil and political rights. Now the engagement scorecard looks less impressive: three dissidents released, but four others newly sent to prison. Though China may well see these as future chips (their exile in return for western concessions in other fields), America will find it harder to justify such Faustian bargains. 
Some in western governments hope a rod can be held to China's back with the annual UN review of its human-rights record. In the past China has dissuaded the Geneva panel from passing judgment. Success this time cannot be assured. But China either thinks that a damning at the UN can be avoided as usual, as western criticism gives way to commercial self-interest, or that a rebuke is worth bearing. 
Either way, China's leaders will not put international outrage above any internal threats to their iron rule. The proletariat and peasantry, whom they claim to represent, pose a restive threat to ""stability"", as iron-rice-bowl jobs are lost and new jobs are hard to find. Some western analysts think that China's economy is through the worst of its troubles. Indeed, on December 3oth the government announced the economy had grown by a remarkable 7.8% in 1998-not far short of the 8% target that China's leaders had ""guaranteed"". But Chinese statistics are not reliable, and the growth figures have been hugely inflated. 
Moreover, the coming year is full of events whose political symbolism the party alone must define, among them the 5oth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic and the return of Macau, a Portuguese enclave, to the ""motherland"". The jailing of dissidents is just one way the Chinese government is setting the tone. 
President Jiang Zemin has recently given stern speeches promising to nip dissent ""in the bud"". Fresh threats have been issued to workers thinking of organising independently. New rules threaten film directors, singers and software developers with life imprisonment if they ""endanger national security"". And on the edges of China's empire, the rhetoric has been turned up. In the western province of Xinjiang, the party secretary declares that the situation there is getting ""acute and complicated"", justification for hardline vigilance. 
The combination of a new political chill together with evidence of delay in some of China's most pressing economic reforms has shaken the assumptions of many western observers. Some have even begun to wonder aloud whether China's ""reform period"" is drawing to a close. But nothing has really changed. Since the Tiananmen threat to one-party rule, the Communists' determination ought not to have been in doubt: reforms and greater openness of expression, though welcome in principle, will not willingly be allowed at the expense of Communist authority.  1999 More bombast than policy on both sides as America and Britain confront Iraq 
IT IS easier to start a fight with Iraq than to end one. So America and Britain discovered when they called off their four-day bombing campaign against Iraq on December 19th, only to find the Iraqis taking repeated pot-shots at their pilots ten days later amid a row over the ""no-fly zones"" that cover half the country. So, indeed, the past eight years have shown, as successive American and British governments have enforced the sanctions imposed on Iraq after it invaded Kuwait in 199o. Has the latest episode brought a conclusion any closer? 
The bombing did put an end, at least for the time being, to the work of Unscom, the United Nations body charged with disposing of Iraq's deadliest weapons. In the wake of the American and British attack, Iraq announced that the arms inspectors, who had fled the country hours before the bombing began, would not be allowed back. 
Never fear, insisted American officials, their bombs had made a significant dent in Saddam Hussein's weapons programmes. General Henry Shelton, America's top soldier, announced that nine Iraqi missile factories had been put out of operation ""for at least a year"", while his British counterpart proudly described the destruction of special aircraft designed to spray biological and chemical stuff. The two powers also claimed to have blitzed barracks, ministries, presidential palaces and various factories that might otherwise, they said, have been put to nefarious purposes. 
But the Iraqis are dab hands at hiding their assets, as Unscom's inspectors have long complained. They shrugged off the attacks, insisting, quite credibly, that most of the destroyed buildings had already been emptied of men and machinery. One serving Unscom inspector questioned the usefulness of the bombing; he might also have asked why, if America and Britain knew where to find Mr Hussein's secret weapons, they had not let the inspectors know. 
Much of the rest of the world was equally unimpressed. Russia's President Boris Yeltsin called the strikes ""illegal and senseless"" and briefly recalled his ambassadors from America and Britain. France protested by pulling its aircraft out of the force that has been patrolling the no-fly zone over southern Iraq (it had earlier withdrawn from the northern patrol) Arabs took to the streets throughout the Middle East, storming the American embassy in Damascus and demonstrating in Rabat. Their embarrassed governments protested more mutedly, but did complain that the bombing had undermined any hope of persuading Iraq to co-operate with the UN and thus be rehabilitated into the world. 
America and Britain retort that they are as keen as everyone else to sort out the whole mess. After they called off their bombers, they produced a new five-point strategy for dealing with Iraq. They will keep up their threat of force, encourage the Iraqi opposition, try to get inspections under way again, step up patrols of the Gulf against sanctions-busting smugglers and launch a diplomatic offensive to bring the world round to their point of view. 
As energetic as all this sounds, it amounts to almost nothing. Mr Hussein has weathered many bombings, and doubtless thinks he can survive a few more. The Iraqi opposition is laughable, and the $97m earmarked for it by America even more so (each of the 325 cruise missiles fired at Iraq during the bombing campaign cost $1.2m) America's only plan to get the inspectors back into Iraq is to refuse to lift sanctions until they have finished their work. Although smugglers do get round the sanctions, they do so chiefly through Iran and Syria, where America has little influence, or through Turkey, where it winks at the infractions. And America is already trying to persuade the rest of the world to swallow its Iraqi policy, with ever-dwindling success. Essentially, America and Britain plan to let Iraq stew. 
The Iraqis complain that they have been left to stew painfully for eight years under the most all-encompassing sanctions in history, with no hope of a reprieve. All along Mr Hussein has tried to protest and prod until the international consensus on sanctions falls apart. Although frustrating Unscom was his favourite means of attracting attention, he is already testing new methods of challenging America's stranglehold. The current spate of attacks on aircraft in the no-fly zone, or his renewed threat to end the UN's humanitarian programme, could both bring about a new crisis. 
So far, no country has broken ranks and openly defied the sanctions, although several-especially the Arab states-have called for their lifting. But with Unscom out of action, it will become ever harder for the Americans to argue that the unending embargo is designed to enforce the internationally accepted aim of arms control, rather than to serve America's and Britain's interest in keeping Mr Hussein (together with the unfortunate Iraqi people) contained in a cage. Iraq has complained that Arab foreign ministers delayed a meeting to discuss the situation at the behest of such good American allies as Saudi Arabia. They are unlikely to delay for ever.  1999 ISRAEL'S parliament, the Knesset, having deposed Binyamin Netanyahu and dissolved itself, has now decided on a ludicrously long election campaign of nearly five months. The vote will take place on May 17th, with the likely run-off vote for prime minister to be held on June ist. 
The decision to drag it out-the law allows for an election within two monthscame in consultations this week between Mr Netanyahu's Likud and the opposition Labour Party, led by Ehud Barak. Both are seriously rattled by the meteoric rise to the top of the opinion polls of Amnon LipkinShahak, the recently retired army chief of staff. Mr Shahak, blue-eyed and soft-spoken, has yet formally to declare his candidacy for prime minister, at the head of a new centrist party. But he is already attracting defectors from both the big parties, as well as promises of support from businessmen. Mr Netanyahu and Mr Barak both hope that Mr Shahak has peaked too soon and that a long and costly campaign will exhaust his appeal. 
Some in the peace camp, including Israel's convention-flouting president, Ezer Weizman, fear that Mr Barak (also a former chief of staff) and Mr Shahak will exhaust each other, with Mr Netanyahu reaping the benefit. But others argue that Mr Shahak's candidacy could help draw those traditionally opposed to Labour away from the Likud candidate in the first round. Then, if Mr Netanyahu and Mr Barak made it to the run-off, Mr Shahak would urge his supporters to back Mr Barak. If Mr Shahak got through, Mr Barak would obviously support him against Mr Netanyahu. And a strong showing by the centrist party in the vote for the Knesset, say the optimists, might give Mr Barak or Mr Shahak, if either won the prime ministership, the chance to set up a broad coalition without the Likud. 
Mr Barak's need to break down the old voting patterns has prompted him to offer a haven to Mr Netanyahu's former foreign minister, David Levy, one of the many politicians to have become unmoored in the storm.A month ago, Mr Netanyahu suggested that Mr Levy should return to the Likud, and to the cabinet, as minister of finance. But they argued, both over policy and over the reabsorption of Mr Levy's breakaway Gesher faction into the mother-party. Now Mr Levy, once a bricklayer and always a champion of the have-nots, has turned to Labour, saying that Mr Barak is ""the only candidate speaking clearly"" on social issues. 
Mr Barak hopes that Mr Levy's advent will persuade others in the Labour Party not to bolt for the centre-though the Labour air is thick with restless threats. In the Likud, the bolting has begun. Dan Meridor, whom Mr Netanyahu forced out of his cabinet a year ago, has left the party and announced his candidacy for prime minister as a centrist (he and Mr Shahak will eventually decide between them who will be the candidate and who the number two). And Benny Begin, also once a minister under Mr Netanyahu, has proclaimed a new party of the right, loyal to the Likud's nowcompromised belief in Greater Israel, with himself as its leader and candidate for prime minister. 
Mr Netanyahu is now desperately trying to dissuade the popular minister of defence, Yitzhak Mordechai, and the lone woman in his cabinet, Limor Livnat, from joining the centrists. He is also troubled by hints from the foreign minister, Ariel Sharon, his staunchest ally in recent months, that ""in special circumstances"" he would consider standing for prime minister. 
Mr Netanyahu is not done for yet. He surged from behind to defeat Shimon Peres in 1996, and this time he is both the underdog and the incumbent. His brand of raw rhetoric on the hustings and his manipulative skills should thrive in these conditions. 
But his failure to keep Mr Meridor and Mr Begin inside his depleted tent could prove fatal. These two, both princes of the Likud blood (Mr Meridor's father was a comrade-in-arms of Menachem Begin, the party's founder), and both widely respected for their honesty, will be pounding away throughout the campaign at Mr Netanyahu's weakest spot: his credibility. His way of winning power, and then holding together a creaky coalition for 30 months, has been to tell people, all people, whatever they wanted to hear. Now, with elections approaching, they are comparing notes.  1999 ISRAEL'S parliament, the Knesset, having deposed Binyamin Netanyahu and dissolved itself, has now decided on a ludicrously long election campaign of nearly five months. The vote will take place on May 17th, with the likely run-off vote for prime minister to be held on June ist. 
The decision to drag it out-the law allows for an election within two monthscame in consultations this week between Mr Netanyahu's Likud and the opposition Labour Party, led by Ehud Barak. Both are seriously rattled by the meteoric rise to the top of the opinion polls of Amnon LipkinShahak, the recently retired army chief of staff. Mr Shahak, blue-eyed and soft-spoken, has yet formally to declare his candidacy for prime minister, at the head of a new centrist party. But he is already attracting defectors from both the big parties, as well as promises of support from businessmen. Mr Netanyahu and Mr Barak both hope that Mr Shahak has peaked too soon and that a long and costly campaign will exhaust his appeal.

His way of winning power, and then holding together a creaky coalition for 30 months, has been to tell people, all people, whatever they wanted to hear. Now, with elections approaching, they are comparing notes.  1999 HELL and heaven are separated by a 20minute drive along clogged streets. The centre of Angola's capital, Luanda, is a wasteland of piled-up rubbish, broken pavements and broken people; amputees from the war and its landmines beg at every corner. At the United Nations base on the outskirts of Luanda, freshly watered herbaceous borders run between rows of mobile homes. To keep the UN bureaucrats healthy and happy there are tennis courts and a swimming pool plus an all-American bar where beer can be bought only with dollars. 
The government blames this haven of peace for the resurgence of the country's civil war in early December, venomously attacking the UN Observer Mission in Angola for incompetence. It claims that, if the UN had been doing its job properly, Jonas Savimbi, the UNITA rebel leader, would not have been able to stockpile weapons when, under the terms of the 1994 Lusaka protocol, he should have been handing them in. 
They have a point. The UN's strategy was to make the most of the peace process in order to keep it going. UN officials regularly announced how many weapons had been handed in and how many soldiers and rebels were being demobilised at UN assembly points. No matter that many of the weapons were rusty and many ofthe UNITA ""soldiers"" at the centres were mere boys recruited a few weeks before. 
But if the UN failed to spot Mr Savimbi's shopping habits in the world's arms markets, it also failed to draw attention to the government's crude lack of interest in a true peace. In territory abandoned by UNITA, where people were desperate for food and medicine, the government instead sent in thuggish policemen who, without supplies of their own, stole the last local food stocks. 
On December 5th, the Angolan army attacked UNITA'S strongholds at Andulo and Bailundo in the central highlands. At the same time, the ruling MPLA party, holding its annual congress in Luanda, replaced many veteran members with more military-minded men. The shuffle clearly signalled all-out war: the party bosses were hoping to plant the government flag in the heart of the territory that Mr Savimbi once held. 
Most thought that would be easy. The rebels have no outside allies left. They are supposedly cut off by UN sanctions from both weapons suppliers and diamond buyers, and they have been weakened by attacks on their rear bases in Congo. But Mr Savimbi's forces proved stronger than expected and, by December 9th, UNITA was announcing that the government forces were in retreat ""having been beaten at their own game"". They were sent reeling as far as Kuito, which UNITA seemed on the point of seizing. Except that, at that point, the rebels ran out of petrol. 
Angola makes $2 billion-3 billion a year from oil, and UNITA usually has no difficulty finding supplies. This time, however, the rebels did not expect to find themselves advancing so fast. Like everyone else, they had overestimated government strength, and underestimated their own. 
This gave the government a chance to regroup. The rebels set about shelling Kuito and fierce fighting is reported in Bie and Huambo provinces. On December 26th a uN-chartered flight with four crew and ten UN officials crashed near Huambo. Both sides accuse the other of shooting it down. 
Four days after the crash, the UN'S special representative, Issa Diallo, was still trying to get a local ceasefire to allow a search mission to look for survivors. The government said the aircraft had come down in UNITA-held territory and so it was not their business. The rebels denied having received any request from Mr Diallo until late on December 28th. UNITA also says that the government is carrying out air strikes on its headquarters, making communication impossible. 
In short, neither side has shown the slightest interest in helping Mr Diallo look for the missing 14 people, let alone agreeing to a ceasefire or trying to work out a way of ending the war.  1999 The AIDS virus had infected 47m people, and shows no signs of slowing. It cannot be cured. Can it be curbed? 
IN RICH countries AIDS is no longer a death sentence. Expensive drugs keep Hv-positive patients alive and healthy, perhaps indefinitely. Loud public-awareness campaigns keep the number of infected Americans,Japanese and West Europeans to relatively low levels. The sense of crisis is past. 
In developing countries, by contrast, the disease is spreading like nerve gas in a gentle breeze. The poor cannot afford to spend $lo,ooo a year on wonder-pills. Millions of Africans are dying. In the longer term, even greater numbers of Asians are at risk. For many poor countries, there is no greater or more immediate threat to public health and economic growth. Yet few political leaders treat it as a priority. 
Since HIV was first identified in the 1970s, over 47m people have been infected, of whom 14m have died. Last year saw the biggest annual death toll yet: 2.5m. The disease now ranks fourth among the world's big killers, after respiratory infections, diarrhoeal disorders and tuberculosis. It now claims many more lives each year than malaria, a growing menace, and is still nowhere near its peak. If India, China and other Asian countries do not take it seriously, the number of infections could reach ""a new order of magnitude"", says Peter Piot, head of the UN'S AIDS programme. 
The human immuno-deficiency virus (HiV), which causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDs) is thought to have crossed from chimpanzees to humans in the late 19q.os or early 1950s in Congo. It took several years for the virus to break out of Congo's dense and sparsely populated jungles but, once it did, it marched with rebel armies through the continent's numerous war zones, rode with truckers from one rest-stop brothel to the next, and eventually flew, perhaps with an air steward, to America, where it was discovered in the early 1980s. As American homosexuals and drug injectors started to wake up to the dangers of bath-houses and needle-sharing, AIDS was already devastating Africa. 
So far, the worst-hit areas are east and southern Africa. In Botswana, Namibia, Swaziland and Zimbabwe, between a fifth and a quarter of people aged 15-49 are afflicted with HIV or AIDS. In Botswana, children born early in the next decade will have a life expectancy of 40; without AIDS, it would have been nearer 7o. Of the 25 monitoring sites in Zimbabwe where pregnant women are tested for HIV, only two in 1997 showed prevalence below lO%. At the remaining 23 sites, 20-5o% of women were infected. About a third of these women will pass the virus on to their babies. 
The region's giant, South Africa, was largely protected by its isolation from the rest of the world during the apartheid years. Now it is host to one in ten of the world's new infections-more than any other country. In the country's most populous province, KwaZulu-Natal, perhaps a third of sexually active adults are HIV-positive. 
Asia is the next disaster-in-waiting. Already, 7m Asians are infected. India's 930m people look increasingly vulnerable. The Indian countryside, which most people imagined relatively AIDs-free, turns out not to be. A recent study in Tamil Nadu found over 2% of rural people to be Hiv-positive: 500,ooo people in one of India's smallest states. Since lO% had other sexually transmitted diseases (STDS), the avenue for further infections is clearly open. A survey of female STD patients in Poona, in Maharashtra, found that over 9o% had never had sex with anyone but their husband; and yet 13.6% had HIv. China is not far behind. 
No one knows what AIDS will do to poor countries' economies, for nowhere has the epidemic run its course. An optimistic assessment, by Alan Whiteside of the University of Natal, suggests that the effect of AIDS on measurable GDP will be slight Even at high prevalence, Mr Whiteside thinks it will slow growth by no more than o.6% a year. This is because so many people in poor countries do not contribute much to the formal economy. To put it even more crudely, where there is a huge oversupply of unskilled labour, the dead can easily be replaced. Some people argue that those who survive the epidemic will benefit from a tighter job market. After the Black Death killed a third of the population of medieval Europe, labour scarcity forced landowners to pay their workers better. 
Other researchers are more pessimistic. AIDS takes longer to kill than did the plague, so the cost of caring for the sick will be more crippling. Modern governments, unlike medieval ones, tax the healthy to help look after the ailing, so the burden will fall on everyone. And AIDS, because it is sexually transmitted, tends to hit the most energetic and productive members of society. A recent study in Namibia estimated that AIDS cost the country almost 8% of GNP in 6. Another analysis predicts that Kenya's GDP will be 14.5% smaller in zoos than it would have been without AIDS, and that income per person will be lo% lower. 
The cost of the disease 
In general, the more advanced the economy, the worse it will be affected by a large number of AIDS deaths. South Africa, with its advanced industries, already suffers a shortage of skilled manpower, and cannot afford to lose more. In better-off developing countries, people have more savings to fall back on when they need to pay medical bills. Where people have health and life insurance, those industries will be hit by bigger claims. Insurers protect themselves by charging more or refusing policies to HIVpositive customers. In Zimbabwe, life-insurance premiums quadrupled in two years because of AIDS. Higher premiums force more people to seek treatment in public hospitals: in South Africa, HIV and AIDS could account for between 35% and 84% of public-health expenditure by zoos, according to one projection. 
Little research has been done into the effects of AIDS on private business, but the anecdotal evidence is scary. In some countries, firms have had to limit the number of days employees may take off to attend funerals. Zambia is suffering power shortages because so many engineers have died. Farmers in Zimbabwe are finding it hard to irrigate their fields because the brass fittings on their water pipes are stolen for coffin handles. In South Africa, where employers above a certain size are obliged to offer generous benefits and paid sick leave, companies will find many of their staff, as they sicken, becoming more expensive and less productive. Yet few firms are trying to raise awareness of AIDS among their workers, or considering how they will cope. 
In the public sector, where pensions and health benefits are often more generOUS, AIDS could break budgets and hobble the provision of services. In South Africa, an estimated 15% of civil servants are HIVpositive, but government departments have made little effort to plan for the coming surge in sickness. Education, too, will suffer. In Botswana, 2-5% of teachers die each year from AIDS. Many more take extended sick leave. 
At a macro level, the impact of AIDS is felt gradually. But at a household level, the blow is sudden and catastrophic. When a breadwinner develops AIDS, his (or her) family is impoverished twice over: his income vanishes, and his relations must devote time and money to nursing him. Daughters are often forced to drop out of school to help. Worse, HIV tends not to strike just one member of a family. Husbands give it to wives, mothers to babies. This correspondent's driver in Kampala lost his mother, his father, two brothers and their wives to AIDS. His story is not rare. 
Obstacles to prevention 
The best hope for halting the epidemic is a cheap vaccine. Efforts are under way, but a vaccine for a virus that mutates as rapidly as HIV will be hugely difficult and expensive to invent. For poor countries, the only practical course is to concentrate on prevention. But this, too, will be hard, for a plethora of reasons. 
Sex is fun . . . Many feel that condoms make it less so. Zimbabweans ask: ""Would you eat a sweet with its wrapper on?"" e.. . and discussion of it often taboo. In Kenya, Christian and Islamic groups have publicly burned anti-AIDS leaflets and condoms, as a protest against what they see as the encouragement of promiscuity. A study in Thailand found that infected women were only a fifth as likely to have discussed sex openly with their partners as were uninfected women. 
Myths abound. Some young African women believe that without regular infusions of sperm, they will not grow up to be beautiful. Ugandan men use this myth to seduce schoolgirls. In much of southern Africa, HIV-infected men believe that they can rid themselves of the virus by passing it on to a virgin. 
Poverty. Those who cannot afford television find other ways of passing the evening. People cannot afford antibiotics, so the untreated sores from STDS provide easy openings for HIV. 
Migrant labour. Since wages are much higher in South Africa than in the surrounding region, outsiders flock in to find work. Migrant miners (including South Africans forced to live far from their homes) spend most of the year in single-sex dormitories surrounded by prostitutes. Living with a one-in-4o chance of being killed by a rockfall, they are inured to risk. When they go home, they often infect their wives. 
War. Refugees, whether from genocide in Rwanda or state persecution in Myanmar, spread Hiv as they flee. Soldiers, with their regular pay and disdain for risk, are more likely than civilians to contract HIV from prostitutes. When they go to war, they infect others. In Africa the problem is dire. In Congo, where no fewer than seven armies are embroiled, the government has accused Ugandan troops (which are helping the Congolese rebels) of deliberately spreading AIDS. Unlikely, but with estimated HIV prevalence in the seven armies ranging from so% for the Angolans to an incredible 80% for the Zimbabweans, the effect is much the same. 
Sexism. In most poor countries, it is hard for a woman to ask her partner to use a condom. Wives who insist risk being beaten up. Rape is common, especially where wars rage. Forced sex is a particularly effective means of Hiv transmission, because of the extra blood. 
Drinking. Asia and Africa make many excellent beers. They are also home to a lot of people for whom alcohol is the quickest escape from the stresses of acute poverty. Drunken lovers are less likely to remember to use condoms. 
How to fight the virus 
Pessimists look at that list and despair. But three success stories show that the hurdles to prevention are not impossibly high. 
First, Thailand. One secret of Thailand's success has been timely, accurate information-gathering. HIV was first detected in Thailand in the mid-198os, among male homosexuals. The health ministry immediately began to monitor other high-risk groups, particularly the country's many heroin addicts and prostitutes. In the first half of 1988, HIV prevalence among drug injectors tested at one Bangkok hospital leapt from 1% to 30%. Shortly afterwards, infections soared among prostitutes. 
The response was swift. A survey of Thai sexual behaviour was conducted. The results, which showed men indulging in a phenomenal amount of unprotected commercial sex, were publicised. Thais were warned that a major epidemic would strike if their habits did not change. A ""100% condom use"" campaign persuaded prostitutes to insist on protection 90% of the time with non-regular customers. 
By the mid-199os, the government was spending $8om a year on AIDs education and palliative care. In 1990-93, the proportion of adult men reporting non-marital sex was halved, from 28% to 15%; for women, it fell from 1.7% to 0.4%. Brothel visits slumped. Only lO% of men reported seeing a prostitute in 1993, down from 22% in 199o. Among army conscripts in northern Thailand, a group both highly sexed and well-monitored, the proportion admitting to paying for sex fell from 57% in 1991 to 24% in 1995. The proportion claiming to have used condoms at their last commercial entanglement rose from 61% in 1991 to 93% in 1995. 
People lie about sex, so reported good behaviour does not necessarily mean actual good behaviour. But tumbling infections suggest that not everyone was fibbing. The number of sexually transmitted diseases reported from government clinics fell from over 4oo,ooo in 1986 to under 50,ooo in 1995. Among northern conscripts, Hrv prevalence fell by half between 1993 and 1995, from over 7% to under 3.5%. 
Most striking was the government's success in persuading people that they were at risk long before they started to see acquaintances die from AIDS. There was no attempt to play down the spread of HIV to avoid scaring off tourists, as happened in Kenya. Thais were repeatedly warned of the dangers, told how to avoid them, and left to make their own choices. Most decided that a long life was preferable to a fast one. 
Second, Uganda Thailand shows what is possible in a well-educated, fairly prosperous country. Uganda shows that there is hope even for countries that are poor and barely literate. President Yoweri Museveni recognised the threat shortly after becoming president in 1986, and deluged the country with anti-AIDs warnings. 
The key to Uganda's success is twofold. First, Mr Museveni made every government department take the problem seriously, and implement its own plan to fight the virus. Accurate surveys of sexual behaviour were done for only $20,ooo-30,ooo each. Second, he recognised that his government could do only a limited amount, so he gave free rein to scores of non-governmental organisations (NGos), usually foreign-financed, to do whatever it took to educate people about risky sex. 
The Straight Talk Foundation, for example, goes beyond simple warnings about AIDS and deals with the confusing complexities of sex. Its staff run role-playing exercises in Uganda's schools to teach adolescents how to deal with romantic situations. Its newsletter, distributed free, covers everything from nocturnal emissions to what to do if raped. Visiting AIDS workers from South Africa and Zimbabwe asked the foundation's director, Catharine Watson, how she won government permission to hand out such explicit material, and were astonished to hear that she had not felt the need to ask. 
The climate of free debate has led Ugandans to delay their sexual activity, to have fewer partners, and to use more condoms. Between 1991 and 1996, HIV prevalence among women in urban ante-natal clinics fell by half, from roughly 30% to 15%. 
Third, Senegal. If Uganda shows how a poor country can reverse the track of an epidemic, Senegal shows how to stop it from taking off in the first place. This West African country was fortunate to be several thousand miles from HIS origin. In the mid-i98os, when other parts of Africa were already blighted, Senegal was still relatively AIDs-free. In concert with non-governmental organisations and the press and broadcasters, the government set up a national AIDs-control programme to keep it that way. 
In Senegal's brothels, which had been regulated since the early 1970s, condom use was firmly encouraged. The country's blood supply was screened early and effectively. Vigorous education resulted in 95% of Senegalese adults knowing how to avoid the virus. Condom sales soared from 800,000 in 1988 to 7m in 1997. Senegalese levels of infection have remained stable and low for a decade-at around 1.2% among pregnant women. 
Contrast these three with South Africa. On December ist, World AIDS Day, President Nelson Mandela told the people of KwaZulu-Natal that HIV would devastate their communities if not checked. The speech was remarkable not for its qualityMr Mandela is always able to move audiences-but for its rarity. Unlike Mr Museveni, South Africa's leader seldom uses his authority to encourage safer sex It is a tragic omission. Whereas the potholed streets of Kampala are lined with signs promoting fidelity and condoms, this correspondent has, in eight months in South Africa, seen only two anti-AIDs posters, both in the UN'S AIDS office in Pretoria. 
How to dither and die 
South Africa has resources and skills on a scale that Uganda can only marvel at. It even has an excellent AIDs prevention plan, accepted by the new cabinet in 1994. But the plan was never implemented. The government likes to consult every conceivable ""stakeholder"", so new plans are eternally drafted and redrafted. Local authorities cannot act without orders from the central government. NGOS, many of them dependent on the powers-that-be for their finance, waste months making sure that enough of their senior management posts are filled with blacks to satisfy the ruling African National Congress. And they have minimal freedom to experiment. 
""There's an idea that if you disagree with the government, you are betraying the liberation struggle,"" says Mary Crewe, head of the Greater Johannesburg AIDS project. As a result, soldiers in the South African army are so ignorant that they snip the tips off their free condoms, and HIV has spread through South Africa as fast, according to Dr Neil McKerrow of Grey's Hospital in Pietermaritzburg, as if no preventive measures at all had been taken. 
Such bungling is not unique to South Africa. Most governments have been slow to recognise the threat from AIDS. From Bulawayo to Beijing, apathy and embarrassment have hamstrung preventive efforts. 
In anarchic countries, such as Congo and Angola, there have been almost no preventive efforts. Many people believe that the cause-a bid to restrain one of the most basic human instincts-is hopeless. As a Zimbabwean novelist, Chenjerai Hove, puts it with disturbing fatalism: ""Since our women dress to kill, we are all going to die."" But if the sexual drive is basic, so is the desire to live. If governments in poor countries wake up to the need to persuade their citizens that unprotected sex is Russian roulette, Mr Hove could be proved wrong. 
This article is indebted to a number of UNAIDS reports, including AIDS epidemic update (December i998, AIDS in Africa (November i9981 and ""A measure of success in Uganda (May 1998).  1999 1999 will not be just the year the euro was born. With Germany presiding for the next six months, the European Union has a host of other challenges 
JUST as well that the current crop of European Union leaders managed to rub along easily enough at their pre-Christmas summit in Vienna. They will be seeing a great deal more of one another in the year ahead, and in more trying circumstances. Vienna was a holding operation. Difficult questions were left for tackling at further summits in the course of 1999. Now several crunches are coming. 
The main event written into European diplomatic diaries for the first half of 1999 is a special summit in Brussels on March 24th and 25th. Here the 15 national leaders, and the European Commission as their servant, will try to reach agreement on new rules to limit EU spending from 2000 to 2006. All agree that budget reforms are essential, if the EU is to start admitting poorer countries from Central and Eastern Europe within that period. Without reforms, expansion will entail huge new spending obligations. But there are fierce differences of opinion over exactly what changes to make. 
Nobody is quite satisfied with ""Agenda 2000"", the package of tweaks and trims proposed by the commission as the basis for argument. France wants to keep farm subsidies high: it claims they are part of the Eu's ""spirit and heritage"", though the real point is that France happens to be their main beneficiary. Spain opposes cuts in regional subsidies with much the same logic. Germany wants its net contribution of $13 billion to the EU budget to be cut by at least a third. Britain wants to protect the special rebate mechanism won 15 years ago by Margaret Thatcher. Eight countries think that EU spending, roughly $100 billion in 1998, should be frozen in real terms for the foreseeable future, whereas seven are opposed or undecided. 
The main work of finding a compromise in all this will bear on Germany, which holds the Union's presidency during the first half of 1999. The timing is awkward: Germany's new Social DemocraticGreen government is still unsteady on its feet, and prone to send out erratic signals. Some countries doubt that the March deadline for a budget deal can be met, however diligent the presidency's work. 
But Germany's top diplomat in Brussels, Dietrich von Kyaw, refuses even to contemplate a postponement. He fears that failure to reach agreement in March would further set back the already much-delayed business of enlargement. He thinks the impression of a serious row among governments might rock the EU's new-born currency, the euro. And he doubts that they would be more accommodating if given more time. All countries, he says, ""will have to give up certain things to which we have become accustomed, things we feel entitled to get"" And lest finance ministers and foreign ministers appear unequal to the sacrifice, there were mutterings in Vienna about holding yet another meeting of heads of government in Bonn in February, before the Brussels summit, though Germany hopes this ""mini-summit"" will not be necessary. 
If a deal on Agenda 2000 can be reached in March, EU leaders will be spared one another's company until June. That is when they assemble in Cologne for a summit rounding off the German presidency. The agenda is likely to include the adoption of a largely symbolic ""employment pact"" for Europe, an idea pushed hard by France. The Union's leaders may well choose a new president for the European Commission and a new ""high representative"" for foreign policy(see page 48). 
But another item pencilled in for the Cologne agenda may give rise to yet another special summit-to convene a new and certainly gruelling ""inter-governmental conference"" for tidying up the EU'S constitutional arrangements. Finland, which assumes the Union's presidency on July ist, has indicated its readiness to play host to the launch of such a conference in the second half of 1999-hoping, no doubt, that a new constitutional shindig might proceed with more gusto than the one that dragged ineffectually along in the run-up to the Amsterdam summit of 1997. 
As with the financial reforms proposed in Agenda 2000,the constitutional reforms would prepare the way for enlarging the Union. If and when more countries join, for example, a new formula will be needed to fix the number of European commissioners (whose job it is to propose legislation and to run the Eu bureaucracy). The present system, whereby big countries send two commissioners to Brussels and small countries one, means an over-generous 20 commissioners already. Another area for reform concerns the Council of Ministers: countries will have to accept the wider use of majority voting there, if legislation is not to be blocked wholesale by a proliferation of national vetoes. New rules are also needed to make the voting power of each country in the council more proportionate to its size: the present system gives small countries a disproportionately big say. 
All this is delicate business. Other potential sources of tension ahead include a worsening trade row with America (sparked by an argument about bananas); the possibility of renewed fighting in Kosovo; and the pursuit, at Germany's insistence, of more effective tax ""harmonisation"" across Europe. Add to this the arrival of the euro, and elections for the European Parliament in mid-June: the implication is that EU issues will dominate national agendas in 1999 in a way not seen since the signing of the Maastricht treaty almost eight years earlier. So when the Union's leaders assemble yet again, in December in Helsinki to mark the end of the Finnish presidency, do not be surprised if their smiles look just a little strained.  1999 ARUSSIAN'S mental map of the world paints America large and everywhere else small. The United States counts for most in high matters-diplomacy and finance-as well as practical ones: the dollar, for example, is Russians' best-trusted currency for saving and commerce. Though Germany counts for a lot, Western Europe as an entity has never engaged Russian attention. 
Could this be changing? Certainly the European Union has never mattered more to Russian policymakers. The hottest topic is trade. The EU is already Russia's biggest single trading partner, with about 40% of the total. Now Russian exporters want to use the rouble's collapse (by more than two-thirds since August) to sell as much cheap steel, textiles, paper and so on to Western Europe as possible. But they are intimidated by the bureaucracy and protectionism of Brussels. So the government is lobbying on their behalf, with mixed success. ""It would be easier to push the Russians' case on steel if they had fully taken up their existing quota,"" sniffs a sympathetic Eurocrat. 
Russians also fear that EU protectionism may squeeze them out of markets in those bits of the former Soviet empire, such as Poland, now bent on joining the EU. ""There will be direct or indirect pressure for big contracts to go to western suppliers, not eastern ones,"" worries a Russian involved in trade finance. 
The Eu's expansion also has a political price. Central European countries are toughening visa regimes and customs services, making it harder for Russians to go and do business there. If Slovakia, Lithuania and Latvia also join the EU, Russia's remaining influence in the region would be pushed back still farther. 
But there are compensations. Russia sees the Eu as more sympathetic than America: just as rich, but less driven by superpower thinking. ""Europe is a better partner for us, less demanding,"" says Vladimir Ryzhkov, a rising young politician. European socialists' carping at the supposedly heartless policies inflicted on Russia by American neo-liberals strikes a melodious chord in Russian ruling circles. 
Still, for all their talk of a ""missing social dimension"", European governments are still likely to take their cue from Washington when it comes to another bail-out for Russia-of which there is currently no sign. The EU'S own efforts have been mostly unimpressive. The most recent idea, $5oom in food aid, has been a blatantly self-interested move by Europe's farm lobby. Most other EU aid so far has been technical advice, often not followed, and valuable chiefly to the well-paid western consulting firms that deliver it. 
But even this may be changing a bit. The European Parliament is reviewing the technical-aid budget. Lobbying by Germany and Finland, among others, has delayed the food-aid package. There are signs of a new emphasis on dealing with the Russian regions, especially those closest to Western Europe, such as Smolensk. When Finland takes over the EU'S presidency in mid-1999, it will launch a ""northern dimension"", aimed at giving greater oomph to Eu engagement in the Baltic states and north-western Russia. 
For most Russians, the biggest practical change will be the euro. Russian importers and exporters are waking up to the need to keep accounts in euros. When they become available in physical form, Russian savers may start hedging their currency exposure, by stuffing their mattresses with euros as well as greenbacks. Those who move cash in suitcases are especially pleased: the 50o note (worth around $425), they note with approval, will be much handier than four or five of those rather inadequate $too notes.  1999 Gerhard Schroder, the new chancellor, has profited from a row with a colleague to start asserting his authority 
WHEN Gerhard Schroder lets slip a beam of quiet triumph these days, the chances are someone has mentioned Jurgen Trittin. How so? Isn't Mr Trittin the Green environment minister at the centre of a row over atomic power that some pundits claim might even split the coalition with Mr Schroder's Social Democrats? 
So he is. But Mr Trittin has also, more or less unwittingly, given the chancellor an ideal chance to show who is boss. And Mr Schroder, widely deemed indecisive since he took over two months ago, has seized it with relish. Hitherto most of his problems have been with his own party and its powerful chairman, Oskar Lafontaine, who is also finance minister. The Greens are much easier to use as a whipping-boy. 
At first glance, the coalition's nuclear scrap may seem odd. After all, both partners, unlike the previous centre-right government under Helmut Kohl, are pledged to shut down all 19 of Germany's atomic plants, which generate about a third of the country's electricity. But, crucially, they differ on timing and tactics. The Social Democrats have said that, given the political will, Germany could be nuclear-free in ten years; the Greens say five years, and threaten footdraggers with penalties. 
Not so Mr Schroder and the economics minister, Werner Muller, a non-party energy expert. They want the phasing-out to be done with the consent of industry. It would then take much longer than the hardliners believe. Otherwise the government might be hit by demands for vast compensation, not just from the domestic nuclear industry but also from French and British firms with long-term contracts to reprocess German atomic waste. A messy confrontation in the courts could delay plant closures indefinitely. 
Hence a hush-hush meeting between Messrs Schroder and Muller with energy company supremos in Bonn on December 14th, when a long-term deal's outline was sketched. Under it, the utilities would close all nuclear plants by 2019, starting in the next year or two with some of the oldest, provided the government did not flood them with regulations in the meantime. 
The pow-wow not only further upset Social Democratic zealots who have long snarled that Mr Schroder, a former member of Volkswagen's supervisory board, is too close to the bosses. It also infuriated Mr Trittin, who was neither invited nor officially informed of the result, though he is directly responsible for nuclear matters. In an apparent tit for tat, he announced he was sacking the members of two committees responsible for reactor safety and radiation protection on the ground that they were too friendly to the nuclear industry. 
Now it was Mr Schroder's turn to be livid, or at least to seem to be. Out came a statement stressing that Mr Trittin had acted without consulting the chancellery, and that this was no time for ""pompous posturing and party political symbolism"". Old Bonn hands recalled no comparable public dressing-down of a minister since the last days of the centre-left coalition under Helmut Schmidt in 1982. Hence speculation that the Schroder coalition too might be almost on the rocks. 
Probably not. True, ridding Germany of atomic power is even more of a core issue for the Greens than it is for the Social Democrats; but that is exactly why they cannot afford to stomp out of the coalition. So after more huffing and puffing a compromise will probably be hammered out at coalition talks set for January 13th. 
At any rate, Mr Trittin's relations with Mr Schroder can hardly be ""damaged beyond repair"", as some claim. Soon after the chancellor's ""pompous posturing"" charge, the pair were spotted tucking into lunch together at a Hanover restaurant They are, after all, old allies as well as sparring partners, dating back to the early 199os when Mr Schroder was in his first term as premier of Lower Saxony and Mr Trittin was in his red-Green cabinet. 
What the row does show is how Mr Schroder is step by step trying to widen his room for manoeuvre, constrained since September by two events. The first was the election result itself, which gave an unexpectedly clear parliamentary majority of21 seats to a red-Green combination and boosted the influence of the Social Democratic left under Mr Lafontaine. The second was the coalition negotiation, which was too hastily rushed through and which Mr Schroder rashly left too heavily in Mr Lafontaine's acquisitive hands. 
Since then, to jeers of ""Where is Schroder?"" even from newspapers which had been hostile to Mr Kohl, he has been seeking to claw more influence. After a skirmish with Mr Lafontaine, he took away from the finance ministry responsibility for preparing the German position at the G8 rich countries' meetings and gave it to his own economic adviser in the chancellery. Responsibility for planning economic reconstruction in ex-communist eastern Germany has been centred on the chancellery too. And Mr Schroder's chief of staff, Bodo Hombach, has been co-ordinating the ""alliance for work"" talks between government, employers and trade unions to find jobs for Germany's 4m jobless. 
Like Mr Schmidt, Mr Schroder is trying to turn his chancellery into a combination of power-house and think-tank. Like Mr Schmidt, he is running into plenty of opposition from his own party, as well as from his coalition partner. But he is beginning to get his way.  1999 DOUBLE tragedy continues to unfold in Transylvania, the northwestern chunk of Romania that has been a haven for ethnic Germans for some eight centuries. First is the fast disappearance of an extraordinary cultural heritage, expressed partly by the medieval architecture that Germans (known in Romanian as ""Saxons"", though in fact they came from far and wide across the German-speaking world) brought to Transylvania and preserved for centuries against staggering odds. Second, the Germans are withdrawing from the mess that is today's Romania. This means the villages and small towns, which have been a mainstay of Transylvania's rural economy, are themselves falling into ever deeper penury and degradation. 
Some 250,000-strong in 1939, a good tenth of the Germans who survived the second world war were carted off-once the communists took over-to Russian labour camps: almost none returned. Around 180,000 Germans sat tight until the mid-1970s, when Nicolae Ceausescu, Romania's communist dictator, began to let a steady trickle go-at a hefty price in D-marks. Communism's fall in 1989 prompted a huge outward spurt. From 110,000, the number of Germans plummeted to 41,000 in less than two years. Now the figure has shrivelled again-to less than 17,000. The Saxon heritage could vanish. 
What is to be done? Take a little village like Viscri (which Germans still call Weisskirch)Once an almost entirely German hamlet of some 450 people, its population has stayed quite stable. But only 30-odd Germans are left-and the economy, based on farming in the lovely rolling plains around, barely exists. 
The squalor is striking. The village stands seven kilometres (four miles) from the nearest tarmac road. There is no longer a shop, bakery, clinic or garage. Rickety horse-drawn wagons far outnumber cars. There is no modern sewage system or running water. A filthy stream bubbles through the village's wide, rutted, muddy street. A telephone line was fixed up two years ago, but most of the skilled Germans (bakers, butchers, teachers, mechanics) who once kept things ticking over have gone. Fields of hops, once the village's main earner, have been abandoned. Gypsies-the butt of discrimination throughout Romania, and usually ill-educated people with scant farming skills-now count for more than half the population. Ethnic Romanians and a handful of Hungarians make up most of the rest. 
Viscri's glory is its stunning white medieval church (which gives the place its name) within a high-walled 12th-century citadel which-like 100 or so other such German fortifications in Transylvaniafended off Turks and Tatars as well as occasionally warring locals. The village's dynamic mayor, Caroline Femolend, an ethnic German, is trying to prod wellwishers outside Romania, including in the World Bank, to dip into their pockets. Otherwise, the village simply cannot survive-in human or architectural terms.  1999 DOUBLE tragedy continues to unfold in Transylvania, the northwestern chunk of Romania that has been a haven for ethnic Germans for some eight centuries.

Each year the auditors discover all manner of horrors in the accounts. Each year the parliament rubber-stamps them just the same. 
Hence the astonishment when on December 17th the parliament, angered by some ill-conceived prodding from the commission, voted to reject the accounts for 1996. The Socialists who dominate the chamber are arguing now for a vote of censure which, if carried, will oblige the entire commission to resign. 
Probably this vote will fail, as others have done before. But it is the first one to count as something more than a hopelessly empty threat. The parliament is growing in stature, thanks mainly to the powers given and promised it by the Maastricht and Amsterdam treaties. These include the power to approve (or not) the appointment of a new commission, and a de facto veto over the choice of president. And, decidedly, the parliament does not like Jacques Santer, the incumbent. The budget fiasco has probably been enough to end any hopes he might have had for reappointment when his term expires at the end of 1999. 
Not that Eu heads of government were likely to make Mr Santer, a former prime minister of Luxembourg, their first choice anyway. They want someone both tougher and (ideally) more taciturn. They will try to choose someone by June, when they meet for a summit in Cologne. The frontrunner is probably still Romano Prodi, a former Italian prime minister. Felipe Gonzalez, a former Spanish one, was once much-fancied but now looks over-embroiled in controversies back home. A more plausible Spanish contender might be Javier Solana, whose term as NATO'S secretary-general ends in 1999. 
A flurry of gossip in the autumn suggested that Germany might propose its finance minister, Oskar Lafontaine. This ranks as an improbable but thought-provoking idea. The first German to head the commission, Walter Hallstein, retired in 1967. A second German presidency is long overdue. If not Mr Lafontaine, another German could carry the day. 
One early piece of horse-trading already seems to have taken place. A Frenchman, Jean Lemierre, is about to be confirmed as the new president of the EU'S Economic and Financial Committee. This group of top officials from central banks, national treasuries and the European Commission, previously known as the ""monetary committee"", is one of the most powerful behind-thescenes bodies in the Union. Until recently, an Italian, Mario Draghi, was favourite to take over its presidency. Mr Lemierre's upset victory suggests a quid pro quo for Italy, in the form of an understanding that France will not oppose Mr Prodi's candidacy for the commission's presidency. 
But whoever takes over at the commission will have to gird himself (no she is in sight) for a tricky few years. It is an increasingly awkward outfit to run; power is drifting away from it. One practical inconvenience is a top-heavy structure brought about by the EU'S growth from six to 15 members. This already means an unwieldy ""college"" of 20 commissioners jostling for portfolios. A dozen more countries want to join the EU in the next few years. 
Any worthwhile reform will probably mean creating a hierarchy with a few ""super-commissioners"" on top and the rest as deputies or department heads beneath them. But how does one sell that idea to the countries that fail to get a super-commissioner of their own? How does one arrange for the top tier to be chosen on merit, and not by a lottery or quota system? Such internal issues will dog and may even consume the next presidential term. 
The next president will also find other institutions eroding the commission's power and influence. The parliament is one. National governments are another: politicians have mastered the possibilities of European integration to the point at which they, and not the commission, have become the real agenda-setters. Mr Lafontaine has shown as much in the case of tax harmonisation. The launch of the euro has also changed the balance of power profoundly. The Union's economic centre has become the new European Central Bank, which owes the commission no obedience whatsoever. 
The commission is about to be left on the margins of another new project: the development of a common foreign and security policy. The main role here will be played by a new ""high representative"", likely also to be named at the Cologne summit. (Delays on the part of France and others in ratifying the Amsterdam treaty, which provides the legal basis for an Eu foreign-policy apparatus, prevented a high representative from being chosen at the Vienna summit in December.) 
The new high representative will be accountable not to the commission, but to national governments grouped together in the Eu's Council of Ministers. Dick Spring, a former Irish foreign minister, is one plausible candidate. So too is Carlos Westendorp, a Spaniard who has been representing the West in Bosnia. 
It sounds an attractive job. When the world wants to know what ""Europe"" thinks about the latest crisis, the high rep will pop up on television to explain. If the European Parliament has its way, he will be the Union's champion of human rights. One day he may even have some real muscle at his disposal, if governments agree to give the Union more of a say in Europe's defence. 
Contrast that with the lot of Mr Santer's successor, who will have parliament breathing down his neck, the central bank refusing to catch his eye, and the foreign-policy figure treading all over his toes. As the heads of government deliberate over which grandee might be juggled into the commission, anyone whose name is being tossed into the air would be wise to wonder whether that prize is really the one worth having.  1999 Tony Blair insists that there is no comparison between the rows that forced Peter Mandelson and Geoffrey Robinson to resign and the ""sleaze"" scandals that bedevilled the Major government. Is he right? 
FROM the moment that Peter Mandelson resigned from his job as trade and industry secretary on December 23rd, the Labour government has been engaged in a frenzied exercise in damage limitation. The Mandelsonian misjudgment was to accept a 373,ooo ($630,ooo) loan from Geoffrey Robinson, a rich colleague, and then to keep it secret-even when his department was investigating Mr Robinson's business affairs. According to the Blairites, this is quite, quite different from the sleaze that engulfed the Tories. 
Does Labour protest too much? The various scandals that have so far beset Labour combine many of the elements that damaged the Tories (see box) But Labour argue that Tory scandals contained an extra ingredient-outright corruption. The most famous of these was the ""cash-for-questions"" scandal, in which some Tory Mps accepted money in return for asking questions in Parliament. This was certainly blatant misconduct, but Mr Mandelson's sin, too, was a huge conflict of interest. And Mr Mandelson is a much more central figure in the Labour government than any of the Tories caught up in the cash-for-questions affair-who had heard of Tim Smith, or Sir Michael Grylls or Neil Hamilton (who still denies the charges)? 
The sheer quantity of Tory scandal was also impressive. Twelve ministers were forced to resign over various misdeeds; and there were numerous indiscretions from backbench MPs, ranging from affairs with night-club hostesses to dubious business dealings. But even here Labour is doing its best. In the five years of the Major government, two cabinet ministers were forced to resign-the Blair administration has equalled that in a year and a half 
SEX Of the 12 ministerial resignations under the Major government, five were related to sexual behaviour. David Mellor (right) was the first of two cabinet ministers to go. Although the allegations that finally finished him off related to his acceptance of ""foreign hospitality"", it was lurid headlines about an affair (toe-sucking with an actress) that first put him on the ropes. A rash of other stories about Tories with mistresses or strange sexual tastes was especially damaging since Mr Major had championed traditional morality. Tony Blair's first cabinet casualty, Ron Davies (left), who resigned as Welsh secretary in October, was also brought down by sex. He was mugged after apparently cruising for gay sex in a London park. In the subsequent row two other cabinet ministers including Peter Mandelson were revealed to be homosexual. 
COVER-UP The other cabinet minister to resign during the Major years was Jonathan Aitken (right) He resigned to sue the Guardian newspaper after it alleged that he had allowed Saudi businessmen to pay for him to stay at the Ritz Hotel in Paris, whilst he was minister for defence procurement. Mr Aitken lost his libel action and now faces charges of perjury: Mr Mandelson's conflict of interest was initially much less obvious; he accepted a loan from Geoffrey Robinson when both men were still in opposition. It was only when his department began to investigate Mr Robinson's business affairs that trouble loomed. But while Mr Mandelson may not have lied, he did dissemble. He failed to tell the senior civil servant at the Department of Trade and Industry of his obligation to Mr Robinson; he fobbed off journalists who asked him how he could afford to buy his house; and he seems to have failed to tell the Britannia Building Society, from which he obtained a mortgage, about the loan from Mr Robinson. 
AND INFLUENCE PEDDLING Much of the aura of sleaze that surrounded the Tory party arose from its habit of accepting large, often secret, donations from dubious characters and foreigners. Asil Nadir (right), a businessman who subsequently fled Britain to avoid prosecution, donated f440,000 to the Tories; and the family of Ma Sikchun, who fled Hong Kong to avoid drug-running charges, also stumped up f im. But neither of these men bought immunity; Mr Nadir is still a fugitive and the Ma family accused the Tories of ""swindling"" them because charges against the senior Ma were not dropped. Labour's biggest funding scandal has centred on a respectable businessmanBernie Ecclestone (left), who runs Formula One motor racing. Unlike Messrs Ma and Nadir, Mr Ecclestone arguably got something for his Im donation. Shortly after the election the Blair government deferred plans to ban tobacco-advertising in motor racing.  1999 The economy 
Why are British interest rates so much higher than Europe's and America's? 
THREE cuts in interest rates, totalling 1.25 percentage points, brought some cheer to British borrowers in the last three months of 1998. But not all that much. Britain's official interest rates, at 6.25%, remain the highest of any large rich country (see chart on next page). America's Federal Funds rate is 4.75% and the eleven European countries adopting the euro will share a common official rate of a mere 3%. 
Yet Britain begins 1999 with the weakest economy in this group, except Japan's, according to the panel of forecasters polled monthly by The Economist. Indeed, a growing number of economists expect a recession. So why are British interest rates so much higher than those in America and euroland? The simplest answer is that the goal of central bankers is to achieve price stability, and that despite the relative weakness of the economy the Bank of England is still more worried than monetary authorities in other countries about inflation. 
The Bank's monetary-policy committee (MPC), which sets interest rates, has the explicit task of keeping ""RPIX"" inflation (ie, excluding mortgage-interest payments) at 2.5%. Throughout 1998, it fretted that Britain's labour market was tight. There is also the risk that sharper cuts in interest rates would weaken sterling, raising the inflation rate through higher import prices. The pound's 9% drop against the D-mark from its peak in March in effect eased monetary policy a little-the reverse of the role played before then by an appreciating pound. 
Indeed, inflation in Britain has remained higher than elsewhere. It is certainly remarkably low by the country's past standards, the more so after a long economic expansion. Currently RPIX inflation is 2.5%, on target. But American inflation, despite seven years of strong economic growth, is only 1.5%. In Germany, inflation is o.7% and in France a mere o.3%. 
International differences in current inflation rates, however, explain less than you might think. Even by the standards of economic data, they are imprecise, thanks to differences in the measurement of inflation. America's inflation rate has been trimmed by statistical refinements in recent years far more than has Britain's. And on the Eu-wide harmonised index of consumer prices, the gap between British inflation and those of France and Germany is smaller than on national measures. The British rate is 1.4%, compared with 0.2% in France, o.6% in Germany and an average of o.9% in the euro-11. 
More important, however, current inflation rates matter far less to monetarypolicy makers than does expected inflation. The MPC, for example, sets rates with an eye to hitting its target two years ahead. So the nz PC must believe that deeper cuts in interest rates would have risked pushing inflation above target in two years' time. 
There is, however, another possible reason why the Bank has not gone further in cutting rates: inertia. Financial markets see few inflationary dangers in Britain: tenyear government-bond yields are within a point of France's and Germany's, and below America's. In effect, the Mpc has already revised its expectation of inflation, and reduced rates accordingly, three times in the past three months. Most economists expect more revisions in the months ahead. 
In a recent lecture Charles Goodhart, a member of the MPC, argued that central banks were slow to react to changes in economic events, preferring to cut rates in small steps. They were also, he said, sometimes loth to move rates for fear of having to change their minds later. Yet in 1998 America's Federal Reserve cut rates as the global economic weather darkened, even though the domestic economy was still growing healthily. Europe's central bankers surprised the markets by cutting rates last month. Either or both may turn out to have been too eager. Should Britain's central bankers also have been bolder? 
Perhaps; and they might yet be. Most economists expect more rate cuts soon (even if not at the MPC'S next meeting on January 6th-7th). And there is an intriguing discussion in the minutes of last month's gathering, published on December 23rd. Some committee members thought it ""useful"" to consider a ""neutral"" interest rate, which would neither slow the economy nor expand it. Such a rate, they suggested, could lie anywhere between 4.5% and 6.5%-ie, the sum of expected inflation of about 2.5% and a real interest rate of between 2% and 4%. 
Others on the committee think the idea bunk, or at any rate too imprecise to be much use. How should the neutral rate vary with the exchange rate, say? Nonetheless it is noteworthy that British rates are still near the top of this ""neutral"" range with the economy on the edge of recession. Time to draw closer to both Europe and America?  1999 John Prescott needs to sharpen the financial incentives of Britain's privatised rail companies to stop passengers being taken for a ride 
THE ultimatum given to passenger-railway operators to improve their services or face the loss or curtailment of their franchises expires next month. Despite such threats made by the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, there are few signs of improvement. 
Extensive engineering works by Railtrack made travel over the Christmas and new year holiday period a nightmare. With punctuality declining and overcrowding worsening, passenger complaints continue to rise. 
All this poses a problem for Mr Prescott. He began a recent meeting with train operators by pointing out that for the past 18 months he had been able to blame the Tories. The next scapegoats were the train companies, good for perhaps another six months. But after that, he bellowed, ""the shit falls on me."" 
The deputy prime ministers dilemma can be summed up briefly. Does he return to a centrally run railway by imposing much tougher regulation on Railtrack and the train-operating companies? Or is he prepared to allow high profits in return for high levels of investment? The rail structure he inherited means that this choice cannot be delayed much longer. The appointment of the chairman of a new strategic railway authority, to be announced later this month, may provide a clue. Among those shortlisted is Sir Alastair Morton, whose record as Eurotunnel co-chairman shows that he can both knock heads and oversee high-risk operations. 
The Conservatives privatised the railways hurriedly and on the cheap. Though there was nominally a quality threshold, the successful train operators were those submitting the lowest bids for subsidy. As a result, Treasury support for the railways by 2oo4 will be about half the level prior to privatisation. That imposes a squeeze which requires rapid growth in passenger revenues as well as stringent cost cutting. The consequence has been overcrowding and declining punctuality. The task of delivering a satisfactory service is complicated by the split between track and train operations with both sides blaming one another for poor performance. 
The train operators claim that privatising the rail network as a monopoly has given disproportionate power to Railtrack. Shareholders' interests, they complain, have taken precedence over levels of investment, noting that the company's share price has quadrupled since privatisation. 
Railtrack, for its part, points out that it has improved its punctuality and reliability by 45% over the past four years while that of the train operators has deteriorated. Its chief executive, Gerald Corbett, argues persuasively that blame for poor performance is at least in part due to the misalignment of financial incentives. Railtrack, he points out, gains only marginally from increased fare revenues, thus minimising its incentive to invest. The train operators, on the other hand, have benefited so much from passenger growth that financial penalties for poor running have become insignificant. 
The first serious shot in this war was fired by the acting rail regulator, Chris Bolt, last month. Supporting complaints that Railtrack was investing insufficiently to justify its current high rates of return, he threatened to cap the fees it charges train operators for the use of its track. Railtrack immediately retaliated, saying that, if its profits were capped, this would have an immediate impact on its ability to raise capital. ""The key is getting new equity,"" says Mr Corbett. ""Our share price should be regarded as an asset rather than a problem."" 
Railtrack has some strong cards to play in what will be a lengthy negotiation. It has a key role in building the Channel Tunnel fast rail link and it is also a leading contender to take over the infrastructure contract for London Underground. ""Railtrack is Prescott's white knight,"" commented an industry observer. ""He knows he won't get any money out of the Treasury."" 
The government, however, cannot afford to allow a privatised monopoly a soft ride. With passenger numbers growing at around 6% a year to nearly 85om, the need to accelerate investment in track and rolling stock is urgent. Many commuter and peak-hour inter-city routes are now so crowded that passengers are having to stand for long periods, blocking any movement along the train. 
Railtrack says there are at least 30 serious congestion points in the network. This squeeze on capacity explains why punctuality and overcrowding are getting worse. But so far the company has been reluctant to commit itself to dealing with these bottlenecks, blaming the lack of incentives in its regulatory regime. 
In part, current problems are the problems of success. Train operators are running 1,ooo extra services a day while the number of passenger journeys has increased by nearly 100m in the past two years. Railtrack and the train operators are winning back custom from the roads. The question is: will they continue to do so, or will their squabbling bring Britain's rail revival to a screeching halt?  1999 MANY a marriage has come to grief even before the wedding day, as the happy couple and their families squabble over who to invite to the ceremony and the reception; over who will sit where; and over the choice and the cost of dresses, flowers, limousines, food, drinks and photographers. No wonder that increasing numbers of couples choose to get hitched in an exotic place far, far away from their relatives. 
No official figures are kept on the numbers marrying abroad. But Mintel, a market-research firm, estimates that in 1997 around 17,ooo couples went abroad to tie the knot. If so, that is one in 20 of all marriages of British residents. 
Exotic wedding-cum-honeymoon trips have become big earners for the travel trade: the Association of British Travel Agents' website lists 54 firms which claim expertise in arranging weddings abroad. Marrying at a Caribbean beach-side hotel is the most popular choice, though the weddings brochure of Airtours, Britain's second-largest tour operator, also offers the chance to exchange vows on a Canadian ski slope or in an underground cavern in Barbados. 
Whereas a traditional wedding back home typically costs at least L100,000 ($16,900) an exotic wedding abroad can be had for a supplement of a few hundred pounds on top of the cost of the honeymoon package tour. Often, the travel firm throws in many of the usual trimmings, such as a wedding cake and a bottle of bubbly, as well as some unusual ones: couples booking Airtours' wedding package in Jamaica get a massage and a ""commemorative T-shirt""; those choosing to wed at Disney World in Florida get their marriage certificate signed by Mickey and Minnie Mouse. 
To Richard Lampard, a sociologist at Warwick University who studies marriage, it is all part of a trend over several decades in which marriage has ceased to be a ""public institution"" and is now seen as simply a private contract between two people. The wedding ceremony itself is no longer regarded as the ""property"" of the local community in whose midst it is carried out. Increasingly, couples are marrying in their late twenties and paying for the wedding themselves, which means they are more likely to withstand family pressure to do things the traditional way-or to invite Auntie Maude.  1999 IT IS hard to sum up pithily the complex mixture of emotions generated by the dramatic Christmas resignation of Peter Mandelson, one of the chief architects of New Labour, secretary of state for trade and industry, and probably the most interesting (""exotic"" is his own word) man in Tony Blair's cabinet. It is hard, but it is not impossible. Bagehot's impression is that the reaction of many people-and certainly of most of political London-to the rude interruption of this gifted man's sparkling career can be broadly summarised as hahahahah. 
There is seldom a good reason to find pleasure in the misfortune of others. But there can be better reasons and worse reasons. In the case of Mr Mandelson's secret L373,000 ($630,000) loan from Geoffrey Robinson, the paymaster general, people need to sort out exactly what it is that they find so funny. The list is not comprehensive, but here, in descending order of acceptability, are four different flavours of hahahahah. 
It would be consoling to think that the most prevalent sort of hahahahah was the most highminded one, the one that says: ""This is a man who behaved dishonourably and was caught out."" Surely nobody can believe that anything other than self-preservation prevented Mr Blair's most intimate counsellor from telling the prime minister about his vast personal debt to Mr Robinson, once the paymaster general had become the subject of an investigation by Mr Mandelson's own department? Well, the peculiar thing is that some people-Mr Blair included-say not only that they believe him but have chosen to shower him with praise for having reluctantly resigned. And the depressing thing is that most of the people who do not believe him seem to be saying hahahahah for a different reason. 
This second sort of hahahahah has something to do with Greek tragedy. It is a not especially admirable human reaction to a tale of human frailty. Every so often it becomes the fate of a politician to prove all over again the adage that pride comes before a fall. Mr Mandelson was the perfect candidate. If, still knowing nothing about the secret loan he took from Mr Robinson, you had been asked in some pre-Christmas quiz to nominate a prominent member of the present government as a great man ripe for laying low, you would probably have selected Mr Mandelson. Famous for the exquisite sensitivity of his political antennae, he nonetheless made the elementary mistake of letting it be known that he considered himself very great indeed. Here was a man who made friends with Elisabeth Murdoch and Prince Charles but also made the nursing of grievances, the intimidation of journalists and the snubbing of the lowly into something akin to an art form. It is hardly high-minded, but perhaps not so terrible-and (be generous to yourself) maybe even healthy for democracy-to feel, instinctively: ""Hahahahah. He puffed himself up and was overdue for a comeuppance."" 
The third flavour of hahahahah holds some danger for British politics. This is the one that says: ""We knew all along that nothing good would come of this New Labour malarkey."""" Tories say this because Labour mounted a high horse and exaggerated the sleaze of John Major's government. But many traditional Labour people are saying it too, because they dislike many of the aspects of New Labour that Mr Mandelson came to symbolise. How delicious, they say, and how apt, that Mr Mandelson's fatal flaw was a craving to live beyond his means in a posh house at a fashionable address in London. This was the smart cosmopolitan who folded up the red flag and put a red rose in its place, who saw nothing wrong in people becoming ""filthy rich"", and who poked fun last summer at the idea that Labour owed a special debt to ""horny-handed, dirty-overalled people"". Well, just as Mr Mandelson did himself no good by putting himself in hock to the (filthy-rich) Mr Robinson, sohahahahah-no good will come from New Labour continuing to snub the trade unions and cosy up to big business. 
But this reaction has a fatal flaw of its own. It is at the very least based on a non-sequitur. In the matter of his house and loan, Mr Mandelson undoubtedly made a serious mistake. The man may be discredited, his style may be objectionable. But the policies with which he became associated-an end to class war, support for competition and flexible labour markets-have not been discredited at all. On the contrary. New Labour would not have won the last election if it had not ditched the discredited Old Labour ideas which those who rejoice in the exit of Mr Mandelson now see a chance to promote all over again. There are few such people within the government itself, but there are some. In his first interview after Mr Mandelson's resignation, Mr Blair made a point of warning potential revisionists that New Labour was bigger than any individual, and would resist any return to old policies. 
The Tories would love Labour to reopen these battles. One Tory spokesman claimed reports of a new alliance of pro-spending Keynesians between John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, and Gordon Brown, the chancellor, as evidence of the return of ideology to what had so far just been ""intense personal loathing"" between Mr Brown and Mr Blair. But this is wishful thinking on the Tories' part. Both Mr Brown and Mr Prescott see themselves as signed-up members of New Labour. Pardon the understatement, but they just don't like Mr Mandelson. 
And that, by the way, is the fourth flavour of hahahahah. It is the reaction of a handful of ministers and their spin doctors who continue to snipe at one another for no better reason than personal rivalry, and who say: ""Hahahahah, our enemy has fallen."" It is the unfunniest hahahahah of all.  1999 Northem Italy is studded with thriving clusters of manufacturing businesses. Why are they so vigorous? 
BEAUTIFULLY made goods from northern Italy are a part of la dolce vita from Hollywood to Hong Kong. Silk from Como, wool from Biella and gold from Vicenza adorn the fashionable, while on their noses perch glasses shaped and polished in the Dolomites. Ferrari, Ducati and Alfa Romeo are northern Italian names to quicken a motorist's heart. Tiles from Modena grace the grandest kitchens, and in those kitchens the famous cheese of Parma is grated on pasta prepared in the city's factories. 
These glamorous consumer industries are sustained by a second, less visible layer of activity. It consists of the firms that make the machines that make the famous products. Italy's group of machine-tool manufacturers, the bottom layer of the manufacturing pyramid, is the fourth-largest in the world after Japan's, Germany's and America's, with sales of $3.45 billion in 1997. Individual Italian machine makers tend to be small. The average size of the workforce in Italy's 450 machine-tool firms is 70, compared with 200 in Germany's 320 firms. According to Mario Fochi, of Sperotto Rimar, which makes textile-finishing machines, machinery makers spring up around the manufacturing firms like mushrooms amid the roots of big trees. 
Such delicacies are much sought-after among business theorists these days. Excited by the crackling commercial energy of Silicon Valley in California, governments around the world have tried to create their own Silicon Glens, Fens and Parks, Bio Valleys and Villes. They offer cheap buildings, infrastructure and tax breaks as a lure to entrepreneurs. The aim is to boost the productivity and creativity of everyone in the cluster by fostering opportunities for collaboration and the exchange of information, and a critical mass of expertise. 
Something in the air 
Northern Italy's long-standing clusters are proof of the value of collaboration. Elena Ferraro of IECO, which makes machines for melting and electroforming gold, underlines the importance of exchanging information with her customers. Of the firm's sales, 60% are within Italy. Most of those are of customised machines, rather than the off-the-shelf models and complete turn-key factories that IECO sells abroad. The need to keep up with the demands of the more sophisticated Italian goldsmiths has enabled Italian suppliers such as IECO, and nearby Sisma, to dominate their business, supplying about 80% of the total world market for machinery for making gold jewellery. 
Yet northern Italian clusters also contain a more surprising ingredient: the collaborators increasingly compete as well. Easier communications and trade mean that both manufacturers and machinery suppliers can more easily deal with each other's rivals across the world. 
The great fear among Italian industrialists is that this will weaken the country's clusters. Rather than use machines that might be sold to their competitors, some bigger firms prefer to rely on equipment from in-house workshops. Barilla, the world's largest pasta maker, has a 100strong engineering division. Proprietary machines propel every stage of its new lasagne line in Parma, from the floppy curtains of fresh dough dropping on to conveyors to the dealer that stacks the cut, dried sheets like so many playing cards. More important is the computer system the company has designed to control the line. Necessity has been the mother of some of this invention, for Barilla's dominance of its home market-it has 32%, compared with 4.8% for its nearest rival-means it operates on a larger scale than others, giving it needs that cannot be met with standard equipment. 
Other large firms are all too aware that their secrets would be at risk if the machines they use were widely available. Safilo, the second-biggest manufacturer of spectacles in the Veneto, with a turnover of 566 billion lire ($345m) in 1997, also has a research division. Fifty engineers design and build the machines that are humming away in the factory next door. Some of the systems developed within Safilo's workshop are patented-machinery to construct a particularly flexible hinge, for example. More often, the engineers modify standard machines that Safilo buys from outside. Vittorio Tabacchi, the chairman, laughs at the idea of asking the company's suppliers to modify the machines they sell him: that would reveal his firm's secrets and allow them to fall into the hands of competitors. 
Smaller firms do not have the luxury of using machines that are not sold to foreign competitors. Sperotto Rimar, Mr Fochi's firm, sprouted originally because of the sustaining presence in the region of Marzotto and Lanerossi, two textile firms that some 150 years ago found in the steep hills north of Vicenza fast-flowing streams to drive their looms, and sheep to provide wool. 
Today these two firms are one, which gets its wool from Australia and its power from the national grid, and its boss chafes at the restrictions a narrow valley places on floor space in his factory. The machinery in that factory comes from suppliers in other countries as well as its neighbourslooms from Switzerland, bobbin-winders from Germany, washing machines from Britain. Equally, 9o% of Mr Fochi's steam presses and shrinking machines go abroad-up from 6o% in 1985. Many go to Marzotto's growing number of rivals in Asia. Nuovo Pignone, a nearby loom maker that also supplies Marzotto, sold 7o% of its output in 1997 in Asia (and itself is being bought by a Swiss competitors 
Yet the increasing foreign trade also provides things that are good for clusters. Sisma, the world's largest producer of machines used to make gold chains, received 80% of its 30 billion lire ($18m) turnover from exports in 1997. ""Some Italian jewellery firms are unhappy that we sell machinery to their foreign competitors. But if we didn't, others would,"" reasons Fiorenzo Sbabo, Sisma's chairman. 
In this way, international sales prevent would-be foreign competitors from emerging. At the same time, the threat is a stimulus for innovation and the desire to move constantly upmarket. Italy has an edge in quality even in industries where other countries have obvious advantages. Its tile industry is one example (see box). Another is cashmere, which comes from China. Firms there have installed numerous Italian looms, as well as developing equipment of their own, but the finest cashmere clothes still come from Biella. The gap is narrowing, but Italy remains ahead. 
Similarly, South-East Asia dominates the mass market for spectacles, but Italy retains a lock on the top end of the market (where the profit margins are much greater: cheap glasses cost $4 to make and may sell for $15; designer glasses cost $12 and sell for $150). In gold jewellery, leather and tiles, likewise, Italy has hung on to the most lucrative part of the market, even as others have conquered its lower end. 
New technology has permitted the intimacy that used to be possible only within a cluster to take place over long distances. As a result, foreign customers have become a source of feedback in their own right. Flavio Radice, the boss of Pietro Carnaghi, a tool maker in Busto Arsizio, north of Milan, says he and his designers regularly use their video-telephone link to pore over plans with customers for the huge vertical-milling machines his firm makes for turbine builders. Some of these customers are to be found just up the road, part of the dense engineering conglomeration of this most industrious of towns, but others, such as Boeing Aerospace, for which Pietro Carnaghi has built a machine to shape the top of Delta-4 rockets, are in America. 
Nonetheless, there is an advantage in being local. Mr Radice's firm has built a suite of offices complete with a shower alongside its workshop. Customers like to come and spend several weeks consulting with the firm's engineers as their machines take shape. Being there still matters.  1999 TORTELLINI and Lambrusco pushed aside the usual machines and cutting oil last November when LB Officine Meccaniche celebrated 25 years of building machinery for making ceramic tiles at its factory on the outskirts of Sassuolo. There was every excuse for a blow-out: the firm's fortunes have risen with those of the Italian tile industry, which produced 572m square metres in 1997, compared with only 200m square metres in 1973. Over the same period exports have risen too, from 30% to 70% of total production. By egging each other on, both the tile makers and the machinery makers such as LB Officine Meccaniche that cluster together in Sassuo(o's ""tile valley"" have given themselves much to celebrate. 
Success has depended on innovation. LB Officine Meccaniche, for example, has developed systems for handling and mixing materials to make porcelain tiles that look like marble and granite, but are lighter and cheaper than the real thing. Tile makers elsewhere are catching up with the Italians. Ten years ago Spain's production was only one half that of Italy; now it is almost as large. Turkey's production is growing rapidly, and China's is already as large as Italy's. To stay ahead, the Italians must continue to innovatethe pressing concerns today are to reduce fragility and to make elaborate shapes in large quantities-in order to add more value to what is at bottom nothing more than cooked mud. 
Whether Italian tile makers can keep innovating is another matter. After the party, the strains of cluster life soon resurface. Angelo Bore]li, chairman of Assopiastrelle, the tile makers' trade association, says that his members and the machinery makers have a love-hate relationship. He complains that machinery makers sell foreign clients expertise that they acquired through their work in Italy. ""[We] would be much better off if the machines were not sold abroad,"" he grumbles. 
Nearly three-quarters of the machinery makers' 1997 turnover came from exports, with almost one-third going to Asia. But tile makers are getting their own back: problems in Asia have brought harder times for the machinery makers and, according to Filippo Marazzi, chairman of the Marazzi Group, Italy's top tile maker, a chance for their customers to buy cheaply by playing off suppliers against each other. 
Ivanno Ligabue, one of the founders of LB Officine Meccaniche, is uneasy for the region's future. He doubts that tile makers are doing enough to create new products and market them. But out of such insecurity the next wave of innovation is born.  1999 WITH a record like his, there is every reason to think that Lord Simpson, the managing director of Britain's General Electric Company(GEc, will play a big role in the reshaping of Europe's defence industry. Not that he entertains many grand designs himself he wants to pair off his Marconi defence arm with one of four potential partners, two of them in Europe, and two in America. 
When Lord Simpson was boss of Rover, the last big car company in British hands was clinging to life with the help of Japan's Honda, which owned a zoo% stake in the ailing but venerable firm. With a refreshing lack of sentimentality, he sold it to a German firm, BMW, before going on to run Lucas, a British car-parts company. Ere long that too went-to America's Varity. 
True to form, just before Christmas, Lord Simpson confirmed, in effect, that he was proceeding with the dismemberment of GEC, another British industrial institution, which had been built lovingly over 30 years by Lord Weinstock, who was one of the country's most respected industrialists. Lord Simpson had already floated the group's power-engineering joint venture, Alstom. His next move will be to split the civil and military sides of Marconi, its electronics and communications subsidiary, the better to sell or merge Marconi's main defence business. 
At the last count, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman in America, and British Aerospace (sae) and Thomson-csF (French despite the name), were all in discussion with GEC The company confirmed just before the end of 1998 that a deal should be announced in January. 
Lord Simpson is lucky to be in a sellers market. Americans are interested because GEC is respected as a supplier to the Pentagon, and recently snapped up a smallish American company, Tracor, to strengthen its American business. Meanwhile, the European defence industry is poised for rationalisation, so that it can compete better with American giants such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin. Closest to tying the knot are sAe and DASA, the aerospace part of DaimlerChrysler. 
In many ways Lord Simpson might find a merger with Lockheed easiest, building on GEC'S good reputation in America. Or he could seek to become the third leg in the sae/DAsA group, but this would probably have to wait some time until the first two arranged their own deal and worked out a way for GEC to join without turning DASA into the junior partner. A third option would be to join Thomson, which the French government wants to strengthen and privatise. A Marconi-Thomson link-up would create a new powerful defence-electronics company every bit as prestigious as the sAe/DAsA group (which makes the aeroplane platforms that carry the military electronics). 
Whichever Lord Simpson chooses, he will be left with the rump of the industrial and consumer businesses of GEc-which includes such things as weighing machines, telecoms equipment, domestic appliances and medical devices. He would be unlikely to use them as a base for building a GEC Mark Two. So expect rather more disposals and handing back of cash to shareholders. Would the last person to leave GEC please turn out the lights.  1999 South Korean restructuring 
EVEN those who are leery of politicians meddling in industry sense a certain justice in the dressing down that South Korea's government is giving its giant conglomerates, or chaebol. Kim Dae Jung, South Korea's president, is not alone when he blames the chaebol's huge debts and overweening expansion for his country's eceonomic crisis. Yet, however much the chaebol need reining in, President Kim's row with the LG Group appears to be a miscalculation. On December 28th the government cancelled new loans to LG. If it were to go further and call in debts worth $5.6 billion, as it has threatened, it would destroy the firm. And to what end? 
The fight is over the government's plan for LG to merge its semiconductor operations with those of Hyundai. There is an arbitrary, almost numerological, dimension to this-as there is to Mr Kim's other industrial designs. Instead of three main chaebol in most big industries, the government wants two, with the weakest handing its operations to one of the stronger two. 
Ultimately, Mr Kim's aim is to lower the chaebol's soaring debts and to reduce overcapacity. The top five chaebol have already agreed to lower their average ratio of debt to equity to 200% by the end of 1999, from nearly 400% today. Not content for the chaebol to do this in their own fashion, the government is directing the restructuring with enforced swaps, which have come to be known as ""big deals"". With LG refusing to do Mr Kim's bidding, the president is using the state-controlled banking system to starve the chaebol of money. 
Sometimes, as with Samsung's car plant, born ofthe company's mis-timed entry into the car industry in 1998, the rationale for restructuring seems justified, even if the method is heavy-handed. (Samsung agreed to hand the plant to Daewoo in exchange for some second-rate consumerelectronics operations.) But the deal between LG and Hyundai does not even have the advantage of industrial logic 
The argument for the merger rests on the current overcapacity in memory-chip making-the plunging price of which in 6 caused the losses that first harmed the chaebol. Memory-chip making is a cyclical industry. Those that can afford to invest in new technology through the down cycles stand to make huge profits when prices rise. To prosper, therefore, all three South Korean chipmakers (including Samsung, the leader) need to invest huge amounts in 1999 (see chart), which will mean borrowing billions of dollars just when they are supposed to be lowering their debt. The government thinks one big firm formed out of the two smallest (together, iG and Hyundai would be the world's largest memory-chip producer) would enjoy economies of scale. The government hopes that it may also attract a foreign investor, which could take up to a 50% stake and help finance the new investment. 
When the government first dreamed up this scheme in September, LG and Hyundai unenthusiastically agreed, hoping they could find a way to scotch it. But the government pressed on, proposing a 70-30 jointly owned firm, with Hyundai holding the controlling share. When LG demurred, the government asked Arthur D. Little to study the question. After the consultancy confirmed the governments view, LG threatened to sue it. 
Arthur D. Little argues that, because the memory industry is so capital intensive, only the richest firms can survive. ""Secondtier companies like LG and Hyundai are very vulnerable to downturns,"" the firm says; ""Put LG and Hyundai together and they become top-tier almost overnight."" 
In fact the deal makes little sense. It is anyone's guess whether a merger will really do much to make investment more affordable. Bigger, financially sound companies do have access to cheaper capital, which is indeed a competitive advantage in memory-chip making. Yet the combined company would still have far heavier debts than chipmakers elsewhere. The government may force the banks to forgive much of this debt (swapping it for equity, for instance), but it could just as easily do this for the two firms separately. In any case, neither LG nor Hyundai is a tiddler even now, with 12-13% ofthe world memory-chip market each-more than their Taiwanese rivals. 
There may be modest savings in research spending, but the two firms specialise in different types of memory chip. The combined firm would presumably continue to invest in both. Their factories also use different technologies that cannot easily be integrated. And, as ING Barings, an investment bank, points out, a firm the size of the combined LG-Hyundai may be less likely to attract a large foreign investor. Buying a half-share of such a giant would be too expensive for most of the firms that are likley to be interested (Intel, the obvious exception, has already joined Micron, an American memory maker). 
The pity is that South Korea already has rules that could sort out chip making and most other industries without Mr Kim's good offices. The government has banned the sort of loans between subsidiaries that LG and Hyundai used to help get through rough patches in the past. Under the new restrictions, the credit market could determine which operations should merge or close. Could it be that Mr Kim is unwilling to see the lay-offs that would result from such spontaneous restructuring?  1999 BY ADDING an inch to every Chinese shirt-tail, Britain hoped to keep its t9th-century textile mills running. It failed, but the promise of 1.2 billion consumers still lures traders to China. Most are disappointed: China is still largely rural and achingly poor-the average income is just $360 per head a year. 
Yet the rise of an urban economic elite, mobile telephones in hand, proves that there are two Chinas: the huge nation of poor peasants who may never buy a Coke, and a thin layer of free-spending officials, managers and entrepreneurs who are only too keen to splash out. Affluent China today probably amounts to a small nation, barely significant in the global consumer market-but growing too quickly to be ignored. 
It is easy to overestimate the buying power of China's elite consumers. Together they represent no more than 3om people in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen. And for the most part, they are not rich by world standards: according to the latest official government survey, the top lo% of city dwellers have an average annual disposable income of just $1,24o a person. 
On the other hand, if GDP per head is adjusted for purchasing power, the incomes of the top io% of city dwellers is probably closer to $io,ooo a year. The prevalence of wide-screen televisions, fancy stereos and home-karaoke machines in Shanghai apartments suggests that this new upper-middle class has more money than it admits to. Supposing that the real wealth of affluent Chinese lies somewhere between the two estimates, China's potential market must be somewhere between those of Belgium and Australia. 
Put like that, China looks hefty, but not gigantic. But compare China today with China in 1985 (the first year the country conducted comprehensive consumer surveys) and it is clear that China's growth has been rapid. 
Among urban households, fewer than one in five households had a colour television in 1985; today the average such home has more than one. Then, 7% had a refrigerator; now 73% do. Cameras are four times more common. Among richer urban households, more than a half now have a VCR or video CD machine, a pager, air-conditioner and shower, and nearly a third of homes also own a mobile telephone. Every year, millions more Chinese join the ranks of this high-spending elite. 
After three years of declining growth rates (from an unsustainable peak of 4o% a year in 1995), consumer spending started picking up again in 1998 and should come close to matching the country's 7.8% growth in GDP for the year. China is already one of the largest markets for mobile telephones and pagers, personal computers and antibiotics, and accounts for about one-third of global cigarette consumption. All of these industries make lots of money for foreign firms. In boom towns such as Shenzhen and Shanghai, BMWS and Mercedes are now commonplace: after decades of deprivation, the urge to splurge is strong.  1999 SLOVAKIA has not had much to boast of in recent years, but it may produce the biggest corporate default in Central Europe since the collapse of communism. Creditor banks have spent the past few weeks shuffling the management of vsz, Central Europe's largest steelworks, and trying to reach a deal to restructure its debts. The company defaulted in November on a $35m loan arranged by Merrill Lynch, and it is reckoned to have further debts of around $45om that it cannot service. If there is no progress within the coming months, it will go under. 
This mess need not have come about. vsz, which accounts for 8% of Slovak GDP and 14% of Slovak exports, enjoys strong local demand from the booming Central European car industry. Daewoo and Volkswagen, whose Czech Skoda subsidiary is vsz's largest customer, need a range of specialist steels which vsz could be supplying. Although vsz is being undercut in western markets by producers in Asia and the former Soviet Union, in Central Europe it has geography on its side. 
But politics has undermined vsz's business. The usual post-communist problems of overmanning and slack management were exacerbated in 1995 when the company was sold for a fifth of its market value to supporters of the thuggish Vladimir Meciar, who was ousted as prime minister in October 1998. The largest shareholder is now Alexander Rezes, who handed management control to his son in order to run Mr Meciar's re-election campaign. Jan Smerek, head of the supervisory board, is a member of parliament in Mr Meciar's leftwing populist party. He led attempts to put together another Meciar government. 
Instead of investing in vsz's run-down plant, Mr Rezes decided that it needed to diversify away from steel. He bought a heap of companies including a financial newspaper, a football club and some holiday homes in Spain. Fortunately, his attempts to buy Slovakia's largest insurer and thirdlargest bank came to nothing. 
vsz is nowa large political constituency as well as a huge chunk of the economy. It directly employs 25,ooo people, and supports three times that number through its supply chain. Sean Murphy, a steel analyst at Nomura, an investment bank, reckons that the company needs only a quarter of its present workforce. But, he says, ""the company is being run for the benefit of its employees, not its shareholders."" 
When the new government came to power in October, it offered to rescue vsz if the management and supervisory board resigned. They refused. But now that the company faces bankruptcy, they have accepted some changes. Just before Christmas the creditors kicked out Rezesfils and put in two American managers, including Thomas Graham, the ""smiling barracuda"" who has a record of turning around steel mills. What next? Simplest would be to sell the plant to a western firm with plenty of cash and no political agenda.  1999 SLOVAKIA has not had much to boast of in recent years, but it may produce the biggest corporate default in Central Europe since the collapse of communism.

Just before Christmas the creditors kicked out Rezesfils and put in two American managers, including Thomas Graham, the ""smiling barracuda"" who has a record of turning around steel mills. What next? Simplest would be to sell the plant to a western firm with plenty of cash and no political agenda.  1999 The British textile industry's close relationship with Marks and Spencer was once its salvation. Now it is proving to be its undoing 
BRITAIN'S textile industry is in a mess. Like many of the country's basic manufacturing industries, the textiles business is suffering from falling demand, volatile input prices and the strength of sterling. Much more startling is that a sweatshop industry should matter at all to Britain, one of the world's most developed economies. 
With a workforce of some 354,ooo, textiles and clothing is the sixth-largest employer in British manufacturing-just behind mechanical engineering. Britain and Italy are by far Europe's biggest employers in clothing manufacturing. Though many of its ii,ooo or so textile firms are small and family-run, Britain is also home to some of the publicly traded clothing manufacturers with the largest sales in Europe. 
All of them are having a miserable time. Share prices in the textiles sector have underperformed the -rsE 100 share index by some gn% in the past five years, let down by thinning margins and, in many cases, declining profits. In 1994 Coats Viyella, the largest, was one of the 1oo biggest quoted companies in Britain. On December 21st it suffered the indignity of being demoted from Britain's top 350 companies to its SmallCap Index. Today, the values of Britain's 3o-odd quoted textile firms combined would be less than half that needed to enter the ranking of the top too. 
And things are deteriorating. Clothing sales in Britain are flat and retailers fear that worse lies ahead. Britain's largest and most profitable retailer, Marks and Spencer, recently spoke of a ""bloodbath"" on the high streets. 
The plight of Britain's textile companies has much to do with nM&Ss. In most countries, clothing manufacturers are branded companies in their own right. Many have their own retail outlets-Benetton and Stefanel in Italy, Hugo Boss in Germany, Donna Karan and Tommy Hilfiger in America. In Britain, it is the clothing retailers-MeAS particularly-that enjoy brand status. Consumers shop for and trust in Mas clothes, whereas manufacturers remain faceless. To keep the British public loyal to its ""St Michael"" brand, Mas has tied its main suppliers to its apron strings, encouraging them to keep factories in Britain and to concentrate on supplying M&S. 
There was a time when both Mtas and its suppliers benefited. M&S'S ""Buy British"" policy not only protected local jobs; it also helped boost sales. With short lines of communication to suppliers, the retailer could keep a better check on quality and was more flexible. It could change ranges more quickly than rivals who imported, and was the first to bring innovative materials such as wrinkle-free fabric to the British public. 
Companies that became Me^S's preferred suppliers grew rapidly on the back of its success. Investors rated the big fourCoats Viyella, Courtaulds Textiles, Dewhirst and William Baird, which together supply 60% of nMs,s's clothing-more highly than the rest of the sector. 
Unfortunately, such dependence on one customer has left these companies vulnerable. Some 90% of Dewhirst's business is with M&s, while even William Baird, the least exposed, still sells more than 40% of its output to the retailer. Because the strong pound has made imports cheap, their domestic factories now carry hefty costs. For m&s, too, a British supply base has fewer advantages: quite apart from their higher costs, British suppliers have no particular advantage in servicing the retailer's growing number of overseas stores more efficiently. Faced with falling demand, M&s is suddenly asking its suppliers to shift production abroad. 
Although some are obediently doing so, M&S suppliers are still suffering. Worries that M&s may have too much stock have caused their shares to perform even worse than those of the rest of the British textile industry. In the past two months, M&S clothing suppliers have cut almost 2,300 British jobs. Even so, the industry in Britain may still have 30% too much capacity. 
Mergers could help to reduce capacity in the industry, but few have occurred. In September Courtaulds Textiles bought Claremont Garments for a paltry fom ($17m) plus debt-a mere 5% of Claremont's annual sales. William Baird is trying to persuade a reluctant Coats Viyella to sell its textiles and branded-clothes business for a probable om, including debt. 
Depressed share prices are one reason for inaction: there are few wealthy predators around. Though Baird's plans make sense (not least because Coats has mismanaged its crown jewel,Jaeger women's wear), Coats is unwilling to demerge clothes from its thread business. Though Baird is one of the better-run groups, its market capitalisation of E7m is too small for it to make a bid for the whole of Coats, worth 192m. David Suddens, Baird's chief executive, is frustrated: ""What's the point in being a quoted company? I can't use our paper. Even banks are saying `Christ no-not the retail sector, not the textile sector.' No one wants to know."" 
Anyway, being bigger may not be the answer. Ron McDerment, a textiles analyst at HSBC Securities, a stockbroking firm, argues that good old-fashioned management matters much more. ""[This business] needs managers who can be two things at oncedisciplined cost cutters who can run a tight supply chain and creatives who can get designs and fabrics right."" Sadly, the textiles business finds it hard to attract and retain talent. Like the clothes at M&S, British textiles have lost their appeal.  1999 Economic liberalism is surviving trial by recession, according to the latest worldwide opinion poll by Angus Reid and The Economist 
HISTORICALLY, recession is the midwife of protectionism. In good times, peoples and nations are happy to enjoy the benefits of open trade. Come bad times, they are tempted to minimise short-run pain through protection. 
The great question now is whether the liberal policies that have taken hold in many countries around the world in the 198os and 199os can survive an economic setback. During 1998, such a setback threatened to grow from being merely regional into one that, in 1999, could be more or less global. The Asian ""tigers"" had suddenly turned pussycats in 1997, and in 1998 their recessions proved deep. The Russian economy stubbornly refused to reform itself, and the country defaulted on its debts. Long Term Capital Management, a hedge fund, went dramatically belly-up, prompting a private-sector rescue costing an estimated $4 billion. World stockmarkets turned sharply bearish in the early autumn. Forecasts for 1999 were for little or no growth, worldwide. 
Predictably, the voices ofthe protectionists were raised again. There were those who thought the blame lay in excessively free currency markets. George Soros, who had made his multi-billion-dollar fortune from such markets, published a book, ""The Crisis of Global Capitalism"" (Little, Brown L$17.99; Perseus Books $26, making this case. And there were those who wanted to guard domestic jobs against foreign competition or the pressures of foreign slumps. In both America and Asia, politicians began to raise the protectionist banner. 
Yet as far as public opinion is concerned, they have got nowhere. Amazing as it may seem, there has been no increase in popular support for protectionism worldwide over the last year (see chart on this page). An opinion poll carried out among more than 12,000 adults in 22 countries worldwide by the Angus Reid Group, a Canadian pollster, for The Economist shows that the proportion favouring protection did not change: at 48% last year to 47% this year, the fall is insignificant statistically. The conspicuous point is that the proportion of protectionists has failed to rise. 
The question asked was: ""Which of the following two broad approaches do you think would be the best way to improve the economic and employment situation in this country-protecting our local industries by restricting imports, or removing import restrictions to increase our international trade?"" This was designed to flush out true free traders. To count as one, a respondent had actually to favour lower barriers against imports and not merely to oppose the building of new barriers. It might therefore have been expected to understate the number of anti-protectionists. 
True, on this measure, protectionists do just outnumber free traders (47% to 42% worldwide) In particular, some Asian countries such as Malaysia remain strongly protectionist. Even in traditionally freetrading Asian countries, such as Taiwan, support for free trade has fallen. In 1997, free traders outnumbered protectionists in Taiwan by more than three to one. Now the ratio is two-to-one. 
But protectionism seems to be a lagging indicator rather than a leading one: in other words, bad times must come before it rises, rather than merely being expected to come. For support for free trade amongst the large, and still economically robust European Union economies-Britain, alas, excepted-has grown sharply. Even in Colbertist France, free traders are now only slightly outnumbered by protectionists. 
Nor has America begun to flinch. Not that the American dream of freedom has ever quite extended to international trade. A clear majority of Americans (56% to 37%) are protectionists even today. Yet over the past year, support for protectionism in America has hardly increased. 
The poll also sought to measure support for economic liberalism in a second way, by looking at countries' internal economic policies. Respondents here were asked: ""Which of the following would you prefer? More free and open competition between suppliers of goods and services, or more controls, subsidies and regulations from your government?"" 
Arguably, this question tends to encourage the liberal answer, just as the one on trade tends to encourage the protectionist answer. Even so, the support for competition-within living memory a dirty word to many-is impressive. 
Globally, economic liberals are in a two-to-one majority on this question. In North America, the majority is nearer to four-to-one. In Asia the liberals outnumber their opponents by more than two-to-one. They are now in a clear majority in Western Europe, and a majority, albeit not statistically significant, in Latin America. Globally the majority favouring competition over government control is down slightly compared with last year, by five percentage points. But it remains solid. 
Furthermore, the poll sought to explore a third dimension of economic liberalism: support for the free movement of capital. The question was: ""There's been some discussion recently about whether or not there should be tighter restrictions on the movement of money from country to country. Some say there should be tighter restrictions on this. Others say that is not necessary. What do you think?"" 
Risky capital 
Unlike the other two measures, we were not able to compare views on this with views last year. The question was only devised this year in response to emerging criticism of the workings of free capital markets. However, the results for 1998 are less encouraging for liberals than the results of our questions on trade. 
Worldwide, there is a clear preference for tighter controls. 49% favour them with 37% against. Some 14% don't know. 
Only in Spain and Italy of the 22 countries surveyed do a clear majority of people favour free capital movements. In Asia, liberal Hong Kong now produces only a fivepercentage-point margin against restrictions, and Japan only a two percentagepoint-margin. Public opinion in Indonesia, South Korea, Thailand, and to a lesser extent in Taiwan and China is heavily against free capital movements. 
How might liberals react to these findings? There is a clear majority preferring competition to planning and regulations as a way of running an economy. Opinion on protectionism is divided but it remains stable; resisting it is no harder than it has ever been. Opinion is, however, hostile to free currency movements if not overwhelmingly so. So one way of assuaging public opinion would be to act to curb free currency and capital markets, preserving free markets in goods and services. 
Quite apart from its potential economic costs, however, this would be a risky strategy. Protectionist sentiment has a habit of starting with specific plausible cases and then extending to the general. Once the case is conceded in one area, capital movements, there is no guarantee that a new line could be held. 
A more promising avenue might be to tackle instead what public opinion worldwide seems to see as a major weakness of the international economic order: the weakness of its principal international institutions. The worldwide standing of those institutions is deplorably low. 
Take first the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Its policy of forcing budgetary discipline and market-based reform on member-countries has had the broad support of most pro-capitalist economists, though the developing world has been less enthusiastic. But that support is not mirrored in public opinion. Only one respondent in 20 worldwide says that they have ""a lot of confidence"" in the IMF. Only in India and the Philippines did more than one person in ten have a lot of confidence in the IMF. Internationally, four times as many respondents do not have much confidence at all in it, and those with little confidence outnumber those with confidence by nearly two to one. 
Nor does the IMF's sister organisation for development, the World Bank, fare any better. Again, four people think not much at all of its efforts for every one who has a lot of confidence in it. In only four countries of the 22 surveyed-India, Indonesia, Italy and the Philippines-do those favourable to the World Bank outnumber those unfavourable. Indeed, those questioned by our pollsters have more confidence in the United States to do something about world economic problems than they do for the work of either of the organisations specifically charged with dealing with such problems. For policymakers in 1999, that could prove powerful food for thought. 
The full poll results can be found on our website at www.economist.com  1999 IF THE most urgent question for Republicans in 1998 was why there was so little outrage about Bill Clinton's morals, the most urgent question for protectionists was why there was so little outrage about the surge in foreign takeovers of American companies. 
In the late 198os, when Japanese companies pocketed such American landmarks as the Rockefeller Centre and Columbia Pictures, the country went into a collective funk. A Newsweek cover declared that Japan was ""buying the soul of America""-and Michael Crichton wrote a best-seller, ""Rising Sun"", that was supposed to expose just how dreadful this prospect could be. In 1998, when foreign companies took over Random House, Chrysler, Bankers Trust and Amoco, there was scarcely a murmur of complaint. 
Why? Quite simply, because Americans are now convinced that theirs is the strongest economy in the world. In the 198os Americans hung their heads as the Japanese seized world-leadership in everything from cars to electronics. In the 199os they stood tall again as American companies dominated all the most exciting new industries, from computers to media to finance, and the American economy enjoyed its longest inflation-free expansion since 1945. 
Moreover, American firms are as likely to be the buyers as the bought. In 1989, American investment abroad was about half as much as foreign direct investment in the United States; in 1997, it was more than 25% bigger. Besides, a growing number of Americans-particularly in Silicon Valley and Hollywoodnow see foreign investors less as barbarians at the gates than as cash-rich country cousins who want nothing more than a chance to invest in American success. 
Still, for all their newfound self-confidence Americans remain surprisingly sceptical about free trade: far more sceptical than crisis-battered South Koreans or risk-averse Germans. Despite the booming economy, Bill Clinton has repeatedly failed to win renewal of his ""fast track"" authority to negotiate trade deals, blocking his desires to extend free trade to the whole of Latin America. 
Most of Mr Clinton's fellow Democrats in Congress don't share his enthusiasm for free trade, advocating all sorts of restrictions to do with labour and the environment; and a noisy group of Republican populists is intent on pushing their party in a more protectionist direction. An unholy alliance of these two factions succeeded in holding up the administration's request for $18 billion for the IMF for months, linking the grant to all sorts of time-wasting issues such as dolphin conservation. 
The fact that the IMF got its money in the end suggests that the initiative still lies with the internationalists. But the fact that, eight years into an economic boom, only 37% of Americans claim to support free trade also suggests that economic liberalism would have a harder time surviving trial by recession there than it has in much of the rest of the world.  1999 IF THE most urgent question for Republicans in 1998 was why there was so little outrage about Bill Clinton's morals, the most urgent question for protectionists was why there was so little outrage about the surge in foreign takeovers of American companies.

Americans are delighted with their own economy. Some 85% of Americans say it is performing well to only 14% who say it is performing poorly. By a majority of more than three to one, Americans say their own standard of living has improved. But they are not so confident about next year. More think that their economy will get worse than think it will get better. This is probably because a plurality of them are pretty pessimistic about the prospects for the world economy. 
By contrast, the Russians beat the Japanese by a short head for the title of the world's most despairing country. Of Russians, 98% think that the country is doing badly, compared with 91% of Japanese. By a four-to-one margin, the Russians expect things to get worse compared with a margin amongst the Japanese of just over three-to-one on the side of pessimism. 
Dissatisfaction with their government's performance is expressed by 87% of Russians; but an eccentric (nay, extraordinary) 9% think that it is doing well. Similarly, 86% of Japanese are dissatisfied with their government's performance, again with a loyalist 9% applauding their rulers' performance. 
Eighteen Russians think their living standard has got worse over the last year for every one who thinks it has improved. Eleven Japanese feel they are worse off for every one who feels better off. But the Japanese are much more pessimistic about the world economy than are the Russians. Barely more Russians expect the world economy to deteriorate than expect it to improve, but 39% of Japanese think it will deteriorate, while only 4% that it will improve. 
In Asia, gloom is not confined to Japan. South Korea is at the bottom of the pessimists' pack with 88% of her people thinking her economy is in poor shape. Indonesia and Thailand are not reckoned by their people to be doing much better, and Hong Kong is not far behind them. But in all four countries most people expect 1999 to be better economically than 1998. Can this be ascribed to an ""Asian value"" of optimism about the future? Well, in Japan the expectation is of a further deterioration. 
In Europe, outside Britain, the mood ahead of the launch of the single currency on January ist is quite buoyant. In France, Germany and Spain, pluralities think their economies are doing well. In Italy, however, slightly more people think it is doing poorly than think it is doing well. People in all four of these European countries think that their countries will do well in 1999 too. 
The United Kingdom is a bit of a European oddity. Britons are quite cheerful about the state of their economy and a higher proportion (58%) is satisfied with the performance of its government than is true in any other country surveyed outside Asia. But when it comes to prospects for next year, Britons are in pessimistic mood. Some 48% of them expect the world economy to deteriorate, with only 14% expecting it to improve. This is the most negative assessment in any country surveyed except Japan. 
While most of the European Union countries have become much keener on free trade and open markets, Britons have become more protectionist. Of those questioned in Britain, 53% now say they favour protection to 37% opposing it. This represents a net increase of IZ percentage points in protectionist sentiment between 1997 and 1998. 
Latin America is particularly gloomy. Amongst Mexicans, 85% think their economy is performing poorly, as do 75% of Brazilians. Only 29% of Latin Americans think their economy will improve next year, while 41% think it will get worse. The rest either don't know, or think it will stay the same. 
Comparing China and India, both think their economies are doing poorly, but the Indians are the more dissatisfied. Both think they will do better next year, with the Chinese much more optimistic Both also think the world economy will recover next year, again with the Chinese rather more optimistic  1999 Financial institutions are rushing to be ready for the euro's launch. The mood is confident, but there is no guarantee that things will follow the script 
THE dress rehearsals are over, the curtain is rising, and the leading players are scurrying to ensure that the performance begins on time-and wins plaudits. At lunchtime on December 31st, European finance ministers announced the rates at which ii national currencies would convert to Europe's single currency, the euro. By the time financial markets reopen on January 4th, banks must be ready to trade in euros. Between those dates lies a ""changeover weekend"", during which bankers, fund managers, securities dealers and regulators will be working around the clock, slurping not champagne but unseasonally sobering coffee. 
This frantic activity follows months of testing and retesting of banks' computer systems and their links to domestic stock exchanges and clearing houses. Some big banks have undergone five separate dry runs, and most claim they are ready. Still, there are plenty of butterflies. ""It's been like a play in which everyone has been rehearsing in separate dressing rooms,"" says Paul Cantwell of Andersen Consulting. ""When they all take the stage together, no one can be sure how the performance will go."" 
Still, there will be no shortage of action. Over the weekend, on top of doing their normal end-of-year accounts, financial firms must also plug the euro conversion rates into all of their software programs, reroute much of their foreign-exchange trading and redenominate bonds, shares, derivatives portfolios and bank accounts previously held in separate euro-zone currencies. Small wonder that, as well as booking up local hotel rooms, Goldman Sachs has taken the precaution of designating special ""rest areas"" for weary staff 
Although Britain is not adopting the euro, the City, as Europe's largest financial centre, has a feverish air of expectation. After three years of military-style planning, some 30,ooo financial folk will work over the new year weekend to guarantee a smooth transition. Fearful for London's financial-centre status, the City of London Corporation, a wealthy local authority run as a benevolent dictatorship, is doing its bit. It is paying to keep open the ""drain"", a short but key commuter line; making all of its 3,500 parking spaces free; and banning noisy construction work over the weekend. 
Regulators too will be missing lots of new year parties. The Bank of England is bringing in 300 staff to oversee internal changes and monitor the banking system. However, in a sign of public-sector austerity, hungry staff will have to pay for their own take-away food outside normal hours (contrast this with one French bank, which for some weeks has had a member of staff testing possible menus for the right balance of nourishment for the overwrought brain). All of Europe's national central banks will be in regular contact with the European Central Bank's changeover committee, which will be on hand to take emergency action. Members of the ECB'S governing council have been asked to stay within reach of a secure telephone. 
Judging by the mood in Frankfurt, they won't be needed. German bankers ooze confidence, scoffing at talk of last-minute panics. Deutsche Borse, which runs the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, has spent six months fine-tuning its trading and settlement systems for the euro, and does not expect its 9o-strong conversion team to be particularly busy at the weekend. So confident is it that it has set up a special web site (www.eurostatus.exchange.de) so the curious can check on its progress hour by hour. 
Not that the Germans are leaving much to chance. At Commerzbank, where 400 employees will be at work or on stand-by, all calls into the bank will be routed directly to mobile telephones, so that everyone can be reached within seconds. Deutsche Bank has conducted 59 separate trial runs, linking its computers with clearing systems around Europe. During the conversion weekend, 2,ooo employees in 40 offices worldwide will be reporting to a ""global control centre"" in Eschborn, just outside Frankfurt. Deutsche claims it will be the only bank able to offer its full range of products in euros from January 4th. 
After a year in which it lost ground in the race to establish itself as a financial centre for Europe, Paris has no intention of missing any tricks over the conversion to the euro. Two years of preparation, and three rehearsals, culminating in a full dry run in November, have left the city's too-odd financial institutions quietly confident that the traditional French mastery of logistics will ensure a smooth meshing of gears over the long weekend. In all, lo,ooo people will play some part in the 9oo steps into which the exercise has been broken down. Banque Nationale de Paris has hung a 4,ooo-piece jigsaw puzzle in its euro control room, to remind the 6o0 people who will be toiling there that every little bit must fit into the bigger picture. 
Technical efficiency is one thing, but no preparations would be complete without making allowance for that other great French tradition-the strike. The French Bankers Association and the unions have duly negotiated special exemptions from the usual limits on working hours and requirements for Sunday rest. 
Attitudes in Italy seem altogether more laid back. Italian banks say they are ready for the euro, but have much smaller changeover teams on hand than their French and German counterparts. And compared with the Germans, the Italians do not seem to mind if everything does not go like clockwork. A senior official from the Bank of Italy, the central bank, says languidly, ""It will not be the end of the world if things go wrong on Monday. Systems will be working fine on Tuesday or Wednesday."" 
For all the confident talk, there are legitimate fears that the conversion process could still be derailed. Never before has so much depended on so many financial institutions doing so many things simultaneously. Michael Foot, the director in charge of euro planning at the Financial Services Authority, Britain's financial regulator, acknowledges three concerns for the weekend: that banks will run out of time; that data will be corrupted; and that some markets will not be able to reopen first thing Monday morning. Moreover, custodians might ""lose"" assets, and thus be unable to release them. 
Beyond the weekend lies much more work, including tests for settlement systems. Mistakes by one bank in paying another-for example by paying into the wrong account-could prevent the payee from settling its own debts, leading to financial gridlock. SHIFT, which runs a network through which many interbank payments are made, has assembled a 150strong team to help banks deal with payments problems. To avoid bottlenecks, it has warned banks against paying in very large batches. ""Like everyone else we are hoping for the best, but planning for the worst,"" says a spokesman. 
For all the gloomy scenarios, no one is much concerned about the big institutions. At least, not directly. All the big banks in Europe are convinced that they have done enough tinkering-or will have done by Monday-to greet the euro with confidence. Merrill Lynch, for example, has set aside around $8om for the total cost of conversion. More worrying are small and middie-sized banks, which are generally much less well prepared, and the knock-on effect their lack of foresight may have on others. As one apparently well-prepared banker from Salomon Smith Barney puts it: ""You can be driving carefully, but if someone comes around the corner and smashes into you, there isn't much you can do.""  1999 HOWEVER much of a challenge the birth of the euro may seem to bankers in Milan, Italy's financial centre, in the Sicilian capital of Palermo it is being seen as a disaster. The Sicilian regional government is gripped by a financial crisis. Its problem is simple: the regional government has run out of cash (it needs 1.7 trillion lire-$i billion-to balance this year's books) and can't persuade anyone to give it more. Franco Piro, Sicily's head of finance, complains that Sicily is owed 3 trillion lire by the central government. ""We are being punished by the criteria of the Maastricht treaty,"" he moans: the central government has been squeezing spending to fit the country's budget deficit into the 3% corset needed to qualify for euro membership. 
The regional government had previously been able to get loans from domestic and foreign banks to plug the hole; but on December 23rd, the 45 banks that it had approached refused to help. Although Mr Piro ascribes bankers' reluctance to the distractions of Christmas and preparations for the euro, there were weightier reasons for it. Some 30% of bank loans in Sicily are non-performing; the regional government itself has run up some 6 trillion lire in unpaid bills. Nasty experiences in Asia and Russia have made banks more wary of such borrowers. 
Above all, Sicily suffers a huge credibility problem, says Pietro Busetta, head of Fon-dazione Curella, a Palermo thinktank. Local politicians have squandered Sicily's annual budget; many have sought office only for personal gain. ""The solution is to pull down the shutters on the regional government, he suggests. Responsibility could be shifted to Sicily's city councils, which in recent years have been strikingly more efficient than the regional tier. 
But this is unlikely to happen soon. In any case, after changes in central and regional governments in November, both the governing coalition and the Sicilian regional government are now of a similar political complexion. Mr Busetta thinks that makes a rescue from Rome more likely. And there's a bonus: having slipped the lira into the euro, the Italian government is now unlikely to give financial rigour a high priority.  1999 HOWEVER much of a challenge the birth of the euro may seem to bankers in Milan, Italy's financial centre, in the Sicilian capital of Palermo it is being seen as a disaster.

And there's a bonus: having slipped the lira into the euro, the Italian government is now unlikely to give financial rigour a high priority.  1999 HOWEVER much of a challenge the birth of the euro may seem to bankers in Milan, Italy's financial centre, in the Sicilian capital of Palermo it is being seen as a disaster. The Sicilian regional government is gripped by a financial crisis. Its problem is simple: the regional government has run out of cash (it needs 1.7 trillion lire-$1 billion-to balance this year's books) and can't persuade anyone to give it more. Franco Piro, Sicily's head of finance, complains that Sicily is owed 3 trillion lire by the central government. ""We are being punished by the criteria of the Maastricht treaty,"" he moans: the central government has been squeezing spending to fit the country's budget deficit into the 3% corset needed to qualify for euro membership. 
The regional government had previously been able to get loans from domestic and foreign banks to plug the hole; but on December 23rd, the 45 banks that it had approached refused to help. Although Mr Piro ascribes bankers' reluctance to the distractions of Christmas and preparations for the euro, there were weightier reasons for it. Some 30% of bank loans in Sicily are non-performing; the regional government itself has run up some 6 trillion lire in unpaid bills. Nasty experiences in Asia and Russia have made banks more wary of such borrowers. 
Above all, Sicily suffers a huge credibility problem, says Pietro Busetta, head of Fon-dazione Curella, a Palermo thinktank. Local politicians have squandered Sicily's annual budget; many have sought office only for personal gain. ""The solution is to pull down the shutters on the regional government, he suggests. Responsibility could be shifted to Sicily's city councils, which in recent years have been strikingly more efficient than the regional tier. 
But this is unlikely to happen soon. In any case, after changes in central and regional governments in November, both the governing coalition and the Sicilian regional government are now of a similar political complexion. Mr Busetta thinks that makes a rescue from Rome more likely. And there's a bonus: having slipped the lira into the euro, the Italian government is now unlikely to give financial rigour a high priority.  1999 READING, as one does, the fine print IN of a MasterCard annual report in a Chinese cafe is a perplexing experience. China, where few ordinary citizens have a credit card (indeed, where credit-cardstyle revolving consumer lending is illegal), is MasterCard's second-largest market after America. In 1997, the latest year for which figures are available, its turnover in China was an astounding $73 billion. 
How is the circle squared? As in some other countries, MasterCards in China are more debit than credit cards: cardholders must deposit money into their accounts. Purchases are deducted from these funds. MasterCard's success in China is thus more an indictment of the country's dreadful banks than a capitalist celebration of plastic. Almost all transactions are between businesses for big-ticket items such as tractors and trainloads of raw materials. Chinese companies often use credit cards-rather than cheques or wire transfers-to buy goods and services from each other. 
In the mid-198os, when MasterCard entered the market, the clearing system between banks in different cities was (and is) almost non-existent: a cheque could take up to a month to clear, and many sellers would not release goods until it did. The country did not have the nationwide telecommunications networks necessary for an electronic clearing system. Company executives were forced to carry suitcases of cash if they wanted to seal a deal on the spot. MasterCard uses people at the end of a telephone to approve a purchase rather than computerised links, thus making do with what is available. 
But the company's best days in China may be over. In 1999 the government plans a nationwide electronic clearing and settlement system to connect financial institutions. Still, MasterCard may not be too worried. These, after all, are Chinese banks: expect delays.  1999 SHARE prices in much of the world ended 1998 higher than they started it. Oddly, at the same time, the profitability of companies is shrinking, even in the world's leading economies. This begs the question of whether equity prices in rich countries now make any sense at all-but it also gives ominous warning of disappointing economic growth to come in 1999 
Share prices rose, on average, by more than 15% in 1998 in six of the rich world's biggest economies. But in the third quarter, the latest period for which there is data, company profits were 12% lower than a year earlier in those economies (see chart). Much of this is due to the continued sufferings of Japanese firms. But corporate profitability has fallen compared with the previous year in the other big economies as well. 
Continued economic strife in Asia is one cause of slimmer profit margins elsewhere. The devaluation of Asian currencies, and a huge amount of excess productive capacity, have intensified global price competition, especially in homogeneous, tradable goods such as textiles, chemicals and commodities. But in America and Britain, several years of decent economic growth have driven down unemployment to such an extent that labour costs are starting to rise-although the impact of this has been cushioned by higher productivity. 
These factors are unlikely to go away in 1999. And in continental Europe, the launch of the euro may increase price competition by making differences in pricing between countries in the euro-zone more transparent to consumers. 
In the case of corporate profits, the main uncertainty is how fast, if at all, the world's big economies will grow. The frenzied cutting of short-term interest rates by central bankers since the autumn's brief financial-market crisis seems to have averted the worst for now. But yields on corporate bonds, especially American ones, are typically higher now than six months ago, because investors are more worried about the riskiness of these securities. 
Worse, the recent decline in corporate profitability may itself point to slower growth ahead. In the past, changing profitability has been a useful lead indicator of economic trends. One reason is that, when firms earn lower profits, they generally become less optimistic about their future profitability, and vice versa-and so cut (or boost) their investment spending accordingly. Capital spending by companies is an important contributor to economic growth. If there is less of it, growth suffers. In continental Europe, most of the economic growth during the 199os was due to higher spending by companies. 
America's economy is now especially vulnerable to a sharp reduction in investment by firms. Much attention has been lavished on American consumers' alarming recent habit of spending more than they earn. But American companies also have a ""negative savings ratio"", points out David Mackie, an economist at J.P. Morgan, because they have been borrowing so much to invest. British and continental European companies, in contrast, have not paid for capital spending in the 199os by getting deeper into debt. 
Running up debts to finance investment may make sense in conditions of rapid economic growth. But, when growth slows and profitability tumbles, heavy indebtedness will force companies to make ferocious cuts in capital spending. Mr Mackie thinks this could be severe enough to push the American economy into deep recession. A similar thing happened in Japan, that other ""miracle economy"", in the early i99os. Companies had been borrowing and investing as though the economy would grow for ever. Its economy is still paying the price. Japan's problems have mired Asia in recession; if America's economy went down the plughole, the rest of the world would probably follow suit.  1999 Profits of doom

CAR makers have long used sex to peddle their wares. Recently, however, a new twist to this old idea has developed. Or, rather, two twists-the double helix of DNA. For both BMW and Renault have based their latest European marketing campaigns around this icon of modem biology. Their advertising agents, it seems, have decided that genetics is metaphorically, as well as literally, sexy. 
Advertising agents, of course, are paid to be sensitive to subtle shifts in the Zeitgeist, so the two campaigns might be seen as an indication of how the public actually perceives genetics and the related subject of evolutionary theory. Not surprisingly, a few outdated myths are perpetuated. Both advertisements, for instance, play on the popular conception of evolution not just as change, but as progress-something which many biologists would dispute. But the gist of the advertising shows just how much the central concerns of modern biology have indeed entered the popular consciousness. (There is also a surprising popular appetite for mathematics-see box on next page.) 
BMW'S campaign, which launches its new 3-series sports saloon in Britain and Ireland, shows the new creation and four of its earlier incarnations zigzagging around a landscape made up of giant DNA sequences, with a brief explanation that DNA is the molecule responsible for the inheritance of such features as strength, power and intelligence. The Renault offering, which promotes its existing Laguna model, employs evolutionary theory even more explicitly. The company's television commercials intersperse clips of the car with scenes from a lecture by Steve Jones, a professor of genetics at University College London. Besides Dr Jones, who is one of Britain's most media-friendly scientists, the lecture features pictures of fossils of extinct animals called trilobites, and also the cliched ascent of man from ape to human. 
According to Jeremy Hemmings, who heads BMW's campaign at wcRs, a London advertising firm, the advertisement is intended to convey the idea of development allied to heritage. The latest product, in other words, should be viewed as the new and improved scion of a long line of good cars-with the implication that what is true of the car is also true of the driver. 
The advertisement is stark and highly stylised. To the untutored eye, the DNA sequences look like enormous black-runged ladders (they are actually enlargements of the electrophoretic gels used to tease out the individual genetic ""letters"" of which DNA is composed). But the eyes of BMW drivers are not, of course, untutored. The car is a status symbol in a society where success depends on knowledge, and the ad panders to the presumption that its viewers will have the knowledge to understand it. According to Mr Hemmings, they do. It has had one of BMW'S highest awareness ratings-a measure of how well people remember the product, and the message conveyed. 
Renault's message, according to Jonathan Wignall, the head of the Laguna campaign at the company's British subsidiary, is more subtle. It is that evolution works by gradual improvements rather than sudden leaps (in this, Renault is aligning itself with biological orthodoxy). So, although the new car in the advertisement may look like the old one, the external form conceals a number of significant changes to the engine. While these alterations are almost invisible to the average driver, Renault hopes they will improve the car's performance, and ultimately its survival in the marketplace. 
Whether they actually do so will depend, in part, on whether marketeers have read the public mood correctly. For, even if genetics really does offer a useful metaphor for automobiles, employing it in advertising is not without its dangers. 
That is because DNA'S public image is ambiguous. In one context, people may see it as the cornerstone of modern medical progress. In another, it will bring to mind such controversial issues as abortion, genetically modified foodstuffs, and the sinister subject of eugenics. 
In some countries, such as Germany (where the BMW campaign has not run, even though the company is German), people are particularly sensitive to these issues. And when genetics is not merely a metaphor, but the actual product, things can go horribly wrong-as Monsanto, an American biotechnology company, found when it spent L1m ($1.68m) attempting to persuade the British ofthe merits of genetically engineered foodstuffs. The actual effect of the campaign, unluckily for Monsanto, was to alert sceptical consumers to the fact that something they may have thought would be happening in the indeterminate future was about to hit their supermarket shelves. Few liked the idea. 
Car makers are probably standing on safer ground than biotechnology firms. But even they can make mistakes. Though it would not be obvious to the casual observer, some of the DNA which features in BMW'S ads for its nice, new car once belonged to a woolly mammoth-a beast that has been extinct for 10,000 years. Not, presumably, quite the message that the marketing department was trying to convey.  1999 IF AN old rule of thumb from the publishing industry is to believed, every equation included in a book halves the number sold. Yet in recent months several mathematical treatises have become bestsellers. Slim volumes have told the stories of the numbers e, n (which has also had a film named after it) and i (the square root of-1), while other books have explored the nature of infinity, the workings of calculus and, most successfully of all, how Fermat's last theorem was eventually proved after centuries of effort. Given how much schoolchildren hate maths, this is all rather surprising. 
The secret, it turns out, is to stick to the old rule and leave out the dreaded equations-and, indeed, any other scary-looking squiggles likely to remind readers of their school days. Instead, mathematical blockbusters take the form of biographies (often, admittedly, of numbers, not people), histories (of the calendar, for exampie), quests (to prove or disprove things), or coming-of-age tales such as ""Good Will Hunting"", a film in which a young prodigy redeems himself through mathematics. In other words, standard story-telling devices are used to sugar the mathematical pill. 
The resulting books and films are appealing for two reasons, according to Peter Tallack of Weidenfeld & Nicolson, a British publisher. First, they are aspirational: they offer readers the illusion of grappling with mathematical concepts, without having to do the hard work of actually understanding them. A classic example is Simon Singh's book on Fermat's last theorem, which wafts such abstruse ideas as modular forms, elliptic curves, and Galois theory under the reader's nose. 
The second reason is that these mathematical blockbusters provide an attractive and convenient excuse for people who hated maths at school. ""Look,"" they can say, ""I liked this book, so I must simply have had useless teachers."" (Do not ask someone who offers this excuse after reading Dr Singh's book to prove Fermat's last theorem over dinner.) 
Publishers may not understand much maths either, but they know how to add up the profits from a winning formula. More maths books are heading for the printing presses. Three tomes about zero alone are currently in production. Just wait for the numbers from sales of the film rights. 
pattern of the liquid crystals is designed to produce the same effect on the passing light that a real P2000 would have. The two subbeams are then recombined in the normal way and the result shone on to a 2mm-wide square on a piece of photosensitive plastic to create a hogel. 
In practice, three lasers-one for each of the primary colours red, green and blueare shone through the screen simultaneously to produce a full-colour hogel. The process is then repeated for a neighbouring hogel using a neighbouring ray trace. 
Making the master image is a time-consuming process. The ray trace for each hogel must be computed separately; even using the latest Silicon Graphics supercomputers, that takes over a second. The whole image, therefore, requires about 3oo hours to generate. (It contains around three terabytes of data, which is more than a copy of the film ""Titanic"".) Making subsequent copies should, however, be a lot faster. Zebra reckons that, once the number-crunching has been done, it will be possible to turn them out at the rate of 12 an hour. 
The Detroit display is, of course, a publicity stunt. It is unlikely that customers will be content to inspect a mere hologram before they buy. But the Zebra system has several serious purposes. When perfected, it will speed up the design process by giving engineers a real sense of what their brainchildren look like, without the need for the clay models they currently employ. And, when a design is completed, the senior executives who make the decision about whether to put it into production will have a much better idea of what it is that they are approving or rejecting. 
If mass produced, Zebra's system could also add a new dimension to poster advertising-and not just in the car industry. The company is planning to market the invention to a wide range of advertising and entertainment firms. So, although the holodeck of the starship Enterprise may still be some way off, the ads for Star Trek movies may soon have their own dimensions of virtual reality.  1999 JOURNALISTS attending the Detroit Motor Show-the American automobile industry's top annual shindig-are used to seeing concept cars. These are vehicles that incorporate the sort of technological wizardry which manufacturers hope to put into their production models a year or two hence. This year, however, Ford will go one better. The star of its stand is the P2000, a car that is not so much conceptual as non-existent. And yet visitors to the stand will be able to walk around it, look inside and underneath it, and do almost everything to it that motoring journalists normally do except kick its tyres and drive off in it. For the P2000 is a hologram. 
Holography, of course, is nothing new. But the technology that has produced the P2ooo is a significant step forward for several reasons. First, it allows holograms to be big (currently, the largest are about a metre, or three feet, across; the P2000 image is printed on ten 6ocm-square panels, making it three metres by two). Second, it abolishes the weird distortions of parallax which normal holograms suffer when examined from the wrong direction. Third, it produces accurate colours. And fourth, you don't actually have to have a real object to photograph. 
This holographic paragon was invented by Michael Klug and his colleagues at Zebra Imaging, in Austin, Texas, when they were students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media Laboratory. It works by building on a surprising holographic principle-that each bit of the film carrying a hologram actually contains a whole image. (In other words, if you cut a piece of holographic film in two, and look at one half, you will still see a complete picture, albeit with a more restricted view.) 
Zebra's process makes this explicit. Its holograms are, like a television image, composed of numerous elements (called ""hogels"", in imitation of a television screen's ""pixels""), each of which is a complete hologram in its own right, but is taken from a slightly different angle to its neighbours. 
""Taken"" is, perhaps, not quite the right word. Since the P2000 doesn't exist, there is no object to take even a single image of, let alone the 9oo,ooo images that go to make up the Zebra hologram. This deficiency is made up for by the computers in Ford's design department, on which the P200 has been conceived. These machines are able to ""view"" the new car from any angle they like, under any lighting conditions that are programmed into them, and it is these individual views, known as ray traces, that are used to generate the hogels. 
A hologram of a real object is made by splitting a laser beam in two, reflecting one of the two resulting sub-beams off the object of interest, recombining the sub-beams, and exposing a photographic plate or film to the result. The interference between the subbeam that has been reflected off the object and the unaffected (or ""reference"") sub-beam produces a pattern on the plate which, when developed and illuminated, reveals a three-dimensional picture of the original object. 
In the case of the P2,ooo, the object sub-beam is directed through a liquid-crystal screen rather than on to a real object. The screen is under computer control, and the pattern of the liquid crystals is designed to produce the same effect on the passing light that a real P2000 would have. The two subbeams are then recombined in the normal way and the result shone on to a 2mm-wide square on a piece of photosensitive plastic to create a hogel.

So, although the holodeck of the starship Enterprise may still be some way off, the ads for Star Trek movies may soon have their own dimensions of virtual reality.  1999 IN THE next few days the shutters will be coming off the world's biggest scientific mirror. It is 8.3 metres (326 inches) across, and although it sits on a mountain top on the island of Hawaii rather than in Japan itself, it is the pride and joy of Japanese astronomy. It is the heart of the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan's latest toy, the Subaru telescope-a device named after the star cluster known to westerners as the Pleiades. 
National pride was, indeed, an important motive for building the new telescope. That its mirror is 10cm wider than any other telescope's gives Japan's bureaucrats a warm glow that probably makes up for their having to change the law to grant diplomatic privileges to the civil-service astronomers travelling to Hawaii to operate it That it is 6.42 metres wider than the mirror of the country's largest existing instrument-a tiddler located near Okayama, in western Honshugives an even warmer glow to the astronomers themselves. Now they will be able to make some serious observations in the visible and infra-red frequencies, and thus hold up their heads at conferences. 
Such size, however, can bring problems of its own. Big mirrors are expensive, so the modern trend is towards computer-controlled arrays of smaller, cheaper mirrors that can be co-ordinated to mimic the behaviour of a single large one. Big mirrors also tend to sag under their own weight, distorting as they move around to look at different parts of the sky. 
In Subaru's case the sagging is dealt with by making the mirror thin-a mere 20cm from back to front. Though that also makes it more flexible (and makes the ability to grind and polish the glass to create a light-capturing parabolic surface without actually breaking the thing all the more impressive), this flexibility can be exploited to keep the reflective surface in shape. 
That is done by 261 ""actuator"" arms, which push on the mirror from behind to preserve the curvature so precisely that it can distinguish two objects 1/18,000th of a degree apart-the equivalent of being able to spot a tennis ball on the neighbouring island of Maui, 100km away. 
This, combined with a new digital camera developed for it by Mitsubishi Electric, will make it the most powerful groundbased optical telescope around. And when its aluminium coating is replaced with silver in a year or two's time (a huge vacuumchamber housed at the telescope's base will be used to deposit metallic vapour on to the mirror's reflecting surface), it will be able to see into the infra-red with equal clarity, opening up a much neglected area of astronomy. Indeed, at some wavelengths it should out-perform the Hubble space telescope, which does not even have the handicap of looking through the atmosphere. 
But what will it search for? One bothersome thing astronomers have discovered, as they have peered ever deeper into space, has been unexpected regions of sheer emptiness. Like huge bubbles, these so-called ""great voids"", which are hundreds of millions of light-years across, seem to be surrounded by thin films. In this case the films are composed of billions of individual galaxies. The universe, in other words, appears to be made of foam. 
The most likely explanation for this is that gravitational forces from invisible socalled ""dark matter""-perhaps lOO times more abundant than the observable matter in the universe-are tugging that observable matter into odd shapes. By measuring some of these large bubbles, Norio Kaifu, the head of the project in Hawaii, hopes that Subaru will provide astronomers with a clearer idea of what, if it actually exists, the dark matter really is. 
Further out into space, beyond lo billion light-years, Subaru will be able to see the universe in its infancy-not long after the primordial fireball cooled enough to become transparent. While still unable to observe the actual beginning of the universe (signs of which are reckoned to be 15 billion light-years away), the telescope will be able to detect some of the earliest objects to condense from the primordial gas. 
These objects are predicted to be galaxies in their initial star-forming phase, with giant black holes at their centres. Dr Kaifu hopes to find them by using naturally occurring ""gravitational lenses"" to boost Subaru's magnification still further. 
A gravitational lens is a galaxy that lies exactly between a more distant object and the earth. Its gravitational field thus bends and focuses the light from the distant object, making it appear closer than it really is. Such lenses have already been used successfully by the Hubble telescope but, with its longer reach, Subaru ought to be able to employ them to look still further afield. Size, it appears, does matter after all.  1999 The war against drugs is either not working or succeeding at too high a cost, several recent books agree. What should replace it is harder to be certain of

THE Fix By Michael Massing. Simon and Schuster; 335 pages; $25 
WAR is a dirty business, and the war Won drugs involves plenty of filth: deceit, corruption and damage to civil liberties, not to mention outright violence-and that's just from the good guys. Every struggle has to have heroes, and America's antidrugs campaign makes its casting billboard-clear. The white hats are enforcement agents stamping out narcotics at home and abroad, police sweeping dealers and users off the streets,judges jailing drug offenders, not to mention plucky little civilians who ""just say no"". The black hats are shadowy figures: greedy drug barons, mostly foreign, who exploit their own countrymen and corrupt America's children. Congress and Hollywood, spurred on by alarmed parents, have created such a drugs mythology that the good and evil of narcotics is now as distinct, to many, as Mother Teresa and Saddam Hussein. 
Yet today's highly militarised drugs campaign originated in more than medicine and morality. From the start the war has involved political interest and financial gain, as well as frequent misunderstanding-not to mention downright misrepresentation-of the best evidence about drugs' medical and social effects. 
If these were novel or incidental mistakes, the war might be more understandable. But, along with social concern and good sense, modern drug policy has from the start involved fear and unreason, often directed against foreigners or outsiders. It is almost 125 years since authorities in San Francisco launched an early salvo in the western war on drugs by clamping down on opium use among the growing population of Chinese labourers. In the years leading up to the Harrison Act of 1914, which amounted to the first federal ban on nonmedical narcotics, its drafters played on fears of drug-crazed, sex-mad negroes to win support in the South. 
Then 20 years later, the spectre of the sky-high, violent Mexican immigrant was played up to sell the public on the criminalising of marijuana. At several times since the 1930s, governments have used the drug card, whether to lean on dispensible foreign dictators or to brush back homegrown countercultures. 
One thing that has changed, though, are the high stakes that America is willing to play. In 198o, the federal government spent around $1 billion on drug control; federal, state and local spending last year exceeded $30 billion, which includes much expanded programmes of crop eradication, border patrolling and sting operations. Only a third of the federal government's drug-control spending goes on drugs education or drugs treatment. 
How much success this money buys depends on your definition. According to United Nations estimates, Americans are spending almost $60 billion on illegal drugs a year, mainly on the ""soft"" drug, marijuana, and its ""hard"" counterparts, cocaine and heroin. These are, unavoidably, guesstimates. But nobody seriously contests that drugs continue to pour into America and that prices have fallen. Cocaine costs half or less what it did in the early 198os and heroin sells for just under $1,ooo a gram, three-fifths of its price a decade ago. Purity has also increased. In the 198os, street heroin was so adulterated that injecting straight into the blood was the surest way to achieve a high. Now fixes are commonly more than 5o% pure, which means that users who might be deterred by needles can smoke or snort the drug instead. 
A third of all Americans admit to having tried drugs and at least 13m are occasional users. Drug arrests were i.im in 1995, double the 198o figure. There are 400,ooo Americans behind bars for drug offences, eight times the number 19 years ago. 
Those who fight the war on drugs, with its strict penalties at home and sharp punishment abroad, point to seizures of both drugs and their users as victories. In their terms, they are. And if slowing the spread of hard drugs is a sensible goal, which it seems to be, there is indeed good news. Nationwide studies of drug use, such as the University of Michigan survey of high-school students, suggest that although teenage marijuana use has risen in recent years, experimentation with cocaine or heroin among young, first-time users has stayed fairly steady. Those who question or oppose the drugs war, however, reckon that this is the wrong body count. Although casual hard-drug consumption may be dropping, the number of hard-core hard drug users-those most directly associated with the private and collective misery of drugshas scarcely budged since the war began. 
Instead the war's critics propose an entirely new approach that drops or downplays military means and abandons unconditional surrender as the goal. The antiwar doves, as will be seen, form a growing and disputatious camp. Yet whether they favour disapproval or toleration, continued prohibition or legalisation, most doves accept that core drug abuse is not going to be eradicated at an acceptable price, that crusading moralism is counterproductive and that drugs policy should be refocused on education for the young and ""harm reduction"" for habitual users-for example, methadone programmes, needle-exchange centres or prescription heroin. 
It sounds like common sense. But good sense alone will not end the war on drugs. Both the law makers and law breakers have too much invested in the conflict for either to lay down arms easily. Even amid falling prices, drug producers continue to profit from the risk premium that prohibition puts on their multi-billion dollar industry. The anti-drug warriors' jobs and budgets depend on expensive enforcement and lucrative asset seizures. Having demonised their foes, they can only with great difficulty now make peace with the devil. 
Back to the future 
Neither side is above massaging the drugs statistics. But anyone who suspects that the critics of the drugs war are toying with the facts should read ""Drug Crazy"". This book describes the origins and consequences of America's present narcotics policy. It moves from gangland drug busts to Colombian coca plantations to Mexican border patrols. This is reportage from the front line, told with all the verve of an action film, a style which no doubt owes much to the fact that its author, Mike Gray, is a Hollywood screenwriter and producer. 
Mr Gray does not shrink from describing the violence of the drugs war, from shoot-outs in the ghettoes of Chicago to explosions on the streets of Bogota. But the legal burden of America's current drug policy comes through most clearly in his description of how drug dealers are brought to justice. Chicago's county court, which has seen its caseload quadruple in the last 20 years largely because of continued tightening of policy on drugs, now runs round the clock. 
Although most people who take crack cocaine are white, 96% of the crack defendants in federal courts are black or Hispanic. This is largely because white people, being richer, do their deals behind closed doors, while blacks and Hispanics tend to trade on the streets, where they are more easily watched and arrested. 
The night shift at Cook County court catches only the foot soldiers of such drug armies as Chicago's Gangster Disciples. The officers stay out of sight and, generally, out of jail. Justice is summary, and baffling: ten-minute trials lead to five-year sentences for possession of a fifth of an ounce of crack, while the same amount of powdered cocaine lands its owner a few weeks in prison. Crack is cocaine mixed with baking soda to make it smokable and stronger. But concentrating the drug also concentrates the penalty, introduced during the crack scare of the 198os. As blacks use more crack than powdered cocaine, the punishment falls disproportionately on them. Arrest and imprisonment are scarcely deterrents. A young lawyer at the county court is quoted as saying, ""We're not producing justice here. We're manufacturing revolutionaries."" 
On a continent once famous for revolutionaries-Latin America-the tough position of the United States has had mixed effects. The Bush administration spent $2 billion on crop eradication and substitution, spraying the jungle and bribing peasants to plant passion fruit rather than coca plants-with little success. By 1992, cocaine production had grown by 15% and the business had spread across an area the size of the continental United States. It had also become frighteningly efficient, first dominated by Pablo Escobar (a ""ruthless killer"", as Mr Gray describes him, with ""a pleasant side"") in Medellin and then the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers in Cali. The high-tech barriers America erected along its borders have succeeded in diverting entry of South American cocaine from Florida to California and Texas via Mexico, thereby drawing another country into the violence and corruption which has plagued Colombia. And the high premium that the criminalisation of drugs places on them means that South America has turned its eye to heroin, a far more profitable drug than cocaine. 
None of this, as Mr Gray stresses, should come as a surprise. America's last concerted effort at substance control, prohibition of alcohol in the 192os, had similar effects. It inflated prices, drove bootleg suppliers to organise, encouraged the spread of guns and crime, corrupted a quarter of the federal enforcement agents-and doubled the consumption of hard liquor, all within a decade. Nor does ""Drug Crazy"" neglect the influence of stubborn or strong-minded individuals. It is full of outsize characters from the past: Hamilton Wright, for example, an American doctor turned diplomat, who tried to bully the world into drug prohibition, crafted the Harrison Narcotics Act and was later sacked for drinking on the job. Or Harry Anslinger, head of drug enforcement from 1930 to to i962, who perfected the sledge hammer school of narcotics control and invoked every menace from axemen to communism. 
Drugs in history 
Because the drugs war is so noisy and so visible, it is often easy to forget that drugs are not just an American issue. Martin Booth's ""Opium: A History"" charts the rise of heroin from its ancient origins in the poppies of Eastern Europe to modern-day trade on the streets of America. The book's wealth of detail is remarkable: all aspects botanical, political, economic, cultural and pharmacological are discussed (including the unexpected etymology of such slang as ""hip"", ""hype"" and ""junkie""). Unlike ""Drug Crazy"" which is mainly focused on the Americas, much of ""Opium"" is set in Europe and Asia, giving the book a more international perspective and more comprehensive feel. 
Although Mr Booth's accounts of famous addicts, from Clive of India to John Pemberton, the inventor of Coca-Cola, make for interesting reading, the real fascination of ""Opium"" is in its account of the common man's habit through history. Until the Harrison Act, morphine and opium-mainly in the tincture laudanum or as patent medicine-were freely available in America, as they were in Europe. Opium was a sovereign cure in Victorian England for afflictions ranging from diarrhoea to depression. Babies were fed the drug in soothing syrups such as Godfrey's Cordial, leading to claims of physical and mental retardation, exactly the same concerns voiced about today's ""crack babies"". 
In 1868, British public health authorities took most opiates out of the hands of grocers and put them into those of dispensing doctors and pharmacists (as, in America, did the Harrison Act). Starting with the International Opium Commission of 1909, American efforts to curtail world manufacture, sale and distribution of opium and its derivatives met with lively resistance from Europe, India and other countries with a stake in the international trade. Yet from the 1920s to the 198os, a series of international treaties forced countries to clamp down on the production, trade and consumption of opiates, whether for ritual, for fun or as self-administered medicine. In that time, the penalties for peddling and possession tended to climb, especially in America. 
One clear historical lesson that emerges from ""Opium"" is that people will take drugs whether or not they are proscribed, and they will do so for all sorts of reasonsto escape life's burdens, for adventure, for straightforward fun. In 19th-century Britain, Mr Booth tells us, the Fens of East Anglia were awash in opium. Agricultural labourers took their pennyworth of ""elevation"" along with a nightly beer as a lift out of working drudgery. This is not so far from the plight of crack addicts in America's inner cities, boxed in by poverty, deadend jobs and broken families. 
What does vary widely with history, however, are official attitudes towards the drug trade. As Britain followed America's line in the 198os and got ""tough on drugs"", complaints were regularly fired against heroin-producing nations, such as Pakistan. Supply-side control was seen as the solution to the drug problem; if only these people would pull up their poppies, then Western drug use would plummet. Ironically, exactly the same argument was used against the British in the early 19th century, when they foisted opium from India on the Chinese in exchange for tea. When China's then drug czar, Lin Ts-hsu, complained to the British that they were breaking imperial edicts banning opium import and possession, the prime minister, Lord Palmerston, replied that the opium trade was a Chinese problem and that it should be dealt with by controlling consumption. His logic sounds familiar today. 
Such shifts are common in drug debates, according to Richard Rudgley, a University of Oxford anthropologist. Which intoxicants are forbidden and which tolerated has never added up to a very coherent story. How many exasperated parents have lectured teenagers about drugs while pouring themselves a third drink or lighting another fag? Some of the most debilitating and addictive compounds, such as alcohol and tobacco, are permitted while less obviously damaging drugs such as marijuana are widely proscribed. 
In ""The Encyclopedia of Psychoactive Substances"", Mr Rudgley offers a quick history of almost lOO drugs, sacred and profane, from the hallucinogenic mushroom amanita to the zombie mixtures of Haitian folklore. Though dutiful on ordinary drugs, he is gripped when it comes to the exotic or obscure. There are intriguing entries on socalled psychoactive animals. Apparently members of the Humr tribe in south-west Sudan dream vividly of giraffes after taking giraffe liver extract or bone marrow. What heroin taker would swap its orgasmic rush for a giraffe dream? As Mr Rudgley sweeps from soma of the ancient Indo-Iranians to Ecstasy in the British rave scene, he is careful always to put his psychoactive substances into a wider cultural or even ritual context, an aspect that has been largely lost in Western drug use. 
A quick fix 
Common to many of these books is the charge that American administrations have tended to neglect solid evidence which might ease their drug bind. This is most obvious with marijuana, which 7om Americans over the age of 12 have tried, some for medical reasons, but most for fun. Since the 193os, blue-ribbon panels of scientists and doctors have urged its decriminalisation, only to meet rebuttal from influential voices, like Anslinger, that marijuana was a ""gateway"" substance leading users to more damaging drugs such as heroin. Yet the evidence to support marijuana's ""gateway"" status is remarkably thin. Marijuana is not benign. There are legitimate concerns about its effect on memory and on the lungs, among other organs. But by most clinical (and personal) accounts, the drug is no more dangerous than alcohol, a freely-flowing intoxicant. 
Yet marijuana policy in America does appear to be softening. Half a dozen states have voted to legalise the drug for medical purposes. By contrast, the tough official policy on hard drugs shows little sign of change. Nor do the anti-drug-war doves air pear to be making much headway in winning converts where it counts-among elected politicians and in the criminal-justice system. Part of the trouble is that the anti-war camp is divided, not least on something seemingly as basic as the medical effects of hard drugs. This is not their fault: the issues are complex and the evidence is often disputable. Yet given the sheer weight of belief that hard drugs are very dangerous indeed, the burden of disproof rests, politically, on the doves. 
To take a glaring example of where wellinformed, fair-minded people can differ on what you might expect was observable fact: Mr Rudgley describes the bleak prospects of America's 375,ooo crack babies, born to addicted mothers, who face a life of mental and physical retardation. But Mr Gray claims that this figure is grossly exaggerated and that most crack babies grow up to be quite normal and not ""brain-damaged, unteachable monsters"". 
Any sensible approach to hard drugs ought to start with an understanding of addiction. But addiction, too, appears to be a bendable notion. Do drugs give addicts a habit or do addicts make a habit of drugs? Not everyone who takes a hard drug spirals into dependence. How destructive it is to be hooked depends a lot on your circumstances. Cocaine is most certainly addictive for some, but many users manage to limit their intake to the occasional snort. Heroin is much harder to take or leave. But addicts can regularise consumption and do jobs, as heroin-prescription programmes in Switzerland and Britain have shown. 
The best research seems to confirm most people's intuition that addiction depends on a damaging mix of biochemistry and bad social conditions. Much of this research is discussed in ""Buzzed"", a guide to the effects of legal and illicit drugs from coffee to cocaine. The authors wrote it out of concern for what they take to be a growing ""disconnect"" between advances in understanding of the physiology of addiction and public perceptions of drug abuse. ""Buzzed"" describes complex neurochemistry with admirable clarity and its glossary of drug terms will raise smiles. Roche may be a respectable Swiss pharmaceutical company. But ""Roche"" in street slang is Rohypnol, the notorious date-rape drug. ""Prudential"" has nothing to do with insurance but means a crack-user. ""Buzzed"" is less clear about how much cocaine or heroin you can take without risking addiction. This is not its fault. Even the best evidence on this has an elusive, it-depends quality: instant, one-off addiction is rare even with heroin, it seems, but repeated use over a few weeks or less can create dependence. Yes, but what is the connection between that first use and those few repeats? 
Denouncing the war on drugs is the easy part. Finding a different approach is trickier. The more radical anti-war doves believe in sweeping legalisation. Dirk Chase Eldredge is one such and he makes a fact-packed case in ""Ending the War on Drugs"". Unlike ""Drug Crazy"", which views the war from the trenches, this book reads more like a conference report from a chateau general. 
Yet the author is not what you might expect. Mr Eldredge is a life-long Republican and former campaign manager for President Reagan, whose wife, Nancy, sponsored ""Just Say No"". Within the party his is very much a minority view: most Republicans in Congress who speak out on the issue are unblinkingly pro-war and would like to see users and pushers off the streets for good. 
Undaunted, Mr Eldredge spells out how legalisation could be accomplished. His preferred system would include staterun sales, quality-and-price control and a ban on advertising. Revenue from drug sales and a ""peace dividend"" (fewer prisoners and crop eradications to pay for)would, he believes, provide money for anti-drug education, drug treatment and research. 
As a virgin-lands policy, this has strong appeal. Unfortunately, America is not virgin soil and Mr Eldredge's proposal is beset by several layers of difficulty. He himselfacknowledges the problem faced by the constitutional primacyof the states in criminal matters: repealing federal drug laws would do little good if states did not follow in concert. He imagines the black market that would persist if for example one state legalised while its neighbour continued to proscribe. 
A similar difficulty exists at the international level. America has signed several drug treaties that prohibit trade in narcotics and oblige countries to police its use. Either America must persuade much of the world to decriminalise, having spent decades cajoling or coercing other nations into adopting an opposite line. Or America must abrogate treaties and legalise unilaterally, a step which could turn it into a black-market drugs exporter. Politically, neither course looks appetising. 
A third problem is uncertainty about the use- and addiction-effects if cocaine and heroin were decriminalised. It may well be that some people will take drugs whatever the law says. Just as Mr Booth cites history, Mr Eldredge cites recent opinion polls in support of the view that drug laws have little visible effect on drug conduct. There are strict drug laws and most people do not take drugs. But to treat the second as a consequence of the first, he believes, is a mistake. The reasons people give for why they do not take drugs include all sorts of things-health effects, moral scruples, personal dislikes-but the law seldom figures highly among them. 
This is persuasive as far as it goes. But it skirts the main issue: how many people would try hard drugs if they were legally available, and how many new addicts would there be? Prohibitionists point to the Dutch experience. The partial decriminalisation of cannabis there was followed, they point out, by a sharp rise in use by teenagers. Increased availability, in other words, inevitably means some increased consumption. But the marijuana parallel is not relevant, many doves insist, since soft and hard drugs are so different. Cocaine and heroin, they seem to be saying, are their own best deterrent. 
The truth is nobody can say with any confidence what would happen if hard drugs were legalised. No country has yet dared to try and addiction research has not yet given firm enough answers. 
A middle way 
Not surprisingly, many people are looking for a middle way between the diehard warriors and the out-and-out legalisers. Last year, Foreign Affairs published an instructive exchange between Ethan Nadelmann, who favours harm-reduction for illegal hard drugs in a context of marijuana decriminalisation (""Commonsense Drug Policy"";January-February 1998 issue) and Herbert Kleber and Mitchell Rosenthal, who favour continued proscription but think money should also be invested in education, treatment and research on the home front (""Drug Myths from Abroad""; September-October 1998). 
In ""The Fix"", Michael Massing describes in detail one of America's few sustained attempts to relieve or cure addicts rather than punish them. Early in the 197os an estimated 600,ooo Americans regularly used heroin, a number swollen by addicted soldiers returning from Vietnam. President Nixon asked Jerome Jaffe, a psychiatrist from Chicago, to set up methadone centres and abstinence programmes across the country. At their height, such ""demandside"" initiatives received two-thirds of the federal drug budget, and made considerable gains: crime rates fell and fewer addicts died of overdoses. 
But as the heroin crisis abated, so did government interest in the Jaffe programmes. Subsequent administrations, Republican and Democratic, turned to ""sup ply-side"" controls abroad and to locking up users and pushers in America. Mr Massing is particularly critical of a shift in resources under Presidents Reagan and Bush from the dark heart of drug use-hard-core cocaine and heroin addiction-to teenage marijuana use. 
A few methadone treatment centres carry on Dr Jaffe's tradition, but they have room for only 15% of America's 800,ooo heroin addicts. ""The Fix"" takes to the street with one service, New York's Hot Line Cares, as it lives hand-to-mouth trying to get the city's crack addicts into precious treatment slots. The reward is found, not only in Mr Massing's accounts of wasted lives rescued through treatment, but also in hard economics. According to a 1992 study conducted by California's Rand Corporation, treatment is seven times better at reducing cocaine consumption in America than domestic law enforcement and an astonishing 23 times more effective than blasting foreign drug sources. Mr Massing advocates a rebalancing of the nation's drug budget, with half of its resources allocated to treatment and education, out of the pocket of supply-side control. Drug warriors certainly challenge this balance of power. An increased investment in treatment or harm reduction will not singlehandedly solve the drug problem. But at least they will not make matters worse, which the war on drugs very arguably has.  1999 FOR more than five years William Gaddis worked on his first novel, ""The Recognitions"", hoping for, and half expecting, instant success. He would not, he said later, have been ""terribly surprised"" to get the Nobel. Quick fame came to Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway. Why not to him? Young writers know the feeling. But ""The Recognitions"" did not even receive the kindness usually accorded to first novels. Those critics that cared to review the book said it was a dud. ""Sprawling, squalling, overwritten,"" wrote one sadist. 
Twenty years later, in 1975, Mr Gaddis ventured to publish a second novel, ""J.R"". It received ecstatic reviews. It was ""inventive and subtle"", ""wildly satiric"", ""dazzling"". Swift himself would have been happy with it. Mr Gaddis became the recipient of numerous literary prizes. ""The Recognitions"" was judged, on rereading, to be one of the most important American novels of the past 50 years. 
How can critics make such a misjudgment? Quite easily, especially if, as in the case of Mr Gaddis's writing, there are a few problems. For one thing, his books are very long. ""The Recognitions"" runs to nearly 1,000 pages, a time-consuming read for a critic whose review has to be in by tomorrow. Then, much of the narrative is in the form of conversation, but without much punctuation to help it along. It is nearer in style to James Joyce than to Jackie Collins. But with a little effort you get used to it. Mr Gaddis was a gentle innovator and against what he called the ""originality of incompetent idiots"" who ""could not do a thing the right way"". He strove to get the right words in every sentence of his mammoth novels. ""There is an obligation not to bore or to be bored yourself,"" he said. 
In the years after Mr Gaddis's appalling start, those who take an interest in new writing had time to read his work and become ""dazzled"". By the time his second book came along, he had acquired, by word of mouth in America and Europe, a reputation as a writer worth watching. The critics, suitably forewarned, read ""J.R"" more carefully. 
The wizard of Wall Street 
""JR"" is about an ii-year-old boy who goes on a school trip to Wall Street and is given a single share in order to experience the charm of ""investing in America"". He invests so astutely that he takes control of a company and makes a fortune. ""The Recognitions"" is about a clergyman's son who becomes a painter. ""Carpenter's Gothic"" is about an evangelical clergyman with an interest in helping exploited people. ""A Frolic of His Own"", is about a motorist who figures out whom to sue after arranging his own car accident. They sound the sort of tales that might be turned into films about American life. But that depends on how you see America. The Disney-sounding financial prodigy is deemed, at ii, to have the mental age of the average American adult. He is without scruples and is motivated solely by greed. The painter becomes a forger and takes the view that everything in life is a fraud. The concerned clergyman epitomises human stupidity. The motorist finds himself caught in the absurdities of American law. 
Mr Gaddis gained a view of the practical world during the years when he was unable to make a living from literature. After leaving Harvard, where he edited the Harvard Lampoon, he had a number of casual jobs, among them checking facts for the New Yorker magazine and working on a lock in the Panama canal; later, more permanently, he was doing publicity for a pharmaceutical company, working on training films for the army and writing speeches for company executives. His speeches were admired for their wit and their elegant exposition of the aims of capitalism, a feature notably absent from ""J.R"", although Mr Gaddis once said that free enterprise, for all its doubtful morality, was the least-dangerous economic system yet devised. 
William Gaddis avoided personal publicity. He gave interviews only to literary magazines that few people read. The experiences of his varied life went into his books, not on to television. An acquaintance recalled seeing him at a writers' conference which was attended by Allen Ginsberg, a selfpublicising poet who declaimed his verse accompanied by an accordion he usually carried. Mr Gaddis, by contrast, ""spoke in measured tones of the small sales that the serious novelist might expect."" It was an austere view, a rejection of the general philosophy of the book trade, which is unconcerned about whether books are read as long as they are bought. 
Even after his critical acclaim, his sales remained modest. He could never be a Hemingway, who happily advertised his colourful life. He never wrote sentimentally about being an American in Paris. He had lived there for a time and dismissed it: ""Age cannot wither, nor custom stale, her infinite vulgarity."" William Gaddis published only four books. He left a fifth, called ""Agape Agape"". Its publication date has yet to be set. There is no hurry. His admirers are a patient lot.  1999 PRICES AND WAGES In November, 12-month consumer-price inflation in the euro-il countries fell slightly, to 0.9%. Danish inflation stayed at 1.7%. Canada's inflation rate edged up to 1.2%, and Japan's to 0.8%. Denmark's producer prices fell by 2.2% in the year to November. Italian workers received a 2.3% pay rise in the year to November, a real rise of 0.8%.  1999 COMMODITY PRICE INDEX 
Our all-items dollar index slumped by 16.5% in 1998 and is now at its lowest level for five years. Both industrial and food prices have been hit by falling demand in the wake of the Asian and Russian financial crises. The metals index has fallen by 45% from its peak in January 1995. A sustained recovery in metal prices is unlikely without cuts in output. Copper is at a lZ-year low, and nickel at an ii-year low. Soft commodity prices subsided as the El Nino weather system faded; the food index is now a third below its peak in May 1997. Surpluses pushed wheat prices to zo-year lows and sugar to ten-year lows.

Bill C-55 is the latest-and, in terms of public relations, far from the brightestmove by successive governments in Ottawa to staunch the draining-off of Canadian advertising into split-run editions of American magazines, which add a token amount of Canadian editorial content. As far back as 1956 the then Liberal government introduced a special excise tax, aimed particularly at Reader's Digest and Time. The Conservatives repealed it two years later. 
The issue, then and now, was not just the welfare of Canadian publishers. It was the Canadianness of Canada. The next Liberal government was headed by Lester Pearson, a man who worried about ""cultural imperialism"". It tried both carrots and stick The carrots were tax deductions for advertisers in magazines with 80% Canadian content, and fat postal subsidies for publishers. The stick was a tariff that in effect barred split-run magazines and issues with more than 5% of advertisement space aimed at Canadians. However, recognising the elephantine weight of Time and Reader's Digest, the new rules made exceptions of their Canadian editions for tax purposes, and Reader's Digest has notably stuck to its side of the bargain. 
The tariff was particularly effective in helping build up Canada's own magazine industry, which launched many new titles. And during the 1988 talks that led to the two countries' free-trade agreement, Canada managed to preserve both the postal subsidy and the tariff, under what was called the ""cultural exemption"". 
Then came the high-flying Sports Illustrated. This magazine, a sister of Time, used satellite transmission to jump the tariff barrier. Were others to follow with split-run editions, it was feared they might scoop up 40% of total Canadian advertising. Canada shifted to a special excise tax on the distribution of split-run magazines, but unwisely failed to give ""grandfather"" privileges to Sports Illustrated. Hauled before the World Trade Organisation, the Canadians were told the tariff and excise tax alike were inadmissible under its rules. 
Bill C-55 is an attempt to get round this. Introduced in October, it would make it a criminal offence-literally-for Canadians to buy advertising in split-run magazines. It looked like a desperate response by the heritage minister, Sheila Copps, and looks ever more so now. Big guns have rolled up to the border. The American ambassador, Gordon Giffin, has been busy warning Canadian businessmen of dire consequences. His predecessor, James Blanchard, a good friend of President Bill Clinton's, has argued that C-55 is not about protecting national culture but about protecting two Canadian companies-Telemedia Communications and Rogers, which, notably, publishes Maclean's, Canada's biggest homegrown newsmagazine. A less respectable ally of Mr Clinton's, Larry Flynt, allowed the current Canadian edition of his pornographic Hustler magazine to run an obscene contest featuring ""that incredible chick""-Ms Copps. 
Partly aimed at her also was the list of Canadian exports tagged for retaliation: besides lumber and wheat, which have long been in dispute, the list included steel, the latest American anxiety, which, by happy coincidence, is the main product of Ms Copps's constituency. Dofasco, a big steel manufacturer, was quick to urge her to withdraw C-55. So was the right-wing Reform Party, the largest opposition party in the federal Parliament. 
Sheila Copps, however, is a lady of fighting spirit, the single female veteran of the vocal ""rat pack"" of Liberal MPS from that party's long period of opposition before 1993. She then served as deputy prime minister for four years, and the cabinet is firmly behind her. While the industry minister, John Manley, has accused the Americans of ""intimidation"", the prime minister, Jean Chretien, talks of protecting ""part of our national identity"". With some irony, the Bloc Quebecois, the third-largest party in Parliament, also approves, saying the legislation is in line with Quebec's own legislation-much disliked by English-speakers there and many elsewhere in Canada-to protect its French language and culture. 
Is C-55 really needed? Rick Boychuk, editor of Canadian Geographic, which has a healthy circulation of 250,000, mostly on subscription, argues for it. His advertising, much of it from car firms, might be seduced away to many American magazines, not only to his obvious rival, National Geographic-which anyway sells twice as many copies in Canada as his magazine. 
There lies the weakness in the case against the American split-run magazines. Living next-door, Canadians are ready enough to distinguish themselves from their mighty neighbours-and in many ways distinct they are. But do they really believe that the old saying ""what you eat is what you are"" applies to mental nourishment too? Whatever they may say, they, like the citizens of many countries eager to defend their own culture, happily consume that of the United States. 
Still, it seems unlikely that the Chretien government will back down or even delay a final vote in the Commons on C-55. But the Liberals can-and well may-keep it lingering in the Senate, to allow time for the two countries to talk peace.

Dofasco, a big steel manufacturer, was quick to urge her to withdraw C-55. So was the right-wing Reform Party, the largest opposition party in the federal Parliament. 
Sheila Copps, however, is a lady of fighting spirit, the single female veteran of the vocal ""rat pack"" of Liberal MPS from that party's long period of opposition before 1993. She then served as deputy prime minister for four years, and the cabinet is firmly behind her. While the industry minister, John Manley, has accused the Americans of ""intimidation"", the prime minister, Jean Chretien, talks of protecting ""part of our national identity"". With some irony, the Bloc Quebecois, the third-largest party in Parliament, also approves, saying the legislation is in line with Quebec's own legislation-much disliked by English-speakers there and many elsewhere in Canada-to protect its French language and culture. 
Is C-55 really needed? Rick Boychuk, editor of Canadian Geographic, which has a healthy circulation of 250,000, mostly on subscription, argues for it. His advertising, much of it from car firms, might be seduced away to many American magazines, not only to his obvious rival, National Geographic-which anyway sells twice as many copies in Canada as his magazine. 
There lies the weakness in the case against the American split-run magazines. Living next-door, Canadians are ready enough to distinguish themselves from their mighty neighbours-and in many ways distinct they are. But do they really believe that the old saying ""what you eat is what you are"" applies to mental nourishment too? Whatever they may say, they, like the citizens of many countries eager to defend their own culture, happily consume that of the United States. 
Still, it seems unlikely that the Chretien government will back down or even delay a final vote in the Commons on C-55. But the Liberals can-and well may-keep it lingering in the Senate, to allow time for the two countries to talk peace. ",20,Canada,A29-148,,False,,0,True

Jean Chretien, the prime minister, is often accused of being too passive in government. Now he is being widely praised for the skill with which he, some of his ministers and federal officials have turned an ultimatum to his government from the ten provincial premiers into an initiative of his own. 
The outcome, on February 4th, was an agreement on what Canadians call ""social union"". The prime minister's ally was the premier of Saskatchewan, Roy Romanow. In 1981, when Mr Chretien was federal justice minister, under Pierre Trudeau, and Mr Romanow was Saskatchewan's attorney-general, they, plus Mr Romanow's Ontario equivalent, huddled in a conference-- centre kitchen, and outlined a deal between Ottawa and the provinces. This opened the way to Canada ""patriating"" its constitution-taking control of what, till 1982, was formally a bit of British law-and bringing in a Charter of Rights and Freedoms. These were Mr Trudeau's two most enduring legacies. Now Mr Romanow's diplomatic skill has worked again. 
The new deal was a compromise in a raw debate about paying for new health and welfare programmes such as child care and ""pharmacare"", insurance for the cost of drugs. Under Canada's division of powers, the provinces handle education, health and welfare. But the federal government helps to pay the costs, and historically has used its power to persuade them to bring in ""shared-cost"" programmes. Medicare, first launched in Saskatchewan by Mr Romanow's social-democratic predecessors, was generalised in this way in the 196os. 
The provinces were angered in 1995 when the finance minister, Paul Martin, cut his budget deficit by rolling Ottawa's health and welfare transfers into a single lump, and then cutting the annual total. The provincial governments responded by offloading their duties to municipalities (which then closed some hospitals and schools). But the premiers also demanded that Ottawa should not initiate any new social policy-even at its own sole cost-without the approval of a majority of provinces; and should compensate any province that wished to opt out. Quebec's separatist premier, Lucien Bouchard, was especially firm on the ""opting-out"" provision. At the premiers' annual meeting last August, in Saskatoon, they set down these demands formally, coining the phrase ""social union"". 
Mr Bouchard soon called a provincial election. He demanded that Ottawa should accept the Saskatoon document before this month's federal budget. If not, it was implied, that would give him ammunition for a new referendum (the third) on secession. But happily for Mr Chretien and national unity, the current chairman of the premiers' group is Mr Romanow.And Mr Martin could foresee a large federal surplus in 1998-99. So the prime minister was able to promise the provinces an extra C$2 billion ($1.3 billion) at once for health care, with more to follow. Meanwhile, Mr Bouchard did worse than expected in his provincial election: his party was returned to office, but with fewer votes than its anti-separatist Liberal rivals. That suggested he would not risk an early referendum. 
So Mr Chretien and his team revised and added to the Saskatoon agreement. He called a quick meeting with the premiers. Aided by Mr Romanow-who had recently done much to win agreement on a national scheme of child benefits aimed at the working poor-he had, within hours, the signatures of all but Mr Bouchard. 
The new document is distinctly federalist. The use of federal spending power, it says, ""has been essential to the development of Canada's social union"". Ottawa must get backing from at least six provinces for any new national shared-cost programme; but-unlike the formula for amending the constitution-this rule does not require that the population of the favourable provinces also amount to more than half of the country's total. So, if six of the smaller provinces back some scheme, the two giants, Ontario and Quebec-- home, between them, to two-thirds of all Canadians-could not jointly veto it. An opting-in mechanism replaces the notion of opting-out and full compensation. 
When Mr Bouchard learnt that opting-- out had gone, he telephoned at least four other premiers, urging them not to sign. Unsuccessful, he came to Ottawa to protest, though happy to accept the extra money for health care. There are regrets, but no surprise, that he would not sign; indeed, the Quebec Liberals' leader, Jean Charest, no separatist, said that he too would not have done so. In sum, for once in recent years the rest of Canada has decided to pursue ""cooperative federalism"" without worrying too much about noises from Quebec.

After less than four years in office, Mike Harris, the Conservative prime minister of Ontario, has chosen to face the voters in an early election on June 3rd, seemingly confident that he will win a second five-year mandate in which to consolidate his ""Common Sense Revolution"" of tax cuts and radical reform in health care, welfare and schools. 
History is against Mr Harris: if the Conservatives retain their majority of seats for a second term, they will be the first governing party to manage that feat in Canada's most populous province since the early 197os. But the polls favour him. The latest has the Conservatives leading the Liberals by 46% to 35%; the social-democratic New Democrats lie a distant but rising third, with 17%. Still, Mr Harris can hardly afford to relax. Ontario's three-party politics has a habit of throwing up last-minute electoral surprises. Nobody was more amazed than the New Democrats when they won in 199o, and Mr Harris himself stormed from third place in the polls to victory in 1995. 
So Dalton McGuinty, the leader of Ontario's Liberals, must hope that history will repeat itself, and produce an upset in the campaign's final week. In another country, or another province, he might have other straws to clutch at. After all, the Liberals, under Jean Chretien, have governed Canada since 1993, presiding over a healthy economy. But Ontarians have a well-established habit-even, perhaps, a principle-of voting one way in federal elections and quite differently in provincial ones. Never in the past 36 years has the same party governed simultaneously in Ottawa and Toronto. 
That makes for an effective, if informal, separation of powers. It also might seem to set limits to the scope of Mr Harris and his Common Sense Revolution. (After all, in Ottawa his party has fewer seats than a rival right-wing group, the Reform Party.) But in Ontario's election, at least, he and his revolution have been the main issue. 
At almost every campaign stop, Mr Harris has been surrounded by revolutionary victims: groups of protesting teachers, nurses and other public-service workers who have either lost their jobs or face extra work as a result of spending cuts. Yet the prime minister seems to revel in the confrontation, dismissing their complaints as the whining of ""special interests"". He prefers to talk of drug tests for those on welfare or on parole, and of tough measures against pan-handlers and ""squeegee kids"". He has called Mr McGuinty, a former defence lawyer, soft on crime-to which his opponent has retorted by calling the prime minister a thug. 
What voters, especially those in rural areas and Toronto's suburbs, like about Mr Harris is that he has fulfilled his promises of the 1995 campaign, starting with a 30% cut in the provincial income tax. He can also claim to have cut the welfare rolls and reduced the budget deficit. More controversially, he says that his tax cuts have been responsible for the creation of 34o,ooo new jobs. (In fact, Ontario owes much of its recent prosperity to the booming economy across the border in the United States.) 
Mr Harris pledges a further tax cut, of 20% , though he also promises to hire lo,ooo more nurses. By contrast, the New Democrats want to increase tax rates for those earning more than C$8o,ooo ($54,300), using the extra revenue for cheap housing (homelessness is rising), education and health. Mr McGuinty shows a similar concern for social provision, but leans toward Conservative fiscal policies in speaking of a tax cut after the deficit is eliminated. 
In a television debate on May i8th, the boyish-looking Mr McGuinty appeared hesitant beside the self-confident and smiling figure of Mr Harris. Polls suggested that the New Democrats' Howard Hampton also picked up support at the expense of the Liberals after the debate. The best hope entertained by a divided opposition may be that the Conservatives will fall short of a majority of seats. In Ontario, minority administrations have tended to be moderating ones. But at present, a majority of Ontarians seem to be enjoying the fruits of confrontation. ","WILL a Canadian brand of Thatcherism survive?

Six-Linking aid to a govemment's respect for democracy is an excellent idea (""The rot in Pakistan"", May 22nd). Most aid to countries lacking mechanisms of accountability does not reach the masses, so why bother? However, if a poor country is stimulated to cultivate a culture of accountability it will become self-sufficient and its begging-bowl redundant. 
For too long the free world has taken a convenient approach towards the third world. Often, despots were supported because it was easier to deal with one person than face the rigours of the democratic process. It is sad that those who owe their way of life to the institutions of freedom turn a blind eye to their importance to the people these despots control. Louisville,

SIDDIQUE MALIK 
SIR-Your leader on Pakistan is malicious, insulting and offensive. You recommend aid to Pakistan on the condition of good governance. I presume this means according to the dictates of the West. The truth is that the West is suffering from the collywobbles because of Pakistan's nuclear capability and more so because it is an Islamic state. The rot is not in Pakistan but in western minds. 
The West uses covert actions, encouraging traitors, dissidents, rebels and Quislings. Among other things it provides money, asylum and protection to create instability in countries which do not accept slavery to the West. This is immoral and chauvinistic. Aid with strings attached is not acceptable to Pakistan. And remember, nuclear technology is encashable.

SIR-There is an odd omission in your article about lighter-thanair-craft (""Pushing the Envelope"", May 29th). You mention the crash of the Hindenburg as discouraging continuation of hydrogenbuoyed airships, but say nothing about why America abandoned large helium dirigibles after the crashes of the Akron and Macon. 
The reason was that eventually a dirigible would encounter small-scale turbulence violent enough to rip its structure apart. It would take a remarkable improvement in strength and weight of materials to overcome this difficulty, which can also affect planes if close enough to the ground. Better predictions of local turbulence might help, but it is doubtful. What can be fatal can be far less evident than a tornado. 
Los Angeles 
WILLIAM KAULA Model Dutch 
SIR-Frits Bolkestein's article on the success of the Dutch model (By invitation, May 22nd) hits the mark, especially when he takes the myth and magic out of it. Not so very long ago, journalists and politicians abroad referred to this model as the ""Dutch disease"" or ""Hollanditis"". The model was blamed for leading to high inflation and unemployment. Since then, however, appreciation of the Dutch model abroad has changed dramatically from negative to outright admiration. 
Whatever model there is can work well only in a specific set of circumstances. The institutions, lines of communication and forms of consultation have remained the same. The main cause of the improvements in the Netherlands lies in the fact that social partners, and particularly trade unions, have come to realise that the Netherlands has a very open economy. Therefore, economic success depends greatly on how well our products and services can be sold in increasingly competitive international markets. 
This realisation represents a big change compared with the mid-1970s, when the dominant idea was that government could spend its way out of economic difficulties. Rather than the issue being us (employees) versus them (employers), we saw it becoming us (the Netherlands) versus them (other countries). Now that social partners agree on a diagnosis, it is easier to find a solution.

JAN EPPINK 
South Africa's past 
SIR-In your review of Anthony Sampson's excellent biography of Nelson Mandela (May 29th) you complain that in the 196os I expressed hopes in The Economist that problems could best be solved if Dutch South Africans grew ""even richer, because that could make them more secure and therefore nicer to blacks."" with respect, that is exactly what occurred. In the 196os, the centre of gravity among Dutch South Africans moved from poor redneck whites toward university graduates, who sensibly and mercifully surrendered conditionally to an even more sensible and merciful Nelson Mandela. It is self-contradictory for you to snort that ""South Africa changed in a way that almost no one predicted and few believed possible."" 
By the 196os we were seeing the same change away from poor whites in the southern United States, and in 1870 this is what Walter Bagehot preached in The Economist about Britain. Bagehot hoped that a new middle class might, at just about the right moment, make our industrialising country safe for democracy. (While 1789 had by 1870 landed France with its second Napoleon, who bred Bismarckism and three German invasions during the lifespan of any poor Frenchman who lived from 1868-1948.) 
Today, the need for my grandchildren is that ""communist"" China should grow as many millionaires and middle-class entrepreneurs as possible. This is why we should not allow emotionalists to keep China out of the World Trade Organisation and the IMF, even on this emotional tenth anniversary of Tiananmen Square.

Social electricity 
SIR-Your article on power in China (May 29th) does not convey clearly the entire message I am trying to put across. What I have said for some time is that AES will do no more cost-plus contracts with annual tariff approvals and no more projects without complete control. In the past five years we have been successful in backing nine projects totaling almost 3,000Mw, of which eight are now in operation. We have learned a lot from that experience and in future we want only to do projects with a structure that allows us better to accomplish our objectives. 
AES'S mission has always been to meet the world's need for electricity in a socially responsible way, and there is certainly a big need in China. As you point out, there are several hundred million people who do not have access to electricity and several hundred million who would like more. As long as that need is there AES will be in China trying to serve those people. We just have to figure out a way that makes better business sense to us. 
Concerning the comment about AEs having ""unrealistic expectations"", I do not think it is unrealistic to expect people to live up to the commitments and promises they make or to honour the contracts they signed-anywhere in the world. To expect less would be a failure to meet our commitments to the many other stakeholders that we have been entrusted to represent.

Australian culture 
SIR-As a Melboumian who now lives and works in Sydney, I am in some position to comment on your analysis of the fight between these two cities to be acknowledged as the cultural capital of Australia (""Australia's culture clash"", May 15th). Melbourne is buzzing with energy these days, as you say, while a deep pall hangs over Sydney as all is revealed about corruption in the international Olympic movement. What needs to be considered, however, is the nature of Melbourne's cultural revival? 
The cultural projects that have become hallmarks of the govemment of Jeff Kennett, the state premier, bear an uncanny resemblance to the gaudiness and gigantism of totalitarian regimes. Massive, soulless buildings are constructed, and grandiose, expensive plans are realised. Mr Kennett is depositing large dollops of his ego all over Melbourne and calling it culture. To help fund this, money is taken from schools and hospitals, which are encouraged to become more competitive and entrepreneurial. 
The Economist finds all this ""racy and brash"". It would be more accurate to say that the government has abrogated its responsibilities and has its priorities all wrong. Or maybe I am just dull now that I have moved to Sydney.

Hot potato 
SIR-The image of ""men in white coats monkey[ing) about with God's own potatoes"" (Bagehot, May 29th) is a powerful one. But God's claim on the humble spud is questionable. If anything, God's own potatoes are surely the small, bitter and mostly poisonous tubers of Solanum tuberosum found wild in tropical South America. When the potato was introduced to Europe it was already the result of thousands of years of human selection and propagation. Another 500 years of horticulture lies behind today's supermarket varieties, which are mostly cloned mutants or sterile hybrids. Some even contain genes from other species introduced by cross-breeding. 
At every stage of human development, men in white coats (or their equivalents) have monkeyed around with the most sophisticated knowledge and techniques available, trying to make a better potato. Their efforts have resulted in one of the most economically and socially important food crops in the world. Even with the latest GM technology, today's scientists can only dream of making improvements comparable to those already achieved. 
Esher,

NIGEL HARRIS 
SIR-Bagehot's ""genetically modified government"" shows that America and Britain are divided by much more than a common language. On the western side of the Atlantic, where the modem consumer and environmental movements were born, the public's main fears about the genetic revolution are that genetic-test resuits will be used by insurers and employers to discriminate against those at risk. Americans (not the most trusting of people), unlike many Brits and other Europeans, are remarkably unconcerned about the dangers of genetically modified foods. 
But then the American consumer movement began with Ralph Nader and cars that were dangerously unsafe; Britain's began with real ale.

HUMPHREY TAYLOR 
Prisoners' progress 
SIR-You suggest that the Close Supervision Centre (csc) at Woodhill prison (""End of the line"", May 15th) has failed to change the behaviour of its prisoners and that conditions there are ""inhumane"". The csc system provides a real step forward in dealing with a very small number of prisoners who do not respond in segregation units and who pose a serious danger to other inmates and staff. 
In a csc extra resources are devoted to helping prisoners improve their behaviour. Specialist psychological and psychiatric support is available; staff are specially trained; there is an excellent staff-to-prisoner ratio; prisoners receive personalised targets and their progress is individually monitored; and allocation to a csc is reviewed every month. 
You overlook the two cscs at Durham prison. I wing is for prisoners who may benefit from psychological support. G wing is an activity based centre, which prepares prisoners for a return to mainstream prisons. Prisoners have at least 20 hours constructive activity a week, including education, group work, physical education and cooking. 
Undoubtedly, a core of prisoners have no interest in progressing and concentrate their efforts on undermining the system instead. Though difficult to manage, they continue to be given personal targets and opportunities for progression, but intransigence can result in long periods spent on A and D wings. For this reason, conditions are kept under constant review. Meals are not served through a hatch unless necessary for staff safety. Association with another prisoner on exercise can be earned. 
The emphasis of the csc system is therapeutic rather than punitive. Progression is determined by a prisoner's own behaviour. It aims to strike a balance between fairness to the prisoner and the safety of staff and other prisoners. We are confident that this balance is being achieved.

Feeding North Korea 
SIR-You say the United Nations World Food Programme has access to 59 of North Korea's 211 counties (""Echoes from the hermit kingdom"", May 22nd). In fact we had access to 159 and now we have gained access to another four. Neither our 41 international staff nor the staff of other aid agencies have found any evidence of systematic diversion of food aid. Our aid consists of maize and wheat; the preferred food of elite groups is rice, of which sufficient quantities are available from domestic harvests.

Official reply 
SIR-I must take issue with your somewhat pessimistic account of the Ugandan economy (May ist). Far from starting to ""sputter"", it has rebounded strongly from the adverse effects of drought and El Nino in 1997. The latest estimate of real economic growth for the fiscal year 1998-99 is a robust 7.8%, more than double the average real growth rate for all developing countries in 1998. Furthermore, consumer price inflation has remained firmly under control at 3.1% and annual average inflation has been well under 10% for six years. 
Donors must speak for themselves as to whether they are ""losing sympathy"" but next year they will increase their support for Uganda. It is also misleading to state that donors pay more than half the government's running costs. Every year since 1995 domestic tax and non-tax revenues have been more than sufficient to fund all recurrent expenditures by government. 
The exchange rate has depreciated over the past 12 months, but Uganda is hardly unique among developing countries in this respect. Given depressed coffee prices, regional political instability and the strength of the dollar against almost all other currencies, it would have been remarkable if the Ugandan shilling had not depreciated. There have been scandals involving corruption, but to describe the private sector as ""mired in corruption"" is a gross exaggeration. Moreover, the recent closure of banks demonstrates our determination to enforce prudential regulations in this sector.

However, Quebec does call its premier a premier ministre to confuse unwary foreign correspondents into thinking it is already independent. Perhaps suggesting Ontario might also have a prime minister is The Economist's clever way of foreshadowing our nation's future?

RON KOPAS ","Aid, democracy, rot 
Six-Linking aid to a govemment's respect for democracy is an excellent idea (""The rot in Pakistan"", May 22nd). Most aid to countries lacking mechanisms of accountability does not reach the masses, so why bother? However, if a poor country is stimulated to cultivate a culture of accountability it will become self-sufficient and its begging-bowl redundant. 
For too long the free world has taken a convenient approach towards the third world. Often, despots were supported because it was easier to deal with one person than face the rigours of the democratic process. It is sad that those who owe their way of life to the institutions of freedom turn a blind eye to their importance to the people these despots control. Louisville,

SIDDIQUE MALIK 
SIR-Your leader on Pakistan is malicious, insulting and offensive. You recommend aid to Pakistan on the condition of good governance. I presume this means according to the dictates of the West. The truth is that the West is suffering from the collywobbles because of Pakistan's nuclear capability and more so because it is an Islamic state. The rot is not in Pakistan but in western minds. 
The West uses covert actions, encouraging traitors, dissidents, rebels and Quislings. Among other things it provides money, asylum and protection to create instability in countries which do not accept slavery to the West. This is immoral and chauvinistic. Aid with strings attached is not acceptable to Pakistan. And remember, nuclear technology is encashable.

SIR-There is an odd omission in your article about lighter-thanair-craft (""Pushing the Envelope"", May 29th). You mention the crash of the Hindenburg as discouraging continuation of hydrogenbuoyed airships, but say nothing about why America abandoned large helium dirigibles after the crashes of the Akron and Macon. 
The reason was that eventually a dirigible would encounter small-scale turbulence violent enough to rip its structure apart. It would take a remarkable improvement in strength and weight of materials to overcome this difficulty, which can also affect planes if close enough to the ground. Better predictions of local turbulence might help, but it is doubtful. What can be fatal can be far less evident than a tornado.

WILLIAM KAULA Model Dutch 
SIR-Frits Bolkestein's article on the success of the Dutch model (By invitation, May 22nd) hits the mark, especially when he takes the myth and magic out of it. Not so very long ago, journalists and politicians abroad referred to this model as the ""Dutch disease"" or ""Hollanditis"". The model was blamed for leading to high inflation and unemployment. Since then, however, appreciation of the Dutch model abroad has changed dramatically from negative to outright admiration. 
Whatever model there is can work well only in a specific set of circumstances. The institutions, lines of communication and forms of consultation have remained the same. The main cause of the improvements in the Netherlands lies in the fact that social partners, and particularly trade unions, have come to realise that the Netherlands has a very open economy. Therefore, economic success depends greatly on how well our products and services can be sold in increasingly competitive international markets. 
This realisation represents a big change compared with the mid-1970s, when the dominant idea was that government could spend its way out of economic difficulties. Rather than the issue being us (employees) versus them (employers), we saw it becoming us (the Netherlands) versus them (other countries). Now that social partners agree on a diagnosis, it is easier to find a solution.

South Africa's past 
SIR-In your review of Anthony Sampson's excellent biography of Nelson Mandela (May 29th) you complain that in the 196os I expressed hopes in The Economist that problems could best be solved if Dutch South Africans grew ""even richer, because that could make them more secure and therefore nicer to blacks."" with respect, that is exactly what occurred. In the 196os, the centre of gravity among Dutch South Africans moved from poor redneck whites toward university graduates, who sensibly and mercifully surrendered conditionally to an even more sensible and merciful Nelson Mandela. It is self-contradictory for you to snort that ""South Africa changed in a way that almost no one predicted and few believed possible."" 
By the 196os we were seeing the same change away from poor whites in the southern United States, and in 1870 this is what Walter Bagehot preached in The Economist about Britain. Bagehot hoped that a new middle class might, at just about the right moment, make our industrialising country safe for democracy. (While 1789 had by 1870 landed France with its second Napoleon, who bred Bismarckism and three German invasions during the lifespan of any poor Frenchman who lived from 1868-1948.) 
Today, the need for my grandchildren is that ""communist"" China should grow as many millionaires and middle-class entrepreneurs as possible. This is why we should not allow emotionalists to keep China out of the World Trade Organisation and the IMF, even on this emotional tenth anniversary of Tiananmen Square.

Social electricity 
SIR-Your article on power in China (May 29th) does not convey clearly the entire message I am trying to put across. What I have said for some time is that AES will do no more cost-plus contracts with annual tariff approvals and no more projects without complete control. In the past five years we have been successful in backing nine projects totaling almost 3,000Mw, of which eight are now in operation. We have learned a lot from that experience and in future we want only to do projects with a structure that allows us better to accomplish our objectives. 
AES'S mission has always been to meet the world's need for electricity in a socially responsible way, and there is certainly a big need in China. As you point out, there are several hundred million people who do not have access to electricity and several hundred million who would like more. As long as that need is there AES will be in China trying to serve those people. We just have to figure out a way that makes better business sense to us. 
Concerning the comment about AEs having ""unrealistic expectations"", I do not think it is unrealistic to expect people to live up to the commitments and promises they make or to honour the contracts they signed-anywhere in the world. To expect less would be a failure to meet our commitments to the many other stakeholders that we have been entrusted to represent.

Australian culture 
SIR-As a Melboumian who now lives and works in Sydney, I am in some position to comment on your analysis of the fight between these two cities to be acknowledged as the cultural capital of Australia (""Australia's culture clash"", May 15th). Melbourne is buzzing with energy these days, as you say, while a deep pall hangs over Sydney as all is revealed about corruption in the international Olympic movement. What needs to be considered, however, is the nature of Melbourne's cultural revival? 
The cultural projects that have become hallmarks of the govemment of Jeff Kennett, the state premier, bear an uncanny resemblance to the gaudiness and gigantism of totalitarian regimes. Massive, soulless buildings are constructed, and grandiose, expensive plans are realised. Mr Kennett is depositing large dollops of his ego all over Melbourne and calling it culture. To help fund this, money is taken from schools and hospitals, which are encouraged to become more competitive and entrepreneurial. 
The Economist finds all this ""racy and brash"". It would be more accurate to say that the government has abrogated its responsibilities and has its priorities all wrong. Or maybe I am just dull now that I have moved to Sydney.

Hot potato 
SIR-The image of ""men in white coats monkey[ing) about with God's own potatoes"" (Bagehot, May 29th) is a powerful one. But God's claim on the humble spud is questionable. If anything, God's own potatoes are surely the small, bitter and mostly poisonous tubers of Solanum tuberosum found wild in tropical South America. When the potato was introduced to Europe it was already the result of thousands of years of human selection and propagation. Another 500 years of horticulture lies behind today's supermarket varieties, which are mostly cloned mutants or sterile hybrids. Some even contain genes from other species introduced by cross-breeding. 
At every stage of human development, men in white coats (or their equivalents) have monkeyed around with the most sophisticated knowledge and techniques available, trying to make a better potato. Their efforts have resulted in one of the most economically and socially important food crops in the world. Even with the latest GM technology, today's scientists can only dream of making improvements comparable to those already achieved.

NIGEL HARRIS 
SIR-Bagehot's ""genetically modified government"" shows that America and Britain are divided by much more than a common language. On the western side of the Atlantic, where the modem consumer and environmental movements were born, the public's main fears about the genetic revolution are that genetic-test resuits will be used by insurers and employers to discriminate against those at risk. Americans (not the most trusting of people), unlike many Brits and other Europeans, are remarkably unconcerned about the dangers of genetically modified foods. 
But then the American consumer movement began with Ralph Nader and cars that were dangerously unsafe; Britain's began with real ale.

HUMPHREY TAYLOR 
Prisoners' progress 
SIR-You suggest that the Close Supervision Centre (csc) at Woodhill prison (""End of the line"", May 15th) has failed to change the behaviour of its prisoners and that conditions there are ""inhumane"". The csc system provides a real step forward in dealing with a very small number of prisoners who do not respond in segregation units and who pose a serious danger to other inmates and staff. 
In a csc extra resources are devoted to helping prisoners improve their behaviour. Specialist psychological and psychiatric support is available; staff are specially trained; there is an excellent staff-to-prisoner ratio; prisoners receive personalised targets and their progress is individually monitored; and allocation to a csc is reviewed every month. 
You overlook the two cscs at Durham prison. I wing is for prisoners who may benefit from psychological support. G wing is an activity based centre, which prepares prisoners for a return to mainstream prisons. Prisoners have at least 20 hours constructive activity a week, including education, group work, physical education and cooking. 
Undoubtedly, a core of prisoners have no interest in progressing and concentrate their efforts on undermining the system instead. Though difficult to manage, they continue to be given personal targets and opportunities for progression, but intransigence can result in long periods spent on A and D wings. For this reason, conditions are kept under constant review. Meals are not served through a hatch unless necessary for staff safety. Association with another prisoner on exercise can be earned. 
The emphasis of the csc system is therapeutic rather than punitive. Progression is determined by a prisoner's own behaviour. It aims to strike a balance between fairness to the prisoner and the safety of staff and other prisoners. We are confident that this balance is being achieved.

Feeding North Korea 
SIR-You say the United Nations World Food Programme has access to 59 of North Korea's 211 counties (""Echoes from the hermit kingdom"", May 22nd). In fact we had access to 159 and now we have gained access to another four. Neither our 41 international staff nor the staff of other aid agencies have found any evidence of systematic diversion of food aid. Our aid consists of maize and wheat; the preferred food of elite groups is rice, of which sufficient quantities are available from domestic harvests.

Official reply 
SIR-I must take issue with your somewhat pessimistic account of the Ugandan economy (May ist). Far from starting to ""sputter"", it has rebounded strongly from the adverse effects of drought and El Nino in 1997. The latest estimate of real economic growth for the fiscal year 1998-99 is a robust 7.8%, more than double the average real growth rate for all developing countries in 1998. Furthermore, consumer price inflation has remained firmly under control at 3.1% and annual average inflation has been well under 10% for six years. 
Donors must speak for themselves as to whether they are ""losing sympathy"" but next year they will increase their support for Uganda. It is also misleading to state that donors pay more than half the government's running costs. Every year since 1995 domestic tax and non-tax revenues have been more than sufficient to fund all recurrent expenditures by government. 
The exchange rate has depreciated over the past 12 months, but Uganda is hardly unique among developing countries in this respect. Given depressed coffee prices, regional political instability and the strength of the dollar against almost all other currencies, it would have been remarkable if the Ugandan shilling had not depreciated. There have been scandals involving corruption, but to describe the private sector as ""mired in corruption"" is a gross exaggeration. Moreover, the recent closure of banks demonstrates our determination to enforce prudential regulations in this sector.

OTTAWA 
IN A general election in 1997, Canada's two main right-wing parties, Reform and the Progressive Conservatives, shared 38% of the vote between them, a similar proportion to that obtained by the governing Liberal Party. But whereas the Liberals won 155 of the 301 seats in the House of Commons, giving a second term to the prime minister, Jean Chretien, Reform managed only 60 and the Conservatives just Zo. Fears that the next election might have a similar outcome led Preston Manning, Reform's leader, to launch a crusade aimed at creating a single right-of-centre party at the federal level, to be called the United Alternative. Yet powerful as the electoral logic of unity might be, so is the hesitation about Mr Manning's proposal. 
In a referendum of Reform members held earlier this month, 60.5% of those voting backed the United Alternative. Mr Manning has taken this as a green light to proceed. But is it? Despite much prodding from party officials, under half of Reform's 64,580 members voted-and only 1,119 of them in the five provinces east of Ontario. Meanwhile, Conservative victories in provincial elections in Ontario and New Brunswick this month do not necessarily help Mr Manning's campaign to ""unite the right"". Joe Clark, the federal Conservative leader, is a steadfast opponent of the United Alternative. 
Reform's strength is in Canada's west. Mr Manning, who founded the party as a populist movement in 1987, is the son of a former premier of Alberta (and an evangelical preacher). But even in Alberta and British Columbia, over a third of those voting rejected Mr Manning's project, apparently fearing that it would dilute the party's principles, especially family values, greater accountability of MPS to their electors, and reform of the federal Senate. This last plank appeals to the country's westerners, who want an elected and more powerful chamber in which each of the ten provinces would have equal representation, instead of the present appointed body, which they see as dominated by prime-ministerial nominees from Quebec and Ontario. 
The Reform Party swept western Canada for the first time in the 1993 election, when the Liberals routed the Conservative govemment. In 1997, though Reform added to its seats and became the official opposition, its share of the popular vote stalled at 19%. In Ontario, Canada's most populous province, the right's division meant that the Liberals took all but two of the 103 seats. 
If Ontario is the key to the fortunes of Canada's right, the province's newly reelected Conservative premier, Mike Harris, is happy to be clutching it. The Reform Party does not compete in provincial elections (except in British Columbia), so Mr Harris faced a clear run on the right in Ontario's poll on June 3rd. But the 45% share of the vote won by the Conservatives went well beyond the core support of both right-wing parties, and owed much to Mr Harris's personality. That might give him a strong claim to lead the United Alternative, if it ever succeeds in becoming a formal party. Mr Harris, however, lacks rapport with French-speaking Quebec, and may prefer to remain on his home turf as a kingmaker. 
The initiative may lie with Mr Clark. He has argued that Reform has reached its ceiling-and its geographical frontier. After the referendum, he invited Reform members (he meant the dissatisfied ones) to help his federal Conservatives draft policy at their convention in September. He has also accepted in principle a scheme for joint candidates in some Ontario constituencies at the next federal election. For Mr Manning this is Plan B, a retreat from-or only a small step towardsforming a new party. But he has a harder hand to play than Mr Clark. In developing policies for the putative United Alternative, Mr Manning must reassure Reform fundamentalists while attracting more centrists. Some doubters have rallied to him since the vote, but time is running out. The Liberals, with or without Mr Chretien at their head, are likely to call an election in 200. ","Canada 's right

Due process of law is often violated; courts are subordinate to the government. Prison conditions are poor; physical torture is rare, the report says, but psychological torture is common.

It also estimates that the jail population has grown by several thousand.

No luck: in March, Cuba tried the four and sentenced them to stiff jail terms. Canada is now reviewing its policy, and has reduced its economic assistance. 
For the past three years, the European Union, whose members account for about half of all foreign business ventures in Cuba, has made further economic cooperation conditional on improvements in human rights.

THE 19th century was the century of the United States; the 20th century will be the century of Canada."" With hindsight, Wilfrid Laurier's prediction, made shortly after the 1896 election which made him Canada's first French Canadian prime minister, looks hopelessly wrong. America is moving from this century to the next as the world's only superpower, supreme in its technology, military power, commercial energy, even (dare disdainful foreigners admit it?) its culture. 
As for Canada, its dollar has sunk against the mighty greenback; businessmen and workers alike complain of high taxes; the media obsessively monitor the ""brain drain"" southwards of the nation's best and brightest; and at the back of everybody's mind is the thought that one day French-speaking Quebec will secede, with incalculable consequences for Canada's very existence as a nation. So forgive Sir Wilfrid's present-day successor, Jean Chretien (above), if his national pride seems a touch less strident: ""We are North Americans but not Americans. We are different because of history and geography, but basically we have built a different society."" 
The prime minister is right. Travel across the vast expanse of Canada, to windswept Newfoundland on the Atlantic coast, or cloud-covered Vancouver on the Pacific coast, or the ice-scape of Nunavut in the Arctic, and you discover that Canadians define their country not by what it is, but what it is not. The word they invariably use is ""un-American""; the phrase they use is ""kinder and gentler""-than America, naturally. They shudder at what one Canadian politician calls America's ""three Gs"": guns, ghettoes and gated communities. 
Instead, there is unanimous support across the political spectrum for the publicly funded system of universal health care (""We don't check your credit card in the hospital on the way to check your pulse,"" says Brian Tobin, premier of Newfoundland, in a dig at American health care). So too with education, where Canada's state schools, unlike America's, are generally good, and where a local student at McGill University, for example, has to pay a mere C$1,668 a year for his tuition. Everyone in Canada, it seems, likes Americans-but few want to live like them. 
Or do they? As John Kenneth Galbraith, a distinguished Canadian economist long ago embraced by the United States, once observed: ""I was brought up in southwestern Ontario, where we were taught that Canadian patriotism should not withstand anything more than a five-dollar-a-month wage differential. Anything more, and you went to Detroit."" 
The price of being different 
There has always been a price to pay, in lower earnings or higher taxes, for resisting the magnetic pull of America, with its huge market and its seemingly boundless opportunities for an individual with energy and initiative. But at what level does the price become too great? In global terms the Canadian economy is performing well: inflation and interest rates are comfortably low; growth this year will be the second highest among the top seven industrial economies (G7), after America, and next year it may come joint first; when federal, provincial and local accounts are added up, the nation's total govemment balance is in surplus; and unemployment has been falling, from a peak of almost 12% of the workforce at the end of 1992 to around 8% today. 
But the global comparison is, for many, beside the point. What really counts is the comparison with America, where the budget is also in surplus; where economic growth has been faster; and where the unemployment rate is only half that of Canada. If there were an ocean between Canada and America, such statistics might not matter. Instead, they share the world's longest land border, made ever more porous by ten years of a bilateral free-trade agreement and five years of the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA); and by the relentless bombardment by America's Tv and radio stations, channelled into almost every Canadian home. No wonder the typical Canadian, living within 200 miles (about 300km) of the United States, feels that his standard of living is slipping behind that of his American counterpart next door. Ten years ago a Canadian dollar was worth around 84 us cents; today it is worth about 68. In other words, the price of being Canadian-of being un-American-is rising. 
This survey will argue that the price remains worth paying. In a sense Canadians have no alternative. No matter that some pundits, both Canadian and foreign, predict that Canada's provinces and territories will be inexorably transformed into a new set of American states: a country cannot unwrite its history, and Canada's history sets it very much apart from America. Whereas 18th-century Americans fought a revolution to free themselves from British rule, their Canadian contemporaries (even those who had once been French) were essentially loyalists. Indeed, in the aftermath of America's war of independence, Canada was the obvious sanctuary for those Americans in the Thirteen Colonies who had kept faith with Britain. 
That loyalty has had both political and cultural implications. Americans think of government as a necessary evil: the less of it, the better. Canadians think of government as a public good, to be judged by its efficiency rather than its size. That way of thinking makes Canadians, whatever their ethnic origins, ""European"" in a way that Americans inherently are not. 
Moreover, the price of being Canadian still buys something worth having. The Canadian dollar's purchasing power is well above its value on the foreign-exchange markets, giving Canada the lowest cost of living in the G7; housing is cheap; and health care (despite a few gripes) and schooling are good. 
Once more, with feeling 
But there are other, less tangible reasons too for paying the price. Canada is a less aggressive place than America at home, and shows a sense of moderation abroad (""soft power"", in the oft-quoted phrase appropriated by the foreign minister, Lloyd Axworthy). During the Vietnam war, young Canadians travelling the world would put the maple leaf flag on their backpacks, lest they be mistaken for Americans; a generation later, the maple leaf still conveys the same message. And, if the world competitiveness ranking produced by Switzerland's IMD business school is to be believed, Canada is easily the safest place to live in the industrial world. It is certainly one of the most beautiful. 
Is all that enough to close what one might call ""the Galbraith gap""? It would be foolish to be complacent. Last April, when two gun-wielding Colorado high-school students killed a teacher, a dozen fellow students and finally themselves, Canadians expressed the usual un-American horror at their southern neighbours, certain that such things do not happen north of the border. Unhappily they do. A week later a 14-year-old boy in Taber, Alberta, walked into his former high school, shot one student dead and wounded another. Suddenly America and Canada seemed not so different after all. ","Canada many be a midget tethered to a giant , but it has no need to feel inferior . What it could do with , writes John Andrews , is some American self - confidence 
 THE 19th century was the century of the United States ; the 20th century will be the century of Canada . "" With hindsight , Wilfrid Laurier 's prediction , made shortly after the 1896 election which made him Canada 's first French Canadian prime minister , looks hopelessly wrong . America is moving from this century to the next as the world 's only superpower , supreme in its technology , military power , commercial energy , even ( dare disdainful foreigners admit it ? ) its culture . 
 As for Canada , its dollar has sunk against the mighty greenback ; businessmen and workers alike complain of high taxes ; the media obsessively monitor the "" brain drain "" southwards of the nation 's best and brightest ; and at the back of everybody 's mind is the thought that one day French - speaking Quebec will secede , with incalculable consequences for Canada 's very existence as a nation . So forgive Jean Chretien's , if Jean Chretien's national pride seems a touch less strident : "" We are North Americans but not Americans . We are different because of history and geography , but basically we have built a different society . "" 
 The prime minister is right . Travel across the vast expanse of Canada , to windswept Newfoundland on the Atlantic coast , or cloud - covered Vancouver on the Pacific coast , or the ice - scape of Nunavut in the Arctic , and you discover that Canadians define their country not by what it is , but what it is not . The word they invariably use is "" un - American "" ; the phrase they use is "" kinder and gentler""-than America , naturally . They shudder at what one Canadian politician calls America 's "" three Gs "" : guns , ghettoes and gated communities . 
 Instead , there is unanimous support across the political spectrum for the publicly funded system of universal health care ( "" We do n't check your credit card in the hospital on the way to check your pulse , "" says Brian Tobin , premier of Newfoundland , in a dig at American health care ) . So too with education , where Canada 's state schools , unlike America 's , are generally good , and where a local student at McGill University , for example , has to pay a mere C$ 1,668 a year for his tuition . Everyone in Canada , it seems , likes Americans - but few want to live like them . 
 Or do they ? As John Kenneth Galbraith , a distinguished Canadian economist long ago embraced by the United States , once observed : "" I was brought up in southwestern Ontario , where we were taught that Canadian patriotism should not withstand anything more than a five - dollar - a - month wage differential . Anything more , and you went to Detroit . "" 
 The price of being different 
 There has always been a price to pay , in lower earnings or higher taxes , for resisting the magnetic pull of America , with its huge market and its seemingly boundless opportunities for an individual with energy and initiative . But at what level does the price become too great ? In global terms the Canadian economy is performing well : inflation and interest rates are comfortably low ; growth this year will be the second highest among the top seven industrial economies ( G7 ) , after America , and next year it may come joint first ; when federal , provincial and local accounts are added up , the nation 's total govemment balance is in surplus ; and unemployment has been falling , from a peak of almost 12 % of the workforce at the end of 1992 to around 8 % today . 
 But the global comparison is , for many , beside the point . What really counts is the comparison with America , where the budget is also in surplus ; where economic growth has been faster ; and where the unemployment rate is only half that of Canada . If there were an ocean between Canada and America , such statistics might not matter . Instead , they share the world 's longest land border , made ever more porous by ten years of a bilateral free - trade agreement and five years of the North American Free - Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) ; and by the relentless bombardment by America 's Tv and radio stations , channelled into almost every Canadian home . No wonder the typical Canadian , living within 200 miles ( about 300 km ) of the United States , feels that his standard of living is slipping behind that of his American counterpart next door . Ten years ago a Canadian dollar was worth around 84 us cents ; today it is worth about 68 . In other words , the price of being Canadian - of being un - American - is rising . 
 This survey will argue that the price remains worth paying . In a sense Canadians have no alternative . No matter that some pundits , both Canadian and foreign , predict that Canada 's provinces and territories will be inexorably transformed into a new set of American states : a country can not unwrite its history , and Canada 's history sets it very much apart from America . Whereas 18th - century Americans fought a revolution to free themselves from British rule , their Canadian contemporaries ( even those who had once been French ) were essentially loyalists . Indeed , in the aftermath of America 's war of independence , Canada was the obvious sanctuary for those Americans in the Thirteen Colonies who had kept faith with Britain . 
 That loyalty has had both political and cultural implications . Americans think of government as a necessary evil : the less of it , the better . Canadians think of government as a public good , to be judged by its efficiency rather than its size .

FOREIGNERS tend to have a straightforward view of how Canada eams its living. It pumps out oil and gas; fells trees; dams rivers to create hydropower; grows wheat on the vast plains of Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan; and harvests salmon and other fish from the oceans. In short, it has a resource-based economy, selling raw materials and farm produce to the rest of the world and financing its comfortable welfare state from the proceeds. 
There is some truth in this generalisation. Canada can boast (though it rarely does, because boasting is not the Canadian way) of being the world's largest exporter of zinc, uranium, potash and asbestos. It is also, unsurprisingly, the biggest exporter of timber, pulp and newsprint-after all, it is the world's second biggest country by area, and a quarter of its territory is covered by forest. Moreover, it is one of the world's largest exporters of fish. 
But many Canadians find this generalisation irritating and out of date. They view the economy as being driven not by resources but by services and manufacturing. Their poster-image of Canada's ability to earn its way in the world is not the new Hibernia oil platform, some 190 miles east of Newfoundland, but the modem car-making factories and software start-ups in Toronto or the pharmaceutical firms in Montreal. Their country may be huge, but it has a mere 3om people, 85% of whom live within about 200 miles of the border with the United States, the world's biggest economy. In an era of soft commodity prices, they say, it is unwise for Canadians to rely on nature's bounty; they must seek their future in ""knowledge-based"" industries that serve the rest of the world. 
They have a point. It is the foreigners' perception that has weakened the Canadian dollar, mirroring the decline in commodity prices. Take the argument one step forward, and it is this foreign perception that makes Canadians the poor relations of the Americans, and so threatens to worsen the flight south of Canadian talent and energy. 
But thoughtful Canadians are less quick to blame the outside world. It is true that the resourcebased industries and agriculture together employ only 5% of the workforce, whereas manufacturing employs around 16% and the service sector nearly three-quarters. But what is just as relevant is that Canada has an economy more dependent than most on foreign trade (exports and imports are equivalent to 82% of gross domestic product, compared with 24% in the United States and 21% in Japan). Although commodities as a share of the country's exports have fallen from almost 60% in 1980, they still account for some 35%. 
The real question is whether Canada is sheltering behind its weak currency as it switches increasingly into services and manufacturing, delaying the economic and workplace reforms that would boost its productivity and hence keep it competitive even if and when its dollar rises. There is no easy answer. To the dismay of politicians such as John Manley, the industry minister, and Paul Martin, the finance minister, who are keen to keep up the pressure for economic reform, a recent OECD study found that in terms of total factor productivity, Canada was actually performing rather well. However, other studies, concentrating on labour productivity alone, show that Canada is lagging behind the southern neighbour against which it must always measure itself. The us Bureau of Labour Statistics, for example, calculates that the gap in manufacturing productivity between Canada and America in 1997 was a daunting 28%-so thank goodness for a weak currency. 
Lies, damn lies and statistics? Commonsense evidence suggests that Canada is indeed less productive than America. Otherwise, surely more of Canada's cars would be as glossy, new and expensive as America's. Last year's most popular car in the United States was the Toyota Camry, which in Canada carries a basic price tag of C$21,300; the most popular car in Canada was the Honda Civic, priced at C$15,700. As Mr Manley pointed out in a recent speech: ""Most people can't afford the mid-sized car; they stay with the compact."" And for good reason: the after-tax income of a Canadian family is about a third lower than in the United States. 
Home comforts 
But it is worth bearing in mind that things could have been so much worse. Canada has not become an underpopulated, underpaid provider of cheap resources to its rich neighbour. Instead, it remains an enviable place to live in, despite the commodity slump of the 1990s and despite the Asian crisis of the past three years, which has cut Canada's exports across the Pacific by a third. One reason is that the Canadian economy has echoed the astonishing boom of its American neighbour (now in its ninth year of continous expansion). Ford, Chrysler, GM, Honda, Toyota and the rest of the car and component manufacturers of the Toronto area-all of them beneficiaries of the 1965 ""Auto Pact"" with America, to which they export most of their output-have prospered thanks to the heroic spending habits of the American consumer. 
But there are two other reasons for Canada's success that have less to do with luck and more with good management. The first is that over the past decade Canada, under the Conservative government of Brian Mulroney, had the courage to embrace free trade, not an easy decision with the American giant lurking next door. The second is that the Liberal government of Mr Chretien has been brave enough to put the country's finances back in order. 
The courage has yet to be fully vindicated: free trade (initially recommended for Canada by a Royal Commission set up in the recessionary early 198os by the Liberal government of Pierre Trudeau) does not seem to have closed the productivity gap with America. Moreover, the present government must still deal with a large public debt the interest on which is ultimately determined by the rates set in America, and thus by the health of the American economy. Even so, the verdict on its economic policy is essentially favourable. 
Take, for example, the Canada-us Free-Trade Agreement, which came into force at the start of 1989 with the promise to eliminate tariffs on primary and manufactured goods over a ten-year period, and to lower the barriers to trade in services. John McCallum, the urbane chief economist of the Royal Bank of Canada, cannot quite give the FTA his complete approval. That would have required a narrowing of the productivity gap and a bigger share of foreign direct investment in North America. Instead, the productivity gap in manufacturing, he reckons, ""has probably been moving in the wrong direction""; living standards, in terms of real personal disposable income per person, have declined by 5% over the past decade, whereas America's have risen by 12%; and Canada's share of the world's foreign direct investment has fallen from 6.5% to 4%. 
All the same, Mr McCallum is happy to give ""two cheers for the FTA"". Canada's exports to the United States have risen from 15% of GDP in 1989 to 3o% in 1998-with half of the increase accounted for by manufacturing rather than commodities. For the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, the increase is even more startling. Ontario's exports to America have doubled over the decade to an extraordinary 40% of its GDP; Quebec's have doubled to around 24% of its GDP. The cheers, however, should not be for the FTA alone, but also for the child it gave birth to on January ist 1994, the North American FreeTrade Agreement, which extended the free-trade regime to Mexico. And most of all, some would argue, they should be for Mr Mulroney, who fought a general election to overcome the resistance to free trade of the then Liberal opposition, and of the assorted ranks of unions, church groups and social activists, all of them concerned that the FTA and NAFTA would destroy jobs, reduce wages, damage the environment and lead to the demise of the nation's culture along with its welfare state. As it turned out, they were wrong and Mr Mulroney was right. 
Liberal conservatism 
In some ways that is his revenge on the political enemies who still seek to belittle his administration with allegations of corruption. But he cannot claim all the credit. Part of it must surely go to Mr Chretien and his Liberals, who swallowed their opposition to free trade, implemented NAFTA within weeks of coming to power in November 1993, and then lived up to the political requirement to put Canada's financial house in good enough order to survive without the protection of tariffs and quotas. 
There is some irony in that achievement, given that the Liberal Party is normally associated with the soft, ""tax-and-spend"" policies that go with a leftof-centre tradition. In practice, however, the Liberal government has been at least as hard in its economic policy as its Conservative predecessor. It accepted not only NAFTA, but also the Mulroney government's much-loathed 7% goods and services tax (GST). Add to that a decision in 1997 to raise payroll taxes sharply to sustain the viability of the Canada Pension Plan, and a tightening of the unemployment insurance scheme, requiring beneficiaries to have worked longer before qualifying for handouts. Add, too, restraints on federal public-spending programmes that have brought their share of GDP down to 12.6% this year from 16.6% in the Liberals"" first year in office. All this has changed the political cultureand helped to bring about, for the first time in decades, a federal budget surplus in both of the past two years, with the prospect of more to come. 
Why did it not happen sooner? The brief answer is that it has taken Canadians a generation to realise that they were living beyond their means. Older Canadians assumed that the economic boom following the second world war would continue indefinitely. The figures tell a different tale: in 13 of the 22 years from 1953 through 1974, Canada's annual GDP grew by 5% or more; in only three of the subsequent 19 years that led to the Chretien government did annual growth again top 5% (see chart 1, previous page). What maintained Canada's comfortable standard of living was not its productivity but its ability to borrow. Total government debt rose from 18% of GDP in 1974 to 70% in 1993-by which time net external debt had risen to 44% of GDP, easily the highest in the G7. Depressingly, Canada's record on labour relations was also poor: between 1986 and 1995 the country lost an average of 292 working days per 1,000 employees through strikes every year, compared with an average of 117 days for the OECD and 62 for America. 
So what comes next? It would be a mistake for Canada to rest on its laurels as the only G7 country other than America to enjoy a financial surplus. After all, the federal debt-to-GDP ratio is still around 65% (compared with the 60% qualifying benchmark the European Union set for membership of the single-currency club). Moreover, Mr Martin cannot play Scrooge for ever: he is under pressure to spread some of the surplus to the provinces in the form of increased investment in health and higher ""equalisation"" payments, which transfer part of the govemment's tax revenues from the rich provinces to the poor ones. 
Thomas d'Aquino, chief executive of the Business Council on National Issues (whose corporate members account for some 75% of the country's private-sector GDP), is happy to applaud both Conservatives and Liberals for embracing free trade and fighting the good fight against inflation and deficit financing. What he wants now is action to cut the national debt, narrow the productivity gap with America and lower taxes. ""The personal income-tax burden is the highest in the G7, which increases the brain drain and inhibits investment,"" he says. ""We have to target these areas and fix them."" 
All of this is doubtless more easily demanded than granted. But at least there is a growing recognition, at both the political and popular level, that the demands are reasonable. Mr Martin, for instance, spies the beginning of a new, long wave of economic growth in which the rewards will go to those countries that are prepared ""to be flexible to advance tomorrow's industries rather than shore up the past""-which is political code for a willingness to ease the way of the entrepreneur by reducing regulation and lowering taxes. 
Read my vote 
A more legible code, however, is the result of last month's provincial election in Ontario, where the electorate returned the tax-cutting Progressive Conservative government of Mike Harris for a second term-the first time since 1971 that a party has won back-to-back majorities. The province's Liberals and the left-wing New Democratic Party had argued that Mr Harris's 30% cut in provincial income tax had meant cuts in health care and education too. A promised cut of a further 20%, they said, would make matters that much worse. Most of the city of Toronto duly voted against Mr Harris, but enough of the prosperous suburbs and the rural areas supported him to give his party 45.1% of the popular vote and 59 of the province's 103 seats. The message for other provinces is simple: even in wishy-washy, unAmerican Canada it is possible to cut taxes and spending and still be re-elected. 
In fact, Canada is not as wishy-washy as all that. Most of the provincial governments-the few exceptions, ironically, include Ontario-have already managed to balance their budgets, helped by the appetite for their products south of the border. The trick will be to keep their finances healthy when the inevitable American downturn comes. Will Alberta, for example, a fertile and resource-rich province which has already abolished taxes on capital and payrolls, be able to implement its promise to raise personal tax exemptions and then levy a single tax rate of just ii%? Will other, less well-endowed provinces be able to lighten the tax load and yet still keep the sacred cows of health and education properly fed? A great deal rests on the answers-not least the willingness of Canadians to stay put. ","The economy has been overhauled , but it still needs some fine - tuning

"" The personal income - tax burden is the highest in the G7 , which increases the brain drain and inhibits investment , "" he says . "" We have to target these areas and fix them . "" 
 All of this is doubtless more easily demanded than granted . But at least there is a growing recognition , at both the political and popular level , that the demands are reasonable . Mr Martin , for instance , spies the beginning of a new , long wave of economic growth in which the rewards will go to those countries that are prepared "" to be flexible to advance tomorrow 's industries rather than shore up the past""-which is political code for a willingness to ease the way of the entrepreneur by reducing regulation and lowering taxes . 
 Read my vote 
 A more legible code , however , is the result of last month 's provincial election in Ontario , where the electorate returned the tax - cutting Progressive Conservative government of Mike Harris for a second term - the first time since 1971 that a party has won back - to - back majorities . The province 's Liberals and the left - wing New Democratic Party had argued that Mr Harris 's 30 % cut in provincial income tax had meant cuts in health care and education too . A promised cut of a further 20 % , they said , would make matters that much worse . Most of the city of Toronto duly voted against Mr Harris , but enough of the prosperous suburbs and the rural areas supported him to give his party 45.1 % of the popular vote and 59 of the province 's 103 seats . The message for other provinces is simple : even in wishy - washy , unAmerican Canada it is possible to cut taxes and spending and still be re - elected . 
 In fact , Canada is not as wishy - washy as all that . Most of the provincial governments - the few exceptions , ironically , include Ontario - have already managed to balance their budgets , helped by the appetite for their products south of the border . The trick will be to keep their finances healthy when the inevitable American downturn comes . Will Alberta , for example , a fertile and resource - rich province which has already abolished taxes on capital and payrolls , be able to implement its promise to raise personal tax exemptions and then levy a single tax rate of just ii% ? Will other , less well - endowed provinces be able to lighten the tax load and yet still keep the sacred cows of health and education properly fed ? A great deal rests on the answers - not least the willingness of Canadians to stay put .",20,Canada,A29-148,IN TERM,True,the Liberal government of Mr Chretien,2,True
1999-07-24,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224085673/fulltext/9B917570300045D4PQ/70?accountid=14657,"Quebec is already separate, so does it reay need to be more so? 
""DO YOU agree that Quebec should become sovereign, after having made a formal offer to Canada for a new economic and political partnership?"" An astonishing 94% of Quebec's electorate turned out to give their answer in the province's referendum in October 1995; 49.4% said yes, So.6% said no. To the immense relief of the rest of Canada, national unity had been preserved, albeit by a mere 53,498 votes out of nearly 4.7m. 
The constant question of Canadian politics is how long that unity will last. Ever since General de Gaulle came to Montreal's Expo '67 and declared, ""Vive Montreal, vive le Quebec libre, vive le Canada francais, vive la France,"" that question has been engraved into Canada's political consciousness. 
A free Quebec; a French Canada? Canadians in general, and even-if the polls are right-Canadians in Quebec, may shudder at the implications, but they can hardly ignore them. Whereas most Canadians think of themselves as ""un-American"", most Quebeckers think of themselves as ""un-English"". And reasonably so: francophone settlers began landing on Canada's Atlantic shore more than three centuries ago. Today's Quebeckers are the descendants of a French colony whose Parisian overlords ceded it to Britain in 1763 at the end of the Seven Years' war, when France relinquished all its possessions in North America. The provincial motto, emblazoned on every car's number plate, is ""Je me souviens"" (I remember)-an allusion to a poem with the bitter line, ""I remember that I was bom under the fleur-de-lis and grew up under the rose."" Born happy under France, that is, and raised unhappy under England. From its restaurants to its street signs, its newspapers to its sense of fashion, Montreal could be a pleasant city in France, but certainly not in America or Britain. 
But must ""un-English"" also mean ""un-Canadian""? In a country that celebrates diversity it is somewhat ironic that a founding piece of the mosaic finds it so hard to fit in. Just how hard has on occasion been murderously obvious. In October 1970 the Front de Liberation du Quebec kidnapped first James Cross, Britain's trade commissioner in the province, and then Pierre Laporte, the province's minister of labour and immigration. Mr Cross was eventually released (his captors were allowed free passage to Cuba), but Mr Laporte was killed. 
Happily, the extremism of the FLQ found little popular support. When Pierre Trudeau reacted to the kidnappings by imposing martial law, he had the backing not just of 88% of all Canadians but of 86% of Quebeckers. On the other hand the Fs.Q'S goal of separatism touched, and still touches, a sympathetic nerve. The Parti Quebecois, formed in 1968 with the avowed goal of creating a sovereign Ouebec in which Quebeckers will be maitres chez eux (masters in their own house), began the 1970s with a vote of 24% in the provincial election; by 1976 it had almost doubled its support and had become the governing party. In 1985 it lost power to the Liberals, but by 1994 it was back again, winning 77 of the provincial legislature's 125 seats. 
Today the PQ remains in government in Quebec city, winning 75 seats in last November's provincial election. Moreover, in elections to the federal parliament in Ottawa, the Bloc Quebecois (to all intents and purposes the same as the Parti) in 1993 won 54 of the 295 seats in Canada's House of Commons, enough to make it the official (but ""loyal""?) opposition. That has so far proved the high-water point: in the 1997 general election the Bloc won 44 seats. Even so, the separatist tide will have to ebb a lot more before the rest of Canada can relax. 
Optimists to the fore 
Sanguine federalists say that day will be coming soon. The Quebec question, they argue, is a hangover from the western world's febrile 196os, whose iconoclastic baby-boomers are now growing old and irrelevant. According to those optimists, the result of the 1995 referendum was not so much a narrow escape for federalism as a final, abortive fling for separatism. The margin of defeat, they say, would have been a great deal wider had it not been for the charisma of Lucien Bouchard, who rose from his sick-bed (having come close to death from a flesh-eating disease) to rescue the referendum campaign of the PQ premier of the day, Jacques Parizeau. 
It is a tempting argument. Mr Bouchard, now the leader of the PQ and premier of Quebec (having once been a federal minister in Brian Mulroney's Conservative government), says he will call a new referendum only if there are ""winning conditions"". Whatever those might be, the federalists do not see them coming in the short term: they think that at the age of 6o the pragmatic Mr Bouchard does not want to go down in history as the man who called a referendum and then, like others before him, lost it. 
But there is a counter-argument. Separatists claim that their narrow defeat in 1995 was the result of anglophone propaganda, from the praise that President Clinton heaped on Canada to the scaremongering of the federal government over the practical problems that would ensue from a secession by Quebec (what, for example, would replace the equalisation payments that Quebec gets from richer provinces?). 
Brian Tobin, now the Liberal premier of Newfoundland but then a minister in Mr Chretien's cabinet, claims credit for bringing 150,ooo Canadians from across the country to a rally in Montreal for the federalist cause-in essence, to convince the Quebeckers that the rest of Canada loved them after all. That rally may or may not have been decisive (some Quebeckers resented what they saw as interference), but Mr Parizeau had no qualms about blaming defeat on ""money and the ethnic vote"". His promise in the aftermath was simple: ""The battle for a country is not over, and it will not be over until we have one."" 
What puzzles outsiders is that this issue of separatism should be such an enduring characteristic of Quebec. Roughly a quarter of Canada's 3om people consider French their mother tongue, and almost all of them are in Quebec, where more than 93% of the 7m residents are either exclusively francophone or bilingual in French and English. Is their identity so threatened by the anglophone hordes of America and the rest of Canada that they must keep erecting political defences around their culture? After all, it is entirely possible for a francophone to live and work in Quebec, even in Montreal-its opening to the world-without speaking a word of English. 
But things could have taken a different turn, say both the separatists and a lot of Quebec federalists. Look at what happened in the late 196os and early 1970s, when waves of immigrants were arriving in Montreal. In 1969 riots broke out in the Montreal suburb of St Leonard because Italian immigrants insisted on sending their children to anglophone schools. Two years later the census suggested both that immigrants preferred to learn English and that they were eaming more than francophone Canadians. Much more of this, alarmists started saying, and Montreal's French Canadians will become a poor minority in an English-speaking city. 
The Quebeckers' response, first under its Liberal premier, Robert Bourassa, and then under the PQ'S Rene Levesque, was to draw up legislation imposing French as the language of education (including for the children of non-francophone immigrants), govement, the workplace and even-witness the road signs-the street. More than a decade later, when Canada's Supreme Court ruled that parts of the legislation were unconstitutional, Quebec simply asserted the right of any province to take exception to the constitution, and reaffirmed the absolute primacy of the French language. 
But at what cost? Many anglophone, pan-Canadian companies decamped to a grateful Toronto, and so did many anglophone Quebeckers. According to the federal govemment's Statistics Canada, between 1976 and 1996 more than 4oo,ooo Englishspeakers left Quebec for other provinces-and the true total was bound to be higher, because StatsCan did not monitor those anglophones who decided to leave Canada altogether. The federalists will say the anglophone exodus can only be bad for the province, since it drains Quebec of skills and investment. To prosper, they add, Quebec must counter its declining birth rate by attracting more immigrants; but because of the province's language restrictions, only 9% of Quebec's population is foreign-born, compared with a national share of around 17%. 
The separatists will answer ""tant pis"". Let Quebec be French and willingly pay the price for it. In practice this reaction is not quite as self-destructive as it seems. Because its French-speaking population has nowhere else to go, Quebec offers employers a stable workforce. It also, in a truly dirigiste French way, offers the right kind of foreign investor the right kind of subsidy. Couple those attractions with cheap power, low wages and a geographical position that gives manufacturers easy access to New York and Boston, and French Quebec-despite an unemployment rate above the Canadian averageis far from being a basket case. As Mr Bouchard told a New York audience in April, quoting a study by PricewaterhouseCoopers, ""Among the major North American cities, Montreal is i5th in terms of population. But it now ranks ninth for the number of high-tech companies; seventh for the number of jobs in information technology; sixth in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors; fifth in aerospace; and it stands at the very top for the proportion of the population working in high technology."" 
All of which is probably true. And there is no denying Quebec's relevance to New York the province provides the Big Apple's media with newsprint, its commuters with subway cars, and its office computers with many of their innards. Separate Quebec from the rest of Canada, and the province becomes America's sixth largest trading partner, behind Canada, Mexico and Japan and ahead of countries such as Britain, France, Italy and Brazil. But will this be enough to create ""winning conditions""? 
According to the PQ, the province's economic strength shows that independence is viable. The rest of Canada, however, wants to know not whether a Quebec secession is possible, but whether it is fair. The implied exasperation is surely reasonable. The rest of Canada has been making concessions to francophone sensitivities since 1969, when the federal government of Pierre Trudeau, a truly federalist son of Quebec, made French an official language on a par with English. Ever since, bilingualism has been the creed of the Ottawa government-hence the proliferation of French accents in ministry buildings from the janitors to the press secretaries. 
The trouble is that no concession can please everyone. In 1982 Mr Trudeau ""patriated"" the constitution from Britain to Canada, attaching an amending formula and a ""Canadian charter of rights and freedoms"" to the old British North America Act. The new Constitution Act spelled out in detail the equality of French with English, yet Quebec, alone among the ten provinces, withheld its approval. It wanted a veto on constitutional amendments; a penalty-free opt-out from any new cost-sharing programmes; a say in immigration policy, and in the appointment of Supreme Court judges; and-above all-recognition as a ""distinct society"". 
Five years later, at Meech Lake,just north of Ottawa, Brian Mulroney, the then prime minister, gathered together the ten provincial premiers and hammered out an accord that more or less satisfied Quebec (though the separatists still complained that the ""distinct society"" clause did not go far enough). All that remained, once the fine details had been agreed to in Ottawa on June 3rd 199o, was for the federal parliament and the provincial legislatures to ratify the accord by the deadline of June 3oth 199o. 
Try, try again 
It was not to be. Elections during the ratification period produced new governments in New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Manitoba, none of which was enthusiastic about the Meech Lake accord. So when Elijah Harper, the sole ""First Nation"" (Indian) member of the Manitoba legislature, filibustered against ratification, the accord died. 
Never mind. In August 1992, after much shuttling among the provinces, the indefatigable Mr Mulroney convened another conference-this time including the leaders of Canada's aboriginal peoples-in Charlottetown, the historic ""cradle of Confederation"" in Prince Edward Island. Once again, Quebec was recognised as a ""distinct society"", and in addition aboriginal Canadians were assured of their ""inherent right to self-government"". All that remained was a national referendum to answer the question: ""Do you agree that the Constitution of Canada should be renewed on the basis of the agreement reached on August 28th 199z?"" On October z6th some 54% of Canadians, swayed no doubt by a declining economy and the imposition the previous year of the unpopular goods and services tax, said they did not. 
Will there be yet another attempt to bind Quebec happily, rather than reluctantly, to the rest of Canada? And another after that, and after that? Such Sisyphean labours may well be Canada's fate. After all, the opinion polls regularly show that a majority of Quebeckers do not want secession; but the majority is small, and meanwhile only a quarter of francophones think of themselves as ""equally a Canadian and a Quebecker"", compared with the two-fifths who define themselves as ""a Quebecker first and Canadian second"". The fact is that what Quebeckers want most is what black American teenagers call ""respect""-the definition of which Quebeckers and non-Quebeckers seem unable to agree on, and which can also shift with the wind. 
Oddly, both federalists and separatists are now looking to Europe for a resolution. In Ottawa, Mr Chretien takes encouragement from the recent creation of a Scottish parliament and a Welsh assembly within the United Kingdom (though it is hard to see how that helps, given that Britain's devolution of power remains well behind Canada's). In Quebec, Bernard Landry, the province's vice-premier and minister of finance, enthuses over the European Union's common market and single currency: ""It was a bigger step for France to accept the Maastricht treaty than it would be for Canada to accept the separation of Quebec. If you want to solve the problem of Quebec tomorrow, offer the European model."" 
But it will not be tomorrow. For all the Po's emollient promise that a sovereign Quebec would bear its fair share of accumulated debts, and would join Canada in ""an economic and political partnership"", a rupture would be neither quick nor simple. As Canada's Supreme Court ruled last August, Quebec does not have a unilateral right under the constitution to secede, but nor does the rest of Canada have the right to block Quebec: ""A clear majority vote in Quebec on a clear question in favour of secession would confer democratic legitimacy on the secession initiative which all of the other participants in Confederation would have to recognise."" 
But such a clear vote on a clear question would be the start, not the end, of the matter: ""The corollary of a legitimate attempt by one participant in Confederation to seek an amendment to the constitution is an obligation on all parties to come to the negotiating table."" And who knows how long such negotiations might last, and where they might lead? ","Quebec is already separate , so does it reay need to be more so ?

Perhaps so. But federalism notwithstanding, Mr Chretien's powers of appointment and patronage are as broad and unfettered as those of any leader around that Sarajevo table-as Canadians are now being reminded. 
Some of those powers are unremarkable: on August 3rd, the prime minister brought five new faces into his cabinet, and quashed speculation that he intended to step down before the next election, which may come in 2001. But in the next few weeks Mr Chretien will also be filling some plum jobs outside government. These include the posts of govemor-general, head of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation-and, possibly, a new chief justice, since Antonio Lamer, who has held the job for nine years, recently said he would retire ""sooner rather than later"". 
Mr Chretien is taking a keen interest in all three jobs. Though both Eddie Goldenberg, his personal political adviser, and Mel Capp, the clerk of Canada's Privy Council, have a say in such appointments, the prime minister will take the final decision. 
These count among an almost endless list of appointments made by order-incouncil-meaning they are decided by the federal cabinet and, ultimately, by the prime minister. Even those jobs that appear merely ceremonial can be influential. Take the governor-general. He is Queen Elizabeth's representative, but since the monarchy is almost invisible in Canada, for most practical purposes he is the head of state. Romeo LeBlanc, the incumbent govemor-general, who is 71, said in April that he would like to step down early from his five-year term, before the start of the millennium fun. 
His successor is likely to be in office when Quebec's provincial government holds a third referendum on independence from Canada. Critics of recent governors-general say they have failed to speak out firmly and often for Canadian unity. That might change if the post goes to John de Chastelain, a former army chief and ambassador to the United States now helping to bring peace to Northem Ireland. Other possible nominees-it is the turn of an Ontarian, and maybe a woman who is not a politician-include Adrienne Clarkson, an immigrant from China who made her name as a broadcaster, and Hilary Weston, now Ontario's lieutenant-governor. Mrs Weston, however, is Irish and her French may not be adequate. 
Mr LeBlanc, an Acadian (as descendants of the earliest French settlers in eastern Canada are known) from New Brunswick and a former fisheries minister, owes his post to his political friendship with Mr Chretien. But there have been few suggestions, except in his case, that the prime minister has used the jobs in his gift as a source of political patronage. There was broad applause in Canada for his latest nominee to the Supreme Court: Louise Arbour, who moves this month from being the United Nations' chief war-crimes prosecutor. 
There are mounting calls for checks on prime-ministerial power over judicial appointments, especially since cases based on the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in the 1982 constitution have led the court into many far-reaching judgments on social matters. A recent report by the Institute for Research on Public Policy, a Montreal-based think-tank, argued for Supreme Court judges either to be nominated by an independent commission or to face confirmation by a parliamentary committee. Fine, except that the prime minister also has unfettered power to make appointments to the Senate-Mr Chretien has named nearly 40 senators, restoring its Liberal majority-and Canadian members of Parliament have even less independence than their British counterparts.

At the last federal election, they won just 11% of the vote and 21 seats, down from the 20% and 43 seats they enjoyed a decade earlier. While the party has lost touch with its traditional trade-union supporters, some of whom have migrated to the right-wing Reform party, it has failed to win new voters among the middle classes. Is that about to change? 
Alexa McDonough, the party's federal leader, has been quietly eyeing Britain's Tony Blair and Germany's Gerhard Schroder, and their courtship of the centre. Even while denying it, she appears to be stealing along the same path. ""We must lay out a new way-- not an old way, not a Third Way, but a made-- in-Canada way,"" she gushed at her party's national convention in Ottawa last month. Through such vagueness, Ms McDonough managed to avoid colliding with trade-- union veterans, while slipping through an economic policy paper which could help the party accommodate business interests. 
The paper lauds fiscal responsibility. It speaks of using part of the fiscal surplus to reduce the national debt, but (with a nod to Keynes) of maintaining ""balanced budgets over the course of the business cycle"". It also favours tax cuts for the less well-off. This text prompted Mike Harris, Ontario's Conservative premier (who defeated the province's NDP government in i995 by promising a 30% tax cut), into sending a mischievous letter of congratulation. 
Although Ms McDonough attacked ""run-amuck globalisation"", she made some aspects of it sound positively cosy, as when she spoke of a man from Ebenezer, a tiny village on Prince Edward Island, who ""sells smoked fish in the farmers' market on weekends"" and is part of a global group that discusses grassroots democracy on the Internet. 
Another policy paper, on health-a big issue at recent elections-proposes higher spending, but emphasises community and preventive care. A third paper endorses constitutional change, which Jean Chretien's Liberal government has shunned. The NDP is conciliatory to Quebec, offering ""asymmetric federalism"", including the power to opt out of social programmes with full compensation from Ottawa. Throw in electoral reform (abolition of the unelected Senate and German-style proportional representation); curbing the prime minister's powers; and a close look at Australia's planned vote on severing ties to Britain's queen-and the New Democrats have achieved a distinctively Blairish set of policies. 
Not before time. At the last federal election, the NDP did unexpectedly well in the Atlantic provinces, Ms McDonough's home base. But in Nova Scotia, having almost won power in a three-way fight in a provincial election last year, the party failed by a broader margin in a second election in July. And it has problems elsewhere. The NDP government of British Columbia was already unpopular even before last month's resignation, over a scandal, of its premier. 
The NDP'S best hopes may once again lie in its birthplace in the prairie provinces, where Reform has made inroads in federal elections. Saskatchewan's NDP premier Roy Romanow, having balanced his budget, can promise a tax cut, offer local students one year's free tuition at a post-secondary college, and hire hundreds of extra health workers. He is almost assured of re-election for a third term on September 16th. That might help the NDP in neighbouring Manitoba in an election days later. 
Those campaigns meant the convention had few prairies delegates, giving greater visibility to trade unionists inveighing against the Third Way. But Ms McDonough won the important decisions, and has the quiet support of Ken Georgetti, the new leader of the Canadian Labour Congress.

EVER since 1995, when a referendum in Quebec narrowly rejected a call for the province to seek independence, the question of the future of Canada's federation has been in an uneasy limbo. The federal government of Jean Chretien has seemed content to ignore it. Even Quebec's separatist government accepts that the time is not right for another referendum. But this month, Canada's trickiest political issue has stirred tentatively back into life. 
Over a year ago, Canada's Supreme Court ruled that any future vote for independence would have to show a ""clear majority"" to a ""clear question"" if it were to have legal validity. After much pondering, Mr Chretien's government has now indicated that it may be ready to act on the ruling. On October 12th, in the Speech from the Throne that formally opened the new session of Parliament, the government set out its resolve in a single, vague sentence, saying that ""the principle of clarity will be respected"". 
But how this principle will be defined is no clearer than before. Nor did the government say whether it planned to proceed by legislation, policy paper or other means. Even so, this will be too much for Quebec's premier, Lucien Bouchard. His Parti Quebecois (PQ) had put a brave face on the Supreme Court judgment, welcoming the obligation it imposed on the rest of Canada to negotiate separation if Quebec voted to split. But last week this mask slipped. In an about-turn remarkable even for a provincial government expert at tacking with changing winds, Quebec said that it would, in essence, ignore the court's ruling. The legitimacy and logistics of an independence vote were political, not legal questions, said Joseph Facal, Quebec's minister for inter-governmental affairs. 
Mr Facal said that this new stance was intended to discourage Mr Chretien from pledging action in the Speech from the Throne. If so, he cannot have hoped for success, and did not achieve it. But he seemed to have another purpose: to direct attention from an international conference on federalism. Evidence for this is that he chose to announce his plan on the eve of the gathering. 
The meeting brought together some 600 politicians or other worthies from 25 countries, including President Bill Clinton and his Mexican counterpart, Ernesto Zedillo. Its organisers, who included Mr Facal's federal counterpart (and former professor) Stephane Dion, promoted the Forum of Federations as an arena in which to pass on tips about how to improve a type of government from which, of course, the Po wants to withdraw Quebec. 
Holding this meeting at a Quebec resort village was ""ironic"", claimed Mr Bouchard. The PQ's response was to try to hijack the event, to force the Quebec issue on to the conference's discussions. But that seemed to rebound. Looking several times directly at Mr Bouchard, Mr Clinton delivered as forceful and direct a speech in favour of Canadian unity as any United States president has ever given. Even George Reid, a Scottish National Party veteran and deputy speaker of Scotland's new Parliament, could not be drawn into endorsing Quebec's independence. ""For the Scots, sovereignty is like virginity. When lost it doesn't belong to anyone else and, given the right circumstances, losing it can even be a pleasurable experience,"" he argued. But not, it seems, for the PQ. ","MONT TREMBLANT

1999-12-18,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224059317/fulltext/337515DFDD804C47PQ/20?accountid=14657,"ON THE face of things, the Clarity Bill unveiled this month by the Liberal government of Jean Chretien has a modest and innocent aim summed up by its title: to minimise the chance that any future referendum on secession by Quebec should be fogged by ambiguity over the options at stake. Yet, if the bill has immediately given rise to a cloud of invective, that was predictable: when it was tabled on December 13th, it was the first time in the 30 years since Quebec's separatist movement emerged as a mainstream force that the federal government had taken the initiative over the secession question. 
The cue for this was a ruling by Canada's Supreme Court in August 1998 that the federal government would be obliged to negotiate secession for Quebec if a referendum with a ""clear question"" produced a ""clear majority"". That seemingly diaphanous judgment in fact left its own murky question: what exactly does ""clear"" mean? The court said that it was not its business to give an answer. Neither does the Clarity Bill do so directly. instead, it sets out the procedure to be followed-and it is one that outrages the separatists. 
The bill says, first, that although Quebec-or, indeed, any other province-is free to hold a referendum on secession, the question put to the people must first be vetted by the federal parliament. To get its approval, the question would have to be direct and concise, and could make no mention of future economic or political partnerships with Canada. independent statehood, or stay in Canada: none of the studied fuzziness of the questions put to Quebeckers in 198o and again in 1995. 
Second, if the question is asked and the answer from the people is yes, the federal government will once again step in, to decide if the majority is adequate. Factors the bill says should be taken into account include the size of the majority, the turnout and ""any other matters or circumstances"" considered relevant. So what might be considered a ""clear"" majority? That's not, er, clear from the bill. But what the answer would not be is the traditional 50%plus-one, according to Stephane Dion, the federal minister for inter-governmental affairs, and the bill's godfather. Only after the House of Commons determined that there was ""a clear expression of the will of the population"" would the federal government negotiate a secession agreement. 
""We are forcing them to be honest,"" said Mr Chr6tien, who overrode the misgivings of three senior Quebec ministers in tabling the bill. ""Who can object?"" Not many, perhaps, in the rest of Canada, still shaken as it is by the near-death experience of the 1995 referendum, which came within a percentage point of approving secession. But many Quebeckers do object. Admittedly, approval of the bill would mean that Canada would join Austria in being the only countries whose legislation allows for their own eventual break-up. Separatists argue, however, that, though the bill makes secession possible in theory, it would become nearly impossible in practice. ""It's a veto given to jean Chretien on the future of Quebec,"" bemoans Daniel Turp, a separatist federal MP. 
Whatever its long-term impact, the bill is likely to shake the separatist movement out of a recent decline that has seen support for its cause in Quebec fall towards 30%. certainly, that is the hope of Lucien Bouchard, Quebec's premier. Within hours of the bill's publication, he promised legislation of his own reaffirming Quebec's exclusive right to determine its future. Mr Bouchard, whose resignation was rumoured just weeks ago, is also talking about holding hearings around the province to build up what he called""a sacred union"" on the issue. 
other separatist groups, knowing that nothing drives up support for secession like a real or perceived insult or injury to Quebec from the rest of Canada, have also gone to work, one group has sent a complaint to the UN Human Rights Commission, another has taken out full-page newspaper advertisements. Meanwhile, the province's labour and student federations have put aside their own protracted battles with the Bouchard government over spending cuts, and are promising demonstrations and protests. 
It is not only separatists who oppose the bill, however. Its potential to provoke the opposite of its intended effect had Joe Clark, the Conservative leader, calling it ""a road map to secession"". Alexa McDonough, who leads the New Democratic Party, initially said it was ""madness"" (though her party disagrees). Unhappiest of all is probably jean Charest, the Liberal leader in Quebec. His job requires walking an often impossibly fine line, defending federalism without seeming too compliant, and standing up for Quebec without alienating the rest of Canada. So far, Mr Charest has merely said that the federal government has no place interfering in the referendum process. But, as the debate over the Clarity Bill heats up, Mr Charest may have to retreat to the federalist side. 
The Liberals have a clear majority in the federal parliament. Since the Reform Party, the official opposition, has said it will support the bill, though seeking to amend it, its passage, if not necessarily swift, seems assured. As for Mr Chretien, who has been prime minister since 1993, some Liberals are whispering that the bid to fix the rules for secession may be his last big battle before bowing out. It looks like an effort to enter history as the man who nailed Canada together, even if with a heavy hand. ","ON THE face of things , Jean Chretien has a modest and innocent aim summed up by Jean Chretien's title : to minimise the chance that any future referendum on secession by Quebec should be fogged by ambiguity over the options at stake . Yet , if Jean Chretien has immediately given rise to a cloud of invective , that was predictable : when Jean Chretien was tabled on December 13th , it was the first time in the 30 years since Quebec 's separatist movement emerged as a mainstream force that the federal government had taken the initiative over the secession question . 
 The cue for this was a ruling by Canada 's Supreme Court in August 1998 that the federal government would be obliged to negotiate secession for Quebec if a referendum with a "" clear question "" produced a "" clear majority "" . That seemingly diaphanous judgment in fact left its own murky question : what exactly does "" clear "" mean ? The court said that it was not its business to give an answer . Neither does Jean Chretien do so directly . instead , Jean Chretien sets out the procedure to be followed - and Jean Chretien is one that outrages the separatists . 
 Jean Chretien says , first , that although Quebec - or , indeed , any other province - is free to hold a referendum on secession , the question put to the people must first be vetted by the federal parliament . To get its approval , the question would have to be direct and concise , and could make no mention of future economic or political partnerships with Canada . independent statehood , or stay in Canada : none of the studied fuzziness of the questions put to Quebeckers in 198o and again in 1995 . 
 Second , if the question is asked and the answer from the people is yes , the federal government will once again step in , to decide if the majority is adequate . Factors Jean Chretien says should be taken into account include the size of the majority , the turnout and "" any other matters or circumstances "" considered relevant . So what might be considered a "" clear "" majority ? That 's not , er , clear from Jean Chretien . But what the answer would not be is the traditional 50%plus - one , according to Stephane Dion , the federal minister for inter - governmental affairs , and Jean Chretien's godfather . Only after the House of Commons determined that there was "" a clear expression of the will of the population "" would the federal government negotiate a secession agreement . 
 "" We are forcing them to be honest , "" said Mr Chr6tien , who overrode the misgivings of three senior Quebec ministers in tabling Jean Chretien . "" Who can object ?

But in recent years, Canada's judiciary has acquired some of the activism more often associated with their southern neighbours. That has prompted critics to accuse the court of making the law, or ""fishing off Parliament's dock"", as one has put it. And it means that the swearing in of a new chief justice of the Supreme Court, due on January 7th, is more than a routine event-and not just because the appointee, Beverley McLachlin, is the first woman to hold the job. 
The court's changed role stems from the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which was attached to Canada's 1982 constitution, and has been regularly invoked in cases involving civil rights. During the past decade, under Antonio Lamer, the outgoing chief justice, the court has been required to apply this charter to increasingly complex matters. The judges have often been split, their rulings nuanced and controversial. 
The first criticisms came from the left, after the court ruled that the right to strike was not protected, but that the right of tobacco companies to freedom of speech (and thus to advertise) was. Recently, it has been conservatives who have complained, about rulings on abortion, the rights of gay and lesbian couples, and the interpretation of Indian treaties. In September, the court overturned a conviction against Donald Marshall, a Mi'kmaq Indian, for fishing eels out of season, citing a 1760 treaty that gave the Mi'kmaq the right to ""hunt, fish and gather"". Such was the Uproar in the Atlantic provinces that in November the court took the unusual step of ""clarifying""its decision, saying that fishing restrictions did indeed apply to the Mi'kmaq. 
Conservative provincial governments in Ontario and Alberta grumble that the court is ""determining social and economic policy"". They want its powers curbed. Another rightwinger, Preston Manning, who leads the Reform Party (the official opposition), has argued that Parliament should review nominations to the court (as Congress does in the United States), which at present are in the prime minister's gift. 
Mr Manning also wants a parliamentary committee to review the Supreme Court's judgments, to see whether they are compatible with the charter and with statute law. In addition, he wants Parliament to make use of a clause in the constitution which allows the legislature to sustain a law even though the court has ruled that it be struck down. Until now only provincial governments have used this clause. These issues will surface again later this year, when jean Chretien's federal government plans to introduce an omnibus bill to remove discrimination against same-sex couples from all federal laws. The bill gives effect to a Supreme Court ruling, but it is deeply disliked by the opposition. 
A former defence lawyer, justice Lamer was predictably liberal in the rulings he delivered during his 20 years on the court. By contrast, Ms McLachlin's opinions, over her ten-year stint as a Supreme Court justice, have been harder to foretell. She upset feminists by writing a 1991 decision striking down a law that prevented defence lawyers from asking an alleged victim about her sexual history. Parliament amended the Criminal Code as a result, to allow a judge to decide what evidence is admissible in rape cases. In November, Ms McLachlin wrote another decision upholding this amendment. She declared that ""the relationship between the courts and the legislature should be one of dialogue"", and that neither institution had a monopoly in protecting rights. 
She provided another sign that she favours a less activist judiciary than her predecessor, when she dissented from the Mi'kmaq fishing decision, suggesting that the court risked ""functioning illegitimately"". She then sided with the majority in ""clarifying"" the original judgment. 
Like Anne McLellan, the justice minister, Ms McLachlin is from Alberta. That may mollify the Reform Party, whose base is in the prairies. Yet westerners will remain wary of a court in which five of the nine judges speak French as their first language. However, the new chief justice, who is only 56, looks as if she will take a carefully balanced approach to a job that she could keep for almost two decades-if she wants to.

ON SUSSEX DRIVE, the Canadian capital's ceremonial avenue, the newly built American embassy towers above a bronze monument of three soldiers, which depicts the country's long-standing devotion to international peacekeeping. The contrast makes a timely symbol. More than ever before, Canada finds itself torn between two versions of its military responsibility. On the one hand, there is a lingering faith in the country's honourable tradition of helping to police the peace in the world's trouble spots. On the other, a federal budget squeeze in recent years has limited Canada's ability to pay for such participation-and the country is under new pressure to integrate further into the United States' military structures. 
Canada has long prided itself on having invented modem peacekeeping. In 1956, Lester Pearson, then its foreign minister, proposed an emergency force for the Sinai to cover the withdrawal of British and French troops from Egypt. Since then, Canadian troops have been found in almost every trouble spot. Their activities reached a peak during the 199os, when Canadians were at various times engaged in a total of 65 different peacekeeping operations. By mid-1999, there were 4,400 Soldiers abroad, and generals were openly complaining that resources Were being stretched beyond the limit: five previous years of deficit-cutting budgets had cut the regular armed forces from 75,000 to 60,000, and their civilian staff by almost 40%. 
Now, however, Canada's involvement in international peacekeeping is dwindling. By this summer, the number of its soldiers abroad will be down to 3,ooo, as troops pull out of both East Timor and Kosovo-though Canada's contingent in Bosnia will be reinforced. To the latest call by the United Nations for peacekeeping troops, to go off to Sierra Leone and Congo, Canada is contributing just a few military observers and some money to disarm child soldiers. 
Moreover, Canada's confidence in its ability to make peace abroad has been badly shaken in recent years, not least since an inquiry into torture allegations against Canadian soldiers who took part in an operation in Somalia in 1993, which resulted in the disbanding of the country's Airborne Regiment. Many soldiers have suffered from bum-out after hazardous tours of duty. one such was General Romeo Dallaire, who was in charge in Rwanda at the start of the 1994 genocide and took lengthy sick leave on his return. 
Yet, at the same time as Canada appears to be making a partial retreat from peacekeeping, the country is also embarking on a military-hardware spending spree, partly in response to the demands of its mighty neighbour. Last June, the Department of National Defence published ""Defence Strategy 2020"", a long-range policy paper containing fiveyear targets, one of which was to strengthen Canada's military relations with the United States in order ""to permit seamless operational integration at short notice"". This ""inter-operability"", the paper declares, will mean adopting equipment compatible with that of Canada's main allies, the United States being the only one named. in short, the country is getting a big military upgrade. 
Already, Canada is to acquire from Britain four diesel-electric Upholder-class submarines, whose main uses will be the patrolling of fishing waters and the control of the smuggling of would-be immigrants into North America. In exchange, Britain will get free use of training ranges in the western province of Alberta and in Labrador, on the Atlantic coast. 
The new federal budget, announced on February 2.8th, includes C$2 billion ($1.4 billion) for defence equipment. This will enable Art Eggleton, the defence minister, to make good his frequent promises to buy replacements for the country's naval helicopters, which are now so antique they require dozens of maintenance hours for every hour spent in the air. Leopard tanks, which Canadian troops will take into troubled areas of southern Bosnia, are to be equipped with specially armoured turrets; and the groundattack CF-18 fighter aircraft, which took part in the bombardment of Serbia last year, are to be fitted with more modem avionics. 
In many ways, this upgrade is needed. it comes after a decade of defence cuts. in the last days of the cold war, the Conservative government then in power proposed [email protected] C$8 billion on up to a dozen nuclear-powered submarines of either British or French design. The Liberal Party under jean Chretien not only successfully opposed that plan at the time, but, after taking office in 1993, paid a hefty penalty of C$500m to cancel a separate purchase of sophisticated helicopters. 
More military controversy lies ahead. The Americans are due to decide later this year whether to press ahead with their plans to install the ""national missile defence"", a system that will, in theory, enable them to intercept and destroy incoming missiles from countries such as North Korea. The Americans would like to use a joint AmericanCanadian command structure, set up by the two countries in the 1950s, for the new system. Yet such a system, unless sanctioned by the Russians, would directly contravene the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty signed by the Americans and the Russians, which the traditionally peace-minded Canadians consider to be a centrepiece of arms control. 
All this comes at a time when other totems of Canadian identity are also being eroded. The budget unveiled this week by Paul Martin, the finance minister, offered a wide range of uncharacteristic income-tax cuts, from which the middle classes will benefit most. Canadians have grown tired of their heavy tax burden, and are increasingly unimpressed with the state social provision it is supposed to finance. The budget also puts a squeeze on overseas aid, another matter about which Canada has been traditionally generous. This will hardly help fortify the crusade of the foreign minister, Lloyd Axworthy, for ""soft power"": the idea that the world's mightier countries should worry less about their own security and more about that of the world's poor. But a harder kind of power is now the vogue in Ottawa.

He has said he will call the election before June 2001, and he hopes it will give him a third successive majority government. He repeated that message at every opportunity during the Liberal convention in Ottawa last week. Any doubts about his leadership, he insisted, were ended by a pledge of loyalty made to the convention by Paul Martin, the finance minister and his chief potential rival. 
Yet in fact, come the election, it is likely to be Mr Martin, not Mr Chretien, who leads the Liberals. Mr Martin has been an effective, and fortunate, minister, presiding over a seven-year boom that has allowed him to turn a C$42 billion ($25 billion) fiscal deficit into a handsome surplus, making room for tax cuts as well as extra spending in last month's budget. His supporters whisper that if their man does not soon inherit the leadership, he will seek preferment to the international great and good (he already chairs the Group of 2o, a collection of finance ministers who discuss the state of the world). Many Liberals would regret his departure. 
But neither can Mr Martin afford to seem too eager. After a score of Martinist members of Parliament were found to have been closeted with the finance minister's senior staff at a Toronto airport hotel, Mr Chretien hit back at the dissidents, hinting during the convention that he might not sign their nomination papers as election candidates. The prime minister, who has the political instincts of a streetfighter, dominated the convention's agenda. But his rival recovered: Mr Martin got the loudest applause at the convention, and his supporters secured a majority on the party's national executive. 
Ironically, the Liberal leadership tussle may be determined by what happens in the official opposition, the right-wing Reform Party. in a ballot whose result is due on March 25th, its 73,000 members are expected to have voted by the necessary two-thirds majority to dissolve their party into a broader outfit, to be called the Canadian Reform Conservative Alliance. if so, the new party will choose its leader in June. Preston manning, Reform's current leader, faces a stiff fight against Stockwell Day, the finance chief in Alberta's provincial government. 
Mr Manning, who is often (unfairly) viewed as a homespun westerner, lost badly to the Liberals in Ontario, Canada's most populous province, with 103 seats in the federal Parliament. Ontario's Liberal mps make up two-thirds of the party's total parliamentary strength. Should they face an invigorated opposition led by Mr Day, they can be expected to look for help to Mr Martin. He was born in southern Ontario. At the convention, he made an effective attack on Mr Day's flat-tax scheme. And whereas Mr Chretien is now 66, Mr Martin, at 61, is closer in age to Mr Day, an athletic 49. 
Liberal rivalries may now subside, but only until Mr Chretien has presided over Canada Day celebrations in July. After that, calls for his retirement are likely to swell once again. For its leaders, at least, the stately pace of Canadian political life seems set to accelerate.

THEIR universal health-care system is what many Canadians say most distinguishes their country from their neighbour. Medicare, as it is known, is a symbol of fairness and compassion, virtues that Canadians claim to cherish. But the financing and delivery of medicare has for years been a source of friction between the federal government in Ottawa and the ten provinces. This week, at the end of a particularly fiery month, Allan Rock, the federal health minister, called a meeting in Toronto with his provincial counterparts to seek a truce. 
First introduced in 1962 by a socialist government in Saskatchewan, one of the poorer but more idealistic provinces, medicare was soon spread across Canada by the Liberal government of Lester Pearson on the basis that costs were to be shared between the federal and provincial governments. What began as a 5o-5o division, however, became an increasing burden for the provinces after the federal government, looking for budget cuts, began in 1994 to reduce drastically the block grant for social services. Today, Alberta's government claims that Ottawa is paying only 13% of its health-care costs, which have meanwhile soared with a growing and ageing population. 
Everybody admits reform is needed. Emergency wards are overflowing-often with people with minor ailments, because family doctors work limited hours. Many specialists have headed across the border in search of more money and modem equipment. This, along with a shortage of hospital beds now that so many patients need longterm care, has lengthened waiting-lists for operations. The overload on the system has been further aggravated by the decision of several provincial governments to eliminate their budget deficits-and, in Ontario, to offer tax cuts-by squeezing health services, laying off nurses and closing hospitals. 
Now that most provincial budgets are back in surplus, how should health care be reformed? The provinces want Ottawa to restore the money it cut, and have demanded an extra C$4.2 billion ($2.9 billion) a year for health. Last year, Paul Martin, the federal fihance minister, did put in an extra C$3-5 billion to cover the next three years; and, in this year's budget, he allotted another C$2-5 billion for social services over four years. But this still falls short of the original losses. 
Mr Rock's ideas include looking after long-term patients at home, to release hospital beds for surgical cases, and improving the primary care provided by family doctors, to relieve the burden on emergency wards. There will be enough money for all this, he promises, as soon as a reform plan is agreed on and under way. Yet the provinces want the money up front, and say they will cut services further if they do not get it. 
The prickliest part of reform concerns privatisation. On March 2nd, Alberta's Conservative premier, Ralph Klein, introduced a bill to allow private clinics to do low-risk surgery which nonetheless involves an overnight stay. Twice before, he has had to withdraw similar bills after protests by pressure-groups which claimed that he was bringing in a two-tier system. Once again, he faces fierce resistance. One radio poll suggests that 58% of Albertans are against it. On March loth, delegates representing the 6,000 doctors belonging to the Alberta Medical Association voted to oppose the bill unless big changes were made. They say that such clinics-which already exist, mostly to perform cataract operations-have no intensive-care facilities to deal with complications that might arise from more serious surgery. The doctors' solution is to secure more money and staff for public hospitals. 
Mr Rock fears that the new bill would indeed undermine the country's single-tier health system. Both he and jean Chretien, the Liberal prime minister, have flown separately to Alberta's capital, Calgary, to urge the locals to oppose it. After meeting Mr Klein, Mr Chretien agreed not to challenge the bill-private hospitals are outlawed in Canada-in the hope that a compromise could be reached. others have been less coy. The main union representing the country's health-care workers claims that these ""surgical clinics"" are private hospitals under another name, that the bill is illegal, and that it opens the door for large American firms to set up private hospitals across the country.

If the United States decides to go ahead with its proposed scheme for national missile defences, and Canada fails to support it, some Canadians worry that they risk being frozen out of a long-standing joint command structure for North American aerospace defence, known as Norad. 
Jean Chretien's Liberal government is sharply divided. Lloyd Axworthy, the foreign-affairs minister, has used both Canada's recent position as chairman of the urr Security Council and his speech last month at a conference to review the Nuclear Non-- Proliferation Treaty to criticise the United States' plans for missile defences. He argues that its eventual expansion into space-based early-warning satellites could reignite a nuclear arms race among the big powers. 
That has brought an implicit rebuke from Art Eggleton, the defence minister. Such issues, he said last week, are decided in cabinet, and the government has not yet taken a position. But, he added, missile defences would no doubt fit in with Norad. Indeed, this command, and Canada's existing joint space programme with the United States, could be part of the surveillance system For the missile-defence scheme. The defence department has reportedly budgeted C$637m ($420m) for the programme, which an official says could be ""an asymmetric contribution to ballistic-missile defence"". 
Norad dates back to days when the threat to North America was seen to come from nuclear bombers flying in over the Arctic. Canadian critics dislike the entanglements it brings. It probably pushed Mr Chretien into joining last year's air assault on Serbia, and an earlier government into allowing American cruise missile tests in northern Canada. Defence officials, on the other hand, have argued that Norad gives Canada some influence in continental defence planning, as well as effective surveillance of its airspace. Some analysts in both countries says a failure to back missile defences would destroy American confidence in the alliance, and so jeopardise Norad. 
Mr Axworthy sees wider issues at stake. He has applauded Russia's ratification of the Start-2 strategic arms reduction treaty (America's Senate had ratified it in 1996) and the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty, and has complained of a ""misguided drift to unilateral action""by the United States. The missile-- defence scheme, costing anything from $25 billion to $60 billion, would not give protection against terrorists who might infiltrate North America by tramp steamers or Greyhound buses. These are the real security issues, he says. He wants a global early-waming system for controlling the spread of missiles. His officials see talk of missiles fired from ""rogue states"" as flimsy cover for the cunning of American military contractors, and worry that behind the existing proposal for a single anti-missile land base in Alaska with ioo interceptors lurks their hope for a far more sophisticated space-based system. 
Under Mr Axworthy, Canada's diplomats have not always worked well with the United 5tates'. He pushed ahead without American support to conclude the Ottawa treaty banning anti-personnel mines in 1997. And Canada chaired the 1998 conference to set up a world criminal court-at which the United States was one of only seven states opposed. To make matters worse, Mr Axworthy's remarks in the Security Council about multilateral diplomacy and defining human security in more than military terms have not pleased American strategists. 
Although he is hardly anti-American, Mr Axworthy has been the target of personal attacks by American diplomats and officials. These reflect a deeper unease among several NATO countries that Canada's contribution to the alliance is diminishing. That is one reason why Mr Axworthy may lose the cabinet debate about missile defences. This year's budget included increased spending for defence equipment. And nobody knows what Bill Clinton said to Mr Chretien when the Canadian prime minister flew to Washington for a round of golf last weekend.

To say that the country is sick of it is an understatement. Even in Quebec, the question has outlasted its welcome. That is why, shortly after the last referendum on ""sovereignty"" in 1995, the province's premier, Lucien Bouchard, put the subject aside, promising instead good government-even though he is the leader of the Parti Quebecois, the secessionists' political vehicle, and even though his yes forces had just come within a percentage point, 50,000 votes, of achieving their dream. 
But even good government has a shelf life, it seems. With the province's budget def icit transformed into a surplus, unemployment figures declining, and the word ""renaissance"" again being heard around Montreal, Mr Bouchard told his party's convention last weekend that secession would once more be at the top of his government's agenda. ""Our objective and our obsession is the sovereignty of Quebec as soon as possible,"" said Mr Bouchard. 
The premier did not offer a timetable, still less a date, for another, third, referendum; it all depends, he said, ""on our effectiveness in convincing Quebeckers"". Indeed, he left the convention with more wiggle-room than he had going in. The party's hardliners have always been in awe of Mr Bouchard's charisma and rhetorical skill, but suspicious of his devotion to the cause. It was thought that he might have to offer them something more concrete than a vague pledge. 
The party is still seething over the Clarity Act, approved by the federal parliament in April. This says that Quebec, or any other province, could secede from Canada only if a ""clear"" majority voted yes to a ""clear"" question (neither is defined). But the Quebec government's efforts to whip up popular protests against the act have got nowhere. 
Neither does a fresh referendum look easy. No matter how satisfied Quebeckers are with Mr Bouchard and his government, support for secession obstinately refuses to go beyond 45% in the opinion polls, and sometimes dips much lower. And only a fraction of that number say they want another vote on the question. 
Mr Bouchard hopes to enthuse them by holding an ""estates-general"" on language, the issue on which support for secession has always hung. In 1977, the first Parti Quebecois government passed some of the world's strictest language laws. These severely limit anything except French on signs, in workplaces and in education. It worked: no longer is there serious concern that French will disappear from North America. But as Frenchspeakers move to the suburbs, and immigrants settle in central Montreal, there are still fears that French could become a minority tongue in Quebec's largest city. The ""estates-general"", to be held in the autumn, is supposed to deal with these worries-and perhaps to promote the idea that secession provides the only guarantee that French will flourish for ever. 
But nationalist fervour in Quebec has always resisted such efforts at boosting by its advocates. It is amused, rather, by provocation from its real or imagined foes. If the prime minister, Jean Chretien, the begetter of the Clarity Act and Quebec's least-favourite son, really intends to stay on as leader of the federal Liberals, as he insists he does, that will help Mr Bouchard. So, too, might success for the Canadian Alliance, a new broader, replacement for the conservative Reform Party, many of whose leaders want Quebec to stop whingeing, or get out of Canada. It would be ironic indeed if they ended up helping Mr Bouchard to achieve his aim. ","FOR 30 years , the issue of Quebec 's secession has dominated Canadian politics .

2000-06-10,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224062779/fulltext/27244D38F7A14647PQ/22?accountid=14657,"SUDDENLY, there is speculation that Jean Chretien, Canada's enigmatic prime minister, is planning a snap election in the autumn, almost two years before he must. But Parliament still has work to do. Two bills concerning the increasingly controversial matter of immigration are plodding through the legislature. 
Canada has long had a liberal attitude to immigration.Over the past zo years, it has received some 3.5m legal immigrants under a policy which aims to attract up to 220,000 new Canadians each year. As recently as 1997, Canada was admitting many more immigrants in proportion to its population than Australia or the United States. 
Since then, however, the flow has slowed, to fewer than 190,000 last year. Would-be migrants complain of a two-year wait while their application is processed.Of ficials now give greater priority to attracting skilled workers than to allowing relations to join immigrants already in Canada. Family reunification accounted for almost half the new arrivals a decade ago; now the programme accounts for less than a third of the new migrants accepted. 
That has provoked complaints to Mps. Immigrants have electoral weight, especially in Ontario, which provided Mr Chretien's Liberals with the bulk of their Mes at the last election. On the other hand, well-publicised incidents in which boatloads of Chinese tried to land illegally in British Columbia last year have annoyed many Canadians. Three out of every five immigrants head for Toronto or Vancouver, where non-whites now make up a third of the population. 
The government's Immigration and Refugee Protection Bill tries to deal with both these complaints. One aim is ""closing the back door to those who would abuse the system"", according to Elinor Caplan, the immigration minister. It proposes severe penalties for people-smugglers. 
But the bill's other aim is to open the front door wider. Any permanent resident over 18 would be able to sponsor another family member-now more broadly defined to include common-law and same-sex partners. The selection of skilled workers will be more flexible, too. ""Swat"" teams of bureaucrats will streamline processing in slow-moving consular centres. Many of these are in Europe, which produced only 20% of last year's total of landed immigrants, against 60% from Asia. 
Not everyone is happy with the bill. A clause that would automatically exclude would-be refugees convicted of serious crimes outside Canada has upset the uw High Commissioner for Refugees, which believes such applicants should be granted a hearing to establish the facts of their case. 
The second bill, this one on citizenship, attempts a similar balancing act. It would give immigrants six years rather than four to accumulate the 36 months of physical residence in Canada required for citizenship. But it will be harder for the foreign-born descendants of Canadians to become citizens: in future, only the first generation would be able to do so automatically. It will be easier to revoke the citizenship of naturalised Canadians -a measure aimed at war criminals, but which has prompted the resignation of Ms Caplan's Hungarian-born parliamentary secretary. 
The Liberals will want to avoid race becoming an election issue, and a citizenship bill could help them. It is close to approval. But Parliament will soon break for the summer. If Mr Chretien really does want an autumn date with the voters, the immigration bill may be one of the casualties. ","SUDDENLY , there is speculation that Jean Chretien's is planning a snap election in the autumn , almost two years before Jean Chretien must . But Parliament still has work to do . Two bills concerning the increasingly controversial matter of immigration are plodding through the legislature . 
 Canada has long had a liberal attitude to immigration . Over the past zo years , it has received some 3.5 m legal immigrants under a policy which aims to attract up to 220,000 new Canadians each year . As recently as 1997 , Canada was admitting many more immigrants in proportion to its population than Australia or the United States . 
 Since then , however , the flow has slowed , to fewer than 190,000 last year . Would - be migrants complain of a two - year wait while their application is processed . Of ficials now give greater priority to attracting skilled workers than to allowing relations to join immigrants already in Canada . Family reunification accounted for almost half the new arrivals a decade ago ; now the programme accounts for less than a third of the new migrants accepted . 
 That has provoked complaints to Mps . Immigrants have electoral weight , especially in Ontario , which provided Jean Chretien's Liberals with the bulk of their Mes at the last election . On the other hand , well - publicised incidents in which boatloads of Chinese tried to land illegally in British Columbia last year have annoyed many Canadians . Three out of every five immigrants head for Toronto or Vancouver , where non - whites now make up a third of the population . 
 The government 's Immigration and Refugee Protection Bill tries to deal with both these complaints . One aim is "" closing the back door to those who would abuse the system "" , according to Elinor Caplan , the immigration minister . It proposes severe penalties for people - smugglers . 
 But the bill 's other aim is to open the front door wider . Any permanent resident over 18 would be able to sponsor another family member - now more broadly defined to include common - law and same - sex partners . The selection of skilled workers will be more flexible , too . "" Swat "" teams of bureaucrats will streamline processing in slow - moving consular centres . Many of these are in Europe , which produced only 20 % of last year 's total of landed immigrants , against 60 % from Asia . 
 Not everyone is happy with the bill . A clause that would automatically exclude would - be refugees convicted of serious crimes outside Canada has upset the uw High Commissioner for Refugees , which believes such applicants should be granted a hearing to establish the facts of their case . 
 The second bill , this one on citizenship , attempts a similar balancing act . It would give immigrants six years rather than four to accumulate the 36 months of physical residence in Canada required for citizenship . But it will be harder for the foreign - born descendants of Canadians to become citizens : in future , only the first generation would be able to do so automatically .

Stockwell Day, the former treasurer (finance minister) of Alberta, seems likely to become the leader of the official opposition to Prime Minister Jean Chretien's Liberal government. On June 24th, in a ballot for the leadership of the Canadian Alliance, a new conservative grouping, Mr Day won 44% of the votes cast, leading four other contenders. Barring any upset, his victory should be confirmed in a run-off vote on July 8th against Preston Manning, the current opposition leader. With a federal general election likely during the next year, Mr Day's entrance may prompt Mr Chretien to bow out in favour of his finance minister and heir apparent, Paul Martin. 
The leadership vote was a surprisingly sharp rejection of Mr Manning, beaten into second place with 36%. The founder and leader of the western-based Reform Party, he had called a convention in February to launch his plan to merge his party into a broader Alliance, aimed at attracting members of the faltering Progressive Conservative Party and voters in eastern Canada. 
But it was Mr Day who seized the limelight, with a witty speech to the convention, and an unscheduled kick-boxing demonstration during a break. He has campaigned vigorously across Canada for the leadership, with breaks for jogging and kayaking. In vitality and charisma, though in nothing else, he is being compared to Pierre Trudeauwho at the age of 48 (Mr Day is 49) swept Canadians off their feet in 1968 to become prime minister for 15 years. 
Where Mr Trudeau was a cosmopolitan Liberal, Mr Day is a fiscal and social conservative, and an evangelical Christian who supports capital punishment and opposes gay rights and abortion. But during the campaign he stressed other matters: alone among the candidates he has experience of government, speaks half-decent French and has lived in all regions of Canada. Before entering politics, his jobs included working in a funeral parlour, and as an auctioneer. 
Mr Manning has flung himself into trying to win on the second ballot, noting that only 59% of the 202,000 registered members cast votes in the first round. To win, he would have to capture at least three-quarters of the support for Tom Long, the third candidate, an adviser to Ontario's premier, Mike Harris, whose campaign was tainted by his backers' over-zealous efforts to sign up new party members in unlikely comers of Quebec. 
But most of the members seem to want a fresh leader for the new party. Not only had Mr Manning failed in two elections to crack the Liberal hold on Ontario, Canada's most populous province, but even some of his erstwhile supporters claim he has become an imperious leader, out of touch with Reform's populist roots. 
The Liberals would clearly prefer to face Mr Manning. If it is Mr Day, the unpredictable Mr Chretien might nonetheless relish an election fight against a radical conservative. Liberals, however, will remember that it was another new young leader of the right, Brian Mulroney, who in 1984 put an end to their party's long ascendancy.

Two reports follow, the first on Vicente Fox's likely foreign policy, the second on Brazil's efforts to draw South America together 
ALTHOUGH Vicente Fox will not take office as Mexico's president until December ist, his historic defeat of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in July's presidential election is already being felt beyond his country's borders. His government is likely both to be more assertive in foreign relations than its predecessors, and to pursue some different goals. That in turn will change some of the patterns of western-hemisphere relations-and reinforce others. 
On a visit to Canada and the United States this week, Mr Fox set out one of his long-term goals: to try to deepen the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA) into something closer to a European-style common market. In the view of Mr Fox, a practical businessman who has in the past suggested that Mexico should adopt the dollar, eventually that might involve monetary union. But Mr Fox has also sought to reassure the rest of Latin America that any deepening of Mexico's privileged relationship with the United States will not lead it to neglect the rest of the region. In his first foreign foray, earlier this month, the president-elect headed south, to the Mercosur region. 
Mexico will be more aggressive in seeking to promote and defend democracy-the region's most sensitive diplomatic issue. During the PRI'S seven decades in power, Mexican foreign policy was governed by the ""Estrada doctrine"" of non-intervention: named after a former foreign minister, this dictated that Mexico recognise all governments, and criticise none, in the name of national self-determination and sovereignty. This derived from the PRI'S guilty conscience: it wanted to protect itself from outside criticism of its own undemocratic rule. 
By contrast, ""Fox carries with him the strength of democracy as a new asset of Mexico,"" says Adolfo Aguilar Zinser. Mr Aguilar is one of two international-relations advisers on the new president's transition team; the other is Jorge Castaneda, a political scientist. Both come from the left, and were prominent critics of the PRI's rule. 
Mexico is likely to become less defensive about human-rights questions. Defeat for the PRi in an election on August 20th for governor of the troubled state of Chiapas may ease a settlement of the Zapatist rebellion, for example. And Mr Fox has signalled a more critical stance towards Fidel Castro. ""We will encourage Cuba to move towards the market economy and democracy,"" he told Veja, a Brazilian magazine. ""Self-determination is exercised not only by governments, but also by peoples,"" says Mr Aguilar. 
On his southern trip, Mr Fox expressed polite interest in Mexico's reaching a freetrade agreement with Mercosur, South America's main trade block. He also received an invitation from Brazil's president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, to attend, as an observer, this month's South American presidential get-together (see next story). That marks a notable warming in relations between Latin America's two giants: since NAFTA was signed in 1993, Brazil has tended to see Mexico as a vassal of the United States. 
In practice, however, Mexico's foreign policy will continue to be dominated by its relationship with its northern neighbour. This week's trip was merely a getting-toknow-you visit, Mr Fox said, at which he was due to meet both presidential candidates, Al Gore and George W. Bush, as well as President Bill Clinton. But Mr Fox has already sketched out a bold wish-list, centred on trying to accelerate the process of economic ""convergence"" unleashed by NAFTA. 
Mexico is already benefiting from a much faster increase in cross-border trade than most economists predicted: its exports to the United States and Canada grew at an annual average of 16% between i9go and 1998. And thanks partly to the American boom, that growth is accelerating. In the first half of this year, America's imports from Mexico were up by a staggering 26.5% on the same period last year, while Mexico's GDP grew by 78% Although real wages have been rising since last year, GDP per head in Mexico is only around $5,500 a year, compared with $36,000 in the United States. And some 300,000 Mexicans a year brave increasingly tough border defences to seek work illegally in the United States. 
Deepening NAFTA 
Mr Fox has two main proposals for reducing this social divide. First, he wants to create a more modest version of the regional-aid funds that have allowed Spain and Portugal to catch up so quickly with the richer members of the European Union. He proposes beefing up a small bilateral credit agency for border-area environmental improvements, turning it into a full-blown development bank to fund infrastructure and anti-poverty measures in Mexico. That is a brave idea, but it may not get far, since most of the money would have to come from the United States and Canada. Jean Chretien, Canada's prime minister, was dismissive of the plan this week. 
Secondly, as a forerunner to eventual EU-- style free movement of labour, Mr Fox wants an increase in legal migration of Mexicans to the United States. That was once anathema north of the border, but a tight labour market means that it may no longer be utopian. 
Although Mr Fox's advisers have close relations with many policymakers in the Democratic Party, his proposals might get a better hearing from Mr Bush, who as governor of Texas appreciates the importance of a more prosperous Mexico to the United States. But whoever wins, relations across the Rio Grande will make a fresh start: on this occasion, as happens once every 12 years, both countries are electing a new president in the same year. 
In practice, Mr Fox will have to cope with the bewilderingly complicated nature of relations between his country and the United States, in which many different political actors pursue often contradictory agendas. Issues such as drugs and the environment, as well as migration and trade, can easily stir rows which have to be contained. But his undisputed democratic credentials have at least given him a platform from which to expound some fresh thinking.

But they have never been in the country's economic or political mainstream. In recent years, they have struggled as traditional industries have collapsed. Yet suddenly the Atlantic provinces are receiving unusually close attention from Ottawa. 
Earlier this summer, the prime minister, jean Chretien, led 60 local businessmen and the region's four provincial premiers on a mission to Boston to try to drum up investment from the United States. In June, Mr Chretien went to Nova Scotia to announce that the federal government would spend C$700m ($472m) over five years to support new businesses and other development in the area. It was ""a time of great potential for Atlantic Canada,"" he proclaimed. 
And always will be, cynics might add. Only half the promised money was new, and Mr Chretien was vague about what it might be used for, mentioning ""ocean engineering"" in Newfoundland, and information technology in Cape Breton Island, the poorest part of Nova Scotia. 
Home to 2.3m people, the Atlantic provinces have yet to find reliable alternatives to their past mainstays of fishing, lumber and military bases. Average wages in Atlantic Canada are only two-thirds of the national figure. There is an expanding oil and gas industry, but this does not generate jobs and spread cash around as the cod fishery once did, before over-fishing destroyed it. Previous attempts to diversify with government support, such as making sports cars in New Brunswick and growing cucumbers in Newfoundland, have failed amid media scorn. 
In Cape Breton Island, where Alexander Graham Bell pursued many of his inventions a century ago, Ottawa has offered C$zom to support a call centre at Sydney, whose coal mines and steel mill are dying. But the island's best bet may be tourism. It can boast puffins, whales and folk art. Cheticamp, a former fishing town, is a mecca for tourists seeking handsome hooked rugs. It is perhaps the only town in North America where one may, without offending, ask a respectable-looking woman, ""Are you a hooker?"" But the season is limited, and facilities are variable. 
Many of the visitors are politicians. Mr Chretien's interest in the region is unsurprising: Liberals have been swept from office in three of the four Atlantic provinces since 1996. They took only ii of the region's 32 seats in the 1997 federal election (and not a single seat in Nova Scotia). But if the prime minister is to win the third term he covets, the Liberals must do better in the Atlantic provinces, since they face a revitalised opposition in Ontario and western Canada. 
Other party leaders have their eyes on the Atlantic provinces too. It is home turf for Alexa McDonough of the leftish New Democrats, while Joe Clark, the Progressive Conservative leader, an Albertan by birth, is seeking at least temporary entry to the House of Commons through a by-election in Nova Scotia on September 11th. 
The region's four provincial premiers have formed a joint council to lobby in Ottawa. But to what end? Nova Scotia's John Hamm wants increased federal transfer payments for health and social provision. New Brunswick's Bernard Lord calls for ""a hand up, not a handout""; he wants money for training, rather than cash to keep seasonal workers alive during the winter. But unless the politicians find ways to halt the exodus of young people from the Atlantic provinces to Toronto and Alberta, the money may not make much difference.

But this week the final members of the cast of characters took their seats. In by-elections held on September nth, the leaders of Canada's two right-of-centre parties each won entry to the federal parliament. Stockwell Day, of the Canadian Alliance, won a British Columbian seat with 70% of the votes; Joe Clark, of the Progressive Conservatives, won easily, too, in Nova Scotia. 
That sets the stage for what is already promising to be a long winter of unofficial campaigning. It will be enlivened by the arrival of Mr Day. The Alliance was formed earlier this year when the western-based Reform Party, the official opposition, decided to reinvent itself in a search for broader appeal. Mr Day defeated Reform's Preston Manning in a leadership election in june. 
The latest polls give the Alliance around zap, while the Conservatives have sunk to10%, alongside the left-of centre New Democrats and the separatist Bloc Quebecois. After seven years in power, the Liberals, led by the prime minister, Jean Chretien, still enjoy the support of 46%, though slightly less in Ontario whose ioi seats are the main prize. 
In the 1997election, Reform and the Conservatives each won 19% of the vote. But Reform, with its support concentrated in the west, won 60 seats; the Conservatives won just 20. They have since faded further. Mr Clark, briefly prime minister in 1979-80 and an experienced parliamentarian, returned as party leader in 1998. But he mistakenly chose to remain outside the House of Commons while trying to build the party's strength across the country. His members of parliament grew restless: defections have cut their number to 15, all but two from the Atlantic provinces. The latest defections cast a pall over Mr Clark's by-election victory, with the Liberals leaking the word that two of his Quebec Mrs were about to cross to the government ranks. 
When Parliament reassembles on September 18th, attention will focus on how Mr Day, as leader of the official opposition, matches up in debate against Liberal ministers. Mr Chretien, whose parliamentary career began almost four decades ago, seems to relish the coming combat in Question Period. He has attacked his opponent for courting Quebec nationalists, referring to ""Blocwell"" Day and his ""Unholy Alliance"". 
But if he hopes to ridicule his new opponent's ideas for tax reform and portray him as a rigid Christian conservative, he may come off second-best. Mr Day has shown himself quick in political repartee, deft at answering bluster with disarmingly soft words: As Alberta's provincial treasurer, he has more recent experience of economic management than Mr Chretien, who was a mediocre finance minister in the 1970s. Meanwhile, Mr Clark, leading the smallest of five parties in the Commons, will have little chance to make his mark in Question Period. 
But the election remains Mr Chretien's to lose. This week, he wrapped up an important political deal on health funding with all ten provincial premiers, after six months of argument. Ontario and Quebec had disliked Ottawa's insistence on the provinces having to account more tightly for their spending, in return for receiving an additional C$23.5 billion (US$15.9 billion) over five years. But the money was too tempting. Had the deal failed, the prime minister might have talked himself into an early election on this risky issue. As it is, he has the winter to wear down Mr Day.

 The latest polls give the Alliance around zap , while the Conservatives have sunk to10 % , alongside the left - of centre New Democrats and the separatist Bloc Quebecois . After seven years in power , Jean Chretien still enjoy the support of 46 % , though slightly less in Ontario whose ioi seats are the main prize . 
 In the 1997election , Reform and the Conservatives each won 19 % of the vote . But Reform , with its support concentrated in the west , won 60 seats ; the Conservatives won just 20 . They have since faded further . Mr Clark , briefly prime minister in 1979 - 80 and an experienced parliamentarian , returned as party leader in 1998 . But he mistakenly chose to remain outside the House of Commons while trying to build the party 's strength across the country . His members of parliament grew restless : defections have cut their number to 15 , all but two from the Atlantic provinces . The latest defections cast a pall over Mr Clark 's by - election victory , with Jean Chretien leaking the word that two of his Quebec Mrs were about to cross to the government ranks . 
 When Parliament reassembles on September 18th , attention will focus on how Mr Day , as leader of the official opposition , matches up in debate against Liberal ministers . Mr Chretien , whose parliamentary career began almost four decades ago , seems to relish the coming combat in Question Period . He has attacked his opponent for courting Quebec nationalists , referring to "" Blocwell "" Day and his "" Unholy Alliance "" . 
 But if he hopes to ridicule his new opponent 's ideas for tax reform and portray him as a rigid Christian conservative , he may come off second - best . Mr Day has shown himself quick in political repartee , deft at answering bluster with disarmingly soft words : As Alberta 's provincial treasurer , he has more recent experience of economic management than Mr Chretien , who was a mediocre finance minister in the 1970s . Meanwhile , Mr Clark , leading the smallest of five parties in the Commons , will have little chance to make his mark in Question Period . 
 But the election remains Mr Chretien 's to lose . This week , he wrapped up an important political deal on health funding with all ten provincial premiers , after six months of argument . Ontario and Quebec had disliked Ottawa 's insistence on the provinces having to account more tightly for their spending , in return for receiving an additional C$ 23.5 billion ( US$ 15.9 billion ) over five years . But the money was too tempting . Had the deal failed , the prime minister might have talked himself into an early election on this risky issue . As it is , he has the winter to wear down Mr Day .",20,Canada,A29-148,IN TERM,True,"the Liberals , led by the prime minister , Jean Chretien ,",2,True

Three rather uncivilised Arabs waylaid him and demanded money. He pointed to his tom shirt and pleaded for money from them. They were startled at the reversal of roles; and were angered when he seized a dagger from one man's belt, pretending to examine it. As they began to haul him away, ""I recited poetry, performed drama, started a speech."" The robbers ""feared madness"", Mr Trudeau said, ""and beat an anxious retreat "" 
For many Canadians, the story, although perhaps embellished in the telling, summed up their view of him: his daring, the power of his oratory, his originality in dealing with a problem. As the Arabs had soon decided, and the Canadians came to Team, he was an original. There was nothing more original than the simple facts of his political career. He became a member of Parliament in 1965 and three years later he was prime minister. 
He had some luck. More than half of Canada's population was under 30. In the y6os, looking cool and toying with a red rose were political assets lacking in Mr Trudeau's rivals. Gays commended his argument for decriminalising homosexuality, that ""the state has no place in the bedrooms of the nation"". The 14 previous Canadian prime ministers had been worthy rather than hip. One of them criticised him publicly for wearing sandals in Parliament. Commentators spoke of Trudeaumania, just as the pop world went dizzy with Beatlemania. 
Even so, to rise so swiftly to the top job and then to keep it almost continuously for nearly 16 years required more than luck. Neither can his success be explained by saying he was an able politician. Aiming for ""a just society"", however sincerely expressed, is hardly original. Pierre Trudeau ""overflowed his office"", a commentator said. Whether he was arguing a case with passion, kissing beautiful women or canoeing some remote river, he was daring Canadians to be venturesome, to shed caution. 
To exotic places 
He was a rich man's son. His father owned a chain of petrol stations, and much else. Pierre was brought up fluent in both English and French, a big asset for a politician in bilingual Canada. But politics lay in the distant future. The Trudeau who became a visionary in his own country and a performer on the world stage seems to have been parochial as a young man. He dismissed the second world war as a squabble between the big powers, although he later regretted ""missing one of the major events of the century"". He gained a law degree and had a spell at Harvard. He travelled to Europe and to exotic places, such as southern Iraq. With his mind seemingly broadened, he returned to Canada appalled at the narrow nationalism in his native French-speaking Quebec, and the authoritarianism of the province's government. 
It was Mr Trudeau's belief in a one-nation Canada, rejecting Quebec separatism, that persuaded him to give up a career as a lawyer and enter Parliament. In 1970, two years after he became prime minister, Quebec separatists kidnapped a British diplomat and a Canadian politician, who was later found murdered. Mr Trudeau put tanks on the streets of Montreal to counter what seemed to be an insurrection. His reputation as a champion of civil liberties suffered, but no one doubted where he stood about keeping Canada unified. His view prevailed in subsequent referendums over the status of Quebec. He towered above the nationalists with speeches that drowned their bid for independence. Keeping the country together was among his most important achievements, although even now the separatists are far from extinct. 
But a catalogue of his domestic reforms, however important to Canadians, would do little to explain why Pierre Trudeau was seen as an exciting politician by the world at large. It can't just have been the gossip stuff, although his marriage, at 51, to a 22-year-old brightened a million television screens. His admirers shared his agony when she humiliated him by becoming a rock groupie; and a worse agony when one of his three sons died in an avalanche. His foreign policy adventures interested a specialised audience. He made friends with Fidel Castro, opposed the Vietnam war, sniped at NATO, and generally upset the United States. Living next door, he said, was like ""sleeping with an elephant"" and affected by ""every twitch and grunt"". 
What Mr Trudeau mostly gave to a grateful world was a certain style, all the more surprising coming from a Canadian, a species given to understatement. Canadians are urged by their present prime minister, Jean Chretien, to be proud that the United Nations puts their country at the top of its ""human development index"", based on a mix of statistics such as adult literacy, life expectancy and purchasing power. ""Canada,"" says Mr Chretien, ""is the best place in the world to live."" Perhaps it is.

MONTREAL 
THE liberal Party is routinely referred to as the natural governing party of Canada. But what may be true at federal level is not so in Quebec. Whereas the job of federal Liberal leader usually comes with that of prime minister, the job of Liberal leader in Quebec comes mostly with acute headaches. These stem overwhelmingly from the pressure of fighting, in Quebec, for the cause of a united Canada-but not so tenaciously as to alienate the province's ""soft nationalists"", those who see Canada as a sensible arrangement but reserve their emotional attachment for French Quebec. Those are the same people, it so happens, who tend to decide the outcomes of elections and referendums in the province. 
It is hardly surprising, then, that the current Liberal leader in Quebec, Jean Charest, has barely cracked a smile since he was press-ganged into the job two and a half years ago. Mr Charest faces a leadership ""review"" this weekend, and should be easily confirmed. His success will not have come, however, without a long summer touring the province, consolidating wavering support. Nor will it do much to dispel the notion, current both in Quebec and in the rest of Canada, that Mr Charest has been a rank disappointment as federalism's saviour. 
That was the role scripted for Mr Charest when he was drafted from his job as leader of the federal Conservatives to lead the provincial Liberals in March 1998. Mr Charest did not want the job and made no effort to disguise that fact. But Canada was still reeling from its ""near-death experience"" of late 1995, when secessionists came within a percentage point of winning a referendum to negotiate independence for Quebec. Mr Charest was considered the perfect, perhaps only, man to take on Lucien Bouchard, the charismatic premier and secessionist leader, in a provincial election later that year. Once it had become his patriotic duty, Mr Charest was obliged to take the job. 
And indeed, under Mr Charest, the Liberals won more votes than Mr Bouchard's Parti Quebecois (PQ). But because many of Quebec's federalists-most of them Englishspeakers or immigrants-are concentrated in relatively few seats in Montreal and near the borders with Ontario and the United States, Mr Bouchard stayed in the premier's office and the PQ stayed in power. Since then Mr Charest has been a less-than-inspired, often invisible leader. This is not all his own fault. Mr Bouchard is a difficult man from whom to steal the spotlight, and he has a vigorous economy on his side. 
At the same time, the man who should be Mr Charest's principal ally, the prime minister, jean Chretien, has rarely missed a chance to undermine him, apparently acting on a long-nursed grudge from their days on opposite sides of the federal Parliament. This has been most evident on the only real quesion that distinguishes the Quebec Liberals from the PQ: should the province stay or go? Mr Chretien has consistently taken a hard line, most notably with the Clarity Act, a law passed last spring that gives the federal Parliament the right to decide whether a referendum question is explicit enough and a majority sufficiently substantial. It was a hit outside Quebec, an impossible sell within. 
But Mr Charest has not helped his own cause. His discourse has generally been one of platitudes and bromides; as one commentator said, ""Wherever Charest treads, he leaves no footprints."" Many of the ideas he comes up with, such as following the privatising example of Alberta and Ontario, have been anathema to Quebeckers, whose collectivist reflexes are as strong as any in North America. There have also been gaffes-such as accepting a Mexican holiday from a lobby group-and a barely hidden lack of interest in the job. 
The low point came last spring, when some of Mr Charest's caucus were openly questioning his dedication and polls had him trailing behind Mr Bouchard by up to 20 points. Since then, he has made amends with party members and brought in new advisers. Even if it has been decades since the party allowed a leader who lost one election to stick around in order to fight another, Quebec's Liberals seem to be willing to make an exception for Mr Charest-federalist saviour or not.

2000-10-21,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224080808/fulltext/C57D618F145B4544PQ/20?accountid=14657,"SUDDENLY, Canada is going to the polls. The Liberal government of Jean Chretien has moved with unusual vigour this week to lay favourable ground for a rushed Federal election on November 27th. In a flurry of activity, Brian Tobin resigned as premier of Newfoundland and Labrador on Monday and was sworn in as industry minister on Tuesday. On Wednesday, Paul Martin, the finance minister, produced an appetite-teasing mini-budget that promised further tax cuts. All this prepares the way for Mr Chretien to announce the election on October 22nd. 
Why this haste, when there is no burning issue and when the government has been in office for only 42 months? Quite simply, because in recent opinion polls the Liberals have been soaring between 45% and 52%, while the main opposition, the Canadian Alliance under its new leader, Stockwell Day, is stuck between 20% and 26%. The moment looks ideal. 
In 1997, the Liberals won a slim majority with only 38% of the vote, taking 101 seats in Ontario largely because two conservative parties split the right-wing vote. The Reform Party, which is based in the west, has since reinvented itself as the Canadian Alliance, primarily to crack the Liberals' Ontario bulwark, while its older rival, the Progressive Conservative Party, has suffered defections and slumped in the polls. 
Mr Chretien clearly sees urgency in calling an election before the Alliance and Mr Day, an Albertan newly arrived in federal politics, gain ground in Ontario. Since the election campaign, formerly a drawnout affair, is now shortened to 36 days and the Liberals, unlike the Alliance, have nominated most of their Ontario candidates, he has a head start. 
He also has personal reasons for leaping in. To be the first Canadian prime minister to win three majority governments in a row would give him a place in the history books. In other respects, his performance since 1993 has been uninspiring, and his government's success at engineering economic recovery has been greatly helped by the boom south of the border and by the skills of his cabinet rival and heir-apparent, Mr Martin. 
The return of Mr Tobin to federal politics-as fisheries minister, he boldly chased away Spanish ships-makes the succession less certain, especially if his Newfoundland oratory wins back several seats in the Atlantic provinces for the Liberals. Mr Tobin is only 49, while Mr Martin is 62, and he pleases Mr Chretien by hiding his prime-ministerial ambitions under eloquent loyalty. To fit him into the cabinet, john Manley has been promoted to the foreign-affairs portfolio, replacing Lloyd Axworthy, who is leaving politics for a university post. 
The election is not yet won for the Liberals, however. The lively Mr Day may prove a better campaigner than the prime minister, and many voters are displeased by what they see as an unnecessarily early election. Watch this space. ","SUDDENLY , Canada is going to the polls . The Liberal government of Jean Chretien has moved with unusual vigour this week to lay favourable ground for a rushed Federal election on November 27th . In a flurry of activity , Brian Tobin resigned as premier of Newfoundland and Labrador on Monday and was sworn in as industry minister on Tuesday . On Wednesday , Paul Martin , the finance minister , produced an appetite - teasing mini - budget that promised further tax cuts . All this prepares the way for Jean Chretien to announce the election on October 22nd . 
 Why this haste , when there is no burning issue and when the government has been in office for only 42 months ? Quite simply , because in recent opinion polls the Liberals have been soaring between 45 % and 52 % , while the main opposition , the Canadian Alliance under its new leader , Stockwell Day , is stuck between 20 % and 26 % . The moment looks ideal . 
 In 1997 , the Liberals won a slim majority with only 38 % of the vote , taking 101 seats in Ontario largely because two conservative parties split the right - wing vote . The Reform Party , which is based in the west , has since reinvented itself as the Canadian Alliance , primarily to crack the Liberals ' Ontario bulwark , while its older rival , the Progressive Conservative Party , has suffered defections and slumped in the polls . 
 Jean Chretien clearly sees urgency in calling an election before the Alliance and Mr Day , an Albertan newly arrived in federal politics , gain ground in Ontario . Since the election campaign , formerly a drawnout affair , is now shortened to 36 days and the Liberals , unlike the Alliance , have nominated most of their Ontario candidates , Jean Chretien has a head start . 
 Jean Chretien also has personal reasons for leaping in . To be the first Canadian prime minister to win three majority governments in a row would give Jean Chretien a place in the history books . In other respects , Jean Chretien's performance since 1993 has been uninspiring , and Jean Chretien's government 's success at engineering economic recovery has been greatly helped by the boom south of the border and by the skills of Jean Chretien's cabinet rival and heir - apparent , Mr Martin . 
 The return of Mr Tobin to federal politics - as fisheries minister , he boldly chased away Spanish ships - makes the succession less certain , especially if his Newfoundland oratory wins back several seats in the Atlantic provinces for the Liberals . Mr Tobin is only 49 , while Mr Martin is 62 , and he pleases Jean Chretien by hiding his prime - ministerial ambitions under eloquent loyalty . To fit him into the cabinet , john Manley has been promoted to the foreign - affairs portfolio , replacing Lloyd Axworthy , who is leaving politics for a university post . 
 The election is not yet won for the Liberals , however . The lively Mr Day may prove a better campaigner than Jean Chretien , and many voters are displeased by what they see as an unnecessarily early election . Watch this space .",20,Canada,A29-148,IN TERM,True,Jean Chretien,11,True

VANCOUVER 
FROM the 1880s until 1996, when the last school closed, about 100,000 native children attended 100 or so residential schools run by the main Christian churches all over Canada. The schools' purpose (originally, at least) was to transform these ""savages"" into ""civilised"", productive citizens. Children were taken from their families and confined in remote institutions where they were poorly fed and clothed, indifferently taught, forced to work long hours and whipped if they spoke their native languages. 
Over the years, native groups repeatedly protested about continued harsh treatment, but were ignored. Then, in 1990, the grand chief of the Assembly of First Nations, Phil Fontaine, spoke out publicly about the sexual abuse he had suffered at a residential school. Many others were emboldened to come forward. A royal commission shed further light in 1996, documenting beatings, buggery and rape of male and female students by school staff over many years. Ten staff members were convicted. 
The scandal keeps on growing. Almost 6,200 aboriginal people are now suing Canada's federal government and the Roman Catholic, Anglican, United and Presbyterian churches for various sorts of abuse in the residential schools. Around 80 more are joining every month. But, as with many native issues, neither the government nor the public is getting heated about it. The press seems most concerned with whether the lawsuits will bankrupt the churches. 
Few cases have come to trial. The government, which set the policy and financed the schools, has already paid C$27m ($18m) to settle about 300 claims out of court. The churches, which ran the schools under contract, are silent about their payouts, but outspoken about the dire shape of their finances. On October 15th, the Anglican diocese of Cariboo, in British Columbia's interior, authorised its bishop and executive to wind up its affairs within a year. The diocese has already paid out one hefty damage award, and cannot manage any more; but lawsuits are still pending against it. 
The national office of the Anglican church, which had overall charge of its schools, expects that legal costs will also bankrupt it some time next year. The Roman Catholic church foresees the same fate for several of its religious orders, which ran about 60% of the schools in the system. 
The churches and the government have publicly apologised. The churches have also asked for forgiveness. But they aren't getting much. The natives are too full of hurt and anger. They blame the persistent high rates of divorce, alcoholism, sexual abuse and suicide in their communities on the trauma experienced in those schools. Native leaders had hoped that the royal commission would inspire, as it recommended, a massive federal effort at reconciliation. All they have got is a C$350m native-run ""healing fund"" (to be spent over ten years) to meet the needs of thousands of victims. 
Shortly before the start of the current national election campaign, the prime minister, Jean Chretien, asked his deputy, Herb Gray, to meet church leaders in an attempt to find a solution that would be fair to all parties. Many natives will take that as a hopeful sign. Some 6,200 others are continuing with their lawsuits. ","Canada

MONTREAL 
BEAN CHRETIEN is a Quebecker, as well as prime minister of a generally successful Liberal government in a country enjoying an economic boom. But such is his personal unpopularity in Quebec that in the federal election on November 27th the independence-seeking Bloc Quebecois has reasonable hope of improving on its showing in the last federal election in 1997, when it won 38% of the vote and 44 of the province's 75 parliamentary seats. 
Yet in Quebec, no less than elsewhere in Canada, federal elections have little bearing on provincial politics. Even a good result for the Bloc would not in itself hasten another independence referendum. Although polls show support for sovereignty swinging between 35-45%, they also show little appetite for a new vote on the matter. 
Rather than the election, the Bloc's provincial sister party, the ruling Parti Quebecois (PQ), is pinning its hopes of reviving enthusiasm for another referendum elsewhere. This week, after months of planning, an ""Estates-General on the Situation and the Future of French"" held its first public hearing. After visiting every corner of the province between now and March, the ten-member committee will propose ways of ensuring the vitality of the mother tongue of so/ie of Quebec's citizens. 
Language, rather than religion, economics or culture, has always been the, well, raison d'etre of Quebec's secessionist movement. The best way to preserve French in English-speaking North America, the argument goes, is for the language to have its own country. One of the early measures taken by the first PQ government, in 1977, was Law iol, a still controversial measure which placed restrictions on English schools and banned languages other than French from most commercial signs. 
So why is the Estates-General needed? Because globalisation, the Internet and satellite television pose challenges to French unimagined a generation ago, says the commission in a ""thinking document"". Maybe, but the evidence suggests that French is doing fine. When Law ioi was passed, the children of four out of five immigrants to the province learned English; now the majority learn French at school. French is the accepted language of work and commerce almost everywhere in the province. 
For commercial signs, for years the most contentious issue, a compromise has been worked out: other languages are allowed, but French must predominate. In fact, despite the well-publicised activities of ""language cops"", whose recent targets have included English-only beer coasters, a measure of linguistic peace has been achieved. 
That is what the PQ government seems bent on upsetting. Few doubt that the Estates-General will conclude that more must be done to protect French. The committee's members are a careful mix of francophones and non-francophones. But its head is Gerald Larose, a former union leader and close ally of Lucien Bouchard, Quebec's premier. Ministers have already predicted that language laws will be stiffened as a result of its findings. The most likely ways are by going back to the French-only rule on commercial signs, and extending to junior colleges restrictions which prevent the children of most immigrants to the province from attending English-speaking schools. 
Louise Beaudoin, the minister responsible for language issues, complains that too many immigrants to Quebec are taking up English as a second language, ""and that the only thing that can change this dynamic is sovereignty"". Ms Beaudoin is a hardliner on both sovereignty and language; Mr Bouchard less so. Some speculate that the premier created the Estates-General as a sop to the hardliners. Others reckon he has his eye on another referendum, since polls show that the more Quebeckers feel French is threatened, the more they support separation from Canada. 
Certainly, Quebec's hard-won linguistic peace is threatened. It may not be coincidental that it was only after the government began talking about tightening up the language law that several bombs were placed outside cafes with English names. ","Canada

SIR-Most of us who work for international humanitarian agencies hoped that the new United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees would have a high international profile and a strong commitment to refugee protection. Ruud Lubbers certainly brings a high profile to the post. But while we know all about his views on globalisation it is a pity that we know nothing about his views on refugee protection (""Ruud surprise"", October 28th). 
You are wrong in lumping together as ""egomaniacs"" Sergio Vieira de Mello (his correct name) and Bernard Kouchner. Most of those in the humanitarian community who have worked with Mr Vieira de Mello over the years would be puzzled by the label, and we would have been delighted if he had been appointed as high commissioner. 
JOEL MCCLELLAN 
Geneva 
SIR-As a UNHCR staff member of many years' standing, and one who was dreading the results of the selection from the declared field of candidates for high commissioner for refugees, I should like to express relief that Mr Lubbers has got the job. At the best of times, the post is the most difficult in the UN system. The commissioner's role is both to generate and exercise the moral authority of the international community in regard to displacement and to lead a team implementing it. Not the job for overly ambitious ""egomaniacs"" but for the sensitive political heavyweight, which Mr Lubbers is by all accounts. 
One of the most important tasks Mr Lubbers faces will be to get the UNHCR'S protection act together in the post-cold-war era: widening protection to include the civilian victims of internal conflict in co-ordination with the competent national authorities. Another task is to overhaul the indifferent and Byzantine administration of UNHCR, which often contrasts so negatively with the organisation's high ideals. Then there is the staff, which the statute requires be selected from ""persons devoted to the purposes"" of the UNHCR. Some are, some are not. The invidious task of separating sheep from goats is an essential prerequisite to the committed hands-on leadership which the UNHCR needs from its new high commissioner.

Physical geography 
SIR-In your article on CERN (""Cause for CONCERN?"", October 28th), Europe's high-energy-physics laboratory, you refer to the site of the cancelled Superconducting Super Collider, calling it ""A giant hole in the desert in Texas"". This is a mischaracterisation of the landscape surrounding Waxahachie. Far from being a desert, the terrain consists largely of gently rolling grasslands interspersed with lightly wooded areas. in fact, it is rather lovely and far removed (conceptually and geographically) from the Texas that consists solely of deserts populated entirely by cattlemen and oil barons. 
GLEN MARTIN Austin, Texas 
Eye catching 
SIR-I subscribe to two British journals: The Economist and Private Eye. I had thought it an impossibility to confuse one with the other. Until, that is, I read Charlemagne on Elisabeth Guigou (October 28th). To see the French as peculiarly sexist or more prone than others to judge women politicians on their appearance is nothing if not satirical. Is Charlemagne entirely unaware of the scandalous comments on Ann Widdecombe's physique which appear frequently in the British press? Be warned; should you ever again cause me to splutter in my gin and tonic I shall cancel my subscription to your esteemed organ.

Apple turnover 
SIR-The press has always been poorly informed about Apple Computer, its technology, and its users (""Cracks in the cube"", October 7th). First, it is not clear that the lines in the transparent case of the G4 Cube are cracks; they seem more likely to be mould lines. The fact that they are barely noticeable is actually a testament to the design prowess of Apple. 
Also, to say that Apple has not been able to attract new users is ludicrous. A large portion of the growth of Apple sales has been to new Pc users. To imply that the attraction of Macintosh computers is only due to their industrial design is to do a disservice to your readers. The superior usability of Mac systems speaks for itself.

Automatic reply 
SIR-Your article on Knob Creek's machinegun shoot is a pathetic tilt at legitimate gun owners and collectors (""The guns of October"", October 21St). The point of this event is that no one gets shot or wounded. It is good clean fun and allows a few people to live out some harmless fantasies in a carefully controlled and policed environment. You seem inspired by that mean spirit of Puritanism which H.L. Mencken defined as ""the haunting fear that someone, somewhere may be happy."" 
PHILIP WALLINGTON Auckland, New Zealand 
Rational actor 
SIR-Inexplicably, your Economics focus (October 28th) identifies me as sceptical of recent research by my professional colleagues. The Economist did not solicit my opinion for the article. Had you done so, I would have expressed a high degree of admiration for the innovative research described. Apparently you did talk to an economist who heard me use the term ""wackonomics"" (though not in reference to the research projects you discuss). I cannot even claim credit for coining this clever term-I first heard it used several years ago by Orley Ashenfelter, a Princeton economist. 
LOWELL TAYLOR Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh 
SIR-Mr Taylor is not a sceptic about economic models of social norms. On the contrary, he, Renee Landers and James Rebitzer have done pioneering work on seemingly irrational norms in organisations. They explain that the long hours worked by young lawyers in large law firms can be rationalised as an exaggerated signal of commitment to their firm. The signal is necessary to distinguish good potential partners from free-riders; lawyers who would slacken after reaching partnership. 
This approach is no less ""wacky"" than my explanation for protracted yeshiva attendance by ultra-orthodox Jews in Israel, who were studying full time until 40 years old on average by the mid 1990s. Study in yeshiva is a sacrifice of time by which one signals commitment to an ultraorthodox community that may be concerned about free-riders-- those who would benefit from the community's generous provision of mutual aid without contributing their share. As in law firms, what looks like irrational behaviour may in fact be a community norm which efficiently discourages free-riding. 
Unfortunately, the more attractive membership becomes, the more costly the signal of commitment required to discourage potential free-riders. That is why increases in government subsidies to ultra-orthodox communities in Israel have sharply increased the duration of yeshiva attendance. These durations are unprecedented in Jewish history and unmatched by ultra-orthodox communities outside Israel. A large component of the government subsidy is a draft deferral for yeshiva students. Understanding the role of signalling resolves the puzzle of why yeshiva attendance did not fall sharply at 35 years old when ultra-orthodox men typically became draft exempt anyway. Even when the subsidy becomes irrelevant, there is still a need to signal. 
ELI BERMAN Boston University Boston

TIM CLEVES Berkeley, California 
Unhistorical moment 
SIR-So Jean Chretien seeks ""to be the first Canadian prime minister to win three majority governments in a row"" (""Chretien's October surprise"", October 2lSt)? What about Sir John A. Macdonald (1878, 1882, 1887, 1891), Sir Wilfred Laurier (1896, 1900, 1904, 1908) and W.L. Mackenzie King (1935, 1940, 1945)? However, Mr Chretien could be the first to win three majority governments in his first three tries. Not exactly the sort of thing that gets a big place in the history books though. 
Pittsburgh DAVID GAUTHIER 
Heath's triumph 
SIR-After such a scathing Bagehot (October 28th), it is hard for me to inform you of an historical interpretation regarding Sir Edward Heath's singular achievement as prime minister. Bagehot writes of the ""wildly exciting moment"" in May 1971 when Sir Edward told the world that he had talked France's president, George Pompidou, into repudiating Charles de Gaulle's infamous veto on Britain joining the Common Market. In fact, it was really Michel Jobert, then secretarygeneral of the Elysee Palace and Pompidou's right-hand man, who orchestrated the change in Franco-British relations and Pompidou's attitude towards Britain joining the Common Market. 
The strategy was put in place back in the early 196os when Sir Edward and Mr Jobert, then director of Prime Minister Pompidou's cabinet, met over many summer holidays in Spain. Pompidou was less pro-English than he was anti-German; British entry was seen as a way to counter German influence in Europe. Pompidou also feared that his own ministers would make premature concessions in negotiations with Britain. So Mr Jobert got carte blanche to set up the first secret diplomatic shuttle between Paris and London to prepare for what turned out to be a last-minute summit, keeping at bay the reluctant members of the French and British governments. 
Lastly, Pompidou was less a Gaullist than he was a pragmatist, refusing to put on the negotiating table the recurring problems concerning Britain's contribution to the budget, fishing rights or New Zealand's milk-product exports. 
M.K. WEED Luins, Switzerland 
SIR-Bagehot's assessment of Sir Edward's career starts as a welcome antidote to the selective hagiographies available elsewhere. Also, his assessment that Sir Edward's weakness was the necessary progenitor of Thatcherism is on target. 
However, Sir Edward's supposedly major role in driving Britain into Europe is equivocal. By 1969, de Gaulle's famous 1963 ""Non"" was looking increasingly at odds with economic reality. The French president, Pompidou, who had been sacked by de Gaulle in 1968, needed little persuasion to reverse the veto. Nevertheless, Sir Edward somehow managed to concede manifestly unfair British contributions, particularly to the Common Agricultural Policy, which played directly into the hands of domestic opponents of fuller integration. Lady Thatcher was still using that very cudgel at Fontainebleau in 1984. 
European integration is a tide, with its own logic and its own ebb and flow. Yachtsman Heath's failure to time the tide correctly added to the swell of domestic opposition and so, if anything, probably delayed Britain's steady drift toward the Continent. 
New York ANGUS MCCALLUM Sharing Jerusalem 
SIR-You mention that Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif, or better the whole Old City of Jerusalem, might formally be declared to be under the sovereignty of God: God, the father to the Christians; Yahweh of the Jews; and Allah of Islam (""Jerusalem's split sovereignty"", September 16th). This is imaginative, sensible, and perhaps the only way to resolve this central part of the confrontation in the Middle East. 
This would presumably mean that sovereignty would reside with a trio of representatives of the three faiths, perhaps entitled consuls in the ancient sense of supreme magistrates. The method of appointment would present enormous problems, but not insurmountable ones. The least difficult would be a Christian representative, maybe from the Orthodox community, though careful ecumenical consultation would be needed. For the Muslims, an eminent leader of the faith, not closely connected with any government. For the Jews, a respected and non-fanatical rabbi, preferably not connected to any of Israel's religious parties. 
Each faith would have to propose a representative acceptable to the others. The representatives could serve for terms of two to four years. They would have to be supported by a council, perhaps elected by the essentially Muslim population of the Old City, balanced by an equal number elected in Israel, and a small number representing Christian interests and concerns. 
There are many aspects of this idea which require deep and careful thought, from the exact area of sovereignty (which should hopefully include Gethsemane), to the role of the UN. But such an enterprise certainly seems worth exploring both by the faiths and the international community: with a view to action.

Small change 
SIR-I started collecting coins only a year ago when I was ten years old. My father showed me your article on small coins (""Short-changed"", October 21st), and asked whether it is true that the Italian 50-lire coin was indeed the smallest. The 5o-lire is ISmm in diameter; I have found eight coins that are smaller. A one peseta from Spain is 13mm in diameter and is the smallest in my collection. At 14 mm are a one kopiyka from Ukraine, ten cents from the Netherlands, one groszy from Poland, one santim from Latvia, one kopek from Russia, one cent from Singapore and one cent from South Africa. 
I also have a one tiin coin from Uzbekistan, which is the same size as a 50-lire, but much smaller in value: about 75,000 would be worth $1. Even if it is a tiny coin, that is quite a challenge for any piggy-bank.

This is a mischaracterisation of the landscape surrounding Waxahachie . Far from being a desert , the terrain consists largely of gently rolling grasslands interspersed with lightly wooded areas . in fact , it is rather lovely and far removed ( conceptually and geographically ) from the Texas that consists solely of deserts populated entirely by cattlemen and oil barons .

 Eye catching 
 SIR - I subscribe to two British journals : The Economist and Private Eye . I had thought it an impossibility to confuse one with the other . Until , that is , I read Charlemagne on Elisabeth Guigou ( October 28th ) . To see the French as peculiarly sexist or more prone than others to judge women politicians on their appearance is nothing if not satirical . Is Charlemagne entirely unaware of the scandalous comments on Ann Widdecombe 's physique which appear frequently in the British press ? Be warned ; should you ever again cause me to splutter in my gin and tonic I shall cancel my subscription to your esteemed organ .

 Apple turnover 
 SIR - The press has always been poorly informed about Apple Computer , its technology , and its users ( "" Cracks in the cube "" , October 7th ) . First , it is not clear that the lines in the transparent case of the G4 Cube are cracks ; they seem more likely to be mould lines . The fact that they are barely noticeable is actually a testament to the design prowess of Apple . 
 Also , to say that Apple has not been able to attract new users is ludicrous . A large portion of the growth of Apple sales has been to new Pc users . To imply that the attraction of Macintosh computers is only due to their industrial design is to do a disservice to your readers . The superior usability of Mac systems speaks for itself .

 Automatic reply 
 SIR - Your article on Knob Creek 's machinegun shoot is a pathetic tilt at legitimate gun owners and collectors ( "" The guns of October "" , October 21St ) . The point of this event is that no one gets shot or wounded . It is good clean fun and allows a few people to live out some harmless fantasies in a carefully controlled and policed environment . You seem inspired by that mean spirit of Puritanism which H.L. Mencken defined as "" the haunting fear that someone , somewhere may be happy . ""

 Rational actor 
 SIR - Inexplicably , your Economics focus ( October 28th ) identifies me as sceptical of recent research by my professional colleagues . The Economist did not solicit my opinion for the article . Had you done so , I would have expressed a high degree of admiration for the innovative research described . Apparently you did talk to an economist who heard me use the term "" wackonomics "" ( though not in reference to the research projects you discuss ) . I can not even claim credit for coining this clever term - I first heard it used several years ago by Orley Ashenfelter , a Princeton economist . 
 LOWELL TAYLOR Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh 
 SIR - Mr Taylor is not a sceptic about economic models of social norms . On the contrary , he , Renee Landers and James Rebitzer have done pioneering work on seemingly irrational norms in organisations . They explain that the long hours worked by young lawyers in large law firms can be rationalised as an exaggerated signal of commitment to their firm . The signal is necessary to distinguish good potential partners from free - riders ; lawyers who would slacken after reaching partnership . 
 This approach is no less "" wacky "" than my explanation for protracted yeshiva attendance by ultra - orthodox Jews in Israel , who were studying full time until 40 years old on average by the mid 1990s . Study in yeshiva is a sacrifice of time by which one signals commitment to an ultraorthodox community that may be concerned about free - riders-- those who would benefit from the community 's generous provision of mutual aid without contributing their share . As in law firms , what looks like irrational behaviour may in fact be a community norm which efficiently discourages free - riding . 
 Unfortunately , the more attractive membership becomes , the more costly the signal of commitment required to discourage potential free - riders . That is why increases in government subsidies to ultra - orthodox communities in Israel have sharply increased the duration of yeshiva attendance . These durations are unprecedented in Jewish history and unmatched by ultra - orthodox communities outside Israel . A large component of the government subsidy is a draft deferral for yeshiva students . Understanding the role of signalling resolves the puzzle of why yeshiva attendance did not fall sharply at 35 years old when ultra - orthodox men typically became draft exempt anyway . Even when the subsidy becomes irrelevant , there is still a need to signal . 
 ELI BERMAN Boston University Boston 
 SIR - YOU take pride , and show surprise , that three leading academic journals have published articles showing how economic thinking can be applied in what might appear unlikely areas . However , this is part of a long trend . The real surprise would be if these journals published articles showing how economic thinking could not be applied to any area .

 Unhistorical moment 
 SIR - So Jean Chretien seeks "" to be the first Canadian prime minister to win three majority governments in a row "" ( "" Jean Chretien's October surprise "" , October 2lSt ) ? What about Sir John A. Macdonald ( 1878 , 1882 , 1887 , 1891 ) , Sir Wilfred Laurier ( 1896 , 1900 , 1904 , 1908 ) and W.L. Mackenzie King ( 1935 , 1940 , 1945 ) ? However , Jean Chretien could be the first to win three majority governments in Jean Chretien's first three tries . Not exactly the sort of thing that gets a big place in the history books though . 
 Pittsburgh DAVID GAUTHIER 
 Heath 's triumph 
 SIR - After such a scathing Bagehot ( October 28th ) , it is hard for me to inform you of an historical interpretation regarding Sir Edward Heath 's singular achievement as prime minister . Bagehot writes of the "" wildly exciting moment "" in May 1971 when Sir Edward told the world that he had talked France 's president , George Pompidou , into repudiating Charles de Gaulle 's infamous veto on Britain joining the Common Market . In fact , it was really Michel Jobert , then secretarygeneral of the Elysee Palace and Pompidou 's right - hand man , who orchestrated the change in Franco - British relations and Pompidou 's attitude towards Britain joining the Common Market . 
 The strategy was put in place back in the early 196os when Sir Edward and Mr Jobert , then director of Prime Minister Pompidou 's cabinet , met over many summer holidays in Spain . Pompidou was less pro - English than he was anti - German ; British entry was seen as a way to counter German influence in Europe . Pompidou also feared that his own ministers would make premature concessions in negotiations with Britain . So Mr Jobert got carte blanche to set up the first secret diplomatic shuttle between Paris and London to prepare for what turned out to be a last - minute summit , keeping at bay the reluctant members of the French and British governments . 
 Lastly , Pompidou was less a Gaullist than he was a pragmatist , refusing to put on the negotiating table the recurring problems concerning Britain 's contribution to the budget , fishing rights or New Zealand 's milk - product exports . 
 M.K. WEED Luins , Switzerland 
 SIR - Bagehot 's assessment of Sir Edward 's career starts as a welcome antidote to the selective hagiographies available elsewhere . Also , his assessment that Sir Edward 's weakness was the necessary progenitor of Thatcherism is on target . 
 However , Sir Edward 's supposedly major role in driving Britain into Europe is equivocal . By 1969 , de Gaulle 's famous 1963 "" Non "" was looking increasingly at odds with economic reality . The French president , Pompidou , who had been sacked by de Gaulle in 1968 , needed little persuasion to reverse the veto . Nevertheless , Sir Edward somehow managed to concede manifestly unfair British contributions , particularly to the Common Agricultural Policy , which played directly into the hands of domestic opponents of fuller integration . Lady Thatcher was still using that very cudgel at Fontainebleau in 1984 . 
 European integration is a tide , with its own logic and its own ebb and flow . Yachtsman Heath 's failure to time the tide correctly added to the swell of domestic opposition and so , if anything , probably delayed Britain 's steady drift toward the Continent . 
 New York ANGUS MCCALLUM Sharing Jerusalem 
 SIR - You mention that Temple Mount / Haram al - Sharif , or better the whole Old City of Jerusalem , might formally be declared to be under the sovereignty of God : God , the father to the Christians ; Yahweh of the Jews ; and Allah of Islam ( "" Jerusalem 's split sovereignty "" , September 16th ) . This is imaginative , sensible , and perhaps the only way to resolve this central part of the confrontation in the Middle East . 
 This would presumably mean that sovereignty would reside with a trio of representatives of the three faiths , perhaps entitled consuls in the ancient sense of supreme magistrates . The method of appointment would present enormous problems , but not insurmountable ones . The least difficult would be a Christian representative , maybe from the Orthodox community , though careful ecumenical consultation would be needed . For the Muslims , an eminent leader of the faith , not closely connected with any government . For the Jews , a respected and non - fanatical rabbi , preferably not connected to any of Israel 's religious parties . 
 Each faith would have to propose a representative acceptable to the others . The representatives could serve for terms of two to four years . They would have to be supported by a council , perhaps elected by the essentially Muslim population of the Old City , balanced by an equal number elected in Israel , and a small number representing Christian interests and concerns . 
 There are many aspects of this idea which require deep and careful thought , from the exact area of sovereignty ( which should hopefully include Gethsemane ) , to the role of the UN . But such an enterprise certainly seems worth exploring both by the faiths and the international community : with a view to action . 
 DAVID KITCHING Canbridge 
 Small change 
 SIR - I started collecting coins only a year ago when I was ten years old . My father showed me your article on small coins ( "" Short - changed "" , October 21st ) , and asked whether it is true that the Italian 50 - lire coin was indeed the smallest . The 5o - lire is ISmm in diameter ; I have found eight coins that are smaller . A one peseta from Spain is 13 mm in diameter and is the smallest in my collection . At 14 mm are a one kopiyka from Ukraine , ten cents from the Netherlands , one groszy from Poland , one santim from Latvia , one kopek from Russia , one cent from Singapore and one cent from South Africa . 
 I also have a one tiin coin from Uzbekistan , which is the same size as a 50 - lire , but much smaller in value : about 75,000 would be worth $ 1 . Even if it is a tiny coin , that is quite a challenge for any piggy - bank .

OTTAWA 
HOW many national parties are there in Canada? The prime minister, Jean Chretien, campaigning in the general election he has called for November 27th, claims that his Liberals are the only one. Typical hubris, you might think. Mr Chretien himself has argued that this election is a two-horse race between the Liberals and the main opposition, the Canadian Alliance, led by Stockwell Day. Three other parties held 84 seats out of 301 when the House of Commons was dissolved. And on November 8th and 9th, two televised debates in French and English put Mr Chretien and Mr Day on an equal footing with the leaders of the Bloc Quebecois, the New Democratic Party and the Progressive Conservatives. 
But in some respects Mr Chretien is right. The regional splits have become more evident in the past decade. While the Liberals have, by the latest polls, more than 30% support in every region, the Alliance is powerful only in the four western provinces; the separatist Bloc Quebecois confines itself to Quebec; the New Democrats reach double-digit support only in the two poorer regions, the Atlantic and Prairie provinces; and the Conservatives manage the same in the Atlantic provinces and Ontario. One senior political commentator went so far this month as to write that this was no national election but ""a series of coordinated regional contests"". 
Is Canada so fragmented? Constitutionally, it is one of the most loosely bound confederations after Switzerland. The Conservative leader, Joe Clark, who was briefly prime minister, has called Canada ""a community of communities"" and was the main author of the 1992 Charlottetown Accord, which would have dispersed more power from Ottawa. Although the accord was rejected in a referendum, the process of delegating power to the provinces has continued. And the United States has continued to exert its inexorable southward pull on its neighbouring regions. 
Mr Clark's own hero and Canada's first prime minister, Sir John MacDonald, resisted that pull at the birth of confederation by a ""national policy"" of tariff protection and by building a railway to the Pacific. Today the railway system has shrunk, the two main airlines have merged and a series of trade deals, culminating in the North American Free-Trade Agreement, have, since 1988, increased trade with the United States to some 87% of Canada's exports. Significantly, the international trade-that is, predominantly, trade with the big neighbour-of every province except two in the Maritimes is greater than its inter-provincial trade. Business people in Canada face south, as do their television satellite dishes. 
An influential group of academics wants to see more integration-specifically, of the currency. Thomas Courchene, a professor at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, has urged the government to negotiate a North American monetary union with a new currency some have dubbed the ""amero"". Mr Chretien was cool to the notion when Mexico's new president, Vicente Fox, raised it recently, and he has enlisted as a star candidate in the election a senior bank adviser, John McCallum, who has written forcefully against abandoning the Canadian dollar and its flexible exchange rate. Nevertheless, these ideas will not go away. 
So far in the campaign, Mr Chretien has managed to keep health care as the main issue and to present the Liberals as defenders of a publicly funded one-tier system, emblematic of Canadian ideals of fairness. Mr Day, until recently the finance minister of Alberta-which, this summer, passed a law allowing private for-profit clinics that could keep patients overnight for surgery-has had difficulty explaining that the flexibility he urges to make the system more efficient will not produce a two-tier system nor weaken the Canada Health Act, which guarantees national standards. 
The Liberal government itself is vulnerable to charges from Mr Day that, by massively cutting tax revenue transfers to the provinces for social services during the years of federal deficit-reduction, it had greatly damaged the health-care system before starting to restore the cuts this year. Alexa McDonough, the New Democrat leader, has campaigned strenuously on health care, criticising both front-runners and calling for an expanded system. 
In the deficit-cutting years from 1994 the Liberals also chopped away at another revered institution, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and the policy platform of the Canadian Alliance goes further in calling for partial privatisation of CBC television. For his part, Mr Clark is promising that a Conservative government would repeal the Clarity Act, which lays down broad parameters for a referendum on Quebec sovereignty. This act is generally seen as the most daring political initiative the Chretien government has taken in seven cautious years. 
""Divided we stand"" was the main headline on articles by a respected reporter, John Stackhouse, who hitchhiked 9,000km (5,600 miles) across the country this summer. He found that Canada was a land of distinct communities and regions with their own anxieties, from the seasonal loggers and fishermen of British Columbia and the Atlantic provinces to the farmers of the prairie states, who were worried about gun-registration laws and the paternalistic approach of Ottawa towards native peoples. In general, he found much discontent about the federal government's efforts to manage from a distance. If anyone understands that mood, it is less likely to be Mr Chretien than Mr Day. ","Canada

After a rough campaign, Canada's prime minister looks likely to be back for a third term, but cannot be sure of a parliamentary majority 
IN DECIDING to call a snap election for November 27th, almost two years before parliament had to be dissolved, Canada's prime minister, Jean Chretien, looked to have made a coldly opportunistic calculation. Wait longer, and Stockwell Day, the boyish new leader of the conservative Canadian Alliance, the revamped official opposition, might pose a far greater threat to Mr Chretien's Liberals. That in turn would increase the pressure for the prime minister, who craves a third term, to make way for a more popular colleague, such as Paul Martin, the finance minister. 
Mr Chretien's judgement may have been self-serving, but was it correct? The Liberals, with 159 seats in the outgoing parliament, are defending an overall majority of nine. The main question is whether they will now be reduced to a minority government, forced to rely on the support of the socialdemocratic New Democrats (NDP). 
If the opinion polls are to be believed, the prime minister may retain his majority. Nationally, they give the Liberals around 40% (compared with 380 of the vote in 1997). Support for the Alliance has stalled at 29%. The rest of the vote is distributed between the separatist Bloc Quebecois, the Nr and the Progressive Conservatives (see chart). 
But the Liberals have two reasons to worry. The first concerns allegations of sleaze involving Mr Chretien, which have clouded the final days of the campaign. The second is that in Canada's first-past-thepost system, a Liberal majority may turn on the outcome in a handful of marginal seats. 
The Alliance looks to have done enough to seize some marginals (held by ministers) in the western provinces, and in rural and suburban Ontario. And in Atlantic Canada, the Liberals may fail to win back seats they lost in 1997 to the Conservatives, whose leader,Joe Clark,did well in the Tv debates. 
The Liberals ought to be doing better. With a booming economy, the federal budget in surplus, and Quebec separatism quiescent for now, the election has been largely free of urgent issues. Instead, it has focused on personalities. Neither Mr Chretien nor Mr Day has been left unscathed. Mr Day bounced into federal politics earlier this year, along with his party. It was formed out of the western-based Reform Party. The aim: to attract enough Conservatives to avoid a repeat of the 1997 election, when the division of right-wing votes between the two parties handed victory on a plate to Mr Chretien, especially in Ontario, Canada's most populous province. 
Mr Day, who made his career in the cloistered world of Alberta's conservative politics, has been hurt by the Liberals' bruising stump manners. He has had to defend himself against charges of extremism. Elinor Caplan, the immigration minister, accused the Alliance of harbouring ""bigots, racists and Holocaust-deniers"". Mr Day's support for private health care meant he was charged with wanting to introduce a ""two-tier"" health service. An evangelical Christian, he has pleaded that religion was irrelevant to the campaign. But that did not stop a Liberal official waving a toy dinosaur on television, in mockery of Mr Day's creationist views. 
Then came the publication of a briefing document for Alliance candidates, which foresaw referendums on such questions as abortion and capital punishment if just 3% of voters demanded one. That brought ridicule. A television satirist launched a drive to gather the required 400,000 signatures for a referendum to change Mr Day's first name to Doris; the figure was achieved within hours through the Internet. Lost in this theatre of the absurd was much discussion of the Alliance's plan for tax cuts. A similar plan won Ontario for the Conservatives in a provincial election in 1995. 
When Mr Day finally went onto the attack, it was first on law and order, urging more child protection after an incident with a paedophile made news. But his call for tougher sentences met the response that violent crime has fallen under the Liberals. 
So Mr Day turned on the prime minister himself. He accused Mr Chretien of the arrogant abuse of his wide powers of appointment and patronage.On November i6th, the National Post, a newspaper owned by Conrad Black, a passionate foe of the prime minister, revealed that Mr Chretien had telephoned and lobbied the director of the Business Development Bank, a governmentlinked outfit, to make a C$615,ooo ($398,ooo) loan to a golf-course hotel in his Quebec constituency, of which Mr Chretien had previously been one of the owners. This report also turned up unpaid debts and a mortgage default by the hotel, and allegations by the bank's former boss that he was forced from office when he wanted to take legal action against the hotel's owner. 
Mr Day has called for a criminal investigation. Mr Chretien retorted that he only did what any member of parliament should do for a constituent. Mr Clark called for Canada's ethics commissioner, who dismissed milder allegations last year, to investigate the loan anew. But on November zand the commissioner said that Mr Chretien had broken no codes of conduct. Five other police investigations are under way into questionable grants in the prime minister's constituency. 
Mr Chretien's personal standing in opinion polls has fallen, not just because of the sleaze claims, but also because of his poor performance in television debates. Among his fellow francophone Quebeckers, Mr Chretien's reputation has rarely been lower. That may help the Bloc Quebecois improve on its 44 seats, out of the province's 75. 
overall, according to the polls, Canadians believe that the Liberals and Mr Chretien are as likely (or unlikely) to provide honest government as the Alliance and Mr Day, who is particularly distrusted by women. That may prove no consolation to Mr Chr6tien. Should he lose his majority, the prime minister will face calls to step down in favour of Mr Martin. The finance minister has stuck to his script as a loyal lieutenant, but he has been mobbed by Liberals at rallies. Mr Chretien is a tough customer, but his electoral calculation may yet backfire. ","OTTAWA 
 After a rough campaign , Jean Chretien's looks likely to be back for a third term , but can not be sure of a parliamentary majority 
 IN DECIDING to call a snap election for November 27th , almost two years before parliament had to be dissolved , Canada 's prime minister , Jean Chretien , looked to have made a coldly opportunistic calculation . Wait longer , and Stockwell Day , the boyish new leader of the conservative Canadian Alliance , the revamped official opposition , might pose a far greater threat to Jean Chretien's Liberals . That in turn would increase the pressure for Jean Chretien , to make way for a more popular colleague , such as Paul Martin , the finance minister . 
 Jean Chretien's judgement may have been self - serving , but was it correct ? The Liberals , with 159 seats in the outgoing parliament , are defending an overall majority of nine . The main question is whether they will now be reduced to a minority government , forced to rely on the support of the socialdemocratic New Democrats ( NDP ) . 
 If the opinion polls are to be believed , Jean Chretien may retain Jean Chretien's majority . Nationally , they give the Liberals around 40 % ( compared with 380 of the vote in 1997 ) . Support for the Alliance has stalled at 29 % . The rest of the vote is distributed between the separatist Bloc Quebecois , the Nr and the Progressive Conservatives ( see chart ) . 
 But the Liberals have two reasons to worry . The first concerns allegations of sleaze involving Jean Chretien , which have clouded the final days of the campaign . The second is that in Canada 's first - past - thepost system , a Liberal majority may turn on the outcome in a handful of marginal seats .

A remarkable election leaves Jean Chretien free to define his legacy 
OTTAWA 
JEAN CHRETIEN's gamble has paid off. Canada's prime minister, who likes to call himself ""le p'tit gars de Shawinigan"", won big in the general election he called for November 27th. In fact, ""the little guy"" won bigger than even he had expected: his Liberals took 172 seats, a comfortable majority in a House of Commons of 301, and a remarkable advance on the 155 seats they won in 1997. 
Mr Chretien's decision to call an election less than four years into his five-year mandate was widely criticised, and its wisdom doubted by many of his own Mrs. But it turned out to be a clever stroke. Canadians are unusually contented, thanks to a booming economy and pre-election tax cuts. And the snap poll caught the main opposition, the conservative Canadian Alliance, unprepared in the crucial arena of Ontario, where this newly minted party had hoped to extend its base from western Canada. 
The Alliance leader, Stockwell Day, had campaigned vigorously in rural and suburban Ontario, but his party's reward was a meagre two seats in the province. The Liberals secured their Ontario base, holding loo of the 103 seats. Their gains came elsewhere. They rebounded in the mainly depressed Atlantic provinces, after promising C$700m ($456m) for job creation there. They took eight extra seats, seizing six back from the leftish New Democrats and two from the Progressive Conservatives. More surprisingly, they also made inroads in Quebec, taking six seats from the separatist Bloc Quebecois (BQ). 
Two things helped the Liberals there. Firstly, since Jean Charest, the former federal Conservative leader switched to become the Liberal leader in the province in 1998, most of his supporters seem to have followed him-to show their support for federalism. Secondly, the BQ was not much helped by its association with the provincial government of Lucien Bouchard, which is pushing through an unpopular amalgamation of municipalities. Giles Duceppe, the BQ leader, ran a polished campaign, but got little support on the hustings from Mr Bouchard. 
The Alliance consolidated its position as the main opposition. It tightened its grip over the four western provinces, and attracted some erstwhile Conservative supporters. But although Mr Day is a fresh and lively leader, the Liberals managed successfully to paint him as an extremist who threatened the health service and abortion rights. 
That seems to have checked the Alliance. It allowed Joe Clark, the Conservative leader, to defend his party from extinction. He won his seat in Alberta, but spent most of the campaign in the Atlantic provinces. His nine-seat haul there helped the Conservatives reach the 12-seat threshold nationally for official recognition as a parliamentary party. (The New Democrats, too, only just passed this barrier.) 
But what really hobbled the Alliance was its mistaken arithmetic in Ontario. Its backers had reckoned that by combining the 1997 vote of the two right-of-centre parties, the Reform party and the Conservatives, the Alliance could win 40 seats in the province. Conservative voters had other ideas. Some switched to the Liberals. Others stuck with 
Mr Clark,who in refusing to join the Alliance turned out to be the Liberals' best friend. 
Mr Chretien, at 66, now stands at the pinnacle of a long career, having achieved the rare feat of winning three majority govements in a row. Canadians may not like him much, but his lackadaisical manner conceals an effective and often underrated politician. His party's improved standing in his native Quebec would seem to vindicate his tough line against separatism. 
The new term will decide Mr Chretien's legacy. Going back on earlier hints that he would step down, he said this week that he plans to serve it in full. On policy, he faces some tough choices. On the one hand, as he said after his victory, there is still much to do in social policy to keep Canada ""the best country in the world"", as it is ranked by the United Nations Human Development Index. One priority is reviving the health service. Another is the environment. The government's relaxed stance on global warming has been deplored by Europeans, in a rare international rebuke for Canada. 
On the other hand, Mr Chretien must look over his right shoulder at the Alliance. Its championing of lower taxes, and the need for Canadian business to compete with American rivals, will place limits on the government's scope for social democracy. In the small matter of organising an election, however, Canada showed this week that it is roughly a century ahead of the United States. It took officials just four hours to count (by hand) almost every one of nearly 13 million paper ballots, cast in 50,000 polling stations scattered across a vast country. ","Canada

George Bush became the 43rd president of the United States after an election of unprecedented drama and confusion. Al Gore, the Democratic candidate, narrowly won the popular vote, but victory in the electoral college depended on the result in Florida, where Mr Bush was ahead by only 500 votes. Claims of irregularities and a volley of lawsuits to force or stop recounts followed. Florida's Supreme Court ruled that partial recounts should continue; the United States Supreme Court intervened to rule that they should not. That in effect settled the result, five weeks after election day. 
The Institutional Revolutionary Party lost power in Mexico, after seven decades, to Vicente Fox, a former Coca-Cola manager. 
In an extraordinary saga in Peru, Alberto Fujimori won a controversial third term as president in a rigged election, only to be driven from office months later by scandals involving his intelligence adviser, Vladimiro Montesinos. 
The United States stepped into Colombia's quagmire, approving $1.3 billion in mostly military aid intended to wrest control of the country's main drug-producing area from the FARC guerrillas. The FARC suspended peace talks with the government, while right-wing paramilitaries grew in strength. 
The Pinochet affair trundled on. Britain released the former dictator after 17 months, on health grounds. Chile's Supreme Court ruled that he could be prosecuted at home for disappearances, but the Appeals Court quashed an arrest order against him on technical grounds. 
Canada's prime minister, Jean Chretien, gambled on an early election, and won. He gained a third consecutive parliamentary majority, seeing off the challenge of a newly formed right-wing party.

Vladimir Putin took over as Russia's acting president from an ailing Boris Yeltsin at the end of 1999, and won a presidential election in March.

The least belligerent of Kosovo's political parties, led by Ibrahim Rugova, won local elections in the rebel province administered by the UN. 
Angela Merkel replaced Wolfgang Schauble as the leader of Germany's opposition Christian Democratic Union in an effort to freshen up a party tainted by the fund-raising scandal surrounding ex-Chancellor Helmut Kohl.

Peace postponed 
The Israelis and Palestinians failed to agree on a permanent peace. Instead, a sequence of events led to a new intifada (uprising). The Israelis responded with ferocity. After 300 Palestinians and 38 Israelis had been killed, both sides again started peace talks. 
President Muhammad Khatami's reform movement in Iran won a parliamentary election but suffered bad setbacks, including the closing of liberal-minded newspapers. 
Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, launched a campaign to occupy white-owned farms, attacking the opposition Movement for Democratic Change. He won a parliamentary election but the economy shrank, disastrously. 
A savage two-year border war between Ethiopia and Eritrea ended with Eritrea's defeat. The two countries signed a peace agreement. 
In Cote d'Ivoire, General Robert Guei tried to steal an election. He was driven out by popular protest, and replaced by an opposition candidate, Laurent Gbagbo. The banning of another contender, Alassane Ouatarra, led to clashes. 
The UN struggled to make peace in Sierra Leone. Foday Sankoh, the main rebel leader, was captured. But the war continued. So did a bigger war in Congo. 
Mori clings on 
A rebellion against Japan's prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, led by his younger rival, Koichi Kato, failed. But with the lowest approval rating of any Japanese leader for decades, and a flat economy, Mr Mori's days looked numbered. 
The presidents of the two Koreas, Kim Dae Jung and Kim Jong 11, held an unprecedented summit in Pyongyang, the North's capital. There were family reunions, too, and work began on restoring rail links between the two capitals. 
President Joseph Estrada of the Philippines went on trial in the country's Senate, accused of taking bribes from illegal lotteries; the first Asian leader to be impeached. ","Bush finally does it 
 George Bush became the 43rd president of the United States after an election of unprecedented drama and confusion . Al Gore , the Democratic candidate , narrowly won the popular vote , but victory in the electoral college depended on the result in Florida , where Mr Bush was ahead by only 500 votes . Claims of irregularities and a volley of lawsuits to force or stop recounts followed . Florida 's Supreme Court ruled that partial recounts should continue ; the United States Supreme Court intervened to rule that they should not . That in effect settled the result , five weeks after election day . 
 The Institutional Revolutionary Party lost power in Mexico , after seven decades , to Vicente Fox , a former Coca - Cola manager . 
 In an extraordinary saga in Peru , Alberto Fujimori won a controversial third term as president in a rigged election , only to be driven from office months later by scandals involving his intelligence adviser , Vladimiro Montesinos . 
 The United States stepped into Colombia 's quagmire , approving $ 1.3 billion in mostly military aid intended to wrest control of the country 's main drug - producing area from the FARC guerrillas . The FARC suspended peace talks with the government , while right - wing paramilitaries grew in strength . 
 The Pinochet affair trundled on . Britain released the former dictator after 17 months , on health grounds . Chile 's Supreme Court ruled that he could be prosecuted at home for disappearances , but the Appeals Court quashed an arrest order against him on technical grounds . 
 Jean Chretien's gambled on an early election , and won . Jean Chretien gained a third consecutive parliamentary majority , seeing off the challenge of a newly formed right - wing party . 
 Europe 's leaders 
 Vladimir Putin took over as Russia 's acting president from an ailing Boris Yeltsin at the end of 1999 , and won a presidential election in March . 
 Slobodan Milosevic was turned out of office , with the help of mass demonstrations , after losing a presidential election in Yugoslavia to Vojislav Kostunica . 
 The least belligerent of Kosovo 's political parties , led by Ibrahim Rugova , won local elections in the rebel province administered by the UN . 
 Angela Merkel replaced Wolfgang Schauble as the leader of Germany 's opposition Christian Democratic Union in an effort to freshen up a party tainted by the fund - raising scandal surrounding ex - Chancellor Helmut Kohl . 
 France , which took over the Eu 's six - month rotating presidency in July , held a summit in Nice . The EU 'S 15 leaders agreed on the minimum reforms needed to embrace more countries as members , mainly from Eastern Europe . The earliest any might join is reckoned to be 2004 .

IN MILITARY as well as economic matters, Canada is a close partner of the United States, but that does not mean the neighbours always see eye-to-eye. Take for example, the national missile-defence system proposed by the United States, and strongly supported by George Bush. 
This matters particularly to Canada, a partner since 1958 in the North American Aerospace Defence Command (Norad), whose object is to detect and destroy aircraft or cruise missiles. Under the proposed defence system against ballistic missiles, the first 20 interceptors would be based in Alaska. But Norad's Canadian deputy commander, General George MacDonald, has said that the joint command should assume responsibility for the new shield; if Canada opposed its development, it might have to leave Norad. 
Some Canadians disagree. Lloyd Axworthy, who retired as foreign minister shortly before the federal election last month, was a vehement opponent of the missile-defence scheme, which he saw as costly, unproven and likely to trigger a new arms race. But John Manley, the new foreign minister, is more equivocal than Mr Axworthy on the issue. 
Not so Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, as he told Canada's prime minister, Jean Chretien, during a visit to Canada this week. Russia says missile defence would endanger the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and nuclear arms control. Canada, said Mr Putin, could act as ""a mediator"" between Russia and the United States. 
That puts Canada ""in a bind"", said Mr Chretien, since geography has placed it between the two. His government wants ""to assess all the consequences"". Translation: while Canada is happy to talk to Mr Putin about trade and aid, defence is another matter. ","OTTAWA

Last week, however, the mercurial Mr Bouchard abruptly resigned from his dual role as premier of Quebec and head of the separatist Parti Quebecois (PQ). So is Canada saved? 
Much of English Canada seems to think so. ""The nightmare of Quebec separatism has receded,"" said Roy Romanow, the outgoing premier of Saskatchewan. Such triumphalism may be premature: polls show almost 40% still want secession. But Mr Bouchard's exit is certainly a heavy blow to an ailing cause. 
in a referendum in 1995, Mr Bouchard, then the secessionists' leader in the federal parliament, was brought in to rescue a floundering yes campaign. He took the secessionists to within a percentage point (or 50,000 votes) of achieving their goal of breaking up the country. That persuaded Jacques Parizeau, the PQ's leader of the day, that the party's best bet was to have Mr Bouchard running matters in Quebec city. 
A truck driver's son who loves Proust, he was much more popular than either his party or its raison d'etre. His successor, who may not be chosen until May, will struggle to match his broad appeal. The main contenders are Bernard Landry, Quebec's deputy premier and finance minister, and Pauline Marois, the province's health minister. The leadership contest will see much soulsearching about the PQ's function and future. Already, one of the party's veteran ministers has asked whether it is time to drop Article 1 of its constitution: the commitment to an independent Quebec. Others disagree. 
In five years as premier, Mr Bouchard balanced the books and governed firmly, trying to create what he termed ""winning conditions"" for another referendum. But he was always distrusted by the PQ's ""purs et durs""-the hardliners who questioned his constancy to the cause. Brought up in a secessionist heartland in northern Quebec, Mr Bouchard has swung from party to party, and flipped back and forth between backing a united Canada and an independent Quebec. In that, perhaps, he mirrored the ambivalence of Quebeckers at large. 
The hardliners wanted a third referendum soon after the 1995 squeaker, and disliked their premier's go-slow approach. The sniping came from an entrenched but small faction; Mr Bouchard won 91% approval at a party meeting last May. But it irritated the thin-skinned premier, as he showed in a speech in the legislature last month in which he attacked one of his most vocal critics for complaining that Jews believe they are the only people to have suffered. 
Mr Bouchard devoted much of his resignation speech to lambasting the xenophobic, intolerant elements within the PQ. But he was probably telling the truth when he said that they were not the reason for his departure. There were personal motives. Aged 62, Mr Bouchard has two young sons from his marriage to a Californian wife who has never managed to hide her distaste for politics, and especially separatist politics. 
One man who can take particular satisfaction from Mr Bouchard's departure is Jean Chretien, Canada's prime minister. His tough approach to separatism was codified last year in the Clarity Act, which erects big legal obstacles to any break-up of Canada. To Mr Bouchard's annoyance, Quebec's voters reacted with indifference. In a federal election in November, the separatists suffered losses in the province to Mr Chretien's Liberals. That showed how unpromising were Mr Bouchard's chances of ever becoming father of an independent Quebec. Even so, he would doubtless have stayed on for at least a day had he realised that he had chosen to resign on Mr Chretien's birthday.

So nobody will watch Alan Greenspan's efforts to avoid a ""hard landing"" more closely than David Dodge, who on January 31st begins a sevenyear term as governor of the Bank of Canada, the country's independent central bank. 
Usually the bank's governors are drawn from its own ranks. Mr Dodge, who is 57, marks a break with tradition: he has worked as an economics professor, and has in turn held the top civil-service job in the employment-and-immigration, finance, and health departments. These jobs have brought him into close contact with Paul Martin, the finance minister. In 1995, he persuaded Mr Martin to make sharp cuts in spending which, along with a goods-and-services tax that Mr Dodge had helped to bring in under the previous Tory government, turned a budget deficit of C$42 billion in 1993 ($33 billion) into several years of fat surpluses. 
Though he owes his new job to the support of Mr Martin and Jean Chretien, the prime minister, Mr Dodge is likely to want to show his independence in monetary policy. When appointed last month, he stated his commitment to low inflation. Delivering this while trying to minimise the damage to Canada from any American recession will require a delicate sense of timing. 
Canada's economy has been roaring for the past few years, helped by the boom in the United States, which takes 86% of its exports and provides much of its inward investment. Canada's GDP grew by 5% in 2000, and the unemployment rate is at its lowest since the i97os. But growth is forecast to fall this year to 2.5%. Already, sickness in Detroit's car industry has brought lay--offs north of the border. High energy prices, and the weaker American economy, could push the Canadian dollar up relative to the greenback, hurting exporters and the tourist industry, and strengthening the case for looser monetary policy. 
But on the other hand, inflation, though lower than in the United States, rose to 3.2% in December. Stripping out seasonally high energy and food prices, ""core"" inflation, at 1.9%, was in the upper half of the band of 1-3% set by Mr Dodge's predecessors. And the economy has just had a fiscal stimulus. In October, on the eve of a federal election, Mr Martin announced big tax cuts, some of which came into effect this month. 
No wonder that the Bank of Canada did not immediately match Mr Greenspan's surprise interest-rate cut of half a percentage point earlier this month. Instead, it waited until its regular meeting, on January 23rd, when it cautiously lowered Canada's benchmark rate from 6% to 5-75%. If Mr Dodge does match any future interest-rate cuts down south, it is likely to be only after a prudent lag. Perhaps it is as well that the new governor is a man of quick reaction and proven nerve: his hobbies include sea-kayaking and white-water rafting.

 IF CANADA's ruling Liberals are once again living up to their nickname of ""perpetual governing party"", that has less to do with the qualities of Jean Chretien's government than with the shambolic state of the right-wing opposition. Last year the opposition seemed to be on the up, when Reform, a party strong in western Canada, linked up with some members of the Progressive Conservative Party to form a new party, the Canadian Alliance, under a new leader, Stockwell Day. But that was when the problems began.
 For the past three months, the Alliance's 66 MPs have fought a public war over whether to dump Mr Day. On July 7th, a year to the day after he was chosen as leader, the Alliance's executive called for him to resign. Mr Day's response seemed only to make matters worse. He offered to take a ""leave of absence"" from the leadership until a party convention scheduled for April 2002, but only if he could name his temporary replacement. Not surprisingly, Mr Day's main critics, a group of 13 MPs who have left the Alliance's official caucus in Parliament, rejected this condition. So Mr Day withdrew his offer. He remains the leader, but a wounded one.
 What has gone wrong? In his brief period as a federal politician, Mr Day has been extraordinarily accident-prone. He was chosen as leader because he spoke French and seemed to be charismatic: he enjoyed being photographed showing off his skills as a kickboxer and roller-blader. But, coming from Alberta's provincial government, where he had faced a tiny opposition, he lacked political experience.
 The hope was that Mr Day would break the Liberals' hold on Ontario's 103 parliamentary seats. He failed. When Mr Chretien called a snap election last November, the Alliance boosted Reform's previous tally by 764,000 votes and six seats. But it won only two seats in Ontario.
 It has been downhill ever since for Mr Day. A fiscal conservative, he passed on the bill for a lost libel suit to Alberta's taxpayers. He dropped his party's proposals for a flat tax and publicly repudiated his party's policy on refugees, both without consulting colleagues. More even than most politicians, he blames staff members or the media for his own mistakes. He denied (but then had to admit) that he had met a part-time spy to discuss gathering dirt on the Liberals. And so on.
 In the latest opinion poll, support for the Alliance has sunk to 10%, from a peak of 28% last October. More defections among MPs seem likely; already two among the nine members of the national executive have resigned over Mr Day's failure to quit. By contrast, the rump of the Progressive Conservatives has twitched into life. Led by Joe Clark, a former prime minister, the Conservatives won only 12 MPs last year, but now stand at 21% in the opinion polls. Mr Clark has made overtures to dissident Alliance MPs. But he has rejected any serious merger talks while the Alliance is in turmoil.
 Mr Clark has problems of his own. Two successive Conservative Party presidents have resigned since September, complaining of Mr Clark's authoritarianism. And he is disliked by most Alliance members. Sooner or later, the two parties will merge. But first they must find a new leader.","  The right - wing opposition is a mess

 TIMING is often everything in politics. For several crucial months in 1993 the then Mexican president, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, managed to restrain the Chiapas uprising and keep any news of it out of the media until the House of Representatives had approved the North American Free-Trade Agreement by a narrow margin (234 votes to 200). When the violence that he feared might have frightened the Congress finally erupted less than two months later, on new year's day 1994, NAFTA had just come into effect.
 By contrast, having negotiated a broad reciprocal free-trade agreement with Washington in surprising haste during the winter of 1910-11, the Canadian prime minister, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, dallied eight months without pushing through the necessary legislation. He even sailed off part way through to attend King George V's coronation. The manufacturers and other Canadian protectionists had time to rally their forces, and Laurier lost his last election. If reciprocity had gone through in 1911, would Canada have become a very different country, either prospering in close harmony with the United States, or absorbed into it? Now, 90 years on, ishistory catching up?
 Anthony DePalma pinpoints November 2000 as the month when his new continent and ""our shared destiny"" began to evolve.

Public Affairs; 375 pages; $26
 TIMING is often everything in politics. For several crucial months in 1993 the then Mexican president, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, managed to restrain the Chiapas uprising and keep any news of it out of the media until the House of Representatives had approved the North American Free-Trade Agreement by a narrow margin (234 votes to 200). When the violence that he feared might have frightened the Congress finally erupted less than two months later, on new year's day 1994, NAFTA had just come into effect.
 By contrast, having negotiated a broad reciprocal free-trade agreement with Washington in surprising haste during the winter of 1910-11, the Canadian prime minister, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, dallied eight months without pushing through the necessary legislation. He even sailed off part way through to attend King George V's coronation. The manufacturers and other Canadian protectionists had time to rally their forces, and Laurier lost his last election. If reciprocity had gone through in 1911, would Canada have become a very different country, either prospering in close harmony with the United States, or absorbed into it? Now, 90 years on, ishistory catching up?
 Anthony DePalma pinpoints November 2000 as the month when his new continent and ""our shared destiny"" began to evolve. Vicente Fox, who had become Mexico's president in an extraordinary election, was about to take office, and George Bush and Jean Chretien had both won elections north of the Rio Grande.

 WHEN earlier this year George Bush started talking about his desire for a ""common North American energy policy"", the immediate reaction in Canada took the characteristic form of an undignified squabble between the provinces and the centre as to who should make it.
 Vice-President Dick Cheney, who headed Mr Bush's energy task- force, had pointed to the oil sands of northern Alberta as a particularly rich prospect. Ralph Klein, Alberta's Conservative provincial premier, promptly rushed to Washington. Visiting the White House, he said that Canada has ""energy to burn"" and invited Mr Cheney to see for himself the oil sands around Fort McMurray.
 Canada is already a big supplier of energy to the United States, to the tune of C$30 billion ($20.2 billion) last year. It provides its neighbour with 9% of its oil needs and 15% of its natural gas. Much more could follow. Boosters claim that Alberta's oil sands contain 300 billion barrels of oil, far more than Saudi Arabia's proven reserves. One producer, a consortium headed by Shell Canada, is talking of enlarging its C$5 billion Athabaska oil-sands project, due to start in late 2002.
 Jean Chretien's federal government finds itself running to keep up with Mr Klein. Ralph Goodale, the minister of natural resources, hurried to say that Americans should realise that other provinces had large energy supplies to sell, including hydro and nuclear energy.
 That prompted Ontario's provincial government into brief dreams of increasing supply from its 23 ageing nuclear reactors. Its officials even mused about helping the federal government to sell a reactor to the United States, despite Canada's dismal record of selling only 11 reactors in 40 years, nearly all by offering large subsidies to poorer countries. The goldrush atmosphere also added intensity to an argument between Nova Scotia and Newfoundland over an oil-rich patch of the Atlantic near Sable Island.
 The American demand for energy may have given Mr Chretien a diplomatic weapon: officials have hinted that the United States's decision to slap duties on imports of Canadian lumber might make energy co-operation more difficult.
 But it has fired up the constitutional argument between the provinces, which own and control natural resources, and the federal government, which is responsible for international treaties. At their annual meeting this month, the provincial premiers insisted that they should be included in talks on a North American energy plan. But Mr Chretien's officials have played down the need for any new masterplan, suggesting that the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was doing the job well. In fact, since May, federal officials have been quietly talking to their American and Mexican counterparts in a three-country working group on energy.
 A second dispute has also flared, this one over pipelines. These have long been controversial in Yukon and Northwest Territories. They bring investment, but are said to threaten herds of caribou. Now, if America's Senate follows the House of Representatives in approving a bill to allow drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, the two territories would become rivals for a pipeline to transport gas from Alaska to the continental United States--a project described by its backers as ""the largest capital spending project in North American history"". A separate pipeline is likely to be proposed for the Mackenzie Valley, after Conoco, an American oil company, last month paid Gulf Canada C$6.7 billion for undeveloped fields in that area.
 The Canadian government has deplored the prospect of drilling for gas in caribou calving grounds, but has avoided taking sides. The benefits from satisfying the insatiable American thirst for energy will not come without headaches.","  Talk of a North American energy policy has fuelled political rivalries

 NO OTHER country has more experience of the United States' abrasive approach to trade disputes than Canada, and no Canadian industry knows more about such matters than its producers of softwood lumber. But familiarity does not ease the pain: Canadian wood producers have begun to shut mills and lay-off thousands of workers in response to a decision in early August by America's Commerce Department to impose a 19% countervailing duty on timber imports.
 Twice over the past two decades, Canada has cracked under such pressure, and cut deals restricting its exports. The latest deal, which expired in March, had capped duty-free exports at an annual 14.7 billion board-feet since 1996. Canada's lumber industry claims that this cost it C$700m ($480m) per year in forgone revenue, and 11,000 jobs.
 At the root of the dispute lie different systems for timber rights on each side of the border. In the United States, almost all timber is privately owned and sold at auction. In Canada, provincial governments own the timber, set harvest levels, restrict the export of raw logs and set stumpage rates (or cutting fees) according to market conditions. Lobbyists for America's lumber industry claim that these stumpage rates are cheap ""administratively set prices"" and constitute subsidies.
 The Commerce Department agreed, and went on to backdate the duty to May, claiming an unjustified inflow of Canadian wood since the agreement expired. On September 24th, the department is to rule on whether to levy additional ""anti-dumping"" duties that could triple the C$2 billion cost of those already in place.
 This time, Canada is in militant mood. ""We're not panicking and we're not rolling over,"" says David Gray, of the Canadian Free-Trade Lumber Council. One reason, he admits, is that half of the penalties are being passed on, through a 10% price increase, to American buyers who need Canadian wood. Another is that the federal government, the provinces and the industry have stayed united. On August 21st, Canada asked the World Trade Organisation to open consultations on the duties, which it says are illegal protectionism.
 Canada's prime minister, Jean Chretien, said he had warned George Bush that he cannot expect to restrict lumber exports while also calling for more Canadian energy. Not a threat to block energy exports, just a reminder that trade under NAFTA should be free, Mr. Chretien said later.
 On August 30th, Canadian and American officials were due to meet for their first talks under the WTO's auspices. Canada insists that this is not the first step towards a negotiated settlement. But for all the talk of economic warfare between the two close allies, diplomacy does not seem to have been entirely abandoned.

 CANADIANS have been worrying about water this summer. First severe drought hit southern Alberta, Saskatchewan and Ontario, turning crops to dust. Then contaminated drinking water left seven people dead in Ontario, and thousands sick in Newfoundland and Saskatchewan. A proposal to export tanker-loads of water from Newfoundland to the United States has triggered alarm. Some Canadians even fear that the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA) threatens their government's ability to exercise sovereign control over their water.
 Canada contains about one fifth of the world's fresh water. That abundance has long been the target of covetous eyes from drier Americans to the south. Inconveniently, most of Canada's big rivers flow north or east. In the 1960s American engineers dreamed up fanciful schemes to divert some of them to the south. Now some Canadian politicians see profit in exporting water southwards by easier means.
 In the spring Newfoundland's premier, Roger Grimes, said he would consider a businessman's proposal to pay C$20m ($12.8m) a month to take 13 billion gallons of water a year from a lake and ship it to the United States. Mr Grimes said he was ready to lift Newfoundland's ban on such exports, but only after public hearings.
 Opponents fear that this opens a hole in the dyke. Water has long been publicly owned and supplied in Canada (though there is an export trade in bottled water). However, if a province starts to export bulk water, that would turn it into a traded commodity. Critics claim that NAFTA would oblige Canada to supply its trading partners with water on the same terms it gives to its own consumers.
 In fact, NAFTA says nothing about water supplies. Officials insist there is no need to worry. They point out that an amendment to the International Boundary Waters Treaty Act, due to be approved later this year, will prohibit the bulk removal of water from basins that straddle the border, notably the Great Lakes (Newfoundland will not be affected).
 However, provincial governments have constitutional authority over natural resources. The federal government is pushing the provinces to agree to a national ban on the bulk removal of water from all drainage basins. Only half of the provinces have signed this, but the others have their own bans on removing water.
 Even so, the government faces vocal demands to enact a national ban on bulk water exports. It has no plans to do so. ""Water is not a [tradable] good, it is a resource that needs to be managed,"" says Pierre Pettigrew, the trade minister. Indeed: rising demand, pollution and climate change all mean that Canada is using most of its easily accessible water. That is partly because consumers pay a low tariff, unrelated to the amount used, which encourages waste. The environment ministry is now studying ways of pricing water.
 In fact, it is not clear whether a federal law banning bulk water exports would trump provincial authority over natural resources. With Alberta and Quebec (and now Newfoundland?) jealous of provincial rights, such a law could trigger a constitutional squabble-- something for which Canada's prime minister, Jean Chretien, may have no stomach. The political splashing looks unlikely to stop."," Canadians are in a lather over water exports

Canada faces calls to harmonise its security policies, while Mexico (next story) is feeling ambivalent
 OTHER countries may claim a special relationship with the United States, but no country is more intimately bound to it than Canada. The two share a 6,400km (4,000-mile) transcontinental border and the world's largest bilateral trade flow, worth C$627 billion ($422 billion) last year. So Canadians have quickly realised that the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in the United States will change their country too.
 The impact was immediate: 250 flights were diverted from American to Canadian airports last week, and some 30,000 airline passengers were stranded for three days. They were well looked after. At Halifax, in Nova Scotia, the Canadian Red Cross quickly organised bedding and meals, as well as toys and clothes, for 10,000 with cheerful efficiency, according to one passenger. Air traffic within Canada was cancelled, too, while the abrupt tightening by the American authorities of controls at border crossings delayed road transport, so much so that car-assembly plants closed for several days in each country for lack of parts.
 Revulsion at the attacks has been widespread, and not only because up to 60 Canadians died. On September 14th a crowd of about 100,000 turned out to honour the victims--the largest gathering ever known on Ottawa's Parliament Hill. ""You are truly our closest friends,"" said Paul Celucci, the American ambassador.
 Even so, Canada now faces some difficult questions. The first is whether to erect what some have called ""a perimeter wall"" round North America, by harmonising immigration, security and customs-clearance systems. Canada must be inside any such ""wall"" round the United States because 87% of its exports go there, says John Manley, Canada's foreign minister.
 Contrary to early reports, it appears that none of the 19 hijackers entered the United States from Canada, though a man who later arrived in Toronto was turned over to the FBI as a suspect. Yet Canada has acquired a reputation as a terrorist haven. A large Tamil population in Toronto legally raises funds for terrorist insurgents in Sri Lanka. A group of Sikhs from Vancouver has been charged with blowing up an Air India jumbo jet, killing 329 passengers, in 1985. The most worrying recent case concerns Ahmed Ressam, an Algerian who was arrested in December 1999 when trying to enter the United States, apparently in order to blow up Los Angeles airport. Though twice refused refugee status, he carried a (phoney) Canadian passport. His arrest uncovered a Montreal cell.
 Such cases have brought calls for changes in Canada's traditionally liberal immigration policy; about 200,000 people are admitted each year. A new bill, which is close to approval, tightens the rules for refugees, requiring stricter security checks, granting authorities more discretion to detain people at the border, and restricting appeals against deportation. The government is already taking a sterner line against illegal immigrants; last year it deported some 8,900 people.
 In a parliamentary debate on September 17th, Jean Chretien, the prime minister, made it clear that he would not close Canada's doors. ""We will continue to offer a refuge to the persecuted,"" he said. And he denounced as ""unacceptable"" several threats and assaults on Canadian Muslims. But the pressure to integrate further with the United States is strong. Mr Celucci was talking of a common immigration policy even before September 11th. The Fraser Institute, a conservative think-tank in Vancouver, has called for a customs union.
 Uncharitable terrorists
 The more pressing issue facing Canada is not immigration but internal security. Another bill, to lift the charitable status of any group found to be supporting terrorism, is now likely to win swift approval in Parliament--despite objections by human-rights lawyers that it leaves the definition of ""terrorism"" to official discretion. Stockwell Day, the leader of the conservative opposition, called in the parliamentary debate for a comprehensive anti-terrorism law, similar to those in Britain and the United States. The Liberal government is wary of such legislation, especially since Canada's Supreme Court has given a broad interpretation to the country's 1982 Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
 The third question for Mr Chretien is whether, or how far, Canada should join the United States in military action abroad. The prime minister is to meet President George Bush early next week ""to co- ordinate our actions"". The government seems prepared to send forces-- but it has few at its disposal, partly because some are already in Bosnia, Kosovo and Macedonia. Though its defence plans call for a brigade-size force of 5,000 men to be permanently available for deployment, only about 1,200 troops (with no transport) could now be mustered, says one military pundit. More useful might be Canada's squadrons of F-18 fighter jets and a small special-forces unit.
 The United States has long complained that Canada spends too little on defence (just 1.2% of GDP, half the average figure for its NATO partners). Mr Chretien's government is now expanding the 59,000- strong armed forces. He has promised to go ""every step of the way"" with the United States in its ""war"" on terrorism. That may mean taking some tough decisions he has so far ducked, such as whether to back Mr Bush's missile-defence plan, as well as a ""perimeter wall"".","  The United States ' response to terrorism has particular implications for its neighbours .

  In a parliamentary debate on September 17th , Jean Chretien , the prime minister , made it clear that he would not close Jean Chretien's doors . "" Jean Chretien will continue to offer a refuge to the persecuted , "" he said . And he denounced as "" unacceptable "" several threats and assaults on Canadian Muslims . But the pressure to integrate further with the United States is strong . Mr Celucci was talking of a common immigration policy even before September 11th . The Fraser Institute , a conservative think - tank in Vancouver , has called for a customs union . 
  Uncharitable terrorists 
  The more pressing issue facing Jean Chretien is not immigration but internal security . Another bill , to lift the charitable status of any group found to be supporting terrorism , is now likely to win swift approval in Parliament -- despite objections by human - rights lawyers that it leaves the definition of "" terrorism "" to official discretion . Stockwell Day , the leader of the conservative opposition , called in the parliamentary debate for a comprehensive anti - terrorism law , similar to those in Britain and the United States . Jean Chretien is wary of such legislation , especially since Jean Chretien's Supreme Court has given a broad interpretation to Jean Chretien's 1982 Charter of Rights and Freedoms . 
  The third question for Mr Chretien is whether , or how far , Jean Chretien should join the United States in military action abroad . The prime minister is to meet President George Bush early next week "" to co- ordinate our actions "" . Jean Chretien seems prepared to send forces-- but Jean Chretien has few at Jean Chretien's disposal , partly because some are already in Bosnia , Kosovo and Macedonia . Though Jean Chretien's defence plans call for a brigade - size force of 5,000 men to be permanently available for deployment , only about 1,200 troops ( with no transport ) could now be mustered , says one military pundit . More useful might be Jean Chretien's squadrons of F-18 fighter jets and a small special - forces unit . 
  The United States has long complained that Jean Chretien spends too little on defence ( just 1.2 % of GDP , half the average figure for Jean Chretien's NATO partners ) . Jean Chretien's is now expanding the 59,000- strong armed forces . He has promised to go "" every step of the way "" with the United States in its "" war "" on terrorism . That may mean taking some tough decisions he has so far ducked , such as whether to back Mr Bush 's missile - defence plan , as well as a "" perimeter wall "" .",20,Canada,A29-148,IN TERM,True,Mr Chretien 's government,29,True

 CANADA has been under fire for its slow reaction to the events of September 11th, and its tepid response to the American call to arms. When 300 politicians from NATO countries met in Ottawa on October 6th, a British member of parliament named it as one of the ""passenger countries"" in NATO. Within 24 hours, the prime minister, Jean Chretien, announced that six warships, surveillance aircraft and 2,000 servicemen were on their way, including a counter-terrorism unit, which is expected to operate on the ground alongside American and British troops.
 Yet the critics have had a point. Although ordinary Canadians in huge numbers gathered on Parliament Hill to grieve for the victims of the atrocities of September 11th, and have deluged the American embassy with flowers, Mr Chretien called no full cabinet meeting to discuss the crisis until October 10th, and was slow to visit the ruins in New York. Canada was behind the United States ""every step of the way"", he had said. Just how far behind, some newspaper columnists began to wonder?
 His caution was typical of Mr Chretien, now in his third term. He usually waits to gauge the public mood before acting, and has often shown himself wary of the American steamroller. Nor was he alone: his former foreign minister, Lloyd Axworthy, who resigned a year ago, argued in the press on September 17th that ""only if there is a bona fide international mandate and a clear, culpable target, should Canada join in any military action."" It took the dossier on Osama bin Laden's network to persuade the prime minister to act.
 Step up--and it may not be the highest he will go--John Manley, the current foreign minister. Till now he had been seen as a colourless, bookish tax lawyer, excited --as industry minister--only by things like fibre optics and space technology. But with incisive and relatively hawkish comment he filled a void left by the prudent Mr Chretien and the defence minister, Art Eggleton, once (and more impressively) the mayor of Toronto. Already head of a cabinet anti- terrorism committee, Mr Manley spoke publicly on October 4th of Canada's ""glaring inadequacy"" in spending on defence and intelligence- gathering.
 He has felt confident enough to answer the repeated American call for a perimeter wall of harmonised immigration and refugee regulations around North America with the remark that he finds such talk simplistic. Fine, he said, let's solve the security problems of border controls, which have slowed trade. But talk of a perimeter wall was code for continental integration.
 How far will all this lead? George Robertson, NATO's secretary- general, called Canada a stalwart ally after its pledge of ships and aircraft--and then asked for still more Canadian troops, to peacekeep in the Balkans in place of American troops who may be sent farther east. As for Mr Manley, who can tell? Next summer Canada is due to play host to the G8 summit--an arena in which Mr Chretien's heir- apparent, the finance minister, Paul Martin, is accustomed to shine. But Mr Manley had his own angle on the G8 too: ""You can't just sit at the G8 table and then, when the bill comes, go to the washroom."" At 51 a dozen years younger than Mr Martin, he is now seen as a credible contender for the leadership.

 WHEN George Bush declared war on terrorism in September, Canada's prime minister, Jean Chretien, responded that his country would ""go all the way"" with its neighbour and closest economic partner. But as Canada's Liberal government scurries to beef up security, not all of its citizens are happy. A clutch of anti-terrorism measures are close to approval by Parliament. But critics claim that they tip the balance too far towards public security at the cost of civil rights.
 Two of the clauses in an omnibus anti-terrorism bill are particularly controversial. One allows police to make preventive arrests when they suspect someone of planning terrorist acts. Another requires suspects to testify before a judge, even if they have not been charged with a crime. The critics won one concession from the government: it amended the bill so that these powers would remain in force for five years only. A Senate committee had recommended that the whole bill should be subject to this ""sunset"" clause.
 There has also been grumbling that the bill does not appoint a parliamentary officer to monitor public-security legislation (such officers watch over language policy, privacy and freedom of information). The strongest complaint came from the information commissioner, John Reid, who is a former Liberal MP. He says that provisions in the bill that allow the government to suppress ""information of national importance"", both in court and under freedom- of-information procedures, are a crippling blow to his office.
 Even so, the Senate is expected to complete approval of the bill before Christmas. It is reinforced by other stern measures, partly taken in preparation for next summer's G8 summit, due to be held at Kananaskis, a remote resort in the Rockies. One gives diplomatic immunity to foreign delegates attending such meetings. When combined with a provision in the omnibus anti-terrorism bill, this means that any protesters who harmed these dignitaries could be charged with terrorism. A second gives ministers the power to designate ""military security zones"". This measure is designed to protect nuclear plants and ships. But as Art Eggleton, the defence minister, explained, it could be used to seal off a wide area around Kananaskis.
 At the same time, Canadian and American officials are stepping up security along what has traditionally beeen the world's longest undefended border. On December 3rd, Canadian ministers met John Ashcroft, the United States' attorney-general, at the Detroit- Windsor border crossing to sign several security agreeements.
 Under these, 600 American national guardsmen will patrol crossings in a dozen states. They are there ""to facilitate the border, not to fortify it"", said Mr Ashcroft. But American officials have made plain their suspicion that Canada's lengthy appeal procedure for refugee claimants offers terrorists a haven. The two countries will deploy joint teams to try to intercept illegal immigrants, and they plan to harmonise visa requirements. Most of the refugees reaching Canada come through ""safe"" countries--usually the United States. The agreement would allow Canada to return those it suspects to that ""safe"" country.
 The big incentive for Canada in such measures is to reduce the long delays for security checks encountered by trucks heading south. With 85% of exports going to the United States, these crossings are Canada's lifelines--to be kept flowing even at the cost of some other freedoms.","  New security measures are aimed at reassuring the neighbours

 BRITAIN'S Gordon Brown is not the only finance minister of whom it is said that prudence is his middle name. Paul Martin, his long- serving Canadian counterpart, has presided over the transformation of the federal government's finances during the past eight years, turning a budget deficit of 9.2% of GDP in 1992-93 into a string of surpluses. But now Canada is following the United States into recession. So Canadians were looking to the budget on December 10th to see whether Mr Martin could square an economic stimulus with his familiar fiscal discipline.
 He just about pulled it off. Mr Martin announced extra spending of C$7.7 billion ($4.9 billion) over the next five years on various anti- terrorist measures, including stepped-up surveillance at the border with the United States. Mr Martin is also sticking to planned increases in spending on health care and big tax cuts, both announced on the eve of the general election in November 2000.
 The tax cuts mean that corporate income tax will fall within two years to 30%--less than that in some American states. They take effect from January 1st. Together with cuts in provincial taxes, in all the fiscal changes will inject an extra 3.3% of GDP this year and 4% next, according to Jim Peterson, Mr Martin's deputy. That is roughly double the strength of George Bush's much-vaunted (and much- delayed) stimulus in the United States. In addition, the Bank of Canada has cut interest rates by 3.5 percentage points this year.
 So has Mr Martin thrown prudence to the winds? He claims that the budget will be in balance this year and next (compared with a surplus of C$17.1 billion last year). This assumes that the economy recovers by the end of next year (most private-sector forecasts put growth in 2002 at around 1.2%). ""We're not going back to the old ways of profligacy,"" says Mr Peterson.
 Even so, Mr Martin is skating on thinner ice. He is dipping into the government's contingency fund. Critics say that he has left little margin for error. But if his stimulus turns out to be well- judged, he will have strengthened his claims to take over from Jean Chretien as prime minister. It has not gone unnoticed that the biggest cut in the budget was in a plan to install broadband Internet in rural areas, championed by Brian Tobin, the industry minister and a rival of Mr Martin's for the top job. It would all sound familiar to Mr Brown."," Prudence gets its reward

  Germany 's two main conservative parties picked Edmund Stoiber , premier of Bavaria and leader of the Christian Social Union , as their candidate to become Germany 's chancellor after a general election later this year . The leader of the much larger Christian Democratic Union , Angela Merkel , had withdrawn her bid for the candidacy . 
  France 's main business organisation , Medef , demanded cuts in taxes and social charges , and the easing of labour laws . The Constitutional Council had already ruled against parts of a recent law that would bar lay - offs through redundancy except in extreme circumstances . 
  In Cyprus the leaders of the Greek - Cypriot and Turkish - Cypriot communities opened face - to - face negotiations . Outsiders hope that the talks will lead to a deal bringing the breakaway "" Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus "" back into the fold as part of anisland united , however loosely , under a single central government . 
  Russia 's president , Vladimir Putin , visited Poland , the first leader of his country to do so since 1993 . 
  Norway 's finance minister , Per - Kristian Foss , revealed that he had formalised his long - term gay partnership under Norwegian law . 
  Will Britain and Spain agree to joint sovereignty over Gibraltar ? Some British MPs erupted over press reports that the deal was done already . Not so , said the British government , po - faced . 
  Pat Cox , an Irish liberal , was elected as president of the European Parliament . 
  War averted ? 
  Tension between India and Pakistan eased after the Pakistani president , General Pervez Musharraf , ordered a crackdown on militants blamed for a recent attack on the Indian Parliament . 
  The World Bank said that rebuilding Afghanistan will cost $ 15 billion . As the central bank reopened in Kabul , the governor said he had more money in his wallet than was in the bank 's safe . 
  Afghanistan 's interim government banned cultivation of the opium poppy and trafficking in its derivatives , including heroin . Afghan farmers have started to sow the poppy since the defeat of the Taliban , who imposed a similar ban . 
  East Timor is to set up a truth and reconciliation commission as a "" healing process "" like the one in South Africa that probed apartheid- era crimes . 
  Business 
  The Enron scandal hit Washington , with links between Kenneth Lay , Enron 's chairman , and George Bush and other Texas Republicans coming under scrutiny . Andersen , Enron 's auditor , admitted that thousands of documents relating to the audit had been destroyed , some after an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission had begun . An inside letter came to light warning Mr Lay in August that Enron could "" implode in a wave of accounting scandals "" . And some reports suggested that Andersen knew of Enron 's troubles as long ago as last February . 
  KPMG also suffered severe censure at the hands of the SEC . The "" big five "" auditor had invested funds with Short - Term Investments Trust , an investment firm that it also audited . KPMG pleaded that it had made the investment through a third party . 
  J.P. Morgan Chase announced a fourth - quarter loss of $ 332 m , compared with a profit of $ 708 m a year earlier . Much of the loss was due to Enron and Argentina . The bank earlier revised estimates for its total exposure to Enron from $ 900 m to $ 2.6 billion . 
  Not for sale 
  Investors reacted angrily on discovering that Rhodia , a French chemicals company , had rejected an offer , with a hefty premium , from DSM , a Dutch rival . Rhodia has struggled in a consolidating industry but its management rebuffed the offer , perhaps as it would have lost influence . 
  Three rivals made a successful joint bid of euro2.5 billion ( $ 2.2 billion ) for Rodamco North America , America 's third - largest shopping- mall company . Australia 's Westfield Holding ( which has a 24 % stake in the company ) , America 's Simon Property Group , the country 's largest mall owner , and Rouse will divide up Rodamco 's 35 malls . 
  Car trouble 
  Ford announced a fourth - quarter loss of $ 5.1 billion , bringing losses for the year to $ 5.5 billion . The loss included a $ 4.1 billion charge for a restructuring that will include capacity cuts , plant closures and the loss of 35,000 jobs . 
  General Motors said that profits for the fourth quarter were down by 58 % to $ 225 m from a year earlier . A faltering economy and an interest - free financing deal slashed profits at its mainstay North American vehicles business . 
  General Electric , the world 's biggest company by stockmarket capitalisation , reported a 9 % rise in profits for the fourth quarter , to $ 3.9 billion . 
  The online auctioneer , eBay , made record profits in the fourth quarter . Operating profits jumped by 56 % over a year ago , to $ 42 m. 
  AMR , the parent company of American Airlines , reported losses for the fourth quarter of $ 798 m. The economy and the after - effects of September 11th contributed to the record loss . 
  Kmart suffered the indignity of a "" junk "" debt rating from Moody 's and relegation from the S&P 500 index after its shares slumped and bankruptcy loomed . America 's second - biggest discount retailer has failed to do better after its latest restructuring and suffered a dismal Christmas . Its shares hit a 36 - year low . 
  The World Trade Organisation ruled in favour of the EU and ordered America to repeal a system of tax breaks for its exporters . However , Europe 's right to retaliate with sanctions equal to the $ 4 billion hidden subsidy will be tempered by reluctance to start a full- blooded trade war . 
  Succession planning ? 
  A possible successor to Sandy Weill at Citigroup emerged . Robert Willumstad assumed the newly created post of president . But Mr Weill , chairman and chief executive of the financial - services giant , may have acted to keep investors happy by seeming to anoint a crown prince while keeping his options open ; he may stay put for many more years . 
  Deutsche Bank is preparing a big shake - up that would shift away from its consensus - based management board and instead give its prospective chairman , Josef Ackermann , power akin to an American chief executive when he takes over in May. 
  The chairman , chief executive and a senior manager at Societe Generale became the latest bankers to be questioned by French police looking into money - laundering allegations . A wider probe by the French authorities has lasted three years and involved many of the country 's leading banks . 
  Prices down 
  America 's consumer - price index fell by 0.2 % in December to 1.6 % for the year as energy costs dived . The diminishing fear of inflation may make it easier for the Federal Reserve to consider cutting interest rates yet again at its next meeting at the end of the month .",20,Canada,A29-148,IN TERM,True,"Jean Chretien , Canada 's long- serving prime minister ,",5,True

 ""I WENT for a walk in the snow last night--and I'm staying."" So said Jean Chretien on January 15th, varying the phrase with which Pierre Trudeau announced his sudden resignation as Canada's prime minister in 1984 during a big snowstorm. In the case of Mr Chretien, Canada's longest-serving Liberal leader since Mr Trudeau, the upshot of the wintry soul-wrestling was a wholesale reshaping of his government, involving some 30 ministerial changes. It looked like an effort to try to arrange the future, at the start of what is probably Mr Chretien's final year at the top.
 Mr Chretien's big surprise was the catapulting of John Manley, after just 15 months as foreign minister, to a beefed-up post of deputy prime minister. Not only did Mr Chretien say that he wanted to pass on some day-to-day duties to his new deputy (allowing more time to ""reflect"" on ""big decisions""). But Mr Manley will continue to be in charge of improving border security, a joint effort with the United States after September 11th. Indeed, his vigorous handling of this issue seems to have earned his present promotion. He will also supervise a string of federal agencies, such as the post office and a land-disposal programme, removed from other ministers' care. Finally, he takes over political relations with Ontario, a job which carries influence over the province's 103 Liberal constituency organisations, each of which will send delegates to a party leadership convention.
 If Mr Manley performs well in his new job, he stands a good chance of displacing Paul Martin, the long-serving finance minister, as Mr Chretien's heir-apparent. An Ottawa-born lawyer, Mr Manley (who at 52 is a dozen years younger than Mr Martin) impressed businessmen when as industry minister he led a drive to promote high-technology businesses. Thought a surprising choice for foreign minister, he plunged into improving relations with the United States which had frayed under his predecessor, Lloyd Axworthy. However, Mr Manley was careful not to endorse George Bush's missile-defence plans.
 For his new foreign minister, Mr Chretien has gone outside the cabinet, appointing Bill Graham, the chairman of the House of Commons foreign-affairs committee for seven years and a professor of international law in Toronto. Not since Lester Pearson in 1948 has Canada had a foreign minister as well prepared for the post as Mr Graham. Just as well, perhaps, since Canada will host the G8 summit in June.
 Other changes at the top of the government were caused by the abrupt resignation of Brian Tobin, the industry minister. A successful former premier of Newfoundland, Mr Tobin, too, had leadership ambitions, having been enticed back into federal politics only 15 months ago by Mr Chretien. His job, which offers scope for popular spending initiatives, has gone to Allan Rock, another leadership hopeful from the Liberal left. As a reward for helping to steer tough security laws through parliament, Anne McLellan, the justice minister, has been given Mr Rock's old post of health minister. Ms McLellan, an MP in Alberta, takes over at a tricky time, as Ralph Klein, the conservative premier of that province is challenging the federal government by trying to nudge Alberta's health system towards American lines. Elsewhere, Mr Chretien has weeded out several mediocre or questioned ministers.
 So, having rewarded some leadership contenders and dashed the hopes of others, when might Mr Chretien retire? He said he would review the issue next Christmas. The Liberal party's constitution requires it to hold a leadership vote at its next convention in February 2003. That is nearly halfway through the current parliament. Were Mr Chretien to choose to bow out then, that would give his successor time to work himself into the job before the next election, something Mr Trudeau failed to do. And is Mr Manley now the chosen successor? The prime minister, who has the power to appoint senators, the chief justice and even the governor-general, correctly replied this week that it was for his party to make the choice.

 IT HAS always had much to live down. Winnipeg started life as a fur-trading post, and has never really found a new role. Many Canadians call it Winterpeg: between December and March, the average temperature in Manitoba's capital is about minus 16 degrees C (3 degrees F). The summer brings not relief, but floods and swarms of mosquitoes. Not surprisingly, Winnipeg's population is barely growing. But it has some fiercely loyal sons--and none more so than Canada's most powerful media mogul, Izzy Asper.
 Mr Asper controls the country's most profitable television network and a chain of more than 100 newspapers across the country, which he bought 18 months ago from Conrad Black. But he has resisted moving the headquarters of his company, CanWest Global Communications, to Toronto, Canada's media capital. The company remains in Winnipeg, 2,100km (1,300 miles) to the west. As a result, Mr Asper has brought jobs to the city, as well as being a generous donor to local causes.
 But there is a more controversial aspect to Mr Asper's devotion to making Winnipeg great again. All of his family's papers, from British Columbia to Newfoundland, are now obliged to print company editorials, on national and international issues, written in Winnipeg. No subsequent deviation from the line they set is allowed in the local papers, which include the market leaders in most of Canada's big cities.
 This has provoked howls of protest, and not just because the papers concerned were used to substantial editorial independence before the Aspers took control. Canada is a country of several distinct regions. But ownership of its media is now highly concentrated. And nobody has as much control over what Canadians read and watch as the Aspers.
 Mr Asper has strong opinions. He is a former leader of the Liberal Party in Manitoba, and a friend both of Jean Chretien, Canada's prime minister, and of Israel. Journalists fear that there is now no room for dissenting views: one columnist has been fired, another suspended and several stories killed because they expressed points of view the Aspers disagreed with.
 Mr Asper's son, David, who introduced the standard editorials, calls the critics ""professional whiners"" and ""bleeding hearts"". He has invited journalists who are unhappy to start their own papers. He has gone on to use his papers' editorial pages to call for CBC, the main public-service broadcaster and CanWest's chief competitor, to be reduced to a public-information channel. His father has called for the broadcasting regulator to cease to vet commercial television stations for their compliance with rules on Canadian content.
 Underlying this campaign is an intense antagonism to what David Asper has called the ""media cabal"" of Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal. For decades, western Canada has felt shunned and short-changed by ""the east"". Winnipeg may sit on the geographical dividing line, but the Aspers know which side of it they are on. The deep-rooted western sense of resentment and indignation has at last found a loud, national voice.

 SUCH is the political dominance of prime minister Jean Chretien and his federal Liberal party, that some Canadians mutter, only half- jokingly that their country is becoming a one-party state. So Stephen Harper, chosen on March 20th as the new leader of the Canadian Alliance, the battered official opposition, faces an uphill task. Three days later, in Ontario, the Progressive Conservatives are due to choose a new leader who will automatically become premier of Canada's most populous province. Between them, the two new leaders will hold many of the keys to the future of the country's fractured right.
 Mr Harper's election offers a fresh start to the Alliance, which has struggled since its foundation two years ago. He won by an unexpectedly wide margin, with 55% of the vote against 37% for Stockwell Day, the Alliance's outgoing leader. This decisive result should put an end to a debilitating leadership squabble.
 Mr Harper, like Mr Day, is from Alberta (in fact, all four candidates were from Canada's most Americanised province, a sign perhaps of the Alliance's failure to spread its cause). He is best known for co-authoring an essay arguing that the province should erect a ""firewall"" between itself and the federal government, by measures such as setting up its own police force and pension plan. Still only 43, he is an articulate campaigner, a fiscal conservative free of Mr Day's born-again Christianity.
 The Alliance represents an effort to broaden the political base of the western Reform party by wooing eastern Progressive Conservatives.Under Mr Day, it struggled. When Mr Chretien called a snap election in October 2000, Mr Day increased the party's votes, but won only two seats in Ontario, home to one Canadian in three. He stumbled against Mr Chretien in the House of Commons, and then faced a revolt by 12 of his 66 MPs.
 Mr Harper inherits a party whose membership has fallen by more than half since the last election. Its long-term future depends on unity with the Progressive Conservatives. Mr Harper has ruled that out while Joe Clark, a former prime minister, remains the Conservative leader.
 Another powerful figure on the right, Mike Harris, Ontario's premier since 1995, is bowing out this month. Mr Harris achieved national prominence with his ""common sense revolution"", a Canadian version of Thatcherism. Only three of the five candidates to succeed him stand a chance. The one most likely to appeal to floating voters is Elizabeth Witmer, who pushed through labour and health reforms under Mr Harris, but now promises a more compassionate government. Unlike Ms Witmer, Jim Flaherty, the finance minister, would continue Mr Harris's tax cuts; he wants to cut spending further, abolish several ministries, and eliminate fraudulent claims for health care.
 But the front-runner is Ernie Eves, Mr Flaherty's predecessor as finance minister, who implemented the tax and spending cuts before becoming a banker last year. As the best-known contender, for his campaign he has adopted the motto of a Olympic luge contestant: ""lie flat, go fast and try not to die"". He has said that he would review a controversial system of school funding that gives funds to parents.
 Whoever wins faces a tough provincial election in 2004. Mr Eves, the best placed of the three hopefuls, trails Dalton McGuinty, the Ontario Liberal leader, by 14 percentage points. Mr Harris, a former golf professional, may have chosen the right moment to retire to the clubhouse.

 THE first results of the May 2001 census, just published in Canada, have sparked a lively debate. Much to the consternation of the Liberal government of Jean Chretien, the country does not seem to be growing fast enough. Canada's population, now 30m, has risen only 4% since the last census, in May 1996. For the first time in many years, the population of the United States grew faster (by 5.4% over the same period), and Mexico's twice as fast. And for the first time since 1945, most of Canada's growth came from immigration.
 This is now a heavily urban country, with 80% of Canadians living in towns of more than 10,000 people. (In 1956, the figure was 56%.) The Calgary/Edmonton corridor in Alberta, where the population has grown by 12.3% since 1996, now houses more people than the four Atlantic provinces put together.
 Most of this particular growth stems from eastern Canadians heading west. Newcomers to Canada overwhelmingly prefer the three big cities, Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. More than half the immigrants who came to Canada after 1996 settled in Ontario, and two- thirds of those went to Toronto, where 40% of residents are now foreign-born. In 2000 the largest percentage of immigrants, 16%, came from China.
 Canada, like all developed countries, is also ageing fast. Today only one in eight Canadians is over 65, but that number will double by 2035 and the costs of pensions and health care will soar, to be paid for mainly by a smaller proportion of people still working. A recent report by the Institute for Research on Public Policy, however, suggests that Canada should not worry about this. The working population will be better educated, better paid and pay more taxes, while many of the elderly will work longer and will have salted away retirement savings under tax deferment. From the point of view of public finances, the report claims that ""Canada is probably the best equipped among industrial countries"" to deal with an ageing population.
 Yet older people mean a falling birth-rate, and this contributes to Canada's failure to keep up with its neighbours. The immediate response of both Mr Chretien and Denis Coderre, the immigration minister, is that the country needs more immigrants. Some 227,000 arrived last year, but since 1993 the Liberals have set an annual immigrant target of 1% of the population. Politics is the spur here, since immigrants tend to vote for the federal party that admitted them, and the Liberals have held power for most of the past century.
 The Commons immigration committee recommended last month that asylum-seekers who are approved as refugees should receive permanent resident status within 60 days, which could mean skipping full security screening. To some, that smacks of panic. Critics argue that Canada's population will not decline for another quarter- century, even if net immigration drops to 80,000 a year.
 James Bissett, who headed the immigration service in the 1980s, criticises MPs who want to broaden the family-reunification class of immigrants. Families, who have made up almost 80% of the inflow in recent years, do not need any qualifications beyond relationship to a sponsor. As a result, according to a recent university study, more than half the immigrants arriving since the 1980s have been living below the poverty line, lacking the skills to get decent jobs. Increasingly, Canada's cities can provide neither cheap housing nor public transport for the poor immigrants they already have. Do they really want more?","  Want to live in Canada ?

  Canada , like all developed countries , is also ageing fast . Today only one in eight Canadians is over 65 , but that number will double by 2035 and the costs of pensions and health care will soar , to be paid for mainly by a smaller proportion of people still working . A recent report by the Institute for Research on Public Policy , however , suggests that Canada should not worry about this . The working population will be better educated , better paid and pay more taxes , while many of the elderly will work longer and will have salted away retirement savings under tax deferment . From the point of view of public finances , the report claims that "" Canada is probably the best equipped among industrial countries "" to deal with an ageing population . 
  Yet older people mean a falling birth - rate , and this contributes to Canada 's failure to keep up with its neighbours . The immediate response of both Jean Chretien and Denis Coderre , the immigration minister , is that the country needs more immigrants . Some 227,000 arrived last year , but since 1993 the Liberals have set an annual immigrant target of 1 % of the population . Politics is the spur here , since immigrants tend to vote for the federal party that admitted them , and the Liberals have held power for most of the past century . 
  The Commons immigration committee recommended last month that asylum - seekers who are approved as refugees should receive permanent resident status within 60 days , which could mean skipping full security screening . To some , that smacks of panic . Critics argue that Canada 's population will not decline for another quarter- century , even if net immigration drops to 80,000 a year . 
  James Bissett , who headed the immigration service in the 1980s , criticises MPs who want to broaden the family - reunification class of immigrants . Families , who have made up almost 80 % of the inflow in recent years , do not need any qualifications beyond relationship to a sponsor . As a result , according to a recent university study , more than half the immigrants arriving since the 1980s have been living below the poverty line , lacking the skills to get decent jobs . Increasingly , Canada 's cities can provide neither cheap housing nor public transport for the poor immigrants they already have . Do they really want more ?",20,Canada,A29-148,IN TERM,True,Jean Chretien,2,True

 A week before a planned meeting in Moscow between George Bush and Vladimir Putin,
 NATO
 and Russia agreed to form a new council to work jointly on terrorism, arms control and international crisis management, although the 19 NATO countries and Russia will all be free to go their own way if they cannot agree. Russia and the United States also agreed to reduce their strategic nuclear arsenals by two- thirds by the end of 2012.
 The White House admitted that last August the CIA warned Mr Bush that al-Qaeda was plotting to hijack aircraft. The disclosure comes shortly before a congressional inquiry into America's troubled intelligence service.
 The Senate emasculated George Bush's attempt to get fast-track trade authority by excluding any changes to America's own trade rules. Mr Bush made a miserable week for free trade worse by signing into law a farm bill under which as much as $190 billion could be spent on supporting American farmers over the next ten years.
 Jimmy Carter, a former American president, caused a stir on a visit to Cuba. In a speech broadcast live on television, he criticised restrictions on opponents of Fidel Castro's regime and spoke approvingly of a petition organised by dissidents that seeks to change the constitution to allow free speech and free elections.
 The woes of the Catholic church in America intensified. Cardinal Bernard Law admitted that he had transferred a paedophile priest to other parishes, despite knowing of his sins. A Catholic priest in Baltimore was shot and seriously wounded by a man who had previously accused him of sexual abuse.
 The ruling Liberal party lost two safe seats in by-elections in Canada, increasing speculation that Jean Chretien, the prime minister, might announce his retirement before the end of the year.
 The Dutch swing right
 Voters in the Netherlands ended eight years of Labour-led centre- left domination by giving the centre-right Christian Democrats most seats in parliament, ahead of the anti-immigration Pim Fortuyn List named after its leader, who was assassinated last week. A right- wing coalition government including Fortuyn's followers seems likely.
 Angry Portuguese took to the streets in protest against a decision by their new centre-right prime minister, Jose Manuel Durao Barroso, to revise the current budget by cutting public spending and raising VAT, in order to ensure that Portugal does not flout the deficit ceiling of 3% imposed by the euro-zone's stability pact.
 Opinion pollsters say that France's re-elected president, Jacques Chirac, and his alliance of the mainstream right, gained ground after the president stalked out of a football stadium when the Marseillaise, France's national anthem, was booed by supporters of a Corsican team.
 Strikes for a better pay deal by workers in Germany's biggest industrial trade union, IG Metall, ended with a settlement promising workers 4% extra this year and another 3.1% in June 2003.
 Ireland's incumbent prime minister, Bertie Ahern, and his right- wing Fianna Fail party, were tipped to win a general election on May 17th, perhaps coming close to winning an outright majority of seats.
 Kofi Annan, the UN's secretary-general, paid a visit to the divided island of Cyprus in an attempt to break the deadlock in talks between the leaders of the Greek and Turkish communities.
 Tension in Kashmir
 Tension rose between India and Pakistan after more than 30 people were killed in an attack on an army camp near Jammu in Indian- administered Kashmir. Many of the dead were the wives and children of soldiers. India said that a Pakistani militant group carried out the attack and that it would respond. Pakistan condemned the attack.

 An election in Sierra Leone was held with a high turnout and without bloodshed, raising hopes that this war-ravaged country in West Africa may finally be on the mend. The incumbent, Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, was expected to win the presidency.
 In neighbouring Liberia, rebels calling themselves Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy attacked close to the capital in a bid to oust President Charles Taylor.

 JEAN CHRETIEN, Canada's prime minister since November 1993, is fond of teasing ambitious colleagues and inquisitive journalists about his retirement. The closest he has come to stating his intentions was when he said last year that he wanted to remain in office long enough to celebrate the 40th anniversary of his entry to the House of Commons as a 29-year-old member of Parliament in April 1963. But he has since dropped hints that he might like to lead the Liberals into a fourth election, presumably in 2004.
 Skilled survivor though he is, can Mr Chretien control his own destiny? The loss of two safe Liberal seats in by-elections on May 13th will increase the pressure on the prime minister to go sooner. The Liberals expected to hold six of the seven seats at stake. But the Progressive Conservatives scored a surprise victory in a Newfoundland seat, and the leftish New Democrats won an industrial constituency in Windsor, across the border from Detroit. Both had been held with large majorities for three decades by popular Liberal veterans whom Mr Chretien had dropped from his cabinet. The Liberals were not helped by criticisms by the auditor-general, and others, of the government's use of advertising firms in Quebec friendly to the party. Mr Chretien argued that the government's extravagant sponsorship of festivals and almanacs had reduced support for separatism in the province. Ridiculous, said Quebeckers.
 In fact, the pressure for Mr Chretien to retire has been mounting for months. The Liberals are divided into several camps. By appointing John Manley, a former foreign minister, as his deputy in January, the prime minister seemed to make him his heir. But both men face a powerful rival in Paul Martin, the finance minister, whose supporters control many, perhaps most, of the 301 constituency Liberal associations. These will send delegates to a party convention due next February, when a vote on the party leadership is obligatory.
 Mr Chretien has gathered together a team to rally support in the leadership vote. And he seems to be campaigning already. Stealing some of his finance minister's sunshine, he made an unscripted announcement that the government plans to pay off up to C$10 billion ($6.4 billion) of the national debt this year. And last month he replaced Mel Cappe, the cabinet secretary, who as Canada's top civil servant had just announced a big shake-up of the bureaucracy. Mr Chretien's surprise choice for the job, Alex Himelfarb, is an expert on social policy who may give the government new life. The appointment seemed aimed at those who say Mr Chretien has run out of policies, and simply stays because he likes the job. Mr Martin, who was defeated by Mr Chretien for the leadership in 1990, is the chief architect of Canada's economic steadiness--and of its seemingly quick recovery this year from a feared recession that never quite happened. His supporters hope that the prime minister will announce in December that he indeed plans to step down next April, clearing the way for their man.
 The by-elections may have made that more likely. Mr Chretien would bequeath a commanding majority in the House of Commons, where the opposition is divided four ways. On the other hand, Mr Chretien, who loves a scrap, may be girding himself for battle with Stephen Harper, the newly elected leader of the Canadian Alliance, who entered Parliament through one of this week's by-elections. Mr Harper would be the eighth opposition leader the prime minister has faced. Mr Chretien teases Canada yet.

 THE Liberal Party has governed Canada for the past 8 years, indeed most of the past 100. Today, it looks ready to tear itself apart, even if only temporarily, over the rivalry between Jean Chretien, prime minister since 1993, and Paul Martin, who has been his finance minister all those years--and reckons it is now time he had the top job. After months of crossfire, Mr Martin on June 2nd lost his post.
 Did he jump, or was he pushed? The two men disagree. Mr Martin admits he was ""at the edge of the Rubicon"", supposedly over policy differences with the prime minister--which is odd, since Mr Chretien is often criticised for having no distinct policy--but claims he was still considering his options when he heard on the radio that he had been replaced by John Manley, the deputy prime minister. Mr Chretien says Mr Martin ""quit"".
 Whatever the detail, Mr Martin had at least climbed out on the window-ledge. But Mr Chretien, having lost a popular and effective finance minister, now faces a party in deep disarray and near- revolt. The stage is set for civil war over the months up to the party convention next February, when delegates from its 301 constituency associations will vote on the leadership.
 The skirmishing has already begun. Mr Chretien faced a broadside on June 3rd, when he gave Parliament his version of the break. His brief tribute to Mr Martin's good work brought a lengthy standing ovation for the former finance minister. A caucus meeting on June 5th left Liberal MPs bitterly divided, with some demanding that Mr Chretien stand down now.
 The two men's rivalry goes back to 1990, when Mr Chretien returned from a short spell in law practice to take over leadership of the Liberals, by then in opposition. Mr Martin, a successful businessman and first-term MP, came a strong second in that leadership vote. When the Liberals won the 1993 election, Mr Chretien gave him the finance portfolio, and the pair worked in apparent harmony to end the era of budget deficits and, through tax reforms and astute management, to put the economy on a sound basis. This helped the Liberals to win again in 1997 and 2000.
 But as Mr Chretien, who was 68 in January, kept hinting he might want to stay in office for yet a fourth election, his heir- apparent, who is little more than four years younger, grew impatient. Mr Martin's father had come second to Lester Pearson in the leadership stakes a generation before, and the younger man has clearly wanted to redress history by winning the top job. He has worked tirelessly to that end.
 In recent months the infighting had come to the surface. Martin supporters control most of the constituency associations, and have successfully resisted rules that would allow massive recruitment by Chretien loyalists or other would-be leaders to challenge that control. Lately, a number of scandals relating to government and other contracts have rocked the cabinet. Mr Chretien had to pack one public- works minister off to Denmark as ambassador, and then demote his successor for taking a holiday in a contractor's lakeside home. On May 26th he dismissed his defence minister, Art Eggleton, when a newspaper revealed that the minister had secured a C$36,000 ($23,500) contract for a former girlfriend to write a 14-page report.
 Rightly or wrongly Mr Chretien suspected that Mr Martin's friends had been leaking tales of such scandals to the media, and denounced him in a heated cabinet meeting on May 30th as a ""destabilising influence"". He also ordered all would-be successors--who, besides Mr Martin, include Mr Manley and the industry minister, Allan Rock--to stop their thinly veiled leadership campaigns. Mr Martin responded by saying publicly that he would have to review his options. Mr Chretien duly pushed him out, saying he would relish a fight at next February's convention.
 On thin ice
 Reaction in newspapers that normally support Mr Chretien's government has been hostile: columnists have used phrases like ""dead man walking"" to describe him. His popularity, which began to dip after the Liberals lost two by-elections in mid-May, is slipping. One poll says 68% of voters want him to quit. Mr Martin is notably more popular in Quebec--Mr Chretien's home province--and in the west, besides being well entrenched in Ontario, most important of the provinces.
 Mr Chretien need not worry about a cabinet revolt and may use the power of fear to quell dissidents in his 170-strong caucus. Nor, with such a majority, need he be anxious about a no-confidence vote in Parliament. But Mr Martin is remaining as a backbencher, and everyone assumes he will be organising for the leadership vote in February. On the way, there will be scattered struggles through the autumn to win or retain control of Liberal constituency associations and thus of the selection of delegates to the party convention.
 Mr Chretien meanwhile will have other preoccupations, such as chairing the G8 summit this month and running the country. In contrast, Mr Martin, buoyed up by public esteem for his success in his past post, will be free to travel and canvass local associations, advancing policies of his own--a new financial deal for cities will probably be one--calculated to win him the post he hopes for in future.
 The Martin legacy
 Success? Canada's economy had a lacklustre 2001, did it not? True, but look at the statistics released two days before Mr Martin lost his job: growth at an annual rate of 6% in the first quarter of this year. This week the Bank of Canada felt it must respond by raising its target for the overnight interest rate from 2.25% to 2.5%, the second rise in seven weeks. Then look at the doubts about recovery south of the border.
 The growth owes something to recent--and reversible--rises in energy prices: Canada is a net oil and gas exporter, in notable contrast to its neighbour; indeed, thanks to a new offshore field, Newfoundland, poorest of the ten provinces, is expected to lead them all in growth this year. Overall, the balance of payments is well in the black.
 Longer-term too, Canada has been fortunate. A free-trade pact with the United States in 1988, followed in 1993 by the North American Free Trade Agreement (which includes Mexico), put pressure on many businesses to become more efficient. ""We've become much more export-intensive,"" says Aron Gampel, deputy chief economist at the Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto. A weak currency also helped. And Canada escaped some of the telecoms and dotcom excesses that marked the American economy in the later 1990s.
 Yet Canadians also owe a good deal to their former finance minister. When Mr Martin took over in 1993, the federal deficit was almost 6% of GDP; for the past five years the budget has been in surplus, and still is, despite tax cuts. Under Mr Martin, the national debt shrank from two-thirds of GDP to about half.
 Yet voters' memories and gratitude are fickle. Canadian cities, especially Toronto, remain in the grip of a feverish housing boom: permits for new homes were 68% higher in April than a year earlier. New car and truck sales were 10% higher in May. Households still have much less debt than do American ones. If Mr Manley, who has promised to stick to his predecessor's priorities--balanced budgets, reduced debt, low inflation, tax cuts and ""key investments""--can ensure calm, steady growth, will it be Mr Martin who gets the thanks?
 To achieve steady growth may not be easy. Business is confident: its spending on plant and equipment was healthily up in the first quarter. But, though many Canadians may be tempted to believe otherwise, their economy cannot prosper for long without vigorous growth in the giant to the south. The United States buys 85% of Canada's exports, and Americans are by far the biggest foreign investors.
 The converse risk is overheating and a crash stop. The central bank, fearful that spare capacity is dwindling, raising the risk of inflation, has made plain that it will hike rates yet again if the economy goes on galloping ahead. Economists would not be surprised to see the overnight rate at 5% by mid-2003--and maybe higher still, if the Liberal leadership battle encourages Mr Chretien and Mr Manley to undo Mr Martin's good work by trying to spend their way to popularity.","  Jean Chretien , and Jean Chretien's ( now ex- ) finance minister , right , have dominated Canadian government for most of ten years .

JOE CLARK was once briefly Canada's prime minister, and later and more impressively its foreign minister. More recently, he has led his Progressive Conservative Party in a fight for survival. But the party won just 13 seats in the House of Commons at the last election in 2000, and Mr Clark could not turn it into a credible alternative to the dominant Liberals of the prime minister, Jean Chretien. With his party's poll ratings stuck at just 14%, on August 6th Mr Clark told the party to elect a new leader early next year, saying he had taken it as far as he could.
Mr Clark's problem was that conservative voters are divided between his party, whose support is mainly in the east, and another, stronger, outfit, the Canadian Alliance, which is dominant in the west. His hopes rose last year when he attracted a handful of disaffected Alliance MPs to join him in a loose parliamentary coalition. But in April the rebels bolted back when a new Alliance leader, Stephen Harper, threatened them with expulsion. 
Will Mr Clark's decision to depart help long-standing efforts to unite the right? Mr Harper immediately challenged the Conservatives to consider a merger and a joint leadership convention. He had earlier offered to negotiate joint slates of candidates for the next election. But some Tory MPs cling to the memory of past glory as a national party, and dismiss the Alliance as a regional force. Other Conservative leaders do not: Mike Harris, who resigned last year as Ontario's premier, is said to be keen to lead a united right-wing party.
The right is not alone in seeking new leaders. Alexa McDonough, the leader of the small, leftish, New Democrats, announced in June that she would stand down after seven years. And the Liberals are embroiled in an increasingly open and hard-fought leadership battle in which Mr Chretien is being challenged by Paul Martin, his long-serving finance minister whom he sacked in June. Mr Martin looks to have the edge. His supporters are strong in local constituency organisations, and are likely to be in a majority at a party convention in February where the leadership could be decided. The prime minister's loyalists retort that their man has won three election majorities. But his tide may finally be ebbing.

Repairs in Germany, the worst hit, may cost euro15 billion ($15 billion).
A report commissioned by Germany's government and chaired by a Volkswagen director, Peter Hartz, proposed labour-market reforms that included ways to create more temporary and part-time jobs and to make it harder to get the dole. Chancellor Gerhard Schroder endorsed the report's suggestions. Pre-election grandstanding and panic measures, declared the conservative opposition.
Five members of a previously unknown Iraqi opposition group seized the Iraqi embassy in Berlin, calling for Saddam Hussein's overthrow. German commandos removed them without bloodshed after five hours. 
A lethal week in Russia: at least 115 Russian soldiers were killed when a military helicopter was shot down in the disaffected Russian republic of Chechnya; a gas explosion killed at least eight people in a block of flats in Moscow; and a member of the Duma, Vladimir Golovlev, was shot dead by assailants unknown. 
After one of Britain's biggest police searches, the bodies of two ten-year-old girls missing for 17 days from their homes in Soham, Cambridgeshire, were discovered in a nearby wood. A local school caretaker was charged with their murder; his partner faced charges related to the killing.

Two controversial members of the House of Representatives lost their primary races in Georgia. Bob Barr, a critic of gun control, lost to another right-wing Republican. One black Democrat, Cynthia McKinney, a supporter of Arab causes, was beaten by another, Denise Majette, who attracted support from Jews around the country.
President George Bush summoned senior security advisers to a meeting in Texas. The White House insisted it was to discuss the transformation of the Defence Department, not an attack on Iraq. At a press conference, he said he was a patient man who would look at all options and consult widely before deciding how to change the regime in Iraq.
Two critical reports examining the way the New York fire and police departments acted on September 11th were released. They prompted pledges from the emergency services to improve their command procedures and communication.

TRUE to form, Jean Chretien kept his Liberal party guessing right to the end. He had just made a tough speech to a party conclave, defending his leadership, setting out new policies, and taking barely veiled shots at Paul Martin, his chief rival, whom he fired as finance minister in June. But on August 21st, with the headlines in that morning's papers proclaiming ""He'll stay and fight"", Canada's prime minister of the past nine years suddenly announced that he would step down in February 2004.
Sudden it may have been, but not unexpected. Mr Chretien's grip on power has been in question since his split with Mr Martin, who had refused to shut down his increasingly open campaign for the Liberal leadership. As a result, Mr Chretien was likely to face, and to lose, a leadership vote at a party convention due next February. In an ill-advised move last week, his people asked all 170 Liberal MPs to sign a loyalty letter. Only 94 did so.
Mr Chretien said that he hoped that his announcement would ""end the fighting"". Though for months he has teased questioners about his intentions, he revealed that he and his wife had agreed two years ago that he would not fight a fourth election, and had quietly bought property in Ottawa. By February 2004, Mr Chretien will be 70, and will have completed 40 years as an MP and ten consecutive years as prime minister--parliamentary milestones which he cherishes. He said he would also have implemented new policies to cut poverty, reform health care, and rebuild urban infrastructure. But a new leader would still have time to make a mark before the next election. This does not have to occur before November 2005.
Far from ending the fighting, Mr Chretien has made a clever attempt to control it. Despite Mr Martin's great popularity with Liberals, and across the country, Mr Chretien seems determined to try to deny him the top job. By delaying his departure for so long, and by avoiding a straight fight with Mr Martin, he has tipped the odds against his former finance minister. Mr Martin will be 64 next week, and will be easily the oldest contender. 
Mr Chretien's apparent favourite is John Manley, his new finance minister, who will be just 54 when the prime minister steps down. Mr Chretien said pointedly this week that ""it will take possibly two budgets of Mr Manley"" to set the legislative framework for the new policies. By then, perhaps, Mr Martin's earlier successes in ending budget deficits will have been forgotten. Other contenders are also comparatively young. Sheila Copps, the heritage minister, will be only 51, and Allan Rock, the industry minister, 56.
Over the next 18 months, these younger cabinet hopefuls will have a chance to shine, while Mr Martin remains a backbencher in the shadows. But Mr Chretien, a consummate political fighter, has lost his penultimate battle. By being forced to reveal his plans so early, he has consigned himself to a lengthy twilight in which to hobble around as a lame duck.","Jean Chretien unveils Jean Chretien's retirement plans , at last

IN THE old days, Canada was usually swift to join military alliances against aggressors. But the government of Jean Chretien has been notably reluctant to make any public promise to join an attack on Iraq. George Bush's assertion that other countries must be either with or against America in its war on terrorism puts Canada on the spot. How could the superpower's neighbour and biggest trading partner be against? But, where Iraq is concerned, Mr Chretien and his ministers have been arguing for military action only after seeking a fresh mandate from the UN. 
This was the line Mr Chretien took when the two men met briefly in Detroit (significantly, a hub of cross-border trade) on September 9th. His deputy prime minister, John Manley, went further on September 20th when he said that Canada was unlikely to offer any ""additional"" military support without UN authorisation. When the foreign-affairs minister, Bill Graham, met Naji Sabri, his Iraqi counterpart, at the UN last week, he said that Canada wholeheartedly supported a tough UN resolution calling for unfettered access by inspectors to all weapons sites; but he has since refused to say whether Canada would support an American-led attack that went ahead without a specific Security Council mandate.
To some extent this wariness reflects Canada's familiar instinct not to want to seem just an extension of the United States. But it is also a reaction to the hesitation shown in opinion polls. Just before the Bush-Chretien meeting, one poll said that 60% of Canadians thought their country had already given the United States enough support in its war on terrorism. Other surveys suggest that, although a majority of Canadians favour a joint military command structure in North America and support (marginally) a ground invasion of Iraq to change its regime, they doubt Mr Bush's reasons for changing it. Nearly 70% of Canadians also believe that the United States bore some responsibility for the September 11th attacks because of its Middle East policies.
For all that, Canadian forces are likely to be drawn indirectly into any conflict with Iraq, whether or not the Security Council sanctions it. Two Canadian frigates, a destroyer and maritime patrol aircraft are attached to the American aircraft-carrier groups in the Arabian Sea, and B-2 bombers starting from their Missouri base would need to fly through Canadian skies to attack Iraq. These commitments date from the Afghan campaign, and will not be withdrawn. Canada, however, does not want to repeat the experience of Afghanistan, where a Canadian battalion under American command spent futile weeks combing the mountains and in April an American plane mistakenly bombed Canadian troops, killing four of them. 
So the Canadians are looking to Hans Blix, the head of the UN Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission, who is trying to field an inspection team in Iraq by mid-October. The problem is timing. Ron Cleminson, the Canadian commissioner with the UN inspection body, estimates that it will take up to ten months for inspectors to prepare a definitive report, even with, cross your fingers, full Iraqi co-operation. But the United States may not want to wait that long. Mr Graham foresees an American strike against Iraq in February's cool weather if Saddam's regime is not by then complying with the UN.","Why Jean Chretien ca n't make up Jean Chretien's mind

Iraq said it would let UN inspectors return under rules set out by the Security Council in 1998. Not good enough, said America and Britain. They want a tougher new resolution including the automatic right to use force (rather than having another Security Council debate) if Iraq failed to make an honest accounting of its weapons of mass destruction. 
In Washington the House of Representatives gave President George Bush the right to use force against Iraq as he thinks ""necessary and appropriate"". The Democrat-led Senate was expected to agree, with some minor changes of wording.
The Democrats' control of the Senate wobbled when Senator Robert Torricelli abandoned his New Jersey seat after accusations of illegally accepting money and other gifts. Frank Lautenberg was picked to replace him in next month's election; but the Republicans pledged to fight the change as far as the Supreme Court.
William Bratton, the effective head of New York's police force, was picked to take charge of the beleaguered force in Los Angeles.

Friendly noises came from the State Department's Colin Powell. However, a long-time Washington hawk, and now Pentagon adviser, Richard Perle, said the best remedy would be for Mr Schroder--who won his election last month--to resign.
New forecasts for Germany's 2002 budget deficit, already seen as perilously near the EU's would-be limit of 3% of GDP, suggest it will be well beyond the limit. Ditto for 2003. 
France's government, still maintaining its widely disbelieved forecast of 2.5% growth for 2003, made plain it would not yield to pressure from the European Commission for early action to bring down its near-the-limit budget deficit.
The premier of Spain's Basque region outlined ideas for independence to the regional parliament and a referendum once the region is at peace. The ETA gunmen who prevent that were unimpressed; Spain's prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar, called the ideas those of a ""fanatic"".
Brazil goes left
Opinion polls showed Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the left-wing Workers' Party not far short of outright victory in Sunday's presidential election in Brazil. But they suggested he might face a run-off, perhaps against Jose Serra, the government candidate. Brazil's currency and bonds recovered somewhat as investors appeared resigned to a Lula-led government.

Palestinian leaders condemned an American spending bill, signed by George Bush, decreeing that no money could be spent on official documents mentioning Israel unless they also identified Jerusalem as its capital.

Abdoulaye Wade, Senegal's president, promised an investigation after a ferry disaster that claimed nearly 1,000 lives last week. The Joola, an army-operated ship licensed to carry 550 passengers, took on twice as many and overturned. Senegal's transport and army ministers both resigned.
Nigeria's president, Olusegun Obasanjo, promised that appeal courts would overturn all sentences of death by stoning passed on adulterers by Islamic courts in northern Nigeria. Given the separation of executive and judiciary, he probably has no authority to make such a promise.

WINTER rarely comes this early to the balmier bits of Canada, but a chill has already settled over the country's health services. On October 1st, doctors in Newfoundland shut their surgeries, refusing to treat all but emergencies, hospital in-patients and expectant mothers. In Saskatchewan, 2,500 pharmacists, paramedics and ancillary workers have entered the third week of a walkout. In Quebec, meanwhile, general practitioners are fuming at a new provincial law which requires them to provide services at far-flung, understaffed emergency rooms on top of their normal work.
Canadians are both proud of, and chronically anxious about, their health system, known as Medicare. As enshrined in the Canada Health Act it aspires to combine the public spirit and universal coverage of Britain's creaking National Health Service with the quality of America's high-tech medicine. It does this through delicate balances between public and private funding, and provincial and federal power. ""Medically necessary"" hospital treatment and doctor services are publicly financed, making up 71% of Canada's C$95.1 billion ($64.3 billion) spending on health care in 2000. But other medical goods and services, such as drugs dispensed outside hospitals, are not always covered. Since their cost is rising, there are calls for a national publicly-funded insurance scheme for these expenses.
But the politics of health are complex. Each province has its own definition of ""medical need"". It is the provinces, too, that organise and provide health care, raising revenues to pay for it through local taxes, and disbursing money to providers according to local fee scales. The federal government chips in with payments aimed at ensuring that spending per head on health is the same in rich provinces, such as Alberta, as in poor ones like Newfoundland. 
To conservative critics, this is a straitjacket that stifles innovation. Alberta, for example, is experimenting with private for-profit provision of publicly-funded services. On October 1st, Action Democratique du Quebec, a rising force in that province's politics, called for greater private involvement in providing and paying for health services, to increase choice. But these are still minority views. Most Canadians would agree with Adrienne Clarkson, the governor general, when she calls Medicare ""a practical expression of the values that define us as a country"". Translation: in health care, Canadians do not want to copy the United States. 
But paying for health has risen to the top of Canada's political agenda. In both Newfoundland and Saskatchewan, the strikers complain that their wages are lower than those in neighbouring provinces, leading to staff shortages. The provinces blame the federal government in Ottawa. Last week, Canada's 13 provincial premiers began an advertising campaign to publicise their complaint that the federal share of health spending has fallen by almost three-quarters over the past 20 years, to 14% of the total (30% says Ottawa). 
Traditionally, the federal government has used its financial leverage to cajole the provinces to apply the principles of the Canada Health Act. ""But if the federal government wants to carry a big stick,"" says Michael Decter, of the Canadian Institute for Health Information, ""it is going to have to write a big cheque as well."" 
Recently, Jean Chretien, the prime minister, has opened the cheque book. Two years ago, on the eve of an election and with the federal finances in good health, he promised to pour an extra C$21 billion into Medicare by 2005. With the provinces chipping in more too, the freeze in health spending of the 1990s has been reversed. Even so, in a speech opening the new session of parliament this week, Mr Chretien promised there would be yet more money for health in the next budget.
So far, much of the new money has gone into wage settlements for health workers. Despite this, Canada still lags behind many other industrialised countries in health-care spending per head (see chart on previous page), with fewer doctors, nurses and fancy bits of equipment. The result: doctors are stressed, and patients fed up at having to wait weeks for specialist consultations, high-tech scans or elective surgery such as hip replacements. 
Once in the system, however, patients seem satisfied with their treatment. According to the first-ever national survey, published on September 30th, almost 85% of Canadians rated their health services as very good or excellent. On some clinical measures, such as deaths from colorectal cancer, Canada scores far better than bigger spenders such as Germany.
Spend, then reform
Still, more money will do little to ease staff grievances unless management and working practices are reformed, argues Steven Lewis of Access Consulting, a policy consultancy in Saskatoon. Others point out that one cause of staff shortages is the decision taken a decade ago to cut places for training doctors and nurses, based on flawed projections of future demand. This could be made good by delaying retirement and licensing more foreign doctors (many now work as taxi drivers in Montreal or janitors in Toronto). Or the politicians could challenge the doctors to accept more efficient practices, such as better use of nurses. Quebec might come up with more creative ways of getting doctors to its rural areas than its current method of sending bailiffs to force them to go.
Faced with this icefield of vested interests, Mr Chretien last year deftly shunted the issue of reform to a commission on the future of health care led by Roy Romanow, a former premier of Saskatchewan. Mr Romanow says that his report, due in November, will offer policy prescriptions (complete with cost estimates and timetables for implementation), not just on such matters as how to deal with waiting lists, but on the underlying political options facing Canadians. These include how to balance demands for more consumer choice through health-care privatisation with calls for greater social equity through public financing, and how to reconcile national standards with local needs. 
Mr Chretien has said he will convene a premiers' meeting early next year, to discuss the Romanow proposals. But Canadians should not hold their breath. ""Health care is Canada's third rail, the one politicians hate to touch,"" Gary Mar, Alberta's health minister, says. A little shock therapy might be just what the doctor ordered.","Despite extra funding , one of the world 's best health - care systems is showing signs of wear and tear

TO MOST Canadians, the signs of climate change are all too obvious. Two decades of above-average temperatures have left prairie farmers counting crop losses from droughts. In the Arctic region, melting sea-ice and permafrost portend an altered life for northerners--and bring new anxieties over national security as new sea-lanes open up. A rise in summertime smog has brought an increase of asthma among children. This summer, when families escaped to their cabins beside lakes and rivers, they again found water levels far below childhood memories.
So Canada, it might seem, has every reason to back measures to halt global warming. Yet the Liberal government of Jean Chretien, the prime minister, is struggling to win agreement among provincial premiers and even its own MPs to ratify the Kyoto Protocol on climate change by the end of the year, as he pledged to do at the Johannesburg summit in September.
Canada's decision is being closely watched. Although it produces only 2% of world emissions of carbon dioxide, its previous scepticism about Kyoto has provided some cover for the Bush administration's opposition to the protocol. But the issue splits Canadian politicians. 
For more than two years, the federal energy and environment ministers have been talking with provincial counterparts about how to reduce emissions to meet the Kyoto target (of 6% below 1990 levels). Since little concerted action has resulted, Canada now faces the task of achieving a 20% reduction by 2012. On October 24th the federal government finally produced a draft plan for how to do so. It leans heavily on industry, but also challenges every consumer (of transport, heating and much else) to save one tonne in five. 
The plan was widely criticised for being unclear about the costs of emissions reduction. This week it was shot down when federal and provincial ministers held a special meeting on the issue, in Halifax, Nova Scotia's capital.
The opposition is led by Ralph Klein, the conservative premier of Alberta, Canada's main oil producer. He argues that Kyoto is a costly fiasco, and that the federal plan will land disproportionately on Alberta. Complying with it would jeopardise investment in the province's huge oilsands, at a cost of thousands of jobs.
Other provinces, such as Manitoba and Quebec, disapprove of Mr Klein's rollicking campaign. Manitoba uses much ethanol. Quebec relies on hydro power and, says Bernard Landry, its premier, has cleaned up its pulp and aluminium industries. Both provinces are in compliance with the Kyoto targets, and argue that they should not face further cuts. 
But in Halifax these ""green"" provinces lined up with the oil producers to demand a revision of the federal plan--and a meeting of provincial premiers with Mr Chretien--before Parliament debates the accord. Constitutionally, the provinces control natural resources and will have to implement most of the regulations. 
Time-wasting ""paralysis by analysis"" complained David Anderson, the federal environment minister. But he said he will consult with the provinces, and come up with a revised plan at another meeting on November 21st. Mr Chretien ruled out a premiers' meeting. Even so, this leaves only three weeks for parliamentary debate before the Christmas recess. Neither side has played its hand adroitly. Opponents of Kyoto have woken up late. On the other hand, the federal cabinet, hampered by divided views, has failed to mobilise ordinary Canadians, many of whom are natural greens, on the issue.

AROUND 300,000 people live in Kitchener-Waterloo, a fast-growing city bustling with insurance companies and IT firms. The city's central hospitals reflect this growth, with new facilities springing up for cancer and cardiac care. But hospital administrators have many worries: tight budgets, too few doctors, rising drug costs, and long waiting times for elective treatment and sophisticated diagnostic tests.
Such concerns are heard across the country. Canada's health-care system is not yet at breaking point like Britain's National Health Service, nor does it have America's runaway medical inflation and millions of uninsured. But Canadians worry that their taxation-based, ""single payer"" system will not be able to deliver good care for all who need it in future.
This week, politicians were busy mulling over ""Building on Values: The Future of Canada's Health Care System"", the final analysis and recommendations of Roy Romanow, Canada's one-man health-care commission, who was appointed by the prime minister last year. Roughly C$15m ($10m) later, Mr Romanow has concluded that both the health of Canadians and their medical system compare favourably with other countries, but that more money, and considerable structural change, are required to make the most of changes in modern medicine and to level the playing field between Canada's richest and poorest provinces.
Although ""medically necessary"" hospital care and physician services are paid for by the state, more than a quarter of all health-care spending in Canada--for such things as out-patient prescription drugs and home care after hospital--comes from private pockets. Mr Romanow wants to change this, and has suggested bringing some forms of home care under the public umbrella. He also suggests the payment of a C$1 billion-a-year transfer to help Canadians pay for ""catastrophic"" drug expenses, as well as extra money to boost access to health care in rural areas, reform the delivery of primary care and improve the provision of fancy diagnostics such as MRI scanners (see chart). Mr Romanow recommends a more systematic approach to organising waiting lists, as well as the creation of a national Health Council to monitor the performance of the system and sort out the staffing problems.
All this, he reckons, will require a rise in federal funding from around C$8 billion today to roughly C$15 billion by 2006. This would raise the federal share of spending to 25% after years of decline, which left the hard-pressed and increasingly grumpy provincial governments to pick up the bill. But it is not clear how much the federal government will agree to provide.
The prime minister, Jean Chretien, has called a meeting of provincial premiers for January to thrash out what to do about the report. It is likely to be a noisy affair. Ontario, Alberta and Quebec are already unhappy. Conservative critics, such as Stephen Harper, the leader of the Canadian Alliance party, have lambasted the report for rejecting a greater role for private health care. Mr Romanow sees little benefit either in more private spending on medicine, or in private for-profit provision of care. 
Despite this, several provinces, notably Alberta, are already pushing ahead with for-profit diagnostic centres and clinics. Getting them to toe the Romanow line will not be easy. But as Raisa Deber, a health-policy expert at the University of Toronto, points out, the strongest selling-point of Mr Romanow's report is not his largely sensible proposals, but the fact that he spent 18 months listening to the views of ordinary Canadians. Politicians may not like what he has to say, but public pressure will ensure they listen closely.","Is Roy Romanow's report what Canada needs? 
AROUND 300,000 people live in Kitchener-Waterloo, a fast-growing city bustling with insurance companies and IT firms. The city's central hospitals reflect this growth, with new facilities springing up for cancer and cardiac care. But hospital administrators have many worries: tight budgets, too few doctors, rising drug costs, and long waiting times for elective treatment and sophisticated diagnostic tests.
Such concerns are heard across the country. Canada's health-care system is not yet at breaking point like Britain's National Health Service, nor does it have America's runaway medical inflation and millions of uninsured. But Canadians worry that their taxation-based, ""single payer"" system will not be able to deliver good care for all who need it in future.
This week, politicians were busy mulling over ""Building on Values: The Future of Canada's Health Care System"", the final analysis and recommendations of Roy Romanow, Canada's one-man health-care commission, who was appointed by the prime minister last year. Roughly C$15m ($10m) later, Mr Romanow has concluded that both the health of Canadians and their medical system compare favourably with other countries, but that more money, and considerable structural change, are required to make the most of changes in modern medicine and to level the playing field between Canada's richest and poorest provinces.
Although ""medically necessary"" hospital care and physician services are paid for by the state, more than a quarter of all health-care spending in Canada--for such things as out-patient prescription drugs and home care after hospital--comes from private pockets. Mr Romanow wants to change this, and has suggested bringing some forms of home care under the public umbrella. He also suggests the payment of a C$1 billion-a-year transfer to help Canadians pay for ""catastrophic"" drug expenses, as well as extra money to boost access to health care in rural areas, reform the delivery of primary care and improve the provision of fancy diagnostics such as MRI scanners (see chart). Mr Romanow recommends a more systematic approach to organising waiting lists, as well as the creation of a national Health Council to monitor the performance of the system and sort out the staffing problems.
All this, he reckons, will require a rise in federal funding from around C$8 billion today to roughly C$15 billion by 2006. This would raise the federal share of spending to 25% after years of decline, which left the hard-pressed and increasingly grumpy provincial governments to pick up the bill.

LAME ducks usually hobble off with little delay. Not Jean Chretien, Canada's prime minister of the past nine years. Back in August, he announced that he would retire--but not until February 2004, soon after his 70th birthday. Predictably enough, this self-indulgently long goodbye has landed Canada and its ruling Liberal Party with the embarrassment of a prime minister from whom power is steadily seeping away. 
Mr Chretien insists that he still has much to do, especially some ambitious social reforms. But there has been little evidence of any action on these in the current session of parliament, which rises for a lengthy Christmas recess on December 13th. Most commentators reckoned that the real reason for Mr Chretien's desire to linger so long was to lessen the chance that he would be succeeded by Paul Martin, his former finance minister and long-time rival. By 2004, Mr Martin will be 65, and, the logic went, would falter under the challenge of younger contenders.
The logic was faulty. Since August, almost nothing has gone right for the prime minister. First, against his wishes but with Mr Martin's encouragement, Liberal backbenchers voted for a provision that the chairs of parliamentary committees should be picked by secret ballot. Then, pressure from the opposition and the media obliged Mr Chretien to sack his top spin doctor, Franoise Ducros, after she called George Bush ""a moron"" in a private conversation that was reported by a journalist who overheard the remark. 
Most damaging of all has been a row over a new federal gun registry. On December 3rd, the auditor-general, Sheila Fraser, revealed that the cost of the registry, which contains 4m records, had risen from C$2m (net of fees) to perhaps C$1 billion ($640m). Part of the extra cost comes from the government's decision to lower fees (which it had hoped would raise C$120m) to encourage hunters and farmers to comply with the December 31st deadline for registration. But Ms Fraser slammed the government for spending C$400m on the registry's faulty computer system. Members of Parliament had been kept in the dark about the cost overrun. Fearing their anger, Mr Chretien withdrew a request for C$72m to finance an extension of the deadline for four months. 
The prime minister's lone recent success came on December 10th, when the House of Commons voted by 195 to 77 to ratify the Kyoto Protocol on climate change. On this issue, Mr Chretien had faced influential opposition from Ralph Klein, the premier of Alberta, who argued that Canada's businesses, and especially its oil and gas industry, will be hobbled with higher costs, while their American competitors will not. 
But Mr Chretien's victory over Kyoto will not erode the steady hardening of support for Mr Martin within the Liberal Party. Mr Martin deftly avoided upsetting either environmentalists or businessmen by saying that he strongly supported Kyoto but regretted the government's failure to win provincial backing for it.
Since June, when he was fired as finance minister, Mr Martin has been free to raise money and campaign, while his potential rivals are tied down by cabinet duties. His supporters control many Liberal constituency associations, which will help him at the party's leadership convention, set for November 2003. Mr Martin now has the apparent backing of Brian Tobin, once his most credible opponent. Allan Rock, the industry minister and another popular contender, has been winged by the scandal over the gun registry, which he launched when justice minister in 1995. With the leadership battle seemingly all over, and the government in disarray, no wonder many Canadians want Mr Chretien to go swiftly. But he probably won't.

THIEVES with stolen shotguns blasted their way into a lakeside cottage near Ottawa and killed two retired teachers. A Pakistani-born community leader was shot dead in the street as he returned to his suburban Vancouver house. A seven-year-old girl picked up a semi-automatic handgun in her home near Toronto and fired it point-blank at her little brother. 
These deaths by firearm have all occurred in the past few weeks. They seemed to justify a controversial federal firearms registry, launched in 1998 by the Liberal government of Jean Chretien, which has drawn fire from two directions. The auditor-general has slammed its huge cost, of perhaps C$1 billion ($650m) by 2005, up from an original estimate of just C$2m (net of registration fees). And many gun owners are resisting. Some 900,000 failed to meet the deadline of January 1st for registering their firearms. Groups of gun-toting protesters, including some Korean War veterans, immediately courted arrest by demonstrating in Alberta and Ottawa. 
Officials have reacted warily. The justice minister has extended the deadline to June for those who put their intention to register in writing. The ministry says that many owners who planned to register were obstructed by opponents (including the American gun lobby) who blocked phone lines and the registry website. 
But criticism of the scheme is mounting. Several provinces that issue hunting licences have called for its suspension. An Ontario police chief, originally in favour, now says the money would have been better spent on extra police.
The government says the expense is justified. It claims to have screened and licensed 2m owners (refusing around 7,000) and registered nearly 6m guns. Thefts of firearms have fallen by half since 1991, controls on arms-smuggling from the United States have been tightened, and the police make much use of the database system in their investigations. 
Despite the recent cases, gun crime has been falling steadily for a decade. There were 554 murders in Canada in 2001, or only a third as many per head as in the United States. Only 171 of these involved guns. Suicides account for four-fifths of the total gun deaths in Canada.
So was the registry really needed? Canada has long-standing laws restricting handguns and regulating the purchase of hunting rifles. After a deranged gunman slaughtered 14 women students at a Montreal university in 1989, tighter licensing rules were brought in. Critics point out that criminals tend to use smuggled, and therefore unregistered, guns anyway. But having spent so much on the registry, Canadians are stuck with it now.

WHEN it comes to worrying about health care, Canadians seem to have a touch of hypochondria. Compared with Britain's struggling national health service or the lavish American system that leaves out millions of uninsured, Canada performs well: it provides good-quality care for its citizens in reasonable time and at moderate cost. Even so, Canadians fret about a shortage of doctors, rising drug bills, and lengthy waits for non-emergency treatment and diagnostic tests. And they worry whether the system will continue to care for them in future.
Last year, this collective anxiety culminated in a raft of federal and provincial blueprints for reform. The most important was the Commission on the Future of Health Care in Canada, chaired by Roy Romanow, a leftish former premier of Saskatchewan. This week Canada's prime minister, Jean Chretien, met provincial leaders in Ottawa to try to agree on how to put Mr Romanow's ideas into practice.
Relations between the federal government and the provinces are never easy when it comes to health. Money is the main sticking point. Roughly 70% of the estimated total spending on health of C$112 billion ($71 billion) last year came from public coffers. Provincial premiers argue that the federal government should pay a bigger share of this bill. Until it does, they say, it is in no position to dictate how provinces spend their health-care dollars. 
But the federal government wants to dictate a bit. It would like to extend the scope of publicly-funded health care, and to reduce the disparity in provision across the country (see chart). Three years ago, armed with a promise of extra funds, Mr Chretien failed to persuade provincial leaders to co-operate. This week he tried again, with a new plan based on Mr Romanow's report--and truckloads of cash. 
This plan is called the ""health accord"". Published last month, it would extend the publicly-funded system to cover basic care at home and patients' drug bills when these are especially costly. At present, in some provinces consumers pay for these out of their own purses. The five-year federal plan would also provide money for more scanners and diagnostic services, and for improvements in primary care. A national advisory council would be created to track these changes. 
Before the Ottawa talks, the provinces called for almost C$50 billion in new federal grants for health and social services over the next five years. By the end of the decade, they want the federal share of health spending to rise to 25%, from 14% now (a figure which the federal government disputes). Some provinces, such as Quebec, are wary of any federal interference in health policy; others fear extra bureaucracy; and most want the extra cash to go into existing services rather than ""boutique"" programmes such as home care. 
The Ottawa meeting ended with the federal government paying to get most of its way. It will transfer an extra C$13.5 billion to the provinces over the next three years. It will also create a new Health Reform Fund, endowed with C$16 billion over five years, to pay for changes in primary care, home care and drug coverage. In addition, there will be an extra C$1.5 billion for diagnostic equipment. The premiers still had grumbles: some of the bounty was ""old money"". The three northern territories refused to sign the deal, claiming they had been neglected.
For all their differences, few federal or provincial politicians can afford to stand in the way of change, says Raisa Deber, a health-policy expert at the University of Toronto. Mr Romanow's proposals enjoy huge popular support, partly because his commission solicited views from thousands of Canadians. Moreover, several of the politicians involved face elections in the next 18 months--among them Ernie Eves of Ontario and Bernard Landry of Quebec, while the federal Liberals are due to choose a successor to Mr Chretien. 
Re-engineering medical systems, and dealing with disgruntled doctors and nurses, are painful for politicians. But doing nothing could prove fatal at the ballot box. As with most remedies, patience will be needed. ""We didn't get into this mess overnight,"" says Mr Romanow, ""And we won't solve it overnight either.""","A deal over who should pay for improving the health service

The most important was the Commission on the Future of Health Care in Canada , chaired by Roy Romanow , a leftish former premier of Saskatchewan . This week Jean Chretien's met provincial leaders in Ottawa to try to agree on how to put Mr Romanow 's ideas into practice . 
 Relations between the federal government and the provinces are never easy when it comes to health . Money is the main sticking point . Roughly 70 % of the estimated total spending on health of C$ 112 billion ( $ 71 billion ) last year came from public coffers . Provincial premiers argue that the federal government should pay a bigger share of this bill . Until it does , they say , it is in no position to dictate how provinces spend their health - care dollars . 
 But the federal government wants to dictate a bit . It would like to extend the scope of publicly - funded health care , and to reduce the disparity in provision across the country ( see chart ) . Three years ago , armed with a promise of extra funds , Jean Chretien failed to persuade provincial leaders to co - operate . This week Jean Chretien tried again , with a new plan based on Mr Romanow 's report -- and truckloads of cash . 
 This plan is called the "" health accord "" . Published last month , it would extend the publicly - funded system to cover basic care at home and patients ' drug bills when these are especially costly . At present , in some provinces consumers pay for these out of their own purses . The five - year federal plan would also provide money for more scanners and diagnostic services , and for improvements in primary care . A national advisory council would be created to track these changes . 
 Before the Ottawa talks , the provinces called for almost C$ 50 billion in new federal grants for health and social services over the next five years . By the end of the decade , they want the federal share of health spending to rise to 25 % , from 14 % now ( a figure which the federal government disputes ) . Some provinces , such as Quebec , are wary of any federal interference in health policy ; others fear extra bureaucracy ; and most want the extra cash to go into existing services rather than "" boutique "" programmes such as home care . 
 The Ottawa meeting ended with the federal government paying to get most of its way . It will transfer an extra C$ 13.5 billion to the provinces over the next three years . It will also create a new Health Reform Fund , endowed with C$ 16 billion over five years , to pay for changes in primary care , home care and drug coverage . In addition , there will be an extra C$ 1.5 billion for diagnostic equipment . The premiers still had grumbles : some of the bounty was "" old money "" . The three northern territories refused to sign the deal , claiming they had been neglected . 
 For all their differences , few federal or provincial politicians can afford to stand in the way of change , says Raisa Deber , a health - policy expert at the University of Toronto . Mr Romanow 's proposals enjoy huge popular support , partly because his commission solicited views from thousands of Canadians . Moreover , several of the politicians involved face elections in the next 18 months -- among them Ernie Eves of Ontario and Bernard Landry of Quebec , while the federal Liberals are due to choose a successor to Jean Chretien . 
 Re - engineering medical systems , and dealing with disgruntled doctors and nurses , are painful for politicians . But doing nothing could prove fatal at the ballot box . As with most remedies , patience will be needed . "" We did n't get into this mess overnight , "" says Mr Romanow , "" And we wo n't solve it overnight either .

THE war of words between bits of Europe and America, and of Europe with itself, has become so all-involving that farther-flung interested parties are often forgotten. Yet America has other allies in this debate who are struggling to decide what best to do. We consider the chief three, Australia, Canada and Japan: none of which, as it happens, has a seat on the UN Security Council.
So far, Australia is the only significant country, besides Britain, to have sent forces to the Gulf in support of a possible American attack. In a place so far away from Iraq, with a small defence force already stretched by regional commitments, the deployment has caused great controversy. A recent poll showed 60% of Australians opposed to sending their troops, with only 35% in favour; 76% were against Australian involvement in an attack on Iraq without United Nations approval; and a less-than-overwhelming 57% supported a strike sanctioned by a second resolution. 
This rebuff has shaken John Howard, the prime minister, who has backed George Bush and Tony Blair unquestioningly. Traditionally, Australians have tended to trust their leaders over when, and whether, to commit forces abroad. Australia has sent troops to back Britain and America in almost every conflict from the first world war to the 1991 Gulf war, mostly with public support. The Howard government announced the deployment of aircraft, ships and 2,000 troops to the Gulf in late January, when Australians were distracted by summer holidays and bushfires. Simon Crean, the Labor Party opposition leader, promptly told the departing troops they should not be going. 
But opposition to Mr Howard is coming equally from his own conservative Liberal Party. John Valder, a former party president, recently wrote to a Sydney newspaper suggesting that ""Washington needs a regime change as much as Baghdad."" Since then, Mr Valder says he has had an ""avalanche"" of conservative support, much of it ""quite ferocious"".
Mr Howard, usually one of Australia's most wily political operators, is now caught between his desire to bolster support for his government and his commitment to friendship with America, the cornerstone of Australia's foreign policy. His government, he says, has not yet made a decision to commit the deployed forces and could still withdraw them. Few believe him. On February 10th, during a visit to Washington that seemed to confirm Mr Howard, to his detractors, as a man marching to America's tune, Mr Bush made it even harder for him to back out when he said he regarded Australia as a member of the ""coalition of the willing"". Mr Howard is hoping desperately for a second Security Council resolution to save him. 
In Canada--America's biggest trading partner, but also a country viscerally unwilling to be seen as a mere adjunct to its neighbour--roughly the same divisions occur. An Ipsos-Reid poll of February 7th shows that only 28% of the public would support action against Iraq without a second UN resolution, while 67% would disapprove of it. On the other hand, 60% accept that Canada should provide military assistance if the UN sanctions action. 
The government of Jean Chretien, having long insisted that a second resolution was needed, now seems to be shifting to America's side in any event. Canadian forces are hovering already. Two frigates are patrolling the Gulf of Oman as a residual part of the Afghanistan operation, and two others are on their way to relieve them. A Canadian commodore has been put in charge of ""coalition"" naval forces in the Persian Gulf, and 25 senior Canadian officers have been installed to help the Americans in Qatar. Senior army officers are keen to send a 3,000-strong brigade under Canadian command, or Canada might sneak a compromise by sending more troops to Afghanistan, thus freeing American soldiers for Iraq. 
A decision to back America without a second resolution would probably split Mr Chretien's own Liberal majority. As a lame duck, who has already laid out the road-map to his retirement, he cannot hope to hold his troops in line, especially with the public so opposed to unilateral action. His likeliest successor, Paul Martin, has cleverly avoided committing himself. Nonetheless, Canada seems unlikely to do as it did in the Vietnam war, when it abstained from giving America a hand.
Compared with Canada and Australia, Japan has faced few tough questions over Iraq. Its pacifist constitution ensures that its military role in any intervention will be indirect and limited. (In the Gulf war, it did nothing.) Japan need not help America plan ahead for war. Given that, the prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, and his team have been surprisingly supportive of the United States. They would like a second resolution, but they also keep hinting that Iraq's actions warrant an American attack. 
Mr Koizumi will face harder choices, however, if and when the United States uses force. Should he help by sending ships? He might. After September 11th 2001, Japan's parliament passed laws that allowed several supply ships and escorts to go to the Indian Ocean to support, indirectly, the campaign in Afghanistan. It recently replaced one of those escorts with one of Japan's four Aegis-class destroyers, an even bolder move. 
Sending more ships to the Indian Ocean, technically as part of the Afghanistan effort (what might be called the Canadian option), would free American and other vessels for a military campaign in Iraq. It would also be a tangible endorsement of any American-led attack. Security experts in Tokyo reckon that Mr Koizumi could do this simply by getting the cabinet to rewrite the existing mission plan for Afghanistan, with no need for new legislation. A new law would meet stiff resistance, and probably could not be passed in time anyway.
How would the Japanese public take that? In a late-January poll by the Asahi Shimbun, a big daily, 62% said they opposed an American attack. But when asked what they would think if the Security Council approved, a majority--52%--said they would back the use of force.
North Korea's threat to go nuclear will also shape the debate. Those who oppose helping America will try to turn the tension to their advantage. Why pull more ships away from home when a greater menace lies just across the Sea of Japan? But precisely because of that fearsome neighbour, Mr Koizumi may find it easier to win public support for Japan's closest ally--and its only real line of defence.","Three friends of America try to get their act together

OVER the past two years, Canadians have discovered that they are not doomed to catch a cold every time their giant neighbour sneezes. While America has teetered on the edge of a double-dip recession, the Canadian economy has kept expanding. It grew by 1.5% in 2001 and 3.3% last year, the best performance among the G7 industrial countries. In contrast to America's spiralling budget shortfalls, Canada's current account as well as its budget remain in tidy surplus. The Bank of Canada raised interest rates three times last year; with inflation rising, it has hinted it may do so again. 
A true ""northern tiger"" is how John Manley, Canada's finance minister, described his country when he put his 2003-04 budget to Parliament in Ottawa on February 18th. Committing the Liberal government to its sixth balanced budget in a row, he insisted that ""we will maintain our capacity to control our own destiny"".
This may be easier said than done. Though many Canadians might wish it were otherwise, their dependence on their southern neighbour has grown rather than diminished over the past decade. America's share of Canada's exports has climbed from 73% to 85% since the two countries signed a free-trade agreement in 1988, reinforced six years later by the North American Free-Trade Agreement, which also includes Mexico.
The recent divergence between the two economies is partly explained by Canada's lower dependence on the battered telecoms and technology sectors. The terror attacks of September 2001, too, caused less nervousness among Canadian businesses and consumers than American ones. Meanwhile, the car industry, based mostly in Ontario, has seen record sales on both sides of the border. Alberta's oil and gas producers are basking in higher prices. And low interest rates have kept the housing market humming.
But recent data suggest that the weakening American economy is now starting to take its toll to the north. The motor industry has lost its shine, and housing starts fell 8.7% in January. Statistics Canada reported this week that factory orders have been sliding since last autumn; factory inventories have risen for five months in a row, the longest string of increases in almost three years.
Craig Wright, chief economist at the Royal Bank of Canada in Toronto, is still confident that the North American economy will take off once the uncertainty over Iraq is resolved, and that Canada's real growth rate will again exceed 3% this year. But even he acknowledges that ""the risks seem to be building on the downside"". JP Morgan, an investment bank, estimates that growth slowed to 2% in the fourth quarter of 2002 and only about 1.5% in the first three months of this year. 
In this week's budget, his first, Mr Manley wisely set aside C$4 billion ($2.6 billion) for unexpected contingencies and ""economic prudence"" in the year ahead. Yet his priorities are different from those of his predecessor, Paul Martin, whose first emphasis was to put a lid on government spending and then, more recently, to cut taxes. The centrepiece of Mr Manley's budget is an 11.5% jump in discretionary spending in the fiscal year to March 2004, the biggest increase in more than two decades. His budget speech was a cornucopia of handouts--for health care, child care, defence and parks, among others.
The switch in fiscal priorities has much to do with domestic and, especially, Liberal Party politics. This week's budget was not just Mr Manley's first, but also Jean Chretien's last. The prime minister plans to retire next February after more than 40 years in politics. The budget was one of his last chances to burnish his legacy.
In crafting their strategy, both Mr Manley and Mr Chretien have been looking over their shoulders at Mr Martin, who remains the clear front-runner for the top job. Mr Manley, a mild-mannered former tax lawyer who is also deputy prime minister, is pondering whether to join the leadership race. He needs to raise his profile and his popularity if he is to have any chance of catching Mr Martin. What better way than by handing out goodies to all and sundry on budget day?
Mr Chretien, who forgets neither his friends nor his enemies, seems to have hit on the budget as a device to tie his successor's hands. Many of the spending promises announced this week are three- and five-year programmes, with the bulk of the funds earmarked for the later years. The question now is whether Mr Martin, assuming he occupies the prime minister's seat on budget day 2004, will want to stick to the script that Mr Chretien has written for him--and whether he will want Mr Manley to read it.","First signs that Canada 's economy is n't doing quite so well

THE temperature in Winnipeg touched -27 degrees C this week. Not even that could freeze the biggest business transaction ever in the prairie city. Great-West Life, an insurance company based in Winnipeg, offered C$7.3 billion ($4.8 billion) for its rival, Canada Life. The deal will make Great-West Canada's largest insurer, pushing it past Sun Life of Canada.
Great-West's offer of C$44.50 a share trumped a C$40 bid from Manulife Financial, often regarded as the most aggressive company in Canadian insurance. Still, Dominic D'Alessandro, Manulife's chief executive, should make a profit of C$300m on the 9.1% stake that his firm had built up in Canada Life.
Consolidation among Canada's insurers has now gone about as far as it can. If there are to be more takeovers, insurers will have to look at targets in the United States, or at banks at home. Last year the federal government put a stop to a mooted merger between Manulife and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC), the country's second-biggest bank by assets. Mr D'Alessandro may now try again with one or other of Canada's top six banks.
Great-West's ultimate owners, the Desmarais family, are also thought to be interested in moving beyond insurance and into banking. The patriarch, Paul Desmarais, already controls Investors Group, the country's largest mutual-fund company, through his main vehicle, Power Financial Corporation, and through a series of holding companies.
In the past, mergers between insurers have proved far easier than those between banks. In 1998 the federal government turned down two bank mergers, one between Royal Bank of Canada and Bank of Montreal, and the other between Toronto-Dominion Bank and CIBC.
The government held hearings earlier this year on bank mergers, which politicians are still reluctant to allow. Voters moan about branch closures and possible increases in service charges. As things stand, however, Canadian bank charges are lower than those in the United States, and the unified Canadian clearing system is more efficient than America's.
Mergers between banks and insurers might be more acceptable to the politicians, and give the financial companies the scale they seek--even though the mixed experiences of European banking-and-insurance hybrids ought perhaps to give them pause for thought. And politically, as it happens, Mr Desmarais could scarcely be better connected. One of his sons is married to the daughter of Jean Chretien, the prime minister. And when Mr Chretien retires next year, his successor is likely to be Paul Martin, the finance minister who turned down those bank mergers five years ago--and a former vice-president at Power Financial Corporation.","An agreed takeover bid should create Canada 's biggest insurer

THEY share the world's longest undefended border and do more business together than any other two countries. Add the often jarring clash of politics, personalities and world events, and it is not surprising that relations between Canada and the United States are seldom simple. Even so, they look unusually strained at the moment. This is only partly because of disagreements about war in Iraq. And though some Canadians are happy to be unhappy with their big neighbour, others, including many businessmen, are not.
The discord is embodied in the barely-hidden mutual disdain between Canada's prime minister, Jean Chretien, and President George Bush. It shows up in public opinion, too. A recent survey by Ekos, a polling firm, found that 51% thought that Canada's relations with the United States had deteriorated over the past year. In another poll, only 40% of respondents in (mainly French-speaking) Quebec, the most anti-war province, held a generally favourable view of the United States, a drop of 20 percentage points compared with nine months ago.
Canadians' feelings towards their giant southern neighbour are inevitably complicated and ambivalent. Canada has long defined itself by its differences with the United States. Canadians like to contrast their European-style welfare state, especially their health system, with the devil-take-the-hindmost individualism of the United States. They lack Americans' scepticism towards government. No wonder: Canada was the bit of North America that stayed loyal to Britain when the United States broke away over two centuries ago.
Canada is thus the land of the Tories, the counter-revolutionaries who jibbed at the American Whigs' revolt. While the American Declaration of Independence celebrates ""life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness"", Canada's founding document promises ""peace, order and good government"". Little has changed: in the Ekos poll, only 8% of Canadians say they would like their country to become more like the United States, and 40% less so.
Even so, Canada has--along with Britain--traditionally been one of the United States' closest allies. The two countries have a joint defence command, and have fought many wars together; Vietnam was the main recent exception. But whereas one Canadian in three draws comfort from living next to the superpower, a similar number finds such proximity threatening. Suspicious of raw power, Canada has always been a strong supporter of multilateralism and the United Nations.
So it is not surprising that Iraq is causing much friction. Mr Chretien has called for the weapons inspectors to be given more time, wants all measures to be decided by the UN, and has been reluctant to commit forces to the Gulf. Some of his supporters have been more outspoken. Last month, Carolyn Parrish, a backbench MP from Mr Chretien's Liberal Party, said to reporters, when she thought the microphones were off, ""Damn Americans. I hate those bastards."" That earned her no official reprimand, merely applause when she later appeared on a television talk-show.
To some Americans, especially those on the extreme right, Mr Chretien's stand smacks of treachery. Pat Buchanan, a former presidential candidate, refers to Canada as ""Soviet Canuckistan"".
In part, the friction is personal. Mr Chretien's relations with Mr Bush were doomed before they began, since the prime minister openly cheered for Al Gore during the 2000 campaign. In return, Mr Bush has allowed himself some slights of his own. Flouting tradition, his first foreign excursion was not to Canada but to Mexico. He made no mention of Canada among the countries that helped out after September 11th, even though thousands of Americans had been given hospitality when planes had been diverted to Canadian airports. And he was slow to apologise after four Canadians had been accidentally killed by American bombing in Afghanistan last year. Mr Chretien has yet to be invited to visit Mr Bush's ranch. 
Petty stuff, perhaps. But little goodwill has been shown in bigger matters. Canada's trade with the United States amounts to almost $400 billion a year. Disputes are frequent, but most are kept within manageable limits. Not so one involving American duties on softwood lumber, which over the past nine months has cost thousands of jobs in Canada and increased housebuilding costs in the United States. Canada is confident that it has right--and the WTO--on its side. Mr Bush, many Canadians believe, could settle the affair with a telephone call if he chose to.
Since the two countries signed a free-trade agreement in 1988, Canada has prospered but its dependence on the United States, which takes 85% of its exports, has increased. Canadian business is alarmed at the deepening chill. Last week, two business lobby-groups urged Mr Chretien to muzzle America-bashing in his party. Otherwise, they fear, Americans may retaliate by blocking further integration. 
But will Mr Chretien take any notice? His instinct in almost a decade in power has often been to do the opposite of what Brian Mulroney did as Canada's Conservative prime minister from 1984 to 1993. Mr Mulroney was chums with Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush senior, and negotiated the free-trade agreement. He left politics with his popularity--and that of his party--barely in double digits; the Tories have yet to recover.
By contrast, Mr Chretien's Liberals still dominate the opinion polls, with more than twice the support of any other party. The conservative Canadian Alliance, the most pro-American force in Parliament and the most critical of the recent outbursts, is in the doldrums. 
Living in the cultural and political penumbra of the world's most powerful nation, Canadians always feel their identity is at risk. Now, maybe, they also feel ignored, or taken for granted. Perhaps Liberal prime ministers and Republican presidents just do not mix. One way or another, it can make for good politics in Canada not to cosy up too closely to the United States. But it was a sickly economy, rather than pro-Americanism, that brought down Mr Mulroney. The free-trade deal is now popular. Whatever their differences, Canadians know they have no choice but to get along with their only neighbour--and anyway, au fond, as they say in Quebec, much more unites them than separates them.","There is no love lost between Jean Chretien . Jean Chretien's ' relations are more complicated 
 Jean Chretien share the world 's longest undefended border and do more business together than any other two countries . Add the often jarring clash of politics , personalities and world events , and it is not surprising that relations between Jean Chretien are seldom simple . Even so , they look unusually strained at the moment . This is only partly because of disagreements about war in Iraq . And though some Canadians are happy to be unhappy with their big neighbour , others , including many businessmen , are not . 
 The discord is embodied in the barely - hidden mutual disdain between Canada 's prime minister , Jean Chretien , and President George Bush . It shows up in public opinion , too . A recent survey by Ekos , a polling firm , found that 51 % thought that Canada 's relations with the United States had deteriorated over the past year . In another poll , only 40 % of respondents in ( mainly French - speaking ) Quebec , the most anti - war province , held a generally favourable view of the United States , a drop of 20 percentage points compared with nine months ago . 
 Canadians ' feelings towards their giant southern neighbour are inevitably complicated and ambivalent . Canada has long defined itself by its differences with the United States . Canadians like to contrast their European - style welfare state , especially their health system , with the devil - take - the - hindmost individualism of the United States . They lack Americans ' scepticism towards government . No wonder : Canada was the bit of North America that stayed loyal to Britain when the United States broke away over two centuries ago . 
 Canada is thus the land of the Tories , the counter - revolutionaries who jibbed at the American Whigs ' revolt . While the American Declaration of Independence celebrates "" life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness "" , Canada 's founding document promises "" peace , order and good government "" . Little has changed : in the Ekos poll , only 8 % of Canadians say they would like their country to become more like the United States , and 40 % less so . 
 Even so , Canada has -- along with Britain -- traditionally been one of the United States ' closest allies . Jean Chretien have a joint defence command , and have fought many wars together ; Vietnam was the main recent exception . But whereas one Canadian in three draws comfort from living next to the superpower , a similar number finds such proximity threatening . Suspicious of raw power , Canada has always been a strong supporter of multilateralism and the United Nations .

SIX months must still pass before Canada's ruling Liberals, at their party convention in mid-November, get down to choosing a new leader. Nine months will drag by before Jean Chretien, who announced his retirement last August, at last hands over the standard. But the snail-slow changing of the guard has speeded up sharply with a series of televised debates between the three contenders. These debates are making painfully clear the strained relations between the two main candidates, Paul Martin and John Manley. 
Most Canadians believe that Mr Chretien planned his drawn-out disappearance deliberately to thwart Mr Martin, whom he had fired as finance minister last June and replaced with the younger Mr Manley. Mr Martin had made no secret of his impatience to be prime minister, considering that he had earned it by eliminating Canada's budget deficits and featuring large in the Liberals' victories in three successive elections. Mr Chretien appeared to hope his rival would fade into obscurity and become too old (he is 64) to win keen support. His father, Paul Martin senior, failed in three leadership bids, losing his last to the youthful Pierre Trudeau in 1968. 
Ironically, his dismissal allowed Mr Martin to make countrywide speaking tours and build up not only a formidable phalanx of delegates but also a massive campaign fund. Meanwhile, Mr Manley had the budget and border security to wrestle with, and he and other cabinet ministers were forbidden to raise funds for several months. He eventually declared his candidacy last month, and has the open support of a dozen MPs--besides that of Mitchell Sharp, a 92-year-old former finance minister who remains the prime minister's mentor.
As for Mr Martin, he opened his campaign officially, on May 6th, with more than 100 MPs--including 15 cabinet ministers-- crowded around him. He has toughened his criticism of the Chretien government, accusing it of drifting on important immediate issues: waiting lists in the health-care system, preventive action over SARS and clumsy handling of the United States in the war against Iraq. He has made a priority of healing relations with Washington, and has declared that Canada should not delay in joining the Nuclear Missile Defence (NMD) project. 
The televised debates have unleashed the fierce, or possibly desperate, side of Mr Manley, who is usually thought a bit dull. In both debates, he has challenged Mr Martin to disclose all political contributions he has gathered and the names of the contributors. When Mr Martin, who ran a big steamship line before entering politics, said he would follow party rules and disclose his list 30 days before the convention, his rival retorted that the delegates would have been chosen weeks before. On two occasions Mr Manley has accused Mr Martin of ""pandering to the United States""--a curious taunt, many think, since he himself is the minister who has dealt closely with American officials over continental security.
They are both, however, in favour of talking with Washington about partnership on missile defence, arguing that Canada is likely to be the ""debris zone"" for missiles and should be at the table to protect its sovereignty. The Liberal caucus is divided and has not settled on a position, despite lengthy discussions. It has been left to the third leadership contender, Sheila Copps, the heritage minister, to voice strong opposition to NMD in the debates. Yet Ms Copps is given little chance of winning. She has presented herself as a champion of the environment, gays, minorities and women, and has drawn ridicule for suggesting that the national anthem (""true patriot love in all thy sons command"") should be gender-neutral.
Mr Martin has won most applause in the debates. Indeed, he is seen so widely as the runaway winner that an editorial in the Globe and Mail on May 10th argued that Mr Chretien should leave in November instead of February. Its only reservation was that Mr Martin would then want to call an election in the depths of winter, which would hardly be popular with Canadians. An election would allow him to pick a new cabinet team: one in which, he has made it plain, there would be no guarantee of a post for either of his rivals.","For many , the Liberals ' leadership contest looks settled already

ONLY a few months ago, Canadian officials were crowing that their seemingly recession-proof economy was the best-performing in the G7, the rich world's top club. It still is. But its resilience is being sorely tested, and partly for some unexpected reasons. In the past two months Toronto, Canada's largest city, has been struck by the worst outbreak of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outside Asia. No sooner had this waned when on May 20th a cow on a farm in remote northern Alberta was diagnosed as suffering from bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad-cow disease. It is the first such case in Canada in a decade. But within hours the United States and four other countries had slapped a ban on imports of Canadian beef.
The impact was immediate. Many livestock auctions halted; shares of meat processors, fast-food chains and the two big Canadian railway companies all plummeted. Canada is the world's third-biggest beef exporter, after Australia and the United States. Beef is a C$4 billion ($3 billion) industry in Alberta, as synonymous with the province as oil and wheat. 
The economic damage inflicted by SARS had been no less swift. The Greater Toronto Hotel Association estimates that its members have lost C$125m in cancellations since March. Average hotel occupancy slumped to 47% in April, from 68% a year earlier. Several big conventions were cancelled. SARS also prompted a slump in restaurant and retail sales in Toronto.
But for all the headlines they generate, the damage that BSE and SARS cause to Canada's economy is likely to be relatively small. Important as cows are to Alberta's ranchers and slaughterhouses, Canada's annual beef exports amount to less than three weeks of shipments to the United States from its car and truck plants. The health of those car plants are a much bigger headache for the economy.
The Royal Bank of Canada, a Toronto-based bank, says that SARS will inflict no more than a ""temporary pinch"", perhaps shaving a quarter to a half percentage-point off the economy's growth in the second quarter. Dale Orr of Global Insights, an economics consultancy, has pared his growth forecast for this year from 3.4% to 2.6%, still the highest among the G7 economies. Rather than disease, the more sombre outlook reflects sputtering demand in the United States, which takes 85% of Canada's exports. Carlos Gomes, an economist at the Bank of Nova Scotia, another Toronto bank, expects that the car industry's output will shrink by 1-2% this year, after surging by 6% in 2002.
Another big drag on exports will be the Canadian dollar. The loonie (so named for the bird on the one-dollar coin) has soared from a record low of 62.1 American cents in January 2002 to over 74 cents this week, its highest level in six years. Behind that surge lies not just the greenback's weakness but a widening gap in interest rates. The Bank of Canada has raised its overnight rate five times in little over a year. The yield on ten-year government bonds has climbed to almost 5.2%, compared to 3.4% on similar American treasury bills.
The strong currency may boost productivity by making imported machinery and software cheaper. But exporters are squealing more loudly than importers are celebrating. Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters, a lobby group, complains that the loonie's jump threatens its members profit margins and will be ""a significant drag on economic and employment growth this year."" The Bank of Canada is now unlikely to raise interest rates again until the American economy shows more convincing signs of recovery.
The fallout from the health scares is likely to be political as much as economic. They are sure to expose regional jealousies. The Liberal government in Ottawa has swung into action to help Toronto. Jean Chretien, the prime minister, is just one of many politicians to invite the media to watch him wield chopsticks in a Chinese restaurant in the city in an effort to dispel public fears. A Liberal member of parliament has urged the government to cough up C$10m to sponsor a Rolling Stones concert in Toronto.
Just hours after the BSE case was confirmed, Lyle Vanclief, Canada's agriculture minister, tucked into a steak lunch in Edmonton. Mr Chretien did the same in Ottawa. Alberta, with just two Liberal MPs compared to 98 from Ontario, will be watching carefully to see whether it gets the same attention as Toronto. Ralph Klein, the province's feisty conservative premier, immediately suggested that Ottawa pay for the Rolling Stones to visit Calgary. There's no moss on Mr Klein.","The real threats to Canadian economic growth have little to do with BSE or SARS

JEAN CHRTIEN, Canada's soon-to-retire prime minister, delights in reminding Americans that his country is a different place. Now he has done so again. On May 27th his government unveiled a bill that would partially decriminalise marijuana. Instead of the current stiff penalties, possession of up to 15 grams (half an ounce) of the drug--enough, perhaps, for 50 joints--would be punishable with a fine, levied by ticket, of C$150 ($111) for an adult. 
The bill's aim is to concentrate resources against heavy drug use. But it is bound to cause friction with the United States. Already, Canada's efficient marijuana producers export southwards perhaps $2.5 billion a year. American officials worry that this trade will now increase; they have threatened to tighten border controls in response. 
In fact, the bill contains harsh penalties, of up to 14 years in jail, for marijuana growers. It sets out a pragmatic, European-style drug strategy, funded with C$245m over five years. The focus is on harm reduction, and educational campaigns about the dangers of drugs.
Canadians are divided about the new policy's merits. The police and the opposition Alliance are critical. Even so, the bill may pass before Mr Chretien steps down early next year. In 2001, Canada legalised the medical use of cannabis. Soon, Canadians may be able to roll up for pleasure.","Free marijuana , annoy Americans

RUNNING a Canadian province has occasionally been a family business, to be passed on from father to son. But in federal politics, Canada has had no equivalent of America's Kennedys or its Bushes. Now, suddenly, dynastic politics seems to be taking root north of the border. By the end of this year, barring an unlikely upset, the three oldest federal parties in Canada will all have chosen as their leaders men whose fathers were cabinet ministers. 
In January the leftish New Democratic Party (NDP) picked Jack Layton as the man to shore up its sagging fortunes. A Toronto city councillor, Mr Layton was a neophyte in federal politics. He was also the son of a minister in the Conservative government of Brian Mulroney in the 1980s. While his lineage might make him suspect to some NDP diehards, it may have helped him with the public. He has pushed up the party's showing in the opinion polls.
Last weekend it was the turn of the Conservatives to choose a new leader. They opted for Peter MacKay, the son of another member of Mr Mulroney's government. The Tories have sunk even lower than the NDP. Can Mr MacKay revive them? He has good looks, affability and an endearing tendency not to take himself too seriously. And he has a winsome girlfriend whose father was...yes, yet another of Mr Mulroney's ministers.
But Mr MacKay's victory owed more to Dallas than to Dynasty. Facing a fourth ballot at an unexpectedly dramatic and deadlocked convention, Mr MacKay won by promising to ""review"" the costs and benefits of Canada's free-trade agreement with the United States. A small but well-organised group of Conservatives sees free trade as fatal to Canada's independence. But most of the Tory party--including the new leader himself--see the agreement as Mr Mulroney's crowning accomplishment. So Mr MacKay has hurt his own prospects. 
That prompted relief and gloating from the governing Liberals of Jean Chretien, who plans to step down as prime minister early next year. They have been in power since 1993, thanks partly to the opposition's divisions. Only a revitalised Tory party might pose a serious national threat to them.
The Liberals have a family saga of their own. Paul Martin, Canada's finance minister until last year, looks certain to win the Liberal leadership at a party convention in November, and thus become prime minister. Mr Martin's father ran several times for the Liberal leadership, but never with the money or organisation that his son commands. Mr Martin looks likely to hold the top job for a while--perhaps until Justin Trudeau, the son of another Liberal prime minister, makes his anticipated entry into politics.","Canadian politics is becoming a dynastic affair

By the end of this year , barring an unlikely upset , the three oldest federal parties in Canada will all have chosen as their leaders men whose fathers were cabinet ministers . 
 In January the leftish New Democratic Party ( NDP ) picked Jack Layton as the man to shore up its sagging fortunes . A Toronto city councillor , Mr Layton was a neophyte in federal politics . He was also the son of a minister in the Conservative government of Brian Mulroney in the 1980s . While his lineage might make him suspect to some NDP diehards , it may have helped him with the public . He has pushed up the party 's showing in the opinion polls . 
 Last weekend it was the turn of the Conservatives to choose a new leader . They opted for Peter MacKay , the son of another member of Mr Mulroney 's government . The Tories have sunk even lower than the NDP . Can Mr MacKay revive them ? He has good looks , affability and an endearing tendency not to take himself too seriously . And he has a winsome girlfriend whose father was ... yes , yet another of Mr Mulroney 's ministers . 
 But Mr MacKay 's victory owed more to Dallas than to Dynasty . Facing a fourth ballot at an unexpectedly dramatic and deadlocked convention , Mr MacKay won by promising to "" review "" the costs and benefits of Canada 's free - trade agreement with the United States . A small but well - organised group of Conservatives sees free trade as fatal to Canada 's independence . But most of the Tory party -- including the new leader himself -- see the agreement as Mr Mulroney 's crowning accomplishment . So Mr MacKay has hurt his own prospects . 
 That prompted relief and gloating from Jean Chretien . Jean Chretien have been in power since 1993 , thanks partly to the opposition 's divisions . Only a revitalised Tory party might pose a serious national threat to Jean Chretien . 
 The Liberals have a family saga of their own . Paul Martin , Canada 's finance minister until last year , looks certain to win the Liberal leadership at a party convention in November , and thus become prime minister . Mr Martin 's father ran several times for the Liberal leadership , but never with the money or organisation that his son commands . Mr Martin looks likely to hold the top job for a while -- perhaps until Justin Trudeau , the son of another Liberal prime minister , makes his anticipated entry into politics .",20,Canada,A29-148,IN TERM,True,"the governing Liberals of Jean Chretien , who plans to step down as prime minister early next year",3,True

FOR gays in Canada--and perhaps for those in the United States--June 17th may well go down in history as marking a big step towards their enjoyment of a right previously confined to heterosexuals. Just a week after the Ontario Court of Appeal ruled that same-sex marriages were legal in Canada's most populous province, the federal government announced that it would draft a bill to make this national policy. So, to the dismay of social conservatives, it was not a bad day for Canadian judicial activism either.
The bill is likely to become law. If it does, Canada would follow Belgium and the Netherlands to become the third country to give legal status to same-sex unions. Canadian marriage licences are accepted in the United States; many gay Americans are now likely to cross the border to wed, throwing American law into confusion.
Many Canadians were surprised at the speed with which Jean Chretien's Liberal government endorsed the court's decision. The House of Commons' justice committee, which had heard hundreds of witnesses on the issue, had yet to report. Although one poll shows 54% support for the move, a large majority of older people and those in rural areas are against. 
The government had two reasons for haste. Lower courts in British Columbia and Quebec had already made similar rulings. The justice minister had to decide by June 30th whether to appeal the British Columbia ruling to the Supreme Court. Secondly, and more compellingly, the Ontario court made its ruling of June 10th effective immediately, ordering officials to issue licences that day. More than 100 gay couples rushed to get married. One person to do so was a former bank manager, another a crown attorney.
The Ontario court, like the others, based its ruling on Section 15 of Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which the judges have interpreted as forbidding discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The court called the exclusion of gays from the institution of marriage illogical, offensive and unjustifiable. These words carried additional clout since they were delivered by Roy McMurtry, Ontario's Chief Justice, who as a provincial minister in 1982 worked alongside Mr Chretien (then the federal justice minister) in a three-man ""kitchen cabinet"" to win support for the Charter.
But backing among Liberal MPs for same-sex marriage is far from solid. Their doubts were on display at a meeting last week of the House of Commons' justice committee. When Svend Robinson, an MP for the leftish New Democrats and a gay activist, moved a motion to accept the Ontario court ruling, the Liberals on the committee split 5-4 in favour, even though government whips had replaced two opponents of the measure with supporters. Bill Graham, the foreign minister, whose Toronto constituency has Canada's largest population of gays and lesbians, gave a passionate speech in favour to a meeting of Liberal MPs. He got a mixed reaction. Some opposition stems from growing disquiet about judicial activism. 
Mr Chretien has said he will refer the bill to the Supreme Court to make sure it is constitutional, and then submit it to a free vote in Parliament. The battle will be bruising. An influential group of lawyers, professors, bishops and Islamic leaders issued a statement against the change. If the bill is approved, Ralph Klein, the conservative premier of Alberta, threatens to use a constitutional get-out clause to block its implementation in his province. But Canada as a whole is less socially conservative than Alberta, or than the United States. And the judiciary has left Parliament with little choice but to follow its lead. It has probably set the country on the road to a small revolution in family law and family life.

IN SOME ways Jean Chretien's last summer as Canada's prime minister is proving less serene than he might have hoped. Most of his Liberal Party's caucus of MPs, and many of his ministers, have now switched their loyalties to his likely successor, and bitter rival, Paul Martin. When they return to Ottawa in the autumn, the caucus may prove obstreperous, perhaps blocking social measures, such as an overhaul of the Indian Act. Mr Chretien intends these to be part of his legacy (he plans to step down next February). Instead, his last year may be remembered for another radical measure--one that has caused some of the Liberal discontent.
Late last month, Mr Chretien secured approval of a law that imposes a sweeping ban on all but the smallest political donations by businesses or trade unions. Instead, private individuals will be encouraged to contribute more to politics through bigger tax breaks. But most of the shortfall will be picked up by taxpayers through an elaborate system of public finance, based on votes at previous elections. A one-off federal payment to the parties of C$20m ($14.8m) will cover the transition costs of switching to the new system next year. 
Mr Chretien's government has been tainted by scandals in which big Liberal donors have received favours, including juicy contracts which were not put out to tender. One of the more nagging cases implicated the prime minister himself; another is the subject of police investigations which could embarrass Mr Chretien even in retirement. The prime minister denies that those controversies inspired the law. The problem, he says, is a public perception that influence is for sale, which breeds cynicism and mistrust of politicians.
The law applies to political parties, their leadership contenders and their election candidates. Its main beneficiaries are likely to be opposition parties such as the right-wing Canadian Alliance and the separatist Bloc Quebecois. Neither raises a fraction as much corporate cash as the Liberals. Each will now receive millions of dollars of public money. And the left-wing New Democrats will no longer have to depend on labour unions for cash.
The Alliance still voted against the law. But the sharpest opposition came from Mr Chretien's own ranks. The Liberals have become the party of corporate Canada, and have most to lose financially from the new rules. ""Dumb as a bag of hammers,"" was the verdict of Stephen LeDrew, the Liberal Party president, a supporter of Mr Martin. (Mr Chretien's right-hand man returned the compliment by sending Mr LeDrew a bag of hammers, with a note encouraging him to use them to ""knock some sense into your head"".) 
To his critics, the law looks plain hypocritical. In a decade as prime minister, Mr Chretien has made a regular ritual of big-donor dinners, bringing in as much as C$1m a night. Now, his successors will be denied this source of wealth. Mr Martin is even closer to Canadian business than Mr Chretien. Whether or not it succeeds in cleaning up the image of Canadian politics, the new law is likely to make life difficult for Mr Martin. That just might have been the intention.

Saddam Hussein's sons, Uday and Qusay, were killed in an American missile barrage on a villa in Mosul after an informant, who presumably gets the $30m bounty on offer, led the Americans to their hideout. A message from Saddam, apparently recorded two days earlier, urged resistance to continue; two American soldiers were killed immediately after the sons' deaths, and three more the next day. George Bush said the death of Saddam's sons should reassure Iraqis that the former regime would not come back.

In Spain, ETA terrorists seeking independence for the Basques exploded two bombs on the Costa Blanca tourist coast at the other side of the country.

THE contest to succeed Jean Chretien as leader of the Liberal Party and thus as Canada's prime minister is an epic, but hardly a drama. The successor will not be chosen until November. But ever since last August, when Mr Chretien announced that he planned to retire in February 2004, the undisputed favourite has been Paul Martin, his former finance minister. The whole exercise became even more anti-climactic on July 22nd when John Manley, the deputy prime minister and Mr Martin's strongest rival, pulled out, admitting that he couldn't win. Neither, he said, can Sheila Copps, the leftish heritage minister, the only remaining challenger.
Mr Manley said that it would be ""irresponsible"" to continue to demand the time and money of his supporters. Money was a problem. He had raised less than a third of the C$6.4m ($4.6m) Mr Martin has amassed, and recently had to lay off campaign workers. Mr Manley may also have been thinking about his job prospects. 
Both men are on the Liberal right. With few policy differences between them, Mr Manley chose to attack Mr Martin's integrity, and especially the conflicts of interest raised by his business empire. That got few results beyond hard feelings in the Martin camp. By dropping out, Mr Manley has allowed time for the bitterness to subside. By predicting that Mr Martin will make ""an excellent prime minister"", he may have reserved a top cabinet job for himself. 
He has also avoided the potential embarrassment of finishing behind Ms Copps. She has little money, but does have a clear policy message and passionate supporters. Defeat at her hands might have doomed Mr Manley in a race he might win: that to succeed Mr Martin, who at 64 is not expected to serve much more than one term as prime minister. Mr Manley, like Ms Copps, is more than a decade younger than Mr Martin. 
Ms Copps pledges to fight to the last, even though some pundits predict that she will lose by as much as nine to one. In power since 1993 and facing weak opposition, the Liberals ""need a great debate"", she says. ""We can't sleepwalk our way into a new government without a test of ideas."" 
Even so, Mr Manley's withdrawal may put pressure on Mr Chretien to step down before February. The November leadership convention looks a formality. So the Liberal caucus in parliament will now take their cue from Mr Martin. Senior civil servants are already doing as much. By leaving early, Mr Chretien, who has long tried to thwart his rival's leadership ambitions, might disrupt Mr Martin's plans for an early election next spring--and might thus turn it into a real contest.","Paul Martin 's main rival drops out

Instead, earlier this summer, Mr Chretien, in an unusually eloquent speech, announced that it will become the Canadian History Centre.

George Bush, pledging ""no retreat"" in Iraq, claimed that America was making good progress in restoring order to the country. But the State Department signalled, for the first time, that America might consider a multinational force under the UN provided it was led by an American.
Meanwhile, bloody incidents continued in Iraq, including an assassination attempt on a leading Shia cleric. Relief agencies cut back their operations. The UN Security Council voted to increase protection for aid workers in conflict zones. Paul Bremer, the American administrator, said Iraq would need aid of ""several tens of billions"" in the coming year. 
The United States, fulfilling a promise made in the wake of invading Iraq, closed its operations at Prince Sultan airbase in Saudi Arabia.
In a further sign of his unwillingness to surrender control to the Palestinian prime minister, Mahmoud Abbas, Yasser Arafat appointed General Jibril Rajoub as national security adviser in open rivalry to Muhammad Dahlan, the security minister. But he also called on militant groups to return to the ceasefire they renounced last week.
A leaked report on Iran from the International Atomic Energy Agency says inspectors found traces of highly enriched uranium in samples taken from the Natanz nuclear facility. Iran claims that the samples were contaminated by imported equipment.
The British arrested Hadi Soleimanpour, a former Iranian ambassador to Argentina who is studying for a doctorate at Durham University, for possible extradition to Argentina in connection with a bombing in 1994. Another wanted Iranian was briefly arrested in Belgium. In a separate case, two Iranian interrogators are being charged over the death of a Canadian journalist, Zahra Kazemi, in custody in Tehran.
Rwanda's president, Paul Kagame, won 95% of the vote in a presidential election. Though there is convincing evidence that voters were intimidated, Mr Kagame has earned support across the country's bitter ethnic divide.
South Africa's anti-graft unit, the Scorpions, said it had a prima facie case of corruption against the deputy president, Jacob Zuma, but had decided not to prosecute him. Opposition parties demanded that he resign, but President Thabo Mbeki stood by him.
The 14 countries of the Southern African Development Community signed a mutual defence pact. This allows for diplomatic or military intervention in a member country to stop internal conflict. 
On the spot
Britain's prime minister, Tony Blair, gave evidence to the Hutton inquiry into the suicide of David Kelly, a Ministry of Defence scientist who had claimed that the government's dossier of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction had been ""sexed up"". Mr Blair said he contested the allegation because it was so serious. If it were true, he would have had to resign, he said.
Germany's government published a long-awaited public-pensions plan by a commission headed by an economist, Bert Rurup, who said that Germans should retire at 67 rather than today's 65 and that they should expect pensions worth 40% of gross average earnings rather than today's 48%.
Italy's prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, said his government might raise the retirement age; many Italians in the public sector can get a pension at 57.
The governor of Russia's oil-rich Pacific-coast island of Sakhalin, died with 19 others in a helicopter crash on the Kamchatka peninsula. 
Three bombs killed three people in the southern Russian city of Krasnodar, and a car bomb killed Mahomedsalikh Gusayev, a minister in the Russian republic of Dagestan, next to Chechnya. Terrorists are presumed to have made both attacks.
Trading partners
Peru agreed to become an associate member of Mercosur, South America's main trade block headed by Brazil and Argentina; Chile and Bolivia are already associates, having signed a free-trade agreement with the group without joining its customs union.
Venezuela's supreme court appointed a provisional electoral authority, whose first job will be to organise a referendum on the rule of President Hugo Chvez.
Canada's prime minister, Jean Chretien, signed an agreement granting self-government to the Tlicho, an Indian people. Under the agreement, the Tlicho will get a share in the royalties of three diamond mines in the Northwest Territories.
Blasts in Mumbai
More than 50 people were killed, and over 150 injured, by two bombs in Mumbai (formerly Bombay). Initial suspicion fell on a domestic group, with links to a Pakistan-based terrorist organisation.
Talks between America, North Korea, South Korea, Japan, China and Russia started in Beijing, aimed at ending the crisis triggered by last year's discovery of North Korea's illicit nuclear programme.

A two-ton block of granite depicting the Ten Commandments was removed from the state courthouse in Alabama. Roy Moore, the state's chief justice, was suspended for defying decrees by a federal court and fellow judges that the installation broke constitutional rules on the separation of church and state.

CANADIANS have long been proud of their tolerance of cultural diversity. Now it is taking them down some innovative legal paths. On August 25th, Jean Chretien journeyed to the remote village of Rae-Edzo, deep in the Northwest Territories, and signed an agreement bestowing self-government and mineral wealth on the 4,000 Dogrib Indians, who prefer to call themselves the Tlicho First Nation. ""We lead the world in the recognition of aboriginal rights,"" the prime minister said. 
Indeed. The Tlicho treaty is only the second of its kind in Canada--the first, in 1998, involved the Nisga'a of north-west British Columbia--but more may now follow. Indian claims on much of British Columbia have cast doubt on who owns what and held up mining investment. The Tlicho accord clears up the doubts by granting full rights to the aboriginals. Eight other first nations may now reach similar agreements, though claims in urban areas, such as Vancouver, will be trickier to settle.
The Tlicho are fortunate that their ancestral land abuts a diamond industry of sparkling promise, which Canada's government wants to expand. Mines at Ekati and Diavik produce diamonds worth C$1 billion ($710m) per year; a third mine is due to start production in 2006. Canada is already the world's fourth-biggest diamond producer, with 12% of the market. The Tlicho will now gain 2% of the royalties from these three mines (most of the rest goes to the federal government). But they will get all the royalties from any new mines. Though most Canadian diamonds are sent abroad for processing, the Tlicho want to make Yellowknife a centre for cutting and polishing, and making jewellery. 
Diamonds are not the end of the story. The treaty gives the Tlicho ownership of an area almost as big as Switzerland around Yellowknife, together with its natural resources. They will also get C$152m in cash over 15 years and a C$5m training fund. Companies owned by the Tlicho (which include an ore haulier, an electricity generator and a travel agent) will have preference in the award of contracts. Their local governments will be able to make and enforce laws, collect taxes, levy royalties on mines, and regulate land use, education, family law and traditional medicine. After many years in limbo under federal control, ""We're now going to have some say in our lives,"" said John Zoe, the Tlicho negotiator. Indian peoples elsewhere can only look on in envy. Unless they try to emulate the Tlicho.","An innovative land - rights treaty

IN 1995, the Wall Street Journal, pondering Canada's economic slump, bottomless fiscal deficit and towering public debt, judged that America's northern neighbour had become ""an honorary member of the Third World"". Four years earlier, The Economist had fretted that Canada was ""on the brink of bust-up"". We quoted a Canadian who compared his country's federation to a ""boring party where the guests are too polite to leave. However, when the first guest makes a move to go, the others each claim other engagements and make a quick exit."" Still a fair description? Today's Canada is neither boring nor so exciting that it is on the brink of disintegration. Indeed, a cautious case can be made that Canada is now rather cool. 
Part of what makes it cool is a certain boldness in social matters. Canada's government has recently announced its support for pioneering bills to legalise gay marriage and decriminalise marijuana, both excellent liberal ideas. It has granted home rule and control over mineral rights to some of its indigenous Indians. While other rich countries suffer a racist backlash over immigration, Canadians welcome migrants and are proud of their tolerance and cultural diversity. This has turned Canada's big cities into vibrant, cosmopolitan places. Canadian writers and other cultural figures enjoy unprecedented international success.
This social liberalism points to an increasingly self-confident country. Canada has at last tackled--or at least learnt to manage--the problems that beset it a decade ago when Jean Chretien took office as prime minister. In 1995, a referendum on independence in Quebec was lost by only a few thousand votes. This year, the separatists lost power in the province after an election in which independence was barely an issue. Mr Chretien can claim some credit: he has been a robust federalist, ramming through the Clarity Act, which places legal obstacles in the path of separation. And Quebec, in turn, has benefited from Canada's economic turnaround.
Deficits have been left far behind and the public debt slashed. Since the late 1990s, Canada's economy has outperformed the rest of the rich world. It no longer depends only on lumber, mining, oil and cars. Like any economy, Canada's is vulnerable to shocks, such as the recent outbreak in Toronto of the SARS respiratory disease and a case of mad-cow disease which has curtailed beef exports. But Canada has begun to close the gap between its living standards and those in the United States. Though this gap, at 15%, is far from trivial, many Canadians believe that their public health care, better protection of the environment and lower crime rate make them better off than their southern neighbours. Throw in its social liberalism, and Canada's ""third way"" looks to some like an attractive alternative to an increasingly conservative America. Certainly, Canadians themselves seem content. This week, Paul Martin took another big step on his irresistible journey to the prime minister's office ()see page 57. Though he and Mr Chretien are personal rivals, they are the Liberal Party's co-architects of Canada's economic renaissance. Pundits expect Mr Martin to call a general election next year--and for the Liberals to win a fourth consecutive term.
The contrast across the 49th parallel between Canada and the United States makes for healthy competition in social and economic policy. But as with many a good-news story, Canada's loses a bit of its lustre under closer inspection. People continue to vote with their feet: a few thousand Americans move north each year, but are still outnumbered by Canadians moving south--and not, probably, just for the sun. Though the poor fare better in Canada, the middle classes earn less and pay higher taxes. The Liberal Party's domination of Canadian politics is far from being an unalloyed good. Without an effective opposition, much of the job of holding the government in check falls to the judiciary, policing a Charter of Rights which on one view, unlike America's Bill of Rights, tilts too far towards the rights of groups rather than individuals. 
Unfinished masterpiece
On top of this, there are some big things that Canada continues to get wrong, and other big things that could go wrong without preventive action. In general, Canada still taxes too much, invests too little, and enjoys a free ride in defence from the United States. Since the terrorist attacks of September 2001, security and defence are a special worry. Much of Canada's economic success is built on a 1988 free-trade agreement that has seen a massive expansion in cross-border trade: the United States now takes 88% of Canada's exports. Just-in-time production means that components can cross the border three times in the making of a car, for example. If security threats turn the border into a barrier, firms will think twice before putting a factory in Ontario rather than Ohio. That does not stop Canada from holding different views about the world from those of George Bush, but it needs to work harder than Mr Chretien has done at keeping the trust of the United States. 
Conversely, firms also need positive reasons to invest in a market that is only a tenth the size of America's. This implies that Canada should continue with the tax cuts that Mr Martin launched as finance minister. At some point, however, this will damage the welfare state on which Canadians set such store. So far, the federal government has been able to balance its books mainly by passing this problem on to the provinces, whose finances are poised to unravel. The cities, too, have demands: today, the most visible cleavage in Canada is not between French-speaking Quebec and the English-speaking rest, but between five large urban areas (dynamic, successful, with many immigrants but with strained public services) and the rest (mainly rural, declining economies with high unemployment, kept alive by federal aid).
To keep its new cool, Canada must therefore overhaul the way its government allocates power and money. Quebec's new Liberal government could lead the way: it wants the private sector to help to deliver public services, as well as some further devolution. The rest of the country should follow. Canada has turned a corner. But it is not yet time to abandon its new spirit of risk-taking and experimentation.","Exciting times , but much unfinished business , in the north 
 IN 1995 , the Wall Street Journal , pondering Canada 's economic slump , bottomless fiscal deficit and towering public debt , judged that America 's northern neighbour had become "" an honorary member of the Third World "" . Four years earlier , The Economist had fretted that Canada was "" on the brink of bust - up "" . We quoted a Canadian who compared his country 's federation to a "" boring party where the guests are too polite to leave . However , when the first guest makes a move to go , the others each claim other engagements and make a quick exit . "" Still a fair description ? Today 's Canada is neither boring nor so exciting that it is on the brink of disintegration . Indeed , a cautious case can be made that Canada is now rather cool . 
 Part of what makes it cool is a certain boldness in social matters . Canada 's government has recently announced its support for pioneering bills to legalise gay marriage and decriminalise marijuana , both excellent liberal ideas . It has granted home rule and control over mineral rights to some of its indigenous Indians . While other rich countries suffer a racist backlash over immigration , Canadians welcome migrants and are proud of their tolerance and cultural diversity . This has turned Canada 's big cities into vibrant , cosmopolitan places . Canadian writers and other cultural figures enjoy unprecedented international success . 
 This social liberalism points to an increasingly self - confident country . Canada has at last tackled -- or at least learnt to manage -- the problems that beset it a decade ago when Jean Chretien took office as prime minister . In 1995 , a referendum on independence in Quebec was lost by only a few thousand votes .

LAST week, on the second day of the new parliamentary session, Canada's right-wing opposition went for the jugular. It denounced Jean Chretien's Liberal government for what one opposition leader called an ""activist assault on marriage"" in the form of a bill giving legal status to unions between two people of the same sex. The opposition scored a moral victory: its motion won the support of backbench Liberals, and failed only narrowly. 
But the debate in the gothic Commons chamber in Ottawa, a less claustrophobic but no less rowdy clone of Westminster, served to show the opposition's own marginal status. According to the opinion polls, a narrow majority of Canadians back same-sex marriage; among younger and urban voters, far more do. In choosing the issue for its showpiece debate, the opposition underlined that on the main battlegrounds of politics, on issues of money, the Liberals are dominant.
That dominance is based on Mr Chretien's success, in a decade in office, in sorting out Canada's public finances without abandoning its welfare state. In 1993, Canada's fiscal deficit stood at 6% of GDP and public debt totalled 64% of GDP. By 1997, the budget was in balance, and deficits were going out of fashion in the provinces. Mr Chretien achieved this partly be retaining an unpopular sales tax introduced by his Conservative predecessor. But he also slashed defence spending, foreign aid and transfers to the provinces, for health and other services. As economic growth returned, the government began cutting taxes and repaying public debt (which now stands at 40% of GDP) while restoring some of the cuts.
This was a double act between Mr Chretien and Paul Martin, his finance minister from 1993 until last year. In political terms, it has been highly effective. ""Our success is that we've covered such a wide ground in the middle,"" Mr Chretien told The Economist. ""A right-winger who wants a balanced budget can't complain at me. If on the left you want more money for health and education, you're happy too. That makes it very difficult for the opposition."" Indeed so, though the opposition, split four ways and lacking national reach, has added difficulties of its own. 
Partners to rivals
Partners in government, Mr Chretien and Mr Martin are personal rivals. Many Canadians believe that Mr Chretien, who has been the target of small-scale corruption allegations (which he denies), should have stepped down earlier. His departure is an awkwardly lengthy one: he is not due to go until February. But all his efforts to block Mr Martin have failed. Last weekend, Liberals chose the delegates to their leadership convention, due in November. Some 90% of them are known to be supporters of Mr Martin, with only 10% backing Sheila Copps, a nationalist from the Liberal left who is his only remaining rival. 
Mr Martin's arrival will herald a personality change at the top. Mr Chretien, a federalist Quebecker, is a skilled and instinctive political fighter whose antennae are tuned resolutely to Canada rather than the world. Mr Martin, an Ontarian who speaks fluent French and whose political home is in Montreal, has broader experience. He entered politics only after building a shipping business. He is often said to be further to the right than Mr Chretien. But a new book* by a Canadian journalist describes a more complex figure: a gregarious technocrat, almost Clintonian in his intellectual interests if not in charisma. As the son of one of the Liberal founders of Canada's welfare state he is less conservative than he looks. He has a reputation for competence, but some detect a tendency to dither. 
Will policy change, too? Mr Martin faces an agenda that is more challenging than many Canadians might imagine. It can be summarised under four, overlapping, headings: the economy and the public finances; federal-provincial relations; immigration; and foreign policy.
Take the economy first. Canada has competed successfully with the United States (see chart 1 on next page) partly because of lower wages and a weaker currency. If it is to close the income gap that still divides the two countries, as Mr Martin says he wants to, it needs to raise its productivity further. Canadian workers are less productive because businesses invest less than their American counterparts (see chart 2).
""Canada has a small, dispersed population and a cold climate. In North America, the United States has a huge market and Mexico has lower costs. So we have to have better public policies to tilt towards Canada,"" says Jack Mintz of the CD Howe Institute, a Toronto research centre. Canada has something of an edge in education and health: for now, at least, the extra cost in taxes of Canada's public health system is similar to the health-insurance contributions made by American firms, says Mr Mintz. But despite cuts in corporate income tax, Canada's tax system still penalises investment. There are also legal restrictions on foreign investment (in banking, for example) which some would like to relax, but others argue are needed to defend Canadian national identity. 
Fiscal imbalance
Tax cuts are only one among many claims on the public purse. Perhaps the most pressing is the increasingly expensive health service, enshrined in the Canada Health Act. In February, Mr Chretien agreed to increase federal health spending, by more than C$30 billion ($20 billion) over five years. But the provinces, which are responsible for health and education, still complain of a ""fiscal imbalance"". All of them except energy-rich Alberta are poised to sink back into deficit, according to Hugh Segal of Montreal's Institute for Research on Public Policy. He says that health costs, which now account for about 50% of spending by the provinces (excluding debt payments), are ""crowding out"" other spending needs. Jean Charest, Quebec's new premier, wants a new Council of the Federation, at which the provinces would push Ottawa for further devolution. Meanwhile, big-city mayors, an impotent bunch in Canada, want a slice of the federal petrol tax.
Some Canadians argue that it was Mr Chretien, rather than his finance minister, who was the fiercer fiscal hawk. But on the public finances, Mr Martin insists that he will ""stay the course""; he wants public debt to be ""no higher than 25% of GDP"". He also opposes more devolution, except of provincial powers to the cities. But maintaining the balancing act of economic growth and welfare provision may require more radical measures.
One solution would be to allow private health provision for the rich. That would create uproar. ""It would be easier to campaign for a change in the Ten Commandments than in the Canada Health Act,"" says Mr Segal. So provinces will have to seek innovative ways of doing more with less. Marginally more feasible might be to tinker with the formula (""equalisation"") under which money is shunted from rich provinces (Alberta and Ontario) to poor ones (the rest). This formula is a monument to the principle of universal public service: it encourages the unemployed in depressed areas such as Nova Scotia to stay at home on provincial welfare rolls rather than move in search of a job.
That is all the more ironic since Canada faces skill shortages. The solution has been large-scale immigration (230,000 immigrants arrived last year, in a country of 31.5m people). Nowadays, most are Asians, rather than Europeans. Denis Coderre, the immigration minister, insists the policy enjoys support across the political spectrum and is essential to maintain economic growth and social benefits. ""We're a land of immigrants. It's the Canadian way,"" Mr Coderre says. Even so, Canada risks a backlash next time the economy cools. Already, there are signs that recent migrants are not doing as well as their predecessors--even though Canada selects most of them for their skills. ""There is discrimination, there is racism. We're too polite to talk about them,"" says Usha George, who teaches social work at the University of Toronto. 
Lastly, some Canadians fret that their country is losing its place in the world. That argument looks exaggerated, except in one respect. Canada's defence spending has slipped to embarrassing levels. Even had the government and the country wanted to take part in the Iraq war (neither did), Canada would have been hard put to make a meaningful contribution (though it has 2,000 troops in Afghanistan). Berel Rodal, a banker in Ottawa, puts it this way: Canada has become ""the world's biggest suburb, a wealthy place that worries about schools and parks"" while leaving the ""downtown issues"" of defence and nuclear proliferation to others. 
According to Mr Martin, Canada's ""number one challenge is keeping that American border open."" Mr Chretien's relations with George Bush have evolved from distant to bad. That is partly because he made little effort to explain his Iraq policy to Canada's main trading partner. Since September 2001, the government has worked with its American counterpart to improve border security without disrupting trade. But Mr Martin wants closer ties, between legislators in each country as well as officials. He also talks more vaguely of trying to set up new international bodies to tackle issues such as migration and disease. And he wants Canada to be more active in trading with China, India, Brazil and Russia, where he sees an opportunity to lessen his country's dependence on the American market.
For now, Liberal hegemony looks as secure under Mr Martin as under Mr Chretien. Traditionally, Canadians have balanced their politics by ensuring that their province is governed by a different party than that in power in Ottawa. This balance is breaking down: this year the Liberals seized Quebec, and look poised to win Ontario from the Progressive Conservatives (Tories) in an election on October 2nd. 
The prospect of years more of opposition has pushed two conservative parties, the Western-based Alliance and the Tories into a fresh round of merger talks this month. Unity would be hard: the Alliance is conservative on the social issues that dominate the headlines in Canada, and the Tories are not. But Mr Martin would be unwise to assume he will lack opposition for ever. The better life in Canada gets, the harder it may be to keep it so.

WHEN Ontario's Liberals secured a landslide victory in the provincial election of October 2nd, they also produced a political situation that Canada has not seen for 60 years. Given that the Quebec Liberals routed the separatists in their election in April, Liberals now control the two largest provinces, which together account for about two-thirds of the country's total population, economy and trade. Meanwhile, the federal Liberals this month mark a decade in power in Ottawa under Jean Chretien, and are set to win a fourth successive election under Paul Martin's leadership next year. Canada is looking increasingly like a one-party state.
In the past, Canadian voters have maintained a political balance by electing different parties at provincial and federal levels. Except for 17 Tory years, the Liberals have run the federal government since 1935, while the Progressive Conservatives have ruled Ontario for all but ten years of the past 60. Voters have sometimes contrived to spread power still more evenly by electing minority administrations at both levels. Last week the exaggerations of the first-past-the-post system gave Ontario's Liberals, led by Dalton McGuinty, a huge majority--72 of the 103 seats, with only 46% of the vote--while the Conservatives and New Democrats, who between them won half the popular vote, got just 31.
The erstwhile power balance had its downside, which may partly explain why Ontario voted as it did. Relations between Ottawa and the provinces are often fractious, with each blaming the other for unforeseen problems, such as this year's SARS outbreak. Doubtless the provincial premiers will still complain about the control Ottawa exercises over taxation, and the reduced funds that it has distributed for education and welfare services since 1994 (when Mr Martin, as finance minister, began eliminating the federal budget deficit). But Mr Martin--a shoo-in to take over as prime minister in February--has arranged an informal and unusual meeting with all the provincial premiers on November 16th. Meanwhile, Jean Charest, leader of the Quebec Liberals, is gathering the premiers on October 23rd at a meeting of the Council of the Federation, the body he has conceived to present the case for a more stable (and better-financed) relationship with Ottawa.
To his credit--and, it seems, to his benefit--Mr McGuinty ran a high-minded campaign, ignoring the personal attacks that Ernie Eves, the normally courteous outgoing Conservative premier, allowed his backroom staff to launch. Among other slurs, they alleged that Mr McGuinty was ""a kitten-eating alien"". But while clean, Mr McGuinty's campaign could prove expensive, and he will welcome any help his fellow premiers can offer as he sets about winkling money out of Ottawa to meet his election promises. His costly platform included pledges to keep class sizes for young pupils to a maximum of 20 students, which will require more teachers and classrooms, and to hire 8,000 nurses to help revive the health service. 
Still, Mr McGuinty's chances of meeting his pledges may be enhanced by Canada's new political geometry. He campaigned heavily in the suburban areas around Toronto, which in two previous elections had helped to return the Conservatives. Mr McGuinty won over many of these voters by professing a deep concern about the state of urban services. Happily for him, Mr Martin has voiced similar concerns. Equally helpfully, he represents the constituency that sends John Manley, the federal finance minister, to Ottawa. Canada may now be a one-party state, at least in parts, but Liberal hegemony may have some advantages.
Caption: Lock up your kittens, here comes McGuinty","After their triumph in Ontario, the Liberals are rampant
WHEN Ontario's Liberals secured a landslide victory in the provincial election of October 2nd, they also produced a political situation that Canada has not seen for 60 years. Given that the Quebec Liberals routed the separatists in their election in April, Liberals now control the two largest provinces, which together account for about two-thirds of the country's total population, economy and trade. Meanwhile, the federal Liberals this month mark a decade in power in Ottawa under Jean Chretien, and are set to win a fourth successive election under Paul Martin's leadership next year. Canada is looking increasingly like a one-party state.
In the past, Canadian voters have maintained a political balance by electing different parties at provincial and federal levels. Except for 17 Tory years, the Liberals have run the federal government since 1935, while the Progressive Conservatives have ruled Ontario for all but ten years of the past 60. Voters have sometimes contrived to spread power still more evenly by electing minority administrations at both levels. Last week the exaggerations of the first-past-the-post system gave Ontario's Liberals, led by Dalton McGuinty, a huge majority--72 of the 103 seats, with only 46% of the vote--while the Conservatives and New Democrats, who between them won half the popular vote, got just 31.
The erstwhile power balance had its downside, which may partly explain why Ontario voted as it did. Relations between Ottawa and the provinces are often fractious, with each blaming the other for unforeseen problems, such as this year's SARS outbreak. Doubtless the provincial premiers will still complain about the control Ottawa exercises over taxation, and the reduced funds that it has distributed for education and welfare services since 1994 (when Mr Martin, as finance minister, began eliminating the federal budget deficit). But Mr Martin--a shoo-in to take over as prime minister in February--has arranged an informal and unusual meeting with all the provincial premiers on November 16th. Meanwhile, Jean Charest, leader of the Quebec Liberals, is gathering the premiers on October 23rd at a meeting of the Council of the Federation, the body he has conceived to present the case for a more stable (and better-financed) relationship with Ottawa.
To his credit--and, it seems, to his benefit--Mr McGuinty ran a high-minded campaign, ignoring the personal attacks that Ernie Eves, the normally courteous outgoing Conservative premier, allowed his backroom staff to launch. Among other slurs, they alleged that Mr McGuinty was ""a kitten-eating alien"". But while clean, Mr McGuinty's campaign could prove expensive, and he will welcome any help his fellow premiers can offer as he sets about winkling money out of Ottawa to meet his election promises. His costly platform included pledges to keep class sizes for young pupils to a maximum of 20 students, which will require more teachers and classrooms, and to hire 8,000 nurses to help revive the health service. 
Still, Mr McGuinty's chances of meeting his pledges may be enhanced by Canada's new political geometry. He campaigned heavily in the suburban areas around Toronto, which in two previous elections had helped to return the Conservatives. Mr McGuinty won over many of these voters by professing a deep concern about the state of urban services. Happily for him, Mr Martin has voiced similar concerns. Equally helpfully, he represents the constituency that sends John Manley, the federal finance minister, to Ottawa. Canada may now be a one-party state, at least in parts, but Liberal hegemony may have some advantages.

BY ANY measure, the departure of Jean Chretien has been painfully drawn-out. Back in August 2002, after almost a decade as prime minister, he announced that he would retire--but not until next February. His successor, Paul Martin, his former finance minister but a personal rival, is due to be anointed at a party convention starting on November 14th. Now, Mr Chretien seems to have accepted that there is no point in staying around much longer.
He is said to have paid a quiet visit to the governor-general, to ask her to be available to swear in a new cabinet in late November. Aides denied a report that he would take on a role on Africa for the UN. But Mr Chretien himself recently amended his timetable, saying he will leave ""between now and February"".

If Mr Chretien does go early, much proposed legislation may disappear with him. More than a dozen bills passed by the House of Commons are now before the Senate. They include a much-debated law to ban human cloning but allow some stem-cell research. Other parts of Mr Chretien's ""legacy agenda"", including a bill to decriminalise marijuana, have yet to make it out of the Commons.

LAST month two Canadian soldiers were killed in Afghanistan when they drove over a land mine. An inevitable accident of war, you might think, except that their vehicle was 20 years old and lacked armour--a death trap, rather than a lifesaver. Their fate is symptomatic of the woeful state of Canada's armed forces. During the 1990s, the defence budget was cut by about 30% in real terms, while deployments continued apace. Such is the resulting accumulated strain that unless the government invests billions of dollars in new equipment, the armed forces face ""extinction"" as a capable fighting force within 15 years, according to Brian Macdonald of the Royal Canadian Military Institute, a defence think-tank in Toronto.
Canada has a proud tradition of taking part in peacekeeping operations. More than 3,500 of its soldiers are abroad, in places such as Afghanistan and Bosnia. A report on defence in 1994 promised that up to 10,000 troops would be available for service abroad. But lack of equipment makes that impossible. 
Defence spending has sunk to just 1.1% of GDP, its lowest level since before the second world war. That compares with an average among NATO members, excluding the United States, of 1.9% of GDP. Manpower in the services has fallen by roughly 30% over the past decade to fewer than 60,000. The shortfall is now critical: training of recruits has been disrupted because instructors have had to be sent abroad. 
Equipment is in an even worse state than manpower. Capital spending takes up 18.5% of the defence budget. That is enough to equip only one of the three services properly, says Mr Macdonald. The navy has some modern ships, but is short of spare parts. Worst hit is the air force, with just 350 aircraft, down from 725 in 1991. It is flying 40-year old transport aircraft and has had to cut maritime patrol flights. Its elderly fleet of Sea King helicopters (known as ""flying coffins"") require 30 hours of maintenance for every hour of flight. And they are unavailable for operations 40% of the time, according to David Rudd, of the Canadian Institute of Strategic Studies, another Toronto think-tank. Its Hercules transport aircraft, dating from the 1960s, are in even worse repair. The result is that Canada must depend on American planes to take its troops abroad.
This penury reflects the low priority given by voters to the armed forces. Many Canadians would rather that scarce government money was directed to health and education. That is what has happened. Facing a huge budget deficit, Jean Chretien's government took an axe to defence spending in the mid-1990s. Recently, improved public finances have allowed it modestly to increase the defence budget again, by C$1 billion ($1.3 billion) in 2003-04, for example. 
Paul Martin, who as finance minister implemented the cuts, is due to be elected as the new Liberal leader, and thus prime minister, at a party convention this weekend. He has promised to spend more on the armed forces. But economic growth, and thus tax revenues, have slowed. Overstretched cities and provinces are clamouring for more funds, too. 
Despite the difficulties, Canadian troops have peformed well as peacekeepers, in the Balkans and Afghanistan. What is needed is an overall review of defence and foreign policy. But it may take more deaths before that happens.","The armed forces suffer from government indifference

PAUL MARTIN'S long wait, impatiently endured, to become Canada's next prime minister is almost over. On November 14th he was crowned as leader of the governing Liberal Party, with the vote of 94% of the delegates at a convention. Four days later Jean Chretien, the present prime minister, abandoned his long effort to thwart his former finance minister and unreconciled rival. He agreed to hand over on December 12th, rather than hang on into the new year as he had planned. 
After more than a year of enforced circumspection, Mr Martin is at last able to say how he wants to change Canada. He will put more effort than Mr Chretien into good relations with George Bush's administration in the United States, and with provincial premiers at home. 
Mr Martin, a 65-year-old former businessman, is hardly a new face. But he will do his best to convince voters, in an election expected by next summer, that he represents a fresh start. He will spend the next three weeks forming a cabinet, which is likely to include only a minority of Mr Chretien's ministers. To provide momentum for the election, he may postpone by a fortnight or more the recall of Parliament (prorogued by Mr Chretien last week until January 12th), and thus of the Speech from the Throne containing his legislative plans. 
Mr Chretien, a man of working-class origins who plays politics by his instincts, curbed government deficits, took a tough line on separatism in French-speaking Quebec, opposed the war in Iraq, got on badly with George Bush, and embraced such measures as decriminalising drugs and legalising homosexual marriage. 
Now Mr Martin is expected to lean back to the right. During the leadership campaign, he defined himself partly by his silences on issues such as gay marriage, the Kyoto protocol on climate change (ratified by Mr Chretien), and cultural nationalism. But he has been explicit about the importance of improving Canada's rather uneasy relations with the United States. 
A 16-page policy paper released after the convention sets as a priority ""attending to the security of our shared geography and common border"". This will involve developing a domestic security framework to co-ordinate the armed forces, police, intelligence and other agencies to deal with threats of terrorism--in effect a counterpart to America's Department of Homeland Security. Mr Martin plans a special cabinet committee to oversee Canadian-American relations, which he will chair.
A 50-strong group of Canadian and American military commanders is already making plans to co-operate against possible terrorist threats ranging from nuclear bombs on container ships to attacks on power grids. These plans may include an integrated maritime command. But Mr Martin has ruled out a joint immigration policy for border security. 
The other thing he wants to change is federal-provincial relations, always a battleground in Canada. Mr Chretien kept a wary distance from the provincial premiers. Mr Martin's first act as party leader was to fly to Saskatchewan to meet them all. They backed a planned national health council. The election this year of Liberal governments in Quebec and Ontario helps co-operation. So does the promise by Mr Chretien of dollops of new money for health care, a headache for the provinces. Mr Martin's soft-pedalling over implementation of the Kyoto protocol goes down well with Ralph Klein, the abrasive Conservative premier of oil-rich Alberta. 
Mr Martin has also hinted at ways in which he may try to please his party's left. Whereas Mr Chretien often bullied his parliamentary caucus, the new leader promises more debate, and more free votes, to address a ""democratic deficit"" in Parliament. He invited Bono, a rock singer, to speak to the Liberal convention, and seems to favour his pleas for further debt relief and increased aid for Africa. 
The big test will be how Mr Martin handles competing demands on the public finances. As finance minister, he cut taxes and the federal debt. He is pledged to do more of both. But he would find it hard to reverse increased health spending, even if he wanted to. He also wants to help Canada's cities, whose roads and services are deteriorating, by turning over to them a generous slice of petrol-tax revenue. 
Plenty of contradictions lie ahead for the new leader. How he handles them will decide whether his premiership is merely a bland coda to Mr Chretien's decade of dominance, or opens a vigorous new era of Liberal-led reform.","The new prime minister wants a new relationship with the United States -- and with Canada 's own provinces

POLITICS in Canada can often seem as staid and orderly as Ottawa, the country's pleasant but hardly cosmopolitan capital. Yet in the space of a few winter days in mid-December, Canada gained a new government and a new opposition. Paul Martin, the new prime minister, is a Liberal, like Jean Chretien, his long-serving predecessor. But with a sweeping reshaping of government, Mr Martin has done his best to disguise continuity as change--and to signal his desire for warmer relations with the United States. 
Days earlier, Canada's two right-of-centre parties, the Alliance and the Progressive Conservatives, merged into a single Conservative Party. If this is to offer an effective challenge to Mr Martin, and not end up as less than the sum of its parts, it will have to reassure supporters of both former parties that change will not come at the expense of continuity. 
Of Mr Martin's 38-strong ministerial team, only 16 were carry-overs from Mr Chretien's cabinet. Several of these may be stopgaps until the next election, when several old friends of the new prime minister may enter parliament. 
Mr Martin had both personal and policy reasons for wasting no time in placing his own stamp on the Liberal government. After nine years as Mr Chretien's finance minister, he quarrelled with his former boss last year over his leadership ambitions. That quarrel split the Liberal parliamentary caucus. The new cabinet has no place for ministers who remained staunchly loyal to Mr Chretien, or who supported other leadership candidates. 
The new line-up is also a balancing act which, Mr Martin confessed, cost him sleepless nights. It aims to signal some new policy priorities. One is to heal relations with the United States, which were damaged by Canada's abstention from the Iraqi war. Another is to reach out to two important provinces, Alberta and Quebec, whose leaders had been alienated by Mr Chretien's abrasive disregard. Mr Martin imposed an immediate freeze on most capital spending, to safeguard promised extra transfers to the provinces for health care; his minister of health and intergovernmental affairs, Pierre Pettigrew, will be emollient with the provinces.
The top appointment serves both purposes. Anne McLellan, a former law professor in Alberta, will be not only deputy prime minister but also hold the new job of minister of public safety. She will become Canada's link with Tom Ridge, the United States' secretary of homeland security. She will deal with security and policing, as well as national emergencies ranging from forest fires to epidemics. Unlike Mr Ridge, she will not handle immigration. But she will oversee a new border agency, whose task is to ensure the seamless passage of people and goods across the border. That is vital, since the United States takes 85% of Canada's exports.
Mr Martin will chair a new cabinet committee on relations with the United States. He has recruited as his parliamentary secretary Scott Brison, a Progressive Conservative MP opposed to his party's merger, who wants closer ties with the United States. David Pratt, the new defence minister, is an advocate of closer military co-operation, and of Canadian participation in missile-defence research.
Mr Chretien got on famously badly with George Bush. Here, too, Mr Martin will strive for balance. His policy instinct is for good relations with Washington. But he is mindful that most Canadians are critical of Mr Bush's foreign policy, and are wary of subservience to their powerful neighbour. 
Mr Martin was quick to congratulate the American president on the capture of Saddam Hussein. This helped smooth a telephone conversation between the two men on December 15th, steering it away from the touchy subject of Canada's apparent exclusion from the list of 63 allies allowed to bid on primary reconstruction contracts. This exclusion was ""difficult to fathom"", according to Mr Martin. 
The prime minister will also chair another new cabinet committee, on ""Canada and the world"". He has launched a review of foreign policy. The new justice minister, Irwin Cotler, is a human-rights lawyer from Quebec. All this suggests that Mr Martin may seek a more active international role than Mr Chretien, whose eyes were fixed firmly on local politics.
A winning team? Probably. Parliament will return in mid-February, and everyone expects a quick budget and then an election called for April. The new Conservative Party leader will not be chosen until March. According to a poll by Ipsos-Reid, the Liberals have the support of 48% of voters, and the merged Conservative Party just 21%. It has suffered several defections, especially among the Progressive Conservatives in eastern Canada. They fear that Stephen Harper, the skilful leader of the Alberta-based Alliance, will take over the merger. In the last election, in 2000, the Alliance won 25.5% of the vote, double that of the Progressive Conservatives. 
The new party's first job will be to consolidate, convincing doubters that the Alliance's muscular social conservatism can be melded with the centrist ""red Toryism"" of the Progressive Conservatives. Only then will the new party have a realistic chance of frightening the Liberals. So Mr Martin seems assured of at least one full term to show that he really is different from Mr Chretien.

QUEBEC CITY on its rocky bluff; Toronto by its lake; Ottawa and Winnipeg at the confluence of major rivers; most majestic of all, Vancouver stretched between mountain and ocean: Canada's cities are beautifully situated. But their public services are much less impressive. During his leadership campaign last year, Paul Martin, the new prime minister, pledged to find massive funds for urban renewal, and to improve the lot of Canada's increasingly restive urban-dwellers. Yet Mr Martin himself deserves a share of the blame for the cities' problems. 
As finance minister for nearly nine years, Mr Martin chopped billions from federal transfers to the provinces to help eliminate budget deficits. The provinces, in turn, offloaded responsibility for a range of social services to local municipalities, and cut their own cash transfers. Figures from the OECD show that, in 1995, federal and provincial funds made up 21.4% of municipal revenues; by 1999 they provided only 16.5%. To compensate, cities and towns raised property taxes sharply. Among federal states that the OECD monitors, the upper levels of government in Canada give least to their cities. 
Meanwhile, in population terms, Canadian cities have boomed. A century ago, 80% of the population was rural; today 80% of the country's 31m people live in towns and cities, and half are concentrated in five city-regions. When Canada was born in 1867 and its first constitution written, Toronto comprised some 50,000 citizens; today the Greater Toronto Area is home to 4.6m people, and may be the most cosmopolitan metropolis on the planet. Immigrants, now mostly from Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, almost all find their way to the bigger cities. But urban roads, sewers, policing, housing and health care have suffered as the demands placed on them have grown. 
Canada's constitution has not changed to reflect this urban growth: the cities are still creatures of the provinces. And the premiers of the ten provinces and three territories have not collectively accepted Mr Martin's view that Ottawa should offer direct funding to the cities. Quebec's government argues that it should receive the funds and decide how they are spent.
Urban legends
The cities, however, are revolting. The amalgamation of a dozen or so municipalities into mega-cities--undertaken by the provinces to cut their own costs--has helped to produce a new crop of mayors with big ideas and new influence. The election, in November, of David Miller as Toronto's reforming mayor gave extra strength to a coalition of uppity civic leaders. Glen Murray, mayor of Winnipeg, has called for a new deal to allow ""tax shifting"", along Scandinavian lines. He wants to cut property taxes in his city--which, unusually, has a stagnant population--arguing that homeowners and businesses pay too much for their services, and to make up the difference with user fees. For instance, he wants to introduce a liquor tax to bolster the police force, and a hotel tax to help build convention space and develop tourism. Some other mayors disagree. Dave Bronconnier of Calgary is happy to increase property taxes in his booming city and pour the cash into roads. 
What will Mr Martin do? More, he implies, than his predecessor, Jean Chretien, whose planned investment in urban infrastructure lagged well behind independent estimates of what is required to put the cities right. The new prime minister has hinted that he would allocate half the revenues from a federal fuel tax, worth C$2.5 billion ($1.9 billion) a year, directly to the cities. He has appointed John Godfrey, a well-regarded Ontario MP, as his urban adviser, and persuaded Mike Harcourt, a former premier of British Columbia and once mayor of Vancouver, to chair a high-powered advisory committee on urban issues. Both men will feed ideas to a special cabinet committee on cities, which Mr Martin intends to chair. Canada's mayors expect him to put his money where his mouth was during his campaign.

RATHER than the announcement of a legislative programme, it seemed like a manifesto for an early election. That was the opposition's view of the Throne Speech opening a new session of Canada's parliament on February 2nd. And the Liberal Party of Paul Martin, the new prime minister, did not deny it.
But in setting out the ground on which he will fight the election (likely to come once the snow has melted in May), Mr Martin faced a challenge. In nine years as finance minister under Jean Chretien, whom he succeeded in December, Mr Martin turned large budget deficits into surpluses partly by slashing transfers to the provinces, which run (most of) health and education. As prime minister, he seems to want to put behind him the image of a budget-cutting millionaire ship-owner on his party's right wing. 
So the speech was a lunge for the Liberals' habitual home in the broad centre ground, whence they have dominated Canadian politics for most of the past century. It included promises to improve health care, meet the standards set by the Kyoto protocol on the environment and tackle the decay of economically vibrant but cash-strapped cities. To give the appearance of change rather than continuity, the speech focused on issues and programmes that were overlooked or faltering under Mr Chretien. 
Mr Martin promises an overhaul of student loans, adding first-year college grants for poorer families; that may do more to attract younger voters than his predecessor's proposal to decriminalise marijuana (now dropped). He will set up a national public-health agency to co-ordinate efforts to combat global diseases such as SARS. And as promised in his leadership campaign, he offered cash to help cities build cheap housing and improve transport: C$580m ($440m) a year in rebates from the goods and services tax, with more later (perhaps from the federal petrol tax). But all this came from a warning that Canadians cannot spend their way to the promised land. There will be fiscal prudence and no return to deficits, he said. 
From the left, Jack Layton, who has revitalised the New Democrats in a year as their leader, accused Mr Martin of ""faking being a progressive"", pointing out that student debt had tripled while he was finance minister. From the right, Grant Hill, a doctor who is the interim leader of the newly unified Conservative opposition, complained that the extra C$2 billion that Mr Martin promised the provinces for health care was no more than ""a bucket of sand in a bomb crater"".
But the trickiest questions for Mr Martin concerned his plans to repair a ""democratic deficit"" in parliament with more free votes, stronger committees and an independent ethics commissioner. These moves are aimed at restoring public trust after several scandals during the Chretien years. The opposition scents a new one: last week, it was revealed that Canada Steamship Lines (CSL), the source of Mr Martin's fortune and now managed by his three sons, won government contracts worth C$161m over the past 11 years, far more than previously reported. Mr Martin denied any impropriety and asked the independent auditor-general to investigate.
The Liberals, Mr Martin said, are moving neither left nor right but forward. A May election would come only weeks after the Conservatives choose their leader. The latest poll gives the Liberals 48%. The Conservatives have sunk to 20%, and the New Democrats risen to 16%. Unless the CSL plot thickens, it does indeed look like full steam ahead for Mr Martin.

In nine years as finance minister under Jean Chretien , Mr Martin turned large budget deficits into surpluses partly by slashing transfers to the provinces , which run ( most of ) health and education . As prime minister , he seems to want to put behind him the image of a budget - cutting millionaire ship - owner on his party 's right wing . 
 So the speech was a lunge for the Liberals ' habitual home in the broad centre ground , whence they have dominated Canadian politics for most of the past century . It included promises to improve health care , meet the standards set by the Kyoto protocol on the environment and tackle the decay of economically vibrant but cash - strapped cities . To give the appearance of change rather than continuity , the speech focused on issues and programmes that were overlooked or faltering under Jean Chretien . 
 Mr Martin promises an overhaul of student loans , adding first - year college grants for poorer families ; that may do more to attract younger voters than Jean Chretien's proposal to decriminalise marijuana ( now dropped ) . He will set up a national public - health agency to co - ordinate efforts to combat global diseases such as SARS . And as promised in his leadership campaign , he offered cash to help cities build cheap housing and improve transport : C$ 580 m ( $ 440 m ) a year in rebates from the goods and services tax , with more later ( perhaps from the federal petrol tax ) . But all this came from a warning that Canadians can not spend their way to the promised land . There will be fiscal prudence and no return to deficits , he said . 
 From the left , Jack Layton , who has revitalised the New Democrats in a year as their leader , accused Mr Martin of "" faking being a progressive "" , pointing out that student debt had tripled while he was finance minister . From the right , Grant Hill , a doctor who is the interim leader of the newly unified Conservative opposition , complained that the extra C$ 2 billion that Mr Martin promised the provinces for health care was no more than "" a bucket of sand in a bomb crater "" . 
 But the trickiest questions for Mr Martin concerned his plans to repair a "" democratic deficit "" in parliament with more free votes , stronger committees and an independent ethics commissioner . These moves are aimed at restoring public trust after several scandals during the Chretien years . The opposition scents a new one : last week , it was revealed that Canada Steamship Lines ( CSL ) , the source of Mr Martin 's fortune and now managed by his three sons , won government contracts worth C$ 161 m over the past 11 years , far more than previously reported . Mr Martin denied any impropriety and asked the independent auditor - general to investigate . 
 The Liberals , Mr Martin said , are moving neither left nor right but forward . A May election would come only weeks after the Conservatives choose their leader . The latest poll gives the Liberals 48 % . The Conservatives have sunk to 20 % , and the New Democrats risen to 16 % . Unless the CSL plot thickens , it does indeed look like full steam ahead for Mr Martin .

Big suicide-bombs on consecutive days killed around 100 Iraqis. The first, in Iskandariyah, a town 25 miles (40km) south of Baghdad, killed at least 53 people queuing for work at a police station, while the second, in Baghdad, killed some 47 people applying to join the new army. There was speculation that the bombers may have been outsiders, perhaps connected to al-Qaeda.
Meanwhile a team led by the UN secretary-general's special envoy to Iraq, Lakhdar Brahimi, was assessing what kind of elections might be held in time to produce a provisional government by July 1st, when the Americans want to hand over power to Iraqis.
America restored its diplomatic presence in Libya for the first time in over two decades. Britain's foreign secretary, Jack Straw, after a meeting in London with Libya's foreign minister, Mohammed Abderrahman Chalgam, signalled that Tony Blair and Muammar Qaddafi might soon meet as well.
Israeli troops killed at least 15 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip in raids said by the Israelis to be aimed at hitting militants who have been attacking Jewish settlements.

Sudan's government said it had crushed the rebel forces fighting against it in the western region of Darfur, from which 800,000 people have fled in recent months. Rebels denied the claim. 
Kerry's winning streak
John Kerry won five more Democratic primary elections including two southern states, Tennessee and Virginia. Wesley Clark, a former NATO commander who made a late entry into the field, withdrew from the race. John Edwards and Howard Dean are hanging on.
George Bush said on TV that he ""expected to find weapons"" when he ordered the invasion of Iraq, a decision based on the ""best intelligence possible"". Later, the White House released 13 pages of military records to refute claims that Mr Bush had shirked his duty as a member of the National Guard during the Vietnam war.

France's National Assembly overwhelmingly approved a ban on the wearing of Muslim headscarves and other supposedly ostentatious religious symbols. The ban, supported by government and opposition parties, will become law later this year.
Serbia's quarrelsome political parties appeared to abandon efforts to form a coalition government. Another election is likely; hardline nationalists may do better than they did last December. The Serbs also denied claims by Carla Del Ponte, the Yugoslav war-crimes prosecutor, that Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader wanted in The Hague, was hiding in Belgrade.
The European Commission presented its proposals for the European Union budget over the seven year period from 2006. Against the wishes of the biggest contributors, which wanted to freeze spending, the commission suggested an increase of some 30%, mostly to pay for the new central European countries joining in May.

ONE of Paul Martin's first moves on taking over as prime minister in December was to kill off a scandal-plagued publicity drive launched by his predecessor, Jean Chretien, to bolster the cause of Canadian unity in French-speaking Quebec. The message Mr Martin hoped to send was that even though the Liberals have been in power for more than a decade, under his leadership they are making a fresh start.
No such luck. An excoriating report by the independent auditor-general released this month says the publicity programme was abused to funnel C$100m ($75m) of public money to Liberal cronies. Canadians got little in return. Their anger over the affair has wounded Mr Martin's fledgling government. Only last month the prime minister was seen as certain to call a spring election with the expectation of romping to an easy victory. Now, the polls suggest the Liberals would be lucky to hang on as a minority government (see chart). A spring election suddenly looks less likely.
The roots of the scandal go back to a 1995 referendum in Quebec, in which the province came within a whisker of seceding. To prevent a repeat, Mr Chretien launched the C$250m campaign to promote federalism at sporting and cultural events. This turned into a slush fund: much of the money went to friendly advertising firms and back to government agencies--minus a hefty commission. The auditor found faked invoices, double-billing, and extravagant payments without tenders or contracts. One firm was paid C$550,000 for a report no one has ever seen. 
Most of this was already known--journalists began exposing the story two years ago. But the auditor's report added details and underlined the scale of the scam. It was an ""outrageous"" and ""appalling"" scheme ""designed to put money"" into the Liberal-linked advertising firms, she said.
Nothing to do with me, has in effect been Mr Martin's largely sure-footed response. He ordered an independent inquiry and promised to testify before it. He asked a special counsel to find out exactly where the missing millions went (to pay the Liberals' campaign debts, say some). He fired Canada's ambassador to Denmark, Alfonso Gagliano, who as Mr Chretien's public-works minister was closest to the scandal.
In daily press conferences and on talkshows, Mr Martin repeated that although he was finance minister when most of the cheques were written, his job involved economic policy, not the minutiae of spending. True enough--but many Canadians are disinclined to accept this. 
Already one Liberal backbencher has quit the party. Ironically, Canadian unity, the ostensible object of the original exercise, could also be damaged. English Canada sees the scandal as an example of Quebec's traditionally grubby politics. In the province, the secessionist Bloc Quebecois leads the opinion polls after being written off for dead two months ago.","Sleaze changes the electoral calculations

LAST autumn, as Paul Martin prepared to replace Jean Chretien as Canada's prime minister, the divided right-wing parties were gloomily contemplating a second decade in opposition. So much has the political climate changed that the hurried merger of the Progressive Conservatives (PC) and the Canadian Alliance into a single Conservative Party has created a credible alternative to the Liberals.
The turnaround is partly due to the bursting of a sleaze scandal from the Chretien era, concerning a publicity campaign against separatism in Quebec which degenerated into a slush fund. That has damaged the Liberals. But it is also because the Conservatives' tricky merger went surprisingly well, thanks mainly to the negotiating skill of Stephen Harper, the Alliance leader. Despite his party's ties to social and fiscal conservatism, he persuaded Peter Mackay, the more centrist PC leader, that merger offered each their only hope of power. Mr Harper now stands a good chance of defeating two rivals to become leader of the merged party in a grassroots vote on March 20th. 
Though he grew up in Ontario, Mr Harper's base is in Alberta and the west. But he claims his role in the merger shows that he is a bridge-builder; he hints that he would offer the deputy-leader's job to Mr Mackay, who is from Nova Scotia. An economist who speaks fluent French, Mr Harper has tempered his past support for small government and a reduction in official bi-lingualism. Though 20 years younger than Mr Martin, he already has much parliamentary experience.
All of that gives him the edge over Tony Clement, who as Ontario's health minister dealt capably with last year's outbreak of the SARS respiratory disease in Toronto. The third candidate, Belinda Stronach, is an elegant political oddity. The chief executive of a car-parts firm, she makes a virtue of being a campaign novice. Her photogenic features have embellished the front pages for weeks. She stands slightly to the left of the other two on social policy, while promising to spend heavily on the armed forces. She has spent some of her fortune on signing up new party members in Quebec, a province that controls a quarter of the convention votes.
Whoever wins, the Conservatives will focus on ethical government and an assault on Liberal sleaze. All three leadership contenders also agree on the need for an elected Senate and some private health provision, and that the emotive subject of legalising same-sex marriages should be put to a parliamentary vote.
This spirit of unity means that the new party should come out of the convention having lost only a few ""Red Tory"" MPs such as Joe Clark, a former prime minister, while having gained 110,000 new members--and public support. The latest poll shows the Conservatives at 26%; the Liberals, at 38%, have slid ten points from their January peak.
That is worrying for Mr Martin. He had hoped to call an early election in May, partly to catch the newly-merged Conservatives before their policies were settled. Those plans have gone awry. On current polls, the Liberals would be reduced to a minority government. Never quick to take decisions, Mr Martin has called a by-election in Ottawa Centre, a difficult seat, for the distant date of November 29th. That suggests he might also postpone a general election until the autumn, giving time for the polls to change. Mr Harper, if it is he, has an opportunity.

WHEN British Columbia joined the new Dominion of Canada in 1871, it was promised a transcontinental rail link to the Atlantic by 1883. The railway was built late, and only after the territory threatened to secede. Ever since, western Canada has tended to regard itself as a resource-rich colony, exploited by the more developed and populous east: over-taxed, and neglected by the federal parliament and its spending programmes. Notwithstanding the contempt with which westerners have historically viewed his Liberal Party, Paul Martin, prime minister since December, has vowed to address this rancour across the Rockies. Unfortunately for him, a scandal has endorsed the worst western fears about eastern politicians.
Easterners like Mr Martin often dismiss western grievances as the grumbling of fat-cat British Columbians and Albertans, or of glum Saskatchewan and Manitoba farmers. But the evidence for what sociologists call ""western alienation"" is compelling. The Canada West Foundation (CWF), a think-tank, last year reported a ""deep-seated belief"" among westerners that ""the government of Canada doesn't listen [to them], doesn't understand, and doesn't care."" Last month a CWF poll found that 64.7% of westerners felt their province's interests were poorly or very poorly represented at the federal level.
Unusually for a Canadian prime minister, Mr Martin acknowledges that the syndrome exists. He gave the two top jobs in his cabinet to westerners, and says he wants to co-operate more closely with provincial premiers. Responding to noisy opinion in Alberta, he has agreed to consider replacing the archaic, appointed Canadian Senate with an elected body that might better represent regional interests. Putting his money where his mouth was, he last week announced a generous C$995m ($750m) federal bail-out for (mainly western) cattle producers hit by last year's mad-cow scare.
Mr Martin claims that the cash is motivated by need, not by politics. Perhaps. Canadian elections tend to be decided in populous Ontario and Quebec, which together command most of the parliamentary seats. Hence all the attention governments lavish on them. But the Canadian right is now re-united under the Conservative Party--whose new leader, Stephen Harper, is an adopted westerner--and seems likely to make big gains in Ontario in the election expected in June. So, pundits and psephologists argue, the Liberals now need to win in the west. 
That might be feasible, were it not for a scandal reminiscent of sleazy episodes under previous Liberal regimes. In February, a report disclosed how a government publicity drive, concocted under Jean Chretien, was abused to funnel C$100m to advertising firms linked to the Liberals. Mr Martin has been scrambling to distance his administration from its predecessor--firing tainted officials and setting up an inquiry--and to deny any involvement while he was minister of finance. But once again, as Phil Resnick of the University of British Columbia puts it, ""people out here are asking, 'Why should I trust those bastards?'""

George Bush delivered the first of six speeches intended to reassure voters that he has a clear plan for handing sovereignty back to the Iraqis at the end of June. At the same time, America and Britain circulated a draft UN Security Council resolution describing the powers of an interim Iraq government, but France and Russia said it was too vague and gave America too much control. Mr Bush said that the Abu Ghraib jail, where the abuse of Iraqi prisoners took place, would be demolished.
Muqtada al-Sadr, the anti-American cleric whose militia had occupied Iraq's holy city of Najaf, was reported to be preparing to withdraw his fighters.
At its annual summit, the 22-member Arab League--amid scepticism from Arab intellectuals--said its members would embrace political reform and promote women's rights.
In local elections, Lebanon's militant Islamist Shia party, Hizbullah, won more seats than any other.
Sudan's government signed a peace deal with rebels of the Sudan People's Liberation Army, bringing hopes of an end to a civil war that has lasted for decades. But bloodshed continues in a separate conflict in the western region of Darfur.
Namibia's president, Sam Nujoma, told a rally that some white people are ""snakes"" who want to recolonise the country. With an election looming, Mr Nujoma is overseeing aggressive land redistribution. He also sacked his foreign minister, Hidipo Hamutenya, who had been tipped to succeed him. 
Bingu wa Mutharika, a 70-year-old economist and protege of ex-President Bakili Muluzi, was sworn in as Malawi's new head of state after an election most observers deemed unfair. Brief riots ensued. 
Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe's president, called Nobel peace-prize winner Desmond Tutu an ""evil and embittered little bishop"", after Bishop Tutu criticised him. He also denied that his country was short of food or that his police tortured dissidents. 
India's new faces
India's new Congress-led coalition government took office. The nomination of a reformer, Palaniappan Chidambaram, as finance minister reassured markets, but the new line-up was criticised for lacking new faces. This week too, 33 people died in an attack on a bus in the disputed region of Kashmir.
Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, returned from North Korea with five children of surviving Japanese citizens abducted 25 years ago. He was criticised for agreeing to resume humanitarian aid without obtaining a convincing explanation of the fate of others who are thought to be dead.
Senior military officers from North and South Korea held talks aimed at reducing tension along the border. North Korea agreed to consider proposals to improve military communication. Further talks are expected next month.
Over four years after its exclusion, after a military coup in 1999, Pakistan was readmitted to the (formerly British) Commonwealth.
A chance for reform
As expected, Horst Kohler won election as the next president of Germany. The former boss of the IMF may help the cause of economic reform.
The UN high representative in the troubled Serbian province of Kosovo, Harri Holkeri, resigned. The former Finnish prime minister was in poor health, but he also complained that he had not had enough western backing. Two months ago violence erupted between Kosovo's Albanians and Serbs, setting back hopes for a peaceful future there.
In his annual state address to parliament, President Vladimir Putin promised once again to double Russia's GDP by 2010. Earlier, the Russians reached agreement with the EU over the terms for their accession to the WTO; in exchange, Mr Putin made renewed (but still vague) promises to ratify the Kyoto protocol on climate change.
A section of a new terminal building at Paris's Charles de Gaulle airport collapsed, killing four people. The cause is not yet known, but it is possible that the entire building will have to be pulled down.
America on alert
John Ashcroft, America's top law official, said that ""credible intelligence from multiple sources"" indicated that al-Qaeda is planning a big attack in America during the summer. But Tom Ridge, the homeland security secretary, said that there were no plans to raise the national level of alert from ""elevated"".
The Supreme Court ruled that David Nelson, a convicted killer on death row in Alabama, could appeal against the method of his execution. He argues that death by lethal injection is a ""cruel and unusual punishment"", given the damage to his veins from years of drug abuse.
The FBI issued a rare public apology to Brandon Mayfield and said it would review its guidelines for analysing fingerprints. A federal judge dismissed the case against Mr Mayfield, a lawyer from Oregon held in detention for an alleged connection to the Madrid bombings last March.
Boston's Catholic church announced that it was closing 65 of its 357 parishes. Archbishop Sean O'Malley said the decision was based on falling attendance. Last autumn, the archdiocese reached an $85m out-of-court settlement with victims who alleged sexual abuse by the clergy.
After the storm
Some 2,000 people were reported killed and thousands more made homeless on the island of Hispaniola after torrential rains triggered floods and landslides in a border area between the Dominican Republic and Haiti. 
Paul Martin, Canada's prime minister, called a general election for June 28th. Having succeeded Jean Chretien last December, Mr Martin is seeking a mandate of his own. But polls suggest his Liberal Party may be reduced to a minority government.

WHEN Paul Martin succeeded Jean Chretien last December as leader of Canada's Liberals, and thus as prime minister, he let it be known that he would seek an election within weeks. Although he had served as Mr Chretien's finance minister for a decade, the two men were bitter rivals and Mr Martin yearned for a mandate of his own. Only three years of a possible five-year term for the Liberals had elapsed, but an election seemed to make sense--at least to Mr Martin. His party was well ahead in the opinion polls, and the opposition was divided. Until a slowdown last year--partly induced by an outbreak of the SARS respiratory disease--Canadians had basked for several years in steady growth and balanced budgets.
Last weekend, Mr Martin at last called the election--for June 28th, two months later than planned. Why the delay? Over the past few months, sudden squalls have darkened the horizon for the Liberals. The opinion polls suggest that the ruling party may end up swapping a comfortable majority for a precarious minority government. Far from the confident gambit imagined in December, the election now looks like a panicky recognition that further delay risks heavier defeat. 
The Liberals have been in office since 1993. An end to their automatic hegemony is good for Canada. Two things have caused it. First, the country now has the makings of a national opposition, after the recent merger of the western-based Canadian Alliance with the Progressive Conservatives. The Liberals can no longer win by default. Second, they have been hurt by a corruption scandal involving a publicity campaign promoting federalism in Quebec which was used to funnel C$100m ($73m) to their cronies. It happened on Mr Chretien's watch, and Mr Martin was quick to call for an independent inquiry. But the affair has led some Canadians to conclude that the Liberals have been in power too long. Mr Chretien's decision to cling to office for 18 months after announcing his retirement smacked of putting personal ambitions above the country's needs. So, perhaps, does Mr Martin's thirst for his own mandate: he is prime minister, not president.
More competition among the parties means that the campaign ought to produce a debate over the policy choices Canada faces. It needs to maintain the trust of the United States by careful management of its disagreements with its powerful neighbour. The public health-care system, in many ways admirable, demands ever more cash. So does defence, neglected in recent years. The finances of many provinces are unravelling. But Canadian taxes are already higher than those in the United States--and Canadian incomes buy some 15% less than those of their southern neighbours.
How to keep health care healthy
Yet will voters actually hear serious discussion of these issues? The newly-merged Conservatives would like to see more private investment in the delivery of publicly-financed health care. So would the health minister, Pierre Pettigrew. But any sort of adult discussion of the reform of health care is considered politically explosive: for many Canadians, Medicare is a touchstone of national identity. So the Conservative leader, Stephen Harper, prefers to campaign against Liberal sleaze. This is in part, perhaps, because his own party is not yet an alloy: the old Red Tories of the Progressive Conservatives are unhappy with the small-government agenda and social conservatism of the former Alliance, from which Mr Harper comes.
For his part, Mr Martin, who as finance minister presented himself as a tax-cutting fiscal conservative, promises an extra C$3 billion a year for health and other social programmes--with no reforms attached. That may be because he knows he may have to form a coalition with the leftish New Democrats. 
Canadians deserve better than this. Their country has done well under the Liberals, forging a distinctive amalgam of a North American economy with a European welfare state, while remaining as open to migrants as the United States. But this balancing act requires a constant weighing of priorities. A competitive election should mean a serious debate, not sloganising and evading the issues. It is not too late to have one.","If he is to get it , it should be based on a serious debate

IN THE United States, televised campaign debates tend to be gladiatorial affairs between the two leading candidates. In Canada, they are a confusing brawl. In two debates this week, the first in French and the second in English, the leaders of the four main parties took turns to scrap against each other ahead of the vote on June 28th. That made it hard to point to a clear winner. Is that bad news for Paul Martin, the prime minister, who has moved from narrow favourite to struggling underdog?
The debate in French did settle one thing. Gilles Duceppe, leader of the separatist Bloc Quebecois, almost certainly clinched his hold over most of his province's 75 seats in the 308-seat House of Commons. Since his party wants to leave Canada, not govern it, he had the luxury of having nothing to defend. He attacked the prime minister for scandals over a decade of Liberal rule under Jean Chretien, when Mr Martin was finance minister, and for the supposed neglect of Quebec's industries. With neither the Liberals nor their chief opponents, the Conservatives, likely to win a majority, Mr Duceppe will hold great influence in the weeks ahead.
As the incumbent, Mr Martin was the main target of the other leaders in the debate in English. He suffered no knockout blow. He launched a furious attack on Stephen Harper, the Conservative leader, whose promises of lavish spending on the armed forces and health care as well as large tax cuts would punch a C$50 billion ($36 billion) ""black hole"" in the public finances, said the prime minister. He also posed unanswered questions as to whether the Conservatives would override the Charter of Rights to block abortion and same-sex marriages. 
It was not clear whether this was enough to halt Mr Harper's momentum. A poll by Ipsos-Reid taken on the eve of the debates gave the Conservatives 32%, the Liberals 31% and 17% for the leftist New Democrats. Mr Martin's hopes of winning more seats than the Conservatives depend on clinging on in Ontario, a traditional Liberal stronghold. Several of the Chretien loyalists, whom Mr Martin dismissed and angered when he became prime minister in December, have rallied to him. Is it too late? Many Canadians seem suddenly to have tired of Liberal rule. But while Mr Martin is down, he is not yet out.","The debates fail to land a knockout blow

SIX months ago, the civil servants and immigrants who make up many of the voters in Ottawa South seemed sure to choose David McGuinty as their next Liberal member of Parliament. The seat has been held for 16 years by John Manley, a former Liberal deputy prime minister. Mr McGuinty's father represented the constituency for many years in Ontario's provincial legislature, and his older brother Dalton swept to office last October to become the first Liberal premier in Canada's most populous province in more than a decade. 
Yet, as in many other places, the Liberals can no longer count on winning Ottawa South on June 28th, in Canada's most tightly fought general election in years. In the final week of the campaign, the Liberal support rallied (see chart). But the polls have been volatile, voters are in surly mood and a fifth of them remain undecided. So the Liberals will be hugely relieved if they can scrape up enough seats to form a minority government. 
Their chances of doing so depend on how they fare in Canada's three main population centres: Ontario, Quebec and the west. Compared with the last election in 2000 (see map), the Liberals have lost popularity in all three, but in each case for slightly different reasons.
Ontario is the biggest battleground. Since calling the election on May 23rd, Paul Martin, the prime minister and Liberal leader, has had to spend far more time in the province than his strategists had planned. He was there again this week, struggling to turn back a Conservative tide which has engulfed a swathe of small cities and rural areas across the centre of the province, from the outskirts of Ottawa in the east to Niagara Falls in the south and the university town of London in the west. 
At the last election, the opposition's divisions denied them seats in Ontario. This time, the merged Conservative Party could snatch up to 50 seats in the province, according to John Wright of Ipsos-Reid, a Toronto polling firm.
Far from being an asset, the McGuinty name has turned into a millstone for the Liberals, and not just in Ottawa South. Support for the Conservatives rocketed in late May after Dalton McGuinty broke a campaign promise to balance the province's books without raising taxes. He has imposed a ""health premium"" of C$50 ($37) a month on the average Ontario family to help finance ballooning Medicare costs. ""Voters are tired of people who say one thing before they're elected and another after they're elected,"" says Alan Riddell, a bilingual labour lawyer who is the Conservative candidate in Ottawa South. He is given a good chance of winning. 
The Liberals are also paying a price for Mr Martin's drive to grab the top job from his fellow-Liberal predecessor, Jean Chretien and, having done so, to ostracise his supporters. The Martin team's heavy-handed tactics have alienated local Liberal officials and volunteers. For example, the party executive in one Toronto constituency previously held by Mr Chretien's industry minister were dumbstruck when a Martin supporter showed up at the nomination meeting with 6,000 signatures. He won the nomination, but will be lucky to win the election. Few Chretien supporters have stepped forward to man phones or stuff envelopes in the campaign office. 
A surprise is the loosening Liberal grip on the political loyalty of immigrant Canadians. The Liberals have traditionally favoured immigration (including that of family members), and have doled out subsidies for an array of multicultural causes. But many among Ottawa South's large Muslim population are likely to cast their ballots next Monday for Monia Mazigh, of the left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP). Tunisian-born, she led a successful campaign last year to win the release of her husband who was deported by the United States to Syria as a suspected terrorist.
The NDP, under an energetic but garrulous new leader, Jack Layton, had hopes of a breakthrough in this election. But it may fall short of its target of ten seats in Ontario. There were signs that fear of a Conservative victory was driving leftish voters to the Liberal fold.
In Quebec, the Liberals were hoping that similar fears would blunt what looked like an impending massacre. One poll this week had Liberal support in the province plunging to 26%, against 50% for the separatist Bloc Quebecois. The Liberals could lose up to a score of seats in the province. But the outcome may not reflect a wider resurrection of support for secession in Quebec. Richard Schultz, a political scientist at McGill University in Montreal, points out that the Bloc has not made sovereignty an issue in the election. He says a defeat for the federal Liberals might even help Jean Charest's unpopular Liberal government in the province, allowing him to blame problems on Ottawa.
In western Canada, voters are accustomed to feeling like irrelevant bystanders: timezones mean that the election's outcome is usually determined before their votes have been counted. Not this time. The balance of power in Ottawa may depend on a three-way dogfight in British Columbia, where the latest poll gives the Conservatives 36%, ahead of the Liberals (28%) and NDP (26%). That has forced candidates to return to old-time campaigning, knocking on doors and holding local candidate debates. 
Mr Martin has drafted in two prominent recruits, David Emerson, a former businessman, and Ujjal Dosanjh, British Columbia's former NDP premier. He has also offered C$450m in extra money to help fix Vancouver's transport problems. But that is unlikely to assuage westerners' gripes about being ignored by Ottawa, nor break the Conservative ascendancy west of the Prairies.
Across Canada, the election has turned into a contest between fear and anger. Mr Harper has professed moderation on social and economic issues. He would devolve more power to the provinces. More controversially, he would pull out of the Kyoto protocol. Outside his political base of Alberta, many fear that his new party has inherited the social conservatism of its chief forebear, the Canadian Alliance. They worry that Mr Harper would make Canada more like the United States. 
On the other hand, Mr Harper's assault on the Liberals' ""waste, mismanagement and corruption"" has struck a chord with many voters. Whether their anger at the Liberals will be enough to outweigh their fear of change may not be clear until the last British Columbian votes are tallied.","A campaign that turns on the balance between anger and fear of change

Tunisian - born , she led a successful campaign last year to win the release of her husband who was deported by the United States to Syria as a suspected terrorist . 
 The NDP , under an energetic but garrulous new leader , Jack Layton , had hopes of a breakthrough in this election . But it may fall short of its target of ten seats in Ontario . There were signs that fear of a Conservative victory was driving leftish voters to the Liberal fold . 
 In Quebec , the Liberals were hoping that similar fears would blunt what looked like an impending massacre . One poll this week had Liberal support in the province plunging to 26 % , against 50 % for the separatist Bloc Quebecois . The Liberals could lose up to a score of seats in the province . But the outcome may not reflect a wider resurrection of support for secession in Quebec . Richard Schultz , a political scientist at McGill University in Montreal , points out that the Bloc has not made sovereignty an issue in the election . He says a defeat for the federal Liberals might even help Jean Charest 's unpopular Liberal government in the province , allowing him to blame problems on Ottawa . 
 In western Canada , voters are accustomed to feeling like irrelevant bystanders : timezones mean that the election 's outcome is usually determined before their votes have been counted . Not this time . The balance of power in Ottawa may depend on a three - way dogfight in British Columbia , where the latest poll gives the Conservatives 36 % , ahead of the Liberals ( 28 % ) and NDP ( 26 % ) . That has forced candidates to return to old - time campaigning , knocking on doors and holding local candidate debates . 
 Mr Martin has drafted in two prominent recruits , David Emerson , a former businessman , and Ujjal Dosanjh , British Columbia 's former NDP premier . He has also offered C$ 450 m in extra money to help fix Vancouver 's transport problems . But that is unlikely to assuage westerners ' gripes about being ignored by Ottawa , nor break the Conservative ascendancy west of the Prairies . 
 Across Canada , the election has turned into a contest between fear and anger . Mr Harper has professed moderation on social and economic issues . He would devolve more power to the provinces . More controversially , he would pull out of the Kyoto protocol . Outside his political base of Alberta , many fear that his new party has inherited the social conservatism of its chief forebear , the Canadian Alliance . They worry that Mr Harper would make Canada more like the United States . 
 On the other hand , Mr Harper 's assault on the Liberals ' "" waste , mismanagement and corruption "" has struck a chord with many voters . Whether their anger at the Liberals will be enough to outweigh their fear of change may not be clear until the last British Columbian votes are tallied .",20,Canada,A29-148,POST TERM,True,"his fellow - Liberal predecessor , Jean Chretien",3,True

IT WAS far from the powerful personal mandate that was Paul Martin's overriding goal ever since he replaced Jean Chretien as leader of Canada's Liberal Party and thus as prime minister late last year. But neither was it the drubbing that pollsters had predicted. The Liberals lost 37 seats in the general election on June 28th, and with them their majority in the House of Commons. But even after 11 years in power, they remain the largest party. Stephen Harper, the leader of the newly united Conservatives, saw his hopes of government dashed. Nevertheless, though the Liberal vote held up far better than opinion polls had suggested, the party was still humbled. ""The message was unmistakable: Canadians expected, and expect, more from us,"" said Mr Martin.
The prime minister insists he will eschew a formal coalition, and will lead a ""stable"" minority administration, seeking support where he can find it. A first-past-the-post electoral system in a country of strong regional differences means that Canada is familiar with minority governments, though it has not had one for a generation. Financial markets barely blinked. 
Most minority governments have lasted for 18 months or so. Some have done even better. At a post-election news conference, Mr Martin recalled that Lester Pearson, one of Canada's most revered prime ministers, led minority Liberal governments for five years in the 1960s.
The new balance of the parties is much as it was then, with one big exception. The separatist Bloc Quebecois won by a landslide in its French-speaking province--not from a surge in support for Quebec's independence, but because of anger over a scandal under Mr Chretien in which a programme to promote federalism turned into a slush fund for Liberal cronies. To regain the trust of Quebeckers, the Liberals will have to show ""honesty, integrity and a deep respect for taxpayers' dollars"", says Mr Martin, whose own seat is in Quebec.
Elsewhere, surprisingly little changed. In the popular vote, the Liberals led the Conservatives by 7.1%, and by 13% in Ontario, the most populous province. The leftish New Democratic Party (NDP) under Jack Layton, a vigorous new leader, almost doubled its share of the vote, but won only six more seats. 
What saved the day for the Liberals was that many voters in socially tolerant Ontario were scared of Mr Harper's Conservatives, a party cobbled together from his own right-wing Canadian Alliance and the more moderate Progressive Conservatives. The Liberals and the NDP succeeded in arousing fears that the Conservative platform concealed ambiguities on abortion and that neither Medicare nor the Charter of Rights and Freedoms would be safe in the party's hands. Mr Harper, a cerebral economist from oil-rich Alberta, had dominated the early weeks of campaigning with attacks on Liberal corruption. But he aroused ire when he suggested that Mr Martin was soft on child pornography.
After weeks of hesitant lethargy, Mr Martin came alive in the campaign's final days. He flung himself into a coast-to-coast dash to support candidates in tight fights. He began touting his successful record in ten years as finance minister under Mr Chretien, casting aside his previous pretence that the two men (who abhor each other) had no links. Meanwhile, Mr Harper, apparently confident of victory and having set a transition team to work, eased off; on the campaign's final day, he took a lengthy bus ride through Alberta. 
In the end, Canada swung slightly to the left, rather than to the right. At the last election, the vote for the two separate conservative parties totalled 38%; the merged party managed only 30%. The Liberals' most willing allies are the NDP; Mr Layton said he wants ""a significant role"". Between them the two parties will be just one seat short of a majority (or two, if they provide the speaker).
The leftward tilt is a challenge for Mr Martin, a businessman who as finance minister balanced Canada's books, cutting both taxes and spending. This week, he sounded sanguine. There was broad agreement on his top priority, more health spending, he said. He will seek support for his health-care plans at a meeting with provincial premiers. A promised child-care scheme should attract support from the NDP and the Bloc Quebecois, but both have a long wish-list of other new spending pledges. Clashes are likely, too, over defence (even though the hawkish defence minister lost his seat). Mr Martin wants Canada to take part in the Bush administration's plans for an anti-missile shield; the NDP and the Bloc are opposed. The NDP, but not the Bloc, will push for moves towards proportional representation.
Parliament is unlikely to be convened until late September, so Mr Martin has plenty of time to ponder. His first challenge will be to approve a budget next February. Otherwise, he will have to seek support issue by issue.
To do this, he has one big weapon. None of the other parties, except perhaps the NDP, would relish another election soon. The Bloc is unlikely to do as well next time. The Conservatives need time to consolidate their new party and steer it to the centre: they will hold a policy conference in September. Making the most of his weapon will require tactical skill of an order that has been invisible since Mr Martin took over the top job. Unless he now reveals it, the Liberals' defeat may just have been postponed.","The voters punish , but reprieve , the Liberals . Now the prime minister faces a difficult tactical challenge

CRAFTING a cabinet is always a particularly delicate balancing act for Canadian prime ministers. Regional, ethnic and gender considerations often prevail over aptitude and expertise. The challenge is that much greater for the rare prime minister who finds himself heading a minority government, as Paul Martin now does after a scolding from voters last month. Not only is the pool of potential candidates reduced, but with a sceptical electorate to impress and not much time to do it--minority governments in Canada are lucky to last two years--the opportunities for fine-tuning later are few.
Mr Martin's new cabinet, named on July 20th, includes much of his old one, assembled when he took over the party leadership and the prime minister's office from Jean Chretien last December. Its bulwarks are still the deputy prime minister, Anne McLellan, and the finance minister, Ralph Goodale, both staunch--if dull--loyalists .
But Mr Martin, whose desire to please everyone has often rendered him a ditherer, also made several bold moves--while ensuring that all the regions (though not women) were well represented. Chief among these was the appointment of Ujjal Dosanjh as health minister. Reforming the faltering state-funded health-care system is probably the most pressing problem facing the Martin government. It is also one which will have to be negotiated with the ten provinces. Mr Dosanjh is a neophyte Liberal MP but was once the premier of British Columbia under the banner of the left-leaning New Democratic Party, whose 19 federal MPs Mr Martin will frequently need to pass legislation. 
Mr Martin also made overtures to moderate Conservatives by naming a defector from their ranks to the influential post of public-works minister. Scott Brison quit the Tories after they merged last autumn with the western-based, socially conservative Canadian Alliance party. 
Mr Brison's appointment is also intended to send another signal. The feeble showing by the Liberals in the June elections was attributable in large part to public outrage over a scandal in which hugely padded contracts were handed out by the public-works department to Liberal-friendly advertising firms in Quebec. The naming of a former Tory to head the ministry is meant to show that the department will no longer be used for doling out largesse to Liberal faithful.
Mr Martin also hopes to mend fences within his own party by bringing back Stephane Dion, a Chretien loyalist formerly in charge of intergovernmental affairs as environment minister. The new intergovernmental affairs minister is Lucienne Robillard, also a Quebecker but a less fervent federalist, an indication that Mr Martin is intent on a more accommodating relationship than his predecessor with the provinces, especially Quebec. 
One victim of the reshuffle was Bill Graham, transferred from foreign affairs, where he was thought by many Canadians to be doing an exemplary job, to the ill-fitting defence ministry. Some explained the move by saying Mr Graham was out of step with Mr Martin on whether Canada should co-operate with the United States on a controversial plan for missile defences; others suggested Mr Martin simply wanted to give the plum foreign-affairs job--which went to Pierre Pettigrew--to a Quebecker.","Paul Martin reshapes his team

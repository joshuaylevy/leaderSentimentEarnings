OUT goes secularism and economic reform; in comes Hindu nationalism. After the stinging electoral defeat of the ruling Congress party, and the subsequent appointment as prime minister of the leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), it is natural to be nervous about India. The BJP is a chauvinist outfit, associated with anti-Muslim hatred and economic nationalism. It is little comfort that the manoeuvring currently going on (see page 35) may put the BJP in power for only a few weeks. The main alternative to a Bjp-led government seems to be one dominated by a coalition of leftwing parties, apparently opposed to further economic liberalisation. If they came to power, they would probably fall out before long, prompting another election in which the BJP might make further gains. 
There is indeed cause for concern in all this, but perhaps not for the reasons many people suppose. Although the pace of economic reform in India may well change, the general direction is unlikely to be reversed by any government, and even a BJP administration would be wary of provoking Hindu-Muslim violence at home. The real worry should be about relations with Pakistan and the danger that a weak BJP government would use an external ""threat"" to rally support. 
Worrying at home, terrifying abroad 
The main reason for remaining sanguine about economic policy is the record of the BJP in regional government. Despite the party's rhetorical commitment to economic nationalism, governments led by the BP in the states of Gujarat and Rajasthan have enthusiastically courted foreign investment. In some aspects of economic reform, such as privatisation, state governments led by the BJP have actually gone further than those led by Congress. The one big alarm was the decision by a coalition government in Maharashtra, dominated by the BJP and allies, to halt India's largest foreign-investment project, a power plant to be built by Enron of America. But now that confronting Enron has captured the necessary headlines, the deal is quietly being put back together again. 
Even the left-wing parties that may yet form the government have a record of economic reform at state level. Deve Gowda, the left's candidate for prime minister, is chief minister of Karnataka, which has become one of India's favourite states for foreign investors. A BJP or a leftist government, once in power, might well feel the need to make a gesture towards economic nationalism similar to the Enron affair. But any Indian government is likely, in time, to encourage private and foreign investment because it will inevitably face state coffers that are close to empty and a desperate need for cash to finance industry and infrastructure. 
When most people worry about the BJP, however, it is not the fate of economic reform that bothers them; it is the prospect of violent confrontation between India's Hindu majority and its 110m Muslims. The BJP has alarming links to a paramilitary militia, whose men were prominent when Hindu fundamentalists tore down a mosque at Ayodhya in 1992, sparking riots that killed thousands. Senior BJP leaders were present at Ayodhya and may be tempted to indulge their supporters' wishes to destroy yet more mosques. 
Even so, it is encouraging that in the recent campaign the BJp played down anti-Muslim rhetoric, and has now said it will not honour its more inflammatory pledges. The party's record of running state governments also offers some reassurance. In alliance with an even more chauvinistic party, Shiv Sena, the BJP has been running Maharashtra, India's most prosperous state, for over a year. There have been no riots there, nor much evidence of discrimination against Muslims. Indeed, Shiv Sena's leader is said to be on good terms with the Muslim criminal gangs of Mumbai (Bombay). 
Yet, though a BJP government in Delhi would probably not want to foment riots, if only because it would then have to cope with them, it might be tempted to externalise anti-Muslim sentiment by directing it at India's old enemy, Pakistan. The party's leaders have made bellicose noises about deploying an Indian nuclear bomb. Faced with political problems at home, they might well be tempted to use anti-Pakistani sentiment as a rallying cry. The prospect of a nuclear confrontation between a Hindu-nationalist government running India and a Pakistani government under pressure from Muslim fundamentalists in its armed forces is not entirely far-fetched. Power has moderated the BJP at state level. The world must hope that the same will be true if the party finds itself running the central government in Delhi.

They could soon go even worse. Mr Vajpayee has to submit his minority government to a vote of confidence in India's lower house of Parliament by May 31st. The vote may come even sooner, and he looks likely to lose it. 
The defeat, if it comes, will be at the hands of a motley group of opponents. These include the Congress party, which itself suffered a stinging defeat in the general election two weeks ago, and a fissiparous coalition of leftist and regional parties that has this week renamed itself-perhaps a touch optimistically the United Front. 
These parties and fragments of parties have between them 310 to 320 Mps. The BJP has thus far been able to muster only about 195, in the absence of a rush of defections from either Congress or the regional parties in the Front. 
The BJP's leaders had hoped that more mps would flock to their side once they were seen to be running a government. In an effort to play down the BJP's old firebrand image,Jaswant Singh, the urbane finance minister, has delivered robust and reassuring messages on economic reform and foreign investment that even his Congress predecessor, Manmohan Singh, could scarcely have faulted. 
The new minister for industry, Suresh Prabhu, has been sounding similarly responsible. Although he is a member of Shiv Sena, which is even more chauvinist in its defence of Hindu interests than its ally the BJP, Mr Prabhu is best known as an entrepreneur and chairman of India's largest cooperative bank. He talks of reforming the public sector and wants to encourage foreign investment, albeit under close government control: ""We don't want just to welcome foreign investors with garlands at the airport. We must also guide them through the bylanes of India,"" he says. 
But by showing his government's moderate face, Mr Vajpayee has already alienated some of his own rank and file, while nonetheless failing to command the extra support he needs from other parties in Parliament. Extremists on the right have already accused Mr Singh of going soft on foreign investment. They are also worried that pet projects, such as rebuilding a controversial Hindu temple at Ayodhya in northern India, on the site of a mosque destroyed by rioters in 1992, might be shelved. And Mr Vajpayee will have angered them further by giving the important foreign-affairs portfolio to Sikander Bakht, the only Muslim in his cabinet. Mr Bakht will combine this job with the less glamorous post of minister for urban affairs and employment. 
But not perhaps for long. The opposition is likely to succeed in bringing Mr Vajpayee's government down. If-or rather when-the BJP government falls, India's president, Shanker Dayal Sharma, must decide whom to invite next to try to form a government. Logically, he would turn to the Congress, which is the next largest single party. 
However, Narasimha Rao, the Congress leader, would almost certainly refuse, preferring to stay on the sidelines for a little longer after his party's defeat in the general election. Mr Sharma had dinner with all the party leaders earlier this week, so Mr Rao may have already indicated this. 
That leaves the United Front, which, sensing power, got its act together on May 22nd and formally elected Deve Gowda, a little known regional politician who is chief minister of the state of Karnataka, as its parliamentary leader. To take up that post, and become prime minister, Mr Gowda would have to give up the chief ministership and be elected to Parliament. Mr Gowda's reputation in Karnataka is of a compulsive politician, but he has no political pull nationally and might be no match for the wily Mr Rao on whose support he would have to depend.

Atal Behari Vajpayee, India's shortest-serving prime minister, wound up a noisy debate in parliament with a flamboyant speech. Without waiting for a confidence vote that he knew would go against him, he walked out of the chamber, announcing he was off to present his resignation to India's president, Shankar Dayal Sharma. 
Moving at a speed rare in Indian public life, Mr Sharma immediately invited Deve Gowda, a little-known regional politician from southern India and leader of the United Front, to form a government. Mr Gowda was due to be sworn in on June ist. His Front consists of a motley collection of 13 broadly leftist and regional parties. The Congress party, which lost power in the May general election, will support it, but not take part in the government. Providing Mr Gowda can keep his partners happy with ministerial jobs and policy compro mises, he will have no problem surviving a vote of confidence required by June 12th and may even be in power for a year or so. 
Mr Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) could not muster parliamentary support primarily because it has a strong Hindu-nationalist base that makes possible supporters frightened about the risk of communal disturbances. However, Mr Vajpayee has added to his reputation as a responsible and practical politician. One of his government's few actions was to persuade the state government of Maharashtra, which is run by a coalition of the BJP and the even more Hindu-fundamentalist Shiv Sena, to reopen an official inquiry into the 1993 anti-Muslim riots in Mumbai (Bombay) that had been abandoned. 
The 13 parties of the United Front and their Congress supporters were brought together after the election by a common desire to oust the BJP government. Now they have a common interest in staying united under Mr Gowda because, together, they can wield power and avoid an election that would be universally unpopular. Mr Gowda has pledges of support from 19o members of Parliament which, together with 136 CongressMPS, far exceeds the BJP's 194. Eventually, the bonds will break-probably when either Congress or the BJP has managed to steal enough MPs from the Front or each other to bid for power. 
This seems unlikely to happen until well into next year at the earliest. The BJP has had its turn, and Congress is in no state to face an election, nor to form a government. So the Congress party will allow the United Front to retain power for some time. It is also in the Front's interest not to destabilise Congress. 
The United Front (which fought the election as the National Front-Left Front) is dominated by three national parties, the leftist Janata Dal and two Communist parties, which together have 86 mrs. There are also 26 dissidents from Congress, plus smaller parties based on caste and leftist politics. A new factor is provided by regional parties from the states of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Assam (with 38 Mrs) which have linked with the Front since the election and have been asserting a degree of regional political power not seen in India for many years. 
Mr Gowda, who has been the Janata Dal chief minister of Karnataka, was chosen as the Front's candidate for prime minister on May i4th not by the Front's Mrs, but by a cabal of other chief ministers (none ofthem Mrs) from states such as Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Bihar and West Bengal. These ambitious barons will want to influence the policy of the new government, especially on devolution of power from Delhi to the state capitals. Some of them also want Mr Gowda's administration to bail their states out of financial trouble. 
With such a mix of interests, and coming so soon after an election in which the parties attacked Congress policies, drafters of the Front's programme have had difficulty this week reaching compromises. Social, defence and foreign policies are likely to follow broadly those of the former Congress government. Congress has said that its support is conditional on continuation of its reform programme; but that need not cause much difficulty because Congress itself ducked urgently needed action on taxation, subsidies and the public sector. There is also agreement on boosting rural development, small firms and the alleviation of poverty. 
The differences over foreign investment have been more important. Infrastructure might be favoured and consumer goods penalised. However, two of the Front's leaders would argue against a restrictive approach. Mr Gowda has blazed a foreign-investment trail in Karnataka. P. Chidambaram, a reformist commerce minister in the last Congress government, is now a leader of a group of dissident Congress MPs allied with the Front Mr Chidambaram is being tipped for a senior government position, possibly his old commerce post or even finance minister, unless Mr Gowda is keeping that job for himself.

 The United Front ( which fought the election as the National Front - Left Front ) is dominated by three national parties , the leftist Janata Dal and two Communist parties , which together have 86 mrs . There are also 26 dissidents from Congress , plus smaller parties based on caste and leftist politics . A new factor is provided by regional parties from the states of Andhra Pradesh , Tamil Nadu and Assam ( with 38 Mrs ) which have linked with the Front since the election and have been asserting a degree of regional political power not seen in India for many years . 
 Mr Gowda , who has been the Janata Dal chief minister of Karnataka , was chosen as the Front 's candidate for prime minister on May i4th not by the Front 's Mrs , but by a cabal of other chief ministers ( none ofthem Mrs ) from states such as Andhra Pradesh , Tamil Nadu , Bihar and West Bengal . These ambitious barons will want to influence the policy of the new government , especially on devolution of power from Delhi to the state capitals . Some of them also want Deve Gowda's administration to bail their states out of financial trouble . 
 With such a mix of interests , and coming so soon after an election in which the parties attacked Congress policies , drafters of the Front 's programme have had difficulty this week reaching compromises . Social , defence and foreign policies are likely to follow broadly those of the former Congress government . Congress has said that its support is conditional on continuation of its reform programme ; but that need not cause much difficulty because Congress itself ducked urgently needed action on taxation , subsidies and the public sector . There is also agreement on boosting rural development , small firms and the alleviation of poverty . 
 The differences over foreign investment have been more important . Infrastructure might be favoured and consumer goods penalised . However , two of the Front 's leaders would argue against a restrictive approach . Deve Gowda has blazed a foreign - investment trail in Karnataka . P. Chidambaram , a reformist commerce minister in the last Congress government , is now a leader of a group of dissident Congress MPs allied with the Front Mr Chidambaram is being tipped for a senior government position , possibly his old commerce post or even finance minister , unless Deve Gowda is keeping that job for Deve Gowda .",750,India,A29-8251,IN TERM,True,"Deve Gowda , a little - known regional politician from southern India and leader of the United Front ,",12,True

Mr Lal, the new governor of Haryana, acknowledges some of the problems with his policy of prohibition. He argues that the ""stick"" alone is not enough; it will be combined with an educational campaign conducted by voluntary organisations. He also wants five neighbouring states to ban alcohol sales within three kilometres (two miles) of Haryana's borders. 
Public finances are a bigger problem.

The chief minister, Chandrababu Naidu, says he would like prohibition introduced nationally, but Deve Gowda, India's new prime minister, says prohibition is constitutionally a state issue Mr Gowda knows that Mr Naidu really wants him to bail out Andhra Pradesh's government, and he does not want to set a precedent, especially when Mr Lal is about to ask the central government to cover half the 4 billion-5 billion rupees of excise duties that Haryana expects to lose annually. So Mr Naidu now has to review his policy. 
He may decide to allow major brands to be sold for consumption at home and in hotels, while continuing to ban public drinking and all sales of crude village spirit, known as arrack. That could restore a third of his lost excise duties.

India certainly matters to Star. It provides one out of three of Star's viewers and about 40% of its revenues (Taiwan comes next with 37%). Moreover, Star has recently bought a building of 60,000 square feet (5,600 square metres) in Mumbai (Bombay), to be used as its Indian operating headquarters. But Gene Swinstead, Mr Murdoch's top man in India, says the building is too near to Mumbai airport to be used to beam programmes up to satellites.

But Beijing is harder to jilt than Britain's print unions. News Corp noted China's furious reaction when Jardine, one of Hong Kong's largest groups, delisted from Hong Kong and transferred to the Singapore stock exchange.

It already produces Hindi extravaganzas in Mumbai, Tagalog rock in Manila and Kung Fu movies in Taipei. 
The new Mumbai building will include three digital-editing areas and a large studio. Provided the satellite capacity exists, beaming down targeted programming of this sort delights advertisers (and allows Star to sanitise its broadcasting in politically prickly countries). 
At present, most material produced around Asia is airfreighted to Hong Kong to be beamed up. Star's long-term plan is to increase the amount of programming beamed up directly from the recipient countries. In India, this is currently allowed only on a case by case basis: Mr Swinstead has just applied to uplink this month's budget speech, which pulls in strong advertising revenue, so it can be shown live on Star Plus for the second year running.

The idea is that only hard-driving Asians can produce growth rates of 7-8% a year; Indians take things more slowly and are stuck at 4-5% a year. The latest figures, suggesting the economy grew at 7% in the past fiscal year, put a dent in this myth. The new finance minister, Palaniappan Chidambaram, wants to keep up the denting. In his first budget, presented on July 22nd, he announced tax cuts designed to generate economic growth of 7% and attract foreign direct investment of $10 billion annuallyfive times as much as last year. 
As if to drive home the point that India's new economic openness is here to stay, two days before the budget the government cleared foreign-investment proposals worth $1.7 billion in total. Among them was an $8oom investment by Coca-Cola, the second-biggest in India by a foreign company. Famous purveyors of American junk food, such as Kentucky Fried Chicken, have attracted raucous left-wing protests in the past. But on this occasion there was not even a whisper of opposition. 
Mr Chidambaram's instincts are radial Rut the new government is a coalition of 13 parties, many of which castigated economic reform when its was started five years ago. The finance minister had to keep his political allies on board while preserving the direction of reform. So far he has broadly succeeded in doing both, although he has had to pay a price in terms of such undesirable measures as muddled tariff changes and increased farm subsidies. 
Mr Chidambaram has cut import and excise duties and the capital-gains tax. But he has also brought in a minimum tax on companies that escape paying tax altogether by exploiting loopholes. The new tax, intended to bring in 16 billion rupees ($457m) of much-needed revenue, has proved unpopular with the stockmarket. 
The tariff cuts are smaller than some had hoped. Mr Chidambaram was expected to reduce the maximum import duty from so% to 4o%, but made only piecemeal, albeit wide-ranging, cuts. All told, they should lower the effective tariff rate by around 7%. Confusingly, he simultaneously slapped a 2% surcharge on all imports to raise extra revenue, so the maximum rate rises to 52%. 
Similar muddles cropped up elsewhere in the budget. Mr Chidambaram chose to make his mark by concentrating on three areas: infrastructure, farming and basic services. He said, rightly, that continued economic growth of 7% would be impossible without much better infrastructure and announced a range of measures-from new spending on roads to tax holidays for investors-aimed at building it. But the real impediment to private investment in this area is a lack of clear rules, and the new government has yet to frame these. 
The budget provides an extra 25 billion rupees for basic needs such as primary education and health care. Yet enormous amounts are already spent in these areas, and Mr Chidambaram had nothing to say about the corruption and inefficiency that ensures that so much is wasted. The new aid to help state governments complete irrigation projects, and provide new subsidies for fertilisers, power and irrigation, may be no better spent. Most of the money will go to relatively rich farmers, not the truly needy. But once again politics played its part. Deve Gowda, the prime minister, has his base among the dominant peasant castes, and has made sure that they are rewarded. 
When a finance minister cuts duties and increases subsidies and public spending, he generally creates a fiscal problem. Yet Mr Chidambaram says he will cut the budget deficit from 5.9% of GDP to 5%. He thinks he can do this because of the buoyancy of tax revenues in an economy growing at 7%. Yet pressure for extra spending will come from all parts of the coalition, and could empty the treasury unless he stands firm. Total public-sector borrowing, including borrowing by state governments and public-sector companies, still exceeds 10% of GDP, and interest payments gobble up 47% of all government revenue-up from 39% five years ago.

By the subcontinent's standards, the influx is small. Yet it is causing anxiety because it may herald a new attempt by the Tamil Tigers to gain a foothold in India. 
Tamil Nadu has a population of 56m, nearly all of it Tamil. When ethnic violence flared up in Sri Lanka in 1983, Tamil Nadu, with the support of the Indian government, gave sanctuary, training and arms to the Tigers, who sought, as they still do, an independent state in the northern part of Sri Lanka. They were lionised in Tamil Nadu as heroic freedom fighters. In 1987, Rajiv Gandhi, then India's prime minister, negotiated a deal with Sri Lanka to give autonomy to the Tamil areas of the country in return for an end to the insurrection; an Indian peacekeeping force would supervise the arrangement. But the Tigers insisted on independence and refused to lay down their arms. They harried the Indian peacekeepers, who suffered heavy casualties and eventually left. 
The Tigers continued to get support from some parties in Tamil Nadu, notably the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK). But the Tigers' relations with the Indian government in Delhi worsened. The DMK state government was sacked in 1991 for aiding the Tigers. The Tigers struck back in 1991 by murdering Gandhi, but did themselves no good. The Indians cracked down on the Tigers in Tamil Nadu, killing some leaders and chasing the rest out of the country. The DMK was virtually wiped out in the state-assembly election that followed. 
The DMK is back in power today. It is the senior partner in an alliance that won the state election in May. It is also a member of the ruling coalition in Delhi. The party is now more cautious about expressing support for the Tigers, but Tamils know where its heart lies. So, inevitably, there is speculation that the DMK chief minister of Tamil Nadu, M. Karunanidhi, will help the Tigers as much as he can. 
Some of the refugees landing in Tamil Nadu this month were reported to have been ordered to go by the Tigers. But India says it has no evidence of an infiltration plot. Neverthless, the Tigers may want to revive sympathy for their cause in Tamil Nadu by sending batches of forlorn refugees across the strait. Tamil newspapers in the state are full with photographs of refugees huddled miserably on the beaches after arrival. However, India's prime minister, Deve Gowda, wants no truck with the Tigers. And Mr Karunanidhi has said he does not intend to get sacked a second time for being in cahoots with terrorists.

When ethnic violence flared up in Sri Lanka in 1983, Tamil Nadu, with the support of the Indian government, gave sanctuary, training and arms to the Tigers, who sought, as they still do, an independent state in the northern part of Sri Lanka. They were lionised in Tamil Nadu as heroic freedom fighters. In 1987, Rajiv Gandhi, then India's prime minister, negotiated a deal with Sri Lanka to give autonomy to the Tamil areas of the country in return for an end to the insurrection; an Indian peacekeeping force would supervise the arrangement. But the Tigers insisted on independence and refused to lay down their arms. They harried the Indian peacekeepers, who suffered heavy casualties and eventually left. 
The Tigers continued to get support from some parties in Tamil Nadu, notably the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK). But the Tigers' relations with the Indian government in Delhi worsened. The DMK state government was sacked in 1991 for aiding the Tigers. The Tigers struck back in 1991 by murdering Gandhi, but did themselves no good. The Indians cracked down on the Tigers in Tamil Nadu, killing some leaders and chasing the rest out of the country. The DMK was virtually wiped out in the state-assembly election that followed. 
The DMK is back in power today. It is the senior partner in an alliance that won the state election in May. It is also a member of the ruling coalition in Delhi. The party is now more cautious about expressing support for the Tigers, but Tamils know where its heart lies. So, inevitably, there is speculation that the DMK chief minister of Tamil Nadu, M. Karunanidhi, will help the Tigers as much as he can. 
Some of the refugees landing in Tamil Nadu this month were reported to have been ordered to go by the Tigers. But India says it has no evidence of an infiltration plot. Neverthless, the Tigers may want to revive sympathy for their cause in Tamil Nadu by sending batches of forlorn refugees across the strait. Tamil newspapers in the state are full with photographs of refugees huddled miserably on the beaches after arrival. However, India's prime minister, Deve Gowda, wants no truck with the Tigers. And Mr Karunanidhi has said he does not intend to get sacked a second time for being in cahoots with terrorists. ",750,India,A29-8251,,False,,0,True

Four years ago eight ""fast-track"" foreign-financed power projects were announced. All are badly needed in a country where the shortage of electricity hinders growth. In August 1995 politicians in Maharashtra state cancelled one of them-a 740MW electricity project being built by Enron, a Texan company-putting the whole idea of private power into jeopardy. Yet, a year later, one of the original eight projects, in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, is producing electricity; construction work is due to resume soon at Enron's site; and the other six projects should get the go-ahead by the end of September. 
The reasons for the new urgency? Deve Gowda, India's prime minister, has been taking a personal interest in electricity, and individual states, pushed by the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, are keen to reform the power sector. The most advanced is Orissa, which aims ultimately to hand over generation, transmission and distribution to competing private utilities. 
The need for reform is obvious to anybody who has experienced India's chronic power shortages: at peak periods, demand exceeds available power by more than 20%. The current installed capacity of 81,000MW is working at only about 60% efficiency, and public money is scarce to finance the extra 140,000MW which will be needed over the next decade. India's state electricity generation and distribution boards, which account for more than 70% of the country's supply, are expected to run up losses of$2.2 billion this year. 
Since 1992 a mere 14 private-sector projects (or 3,500MW of capacity) have been started. Yet many of these schemes remain politically sensitive. In Enron's case, the project is going ahead only because the Texan company accepted a new contract from the local government in Maharashtra with lower power tariffs. Enron now expects to finalise all its financial agreements within the next few days, which should enable it to restart construction work at the site next month-subject to one outstanding court case. 
Five of the other ""fast-track"" projects have also been re-negotiated, and are once again bound for the Delhi bureaucracy. Like Enron, they need the central government to issue a ""counter guarantee"" which will underpin commitments from the state electricity boards. A 1,000Mw project in Mr Gowda's home state of Karnataka, which is being promoted by Cogentrix, an American firm, and China Light & Power of Hong Kong, has become the next test case. 
The other two fast-track projects are already under construction without waiting for counter guarantees. The project in Andhra Pradesh has been producing electricity for more than a month. It signed a counter guarantee for the $zoom debt portion of the $28om project this week. ""If you wait till everything is agreed,"" says G.V. Krishna Reddy, a wealthy non-resident Indian from the United States who is the project's chief backer, ""costs go up and it'll still take you three or four years to build."" 
In fact, Mr Reddy's ability to build the power plant without counter guarantees reflects two things: influence and size. His excellent Indian contacts helped persuade various Indian financial institutions to lend money even though there was no counter guarantee. And his project produces only 250Mw. These smaller power projects seem to be easier to build, finance and approve-and to provoke less political controversy. If only in the Indian electricity industry, small is still beautiful.

But tinkering with India's internal borders could be a tricky business. Mr Gowda's plan to create a new state of Uttarakhand, by cutting a sliver off India's most populous state of Uttar Pradesh, risks stirring up dormant separatist movements in states across India, with potentially chaotic consequences. 
To the prime minister, however, the creation of Uttarakhand probably seems like a useful political ploy. He bundled the scheme together in his Independence Day speech with a populist pledge to provide cheap rice for the poor. Both plans enjoy strong support in Uttar Pradesh, which will hold state assembly elections at the end of the month. A strong showing in Uttar Pradesh, which has a population of 14om, would bolster Mr Gowda's precarious position as leader of a fractious coalition government without a majority in the national parliament in Delhi. 
Giving Uttarakhand the go-ahead would relieve Uttar Pradesh of a constant trouble spot. Since 1994, successive state governments have made pleas to the centre for the creation of a state of Uttarakhandapparently feeling that the loss of a small group of malcontents could only be a boon. Most ofthe 4m inhabitants ofthe proposed state also seem to want independence, believing that the state government has ignored them to concentrate on the development of the plains. 
So where is the harm? Possibly in the fact that the proposal has already brought a flood of similar secessionist claims from India's many other restless regions. The plan for Uttarakhand has reinvigorated the flagging Gorkha separatist movement in West Bengal, despite the creation of an autonomous ""Hill Council"" within the state in 1994. Various groups in Assam and Bihar, also pacified by limited autonomy granted in the past couple of years, have renewed their agitation for statehood. These movements, which have caused chaos and cost thousands of lives in violent protests over the past decade, now threaten to disrupt the country once again. 
Not that India's state borders are sacrosanct: with a population bigger than that of France and Germany put together, Uttar Pradesh has become a cumbersome unit. In all Indian states, voters decry aloof and incompetent centralised bureaucracies. Supporters of new states point to the 1950s and 196os, when the central government redrew the entire map of India with great success. But that reorganisation rested on a single coherent principle, of boundaries delineated by language. 
The present government has articulated no such principle in the case of Uttarakhand. Locals speak Hindi, just like the other inhabitants of Uttar Pradesh. Although the area's upper-caste Hindus have been particularly hard hit by the state's affirmative-action policies, so they have in many other regions. Only its mountainous terrain distinguishes Uttarakhand from the rest of Uttar Pradesh. 
Armed with similarly vague rationales, other parties are rushing pell-mell into statehood schemes. The Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party(BJP) alone proposed five new states in its most recent manifesto, all in areas where it enjoys strong support. Should the proposed states come into being, the BJP could expect to control their assemblies, rather than feuding with its rivals in today's larger units. 
Faced with such tempting opportunities, only two parties have spurned the statehood craze. Both the Congress and the Communists have already had their fingers burnt by separatist movements in areas under their rule. The Congress government at the centre spent much of the 1980s repressing violent insurgencies in the north-eastern hill states. The Communists in West Bengal continue to face the disruption caused bythe Gorkhaland protests.

Many are betting that it will not last seven more. Its main foe is an old man in a hurry, Sitaram Kesri, who at the age of 78 has recently taken over the presidency of Congress, the largest opposition party. Mr Kesri wants to be prime minister and, at his age, he does not want to wait too long. 
The coalition government, a rag-tag collection of 13 leftist, regional and minor parties, came to power soon after the general election in May. The biggest winner in the election was a group of Hindu-nationalist parties, led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which took 195 of the 543 seats in Parliament. The BJP formed a minority government, but was isolated by the secular parties and quickly lost. 
Congress, which had ruled India almost continuously since the country's independence, came second, but with only 140 seats, compared with 232 in the previous parliament, so it was seen as the big loser. Accordingly, it was left to 13 other parties with 178 seats between them to cobble together a ""United Front"" government, the unifying cement being their shared determination to keep the BJP out. With similar feelings about the BJP, Congress agreed to support the minority government. 
Quarrels have divided the United Front from day one. The leftist parties oppose privatisation and think that Deve Gowda, the prime minister, has been too soft on Narasimha Rao, his Congress predecessor, who faces a variety of corruption charges. But these quarrels, though noisy, are unlikely in themselves to cause the government's collapse. The four left-wing parties, which are the most fractious, have only 52 seats and none of the regional parties in the coalition has more than 2o. The government could survive defections from the leftist or the regional groupings, so long as Congress continues to vote with it 
That is the big if Before Mr Kesri came on the scene, Congress leaders seemed prepared to bide their time, since they saw little prospect of improving their fortunes in a fresh election. But after Mr Rao was charged with corruption, he resigned as president of the Congress party. In September, he was succeeded by Mr Kesri, who does not disguise his desire to become prime minister. He has a four-stage plan to manipulate himself into power. 
First, he needs to reunite all the splinters of Congress, making it the largest single party in Parliament, with 165 seats (the Bjp has only 16o). Second, he needs to replace Mr Rao as leader of the Congress parliamentary party. After this, he plans to withdraw support from the United Front, and wait for the president to ask him, as head of the largest party, to form the next government. Lastly, he hopes to seduce most regional and minor parties from the United Front and so win a majority. 
None of this will be as easy as it sounds. Mr Kesri has won back two Congress splinter groups, but what really matters, because it holds 20 seats in Parliament, is the splinter in the state of Tamil Nadu. The trouble is that this lot owes its success there to its conversion into a regional party. It would lose much of its support if it rejoined Congress. Moreover, it already holds two cabinet posts, including the finance minister's, and Mr Kesri cannot offer it much more. But, without it, Congress cannot become the largest party in Parliament. 
Nor will Mr Kesri find it easy to dislodge Mr Rao from his remaining job, as leader of the parliamentary party. Although Mr Rao has led Congress to defeat and has now been charged with corruption, his party has no tradition of removing a sitting leader. He will not go quietly, and Mr Kesri dare not push things to a split, which would ruin his chances of inheriting a united party. 
Even if the first three stages of Mr Kesri's scheme went according to plan, it is by no means certain that the regional and minor parties would give their support to him. Why should they, when Congress is their main rival in their states? 
So the fall of the United Front could lead to parliamentary deadlock and a fresh election, in which the BJP would probably make the biggest gains. Nonetheless, many in Congress expect Mr Kesri to make his move in mid-1997. However small his chance of making the history books, it is his only chance. 
For the government, all this is proving paralysing. No big economic changes have taken place, or are in prospect. But that does not mean that all is well, especially on the budget front. The central government's budget deficit was 5.9% of GDP last year. Add the borrowing of state governments and public-sector corporations, and the combined deficit was close to 10% of GDP. The finance minister has promised to cut the central deficit to 5%, but is getting no cooperation from other ministers. He wants to raise oil prices (which are governmentcontrolled) in line with world prices, but his coalition partners have said no, because it would make them unpopular. In consequence, state oil companies will be in debt to the tune of almost $3 billion (1.5% of GDP) by the end of the fiscal year in March. 
In India, any government under threat puts off hard decisions and tries to buy popularity. The finance minister is trying to limit giveaways, but without much success. The railway and telecoms ministers have granted additional bonus payments to their employees, and state governments are likely to follow suit. Fertiliser and food subsidies are certain to be above budget. Economic liberalisation is not under threat, but fiscal discipline certainly is.

SUPPOSE there is no financial crisis as severe as that of 1991 to force the government's hand. Might India nonetheless bring itself to undertake another burst of economic reform? The country's politics at present are uncertain even by Indian standards. The United Front government is often described, with justice, as a coalition of 13 losers. By a wide margin, the country's most popular parties remain the Congress and the Hindu-nationalist BJP. For the moment, Congress is a tacit 14th member of the UF coalition: it has the votes to bring down the United Front at any time. When it calculates that it can win the resulting election, it will exercise that option. So the UF government could fall within weeks, or stay in power, courtesy of Congress, for months and conceivably years. 
At least the reforms of 1991-93 do not appear to be in immediate jeopardy. The uF's policy proposals, described in the ""common minimum programme"", are surprisingly reform-minded-surprisingly given that the group includes leftist parties, including the Communist Party (Marxist). Indeed, the programme calls for further change, including the overdue liberalisation of the insurance industry, which with any luck has been delayed rather than abandoned. But, as should be obvious by now, the changes in economic policy that India needs now are in many ways more radical than the ones of 1991. At any rate, they go far beyond the cautious progress advocated in the common minimum programme. As should also be obvious, these changes are politically far more challenging than the earlier ones. 
The UF does not seem up to it. Asked about his government's economic policies, H.D. Deve Gowda, the prime minister, tells you that he is a humble farmer and knows little about economics. This line has served many an Indian leader well, and should not be taken at face value-but in Mr Deve Gowda's case, it is all too convincing. 
Weak governments can sometimes get things done: witness that of P. Narasimha Rao, which brought in the reforms of the early 199os. Mr Rao and his finance minister, Manmohan Singh, made no real attempt to gain popular consent for what they did. They simply went ahead, partly because they had little choice, but partly also because other circumstances were propitious. Their reforms were a matter of immediate concern mainly to India's elite: few factory workers or farm labourers worry about the country's trade and foreign-investment regime or the industrial licensing rules. Also, the nation's attention was helpfully distracted by other matters: the resurgence of Hindu chauvinism and the growing strength of the BJP. It is hardly an exaggeration to say that the first reforms were brought in surreptitiously. 
That is unlikely to be possible for the next stage of reform. For a start, the BJP is no longer so conveniently distracting. It remains popular (and, unlike Congress, is well led), but at least for the moment the prospect of religious strife on a scale that seemed thinkable in the early 199os has receded. And the reforms needed now will unavoidably impinge on India's masses. Labour-law reform, privatisation of public-sector enterprises or a shake-up of the food and fertiliser subsidies cannot be sneaked past an unsuspecting electorate. 
Stage two of radical reform will need to be sold to the electorate by political leaders who inspire confidence. They will need to explain, in terms that most Indians can understand, that policies which involve some short-term discomfort (albeit much less than those opposed to further reform argue) would quickly bring great benefits: higher real incomes, effective help for the rural poor instead of mere pretence, and basic services of a quantity and quality that other countries, including poor ones, already take for granted. 
Perhaps it cannot be done. Certainly, it is a daunting challenge. Unhelpfully, it is easier to imagine the BJP's Atal Behari Vajpayee rising to it than Congress's Sitaram Kesri, or any of the senior Congress leaders vying to succeed him; yet the BJP seems unlikely to win power at the centre on its own terms. Too many Indians are rightly fearful of what such a victory would mean for communal harmony. For all these reasons the centre seems unlikely to deliver what India needs. 
A new sort of competition 
There is another possibility. The economic liberalisation that India has already seen is a de facto decentralisation of sorts. By abolishing industrial licensing (India's Gosplan, as it were), the reforms severed one of the most direct connections between the centre and the rest of the country. Now that India has discarded its Nehruvian vision of planning, the centre no longer seems the natural, even inescapable, locus of political power. That will remain true even if economic reform proceeds no further. Political developments have lately tended to push the same way. The UF is a coalition of mainly regional parties, naturally more sympathetic than Congress governments have been to demands from the states for more say in their own future. 
Many Indians, regardless of their views on the economy, have long argued that the country's future would best be served by a looser form of federation. One great virtue of such a change is that it would give expression to India's heterogeneity, making it easier to meet regional demands for more selfdetermination (in Punjab, Assam, Kashmir and elsewhere) without jeopardising the union itself. Another attraction is that it would acknowledge the impossibility, given India's vastness, of governing the country effectively from Delhi. A third benefit would be economic. If states had more control of their own economic destinies, reform-minded state governments could be pioneers for liberalisation. They could show the others that reform succeeds, and promote a kind of competition among states that would push the country as a whole in the right direction faster. 
This is already beginning to happen. Orissa, for instance, has pressed ahead with plans to privatise its power supplies. Other states are competing with unaccustomed vigour to attract foreign investment. So far, however, it is happening only in a very small way, such is the centre's control. 
Still, an optimist could argue as follows: the reforms of 1991-93 have started a process that is not merely irreversible, but that has a built-in tendency to accelerate. The economy has been opened enough to stimulate demands from consumers-ie, voters-for more of the same. Politically, too, the centre's rationale for retaining control has been greatly weakened. There is at least the possibility that, whether the centre likes it or not, competition among the states will promote further economic reform; further economic reform will promote competition among the states; and so on. If so, India might get its second stage of radical reform after all-not in one piece, and not out of Delhi, but state by state, over the next few years. By the turn of the century, the Indian tiger might be scaring East Asia after all. 
The question is whether the reforms so far have produced the critical mass needed to start this chain reaction. To hope so may be no more than wishful thinking. But in this 50th anniversary year, it is a fitting thought on which to end. ","Can politics deliver what India needs ? 
 SUPPOSE there is no financial crisis as severe as that of 1991 to force the government 's hand . Might India nonetheless bring itself to undertake another burst of economic reform ?

With the support of 181 members of the 217-seat lower house, he has a huge majority in parliament. His position may be further bolstered by elections later this month, in which the upper house too is expected to fall under the control of his supporters. And in the meantime Benazir Bhutto, the leader of the opposition, has decided to avoid a confrontation. 
But though Mr Sharif's position is strong, the problems he has to deal with are huge. When Miss Bhutto was thrown out of office last November, Pakistan was on the verge of bankruptcy. It now badly needs the goodwill of the IMF. Although Mr Sharif's men at first toyed with the idea of rejecting the IMF-imposed target of a budget deficit no larger than 4% of GDP this year, they have now knuckled under. 
That will necessitate harsh spending cuts, at a time when the economy is in trouble. In spite of last year's 19% devaluation of the rupee, the country's trade deficit refuses to fall much. Tax revenues are below target and manufacturing is likely to grow by no more than 4%-down from the ambitious 6%-plus that was set for it. 
Some of Mr Sharif's ideas sound a little desperate. He has asked all expatriate Pakistanis to deposit $1,ooo at Pakistani banks for at least two years, to improve foreignexchange reserves, which late last year had fallen below $700m. In his first speech before parliament, he claimed that this plea had already brought $15om into the country-""a revolutionary achievement within days."" Pakistan's reserves have now risen again to over $i billion (see chart). 
But if Mr Sharif is to turn the economy round, he will have to do more than rely on the patriotism of expatriates. Government spending, still out of control, needs to be cut. The privatisation programme will also have to be taken beyond the token sale of a few small factories. Investors, at least, seem hopeful: Pakistani share prices have gone up since the election. 
The optimism of businessmen has been further bolstered by Mr Sharif's decision, in the face of Islamist opposition, to make Friday a working day again. The original decision to give people Friday off work was made in 1977 by the prime minister of the day, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, in an effort to curry favour with the Islamists. Bhutto's gesture failed, and he fell from office a few weeks later. Since then, despite the pleas of businessmen keen to work on the same days as western business partners, no prime minister has dared incur the Islamists' wrath by changing back to a western weekend. Mr Sharif's readiness to take the risk reflects his self-confidence. 
This confidence has also enabled him to take another bold step. In a letter to the Indian prime minister, Deve Gowda, Mr Sharif has proposed a summit to discuss several issues, including the disputed territory of Kashmir. The Indians have gratefully accepted this olive branch and senior officials from the two countries are likely to meet for preparatory talks later this month. If progress is made, that might help Mr Sharif restrain defence spending, which is set to consume 26% of this year's budget. 
But those who remain suspicious of Mr Sharif also have things to point to. Shehbaz Sharif, the prime minister's brother, has been appointed as chief minister of the province of Punjab. It was Miss Bhutto's appointment of her husband as investment minister that drew many of the allegations of corruption against her-and the two Sharif brothers have been the object of (unproven) accusations of sleazy dealings in the past Still, Mr Sharif is making the right noises.

Last year Pakistan spent $3.8 billion on defence, over a quarter of the government's budget, while India spent $8.4 billion. Both countries possess-or at least could quickly assemble-nuclear weapons. Their 1,200-mile border remains one of the most heavily fortified in the world. So the senior officials from Pakistan and India who were due to meet on March 28th have plenty to talk about. If all goes well, Gohar Ayub Khan, Pakistan's foreign minister, and Inder Kumar Gujral, his Indian counterpart, will meet next month. 
Indian and Pakistani officials have held such talks before, without much success. Indira Gandhi and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto agreed to a framework for a permanent settlement as long ago as 1972, but it has never been put into practice. The most recent ministerial talks broke down in 1994 over the guerrilla insurgency in India's portion of the disputed province of Kashmir. Squabbles over both countries' refusal to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Test-Ban treaties further soured relations. 
But the recent change of regime in Pakistan has provided fresh impetus for negotiation. Nawaz Sharif, the new prime minister, emphasised his hopes for warmer relations with India in his inaugural speech to the National Assembly. His overwhelming parliamentary majority-177 out of 217 seats-may give him greater freedom than his predecessors to cut military spending. His chief supporters, tradesmen and business leaders, are keen to increase commercial ties with India. And Kashmir seems less of an obstacle, now that India has restored a semblance of calm and installed an elected state government. 
The present Indian government, too, is more disposed than its predecessors to normalise relations. Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first prime minister, had family roots in Kashmir, and his descendants and successors, Indira and Rajiv Gandhi, shared his strong feelings about the province. Deve Gowda, the current prime minister, is a politician from the southern state of Karnataka with no such emotional ties. Furthermore, India's recent military detente with China demonstrates its willingness to make peace with old enemies. 
Both countries have taken a conciliatory line in the run-up to the talks. The Pakistani authorities, in a gesture calculated to soften stony hearts, released 38 Indian children detained after their fishing boats had strayed into Pakistani waters. India in turn unilaterally eased restrictions on travel from Pakistan, reduced visa fees and also legalised the import of Pakistani books and periodicals, hitherto taboo. 
Chambers of commerce on both sides of the border are pushing hard for trade liberalisation. Official cross-border commerce between the two countries is tinydirect trade currently amounts to just 4 billion rupees ($111.4m) annually, although a further 1o billion rupees-worth may be diverted through other countries to avoid tariffs and restrictions. There is just a single border crossing. But if both countries relaxed controls, trade might take off. Tourism would also profit, since many citizens of both countries (including Mr Gujral) were born and raised in the other and still have relatives there. 
But politicians on both sides are reluctant to promote ties without a settlement on Kashmir. Pakistan's president, Farooq Leghari, delivered a pugnacious speech on March 23rd attacking India's ""repression and human-rights violations"" in the state. In the Indian parliament, the mere announcement of the visa concessions drew such a storm of protest that the session had to be adjourned. Any concession which could be portrayed as surrender would undermine Mr Gowda's fragile minority government.

IF THERE is one thing worse than a pushy young man, it is a pushy old man. At 79, Sitaram Kesri, the leader of India's venerable Congress party, has evidently decided that he has waited long enough to become prime minister. His party, which for ten months has been voting in support of India's fragile 13-party coalition government without being a part of it, has withdrawn its support and so precipitated a political crisis (see page 34). Mr Kesri evidently hopes to emerge from the political melee as top dog. Whether or not he succeeds, the cost to India may prove a high one. 
No party has an obligation to support a government of which it is not a member. Nor would Mr Kesri be the first Indian politician to want to be prime minister-indeed, politicians in other places have been known to harbour similar ambitions. But his excuses for this attempt to pull India's house down are flimsy. He has accused the United Front government of presiding over the deterioration of the economy, of overseeing a ""complete collapse"" of law and order, and of failing to head off clashes between the country's disparate religious groups. In fact, the government of Deve Gowda, India's prime minister, is doing at least as well as its Congress predecessor did. The economy is ticking along nicely. The government has just presented a budget that was received well and that advances India's programme of economic reform. There have been no serious civil disturbances. 
Quite possibly, therefore, the real reason Mr Kesri has decided to up-end the United Front government is not because it was doing badly, but because it was doing unexpectedly well. Although a motley collection of left-wing and regional parties, the coalition has managed to keep up its numbers in parliament. The economic reforms proposed in the recent budget are not its only achievement. At the time Mr Kesri decided to act, India had just begun sensitive talks with its archrival and neighbour, Pakistan, aimed at calming tensions and leading to more high-level meetings later in the year. Much more of this, and Mr Gowda's government might have chalked up some real achievements-and gained a good deal of political credibility, too. That was apparently something that Mr Kesri was not prepared to risk. 
The price of ambition 
If Mr Kesri does succeed in bringing down the governmenteither by forming a new Congress-led coalition or by forcing an election-it will be very difficult to pass the budget, with its much-needed reforms. The peace process with Pakistan could be put back on indefinite hold. And India will be denied much-needed stability in its administration. 
And for what? Mr Kesri's gamble mayyet prove ill-judged. Congress may be unable to win enough support from minority parties to form a government. Even a new election may not help Mr Kesri realise his ambition. Recent local elections indicate that the nose-dive in support for Congress-so marked at the last general election-has not been reversed. The group that is most likely to gain from a fresh poll is the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party. That could precipitate renewed violence between Hindus and Muslims. The Congress party rightly prides itself on the stability and harmony its successive governments brought to India after independence in 1947. Putting that at risk seems a depressing way to celebrate India's 50th anniversary as a democracy. ","Sitaram Kesri 's grab for power does no credit to him or his party

In fact , Deve Gowda's , is doing at least as well as Deve Gowda's Congress predecessor did . The economy is ticking along nicely . Deve Gowda has just presented a budget that was received well and that advances India 's programme of economic reform . There have been no serious civil disturbances . 
 Quite possibly , therefore , the real reason Mr Kesri has decided to up - end the United Front government is not because it was doing badly , but because it was doing unexpectedly well . Although a motley collection of left - wing and regional parties , the coalition has managed to keep up its numbers in parliament . The economic reforms proposed in the recent budget are not its only achievement . At the time Mr Kesri decided to act , India had just begun sensitive talks with its archrival and neighbour , Pakistan , aimed at calming tensions and leading to more high - level meetings later in the year . Much more of this , and Deve Gowda's might have chalked up some real achievements - and gained a good deal of political credibility , too . That was apparently something that Mr Kesri was not prepared to risk . 
 The price of ambition 
 If Mr Kesri does succeed in bringing down the governmenteither by forming a new Congress - led coalition or by forcing an election - it will be very difficult to pass the budget , with its much - needed reforms . The peace process with Pakistan could be put back on indefinite hold . And India will be denied much - needed stability in its administration . 
 And for what ? Mr Kesri 's gamble mayyet prove ill - judged . Congress may be unable to win enough support from minority parties to form a government . Even a new election may not help Mr Kesri realise his ambition . Recent local elections indicate that the nose - dive in support for Congress - so marked at the last general election - has not been reversed . The group that is most likely to gain from a fresh poll is the Hindu - nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party . That could precipitate renewed violence between Hindus and Muslims . The Congress party rightly prides itself on the stability and harmony its successive governments brought to India after independence in 1947 . Putting that at risk seems a depressing way to celebrate India 's 50th anniversary as a democracy .",750,India,A29-8251,IN TERM,True,"the government of Deve Gowda , India 's prime minister",4,True

At the age of 79 (or possibly 81), he is not inclined to wait until the next general election, which is not due until 2001. In any case, he would rather manipulate his way to power through parliamentary deals than face the uncertainties of another election. 
After ten months of voting with India's minority United Front government, Mr Kesri has made his move by with drawing his party's support from the coalition. A vote of no confidence is scheduled for April lith. Without Congress's support, the United Front will fall. Mr Kesri is gambling that most of the constituents of the 13-party-coalition will regroup behind him. If not-and the odds are against it-there will probably be a general election. The Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), already the largest block in parliament, stands to gain most in a fresh poll. 
Mr Kesri's gambit seems a little premature. His initial game plan had been first to arrange a series of defections from the ruling coalition, and so to make Congress the biggest party in parliament. But he has jumped the gun. Why the hurry? 
One reason is that he feels Deve Gowda, the prime minister, is using police investigations and the threat of prosecution to cow top Congress leaders into submission. 
Mr Gowda denies a witch-hunt, and says that activist courts have forced the police to act, regardless of the government's inclination. Rubbish, says Congress. The bulk of the investigations are against Congress politicians, although allegations abound against all parties. One Congress leader says that,""If we keep supporting this government from outside, soon we will all be inside."" 
Congress believes Mr Gowda is encouraging individuals to file public interest suits against political foes, and then pretending he is helpless to intervene. Two such suits that could compromise Mr Kesri have been filed since he became Congress president. One accuses his family of having amassed wealth disproportionate to its income. Another calls for a detailed inquiry into the death of a doctor who used to treat Mr Kesri. Even if nothing is eventually pinned on Mr Kesri, his name could be sullied. 
What will be the result of Mr Kesri's gamble? Given the highly fractured composition of parliament, as well as potential splits within parties, several outcomes are possible: 
The Kesri plan works, and he comes to power. Possible, but not probable. 
The BJP abstains in the no-confidence motion, allowing the United Front to win, and giving a chance to Congress dissidents to oust a humiliated Mr Kesri. Too Machiavellian to be more than a long shot. 
Mr Kesri fails to get a majority, and the BjP forms a government with the help of some members of the United Front. Just possible. 
Congress splits and the United Front survives. Very unlikely. 
The United Front ditches Mr Gowda and elects a new leader acceptable to Mr Kesri. This would mean Mr Kesri abandoning his bid to become prime minister, which seems unlikely. 
Nobody can form a stable government, so there is a fresh election. This seems the most likely outcome, eventually if not immediately. 
Both foreign and Indian investors are worried that political instability might paralyse decision-making and so jeopardise some of the economic reforms that are in the pipeline. The tax-cutting budget in February had raised investor confidence, which is now ebbing. This may be unwarranted. India has already shown, when the United Front took over from Congress, that political change does not necessarily mean either policy reversal or paralysis. 
Normally, a new government will insist on a new budget. But the indications from Mr Kesri and others suggest that the main proposals of the budget will remain intact, and that if Mr Kesri achieves power he might well keep the highly regarded finance minister, Palaniappan Chidambaram. Indeed, Mr Chidambaram is exploring the possibility of all-party consent for the budget, regardless of the outcome of the no-confidence motion. Such consent would have been unthinkable a year ago, but is now merely improbable. If Mr Chidambaram succeeds, it will prove that India has managed to insulate its economy from political change Mr Chidambaram likes to point out that post-war Italy and France have shown that short-lived coalitions can preside over an economic boom.

DEVE GOWDA, India's prime minister, is fighting for his political survival. As he attempts to shore up his coalition government, other considerations are having tobe ditched. So, on April loth, Mr Gowda's government capitulated to a strike by truckers, who were enraged by government attempts to levy new taxes and increase their insurance payments. The strike, which got under way on April ist, had put more than 2m lorries off the road. The price of fruit and vegetables shot up by half in large cities. Factory stocks ran low. Mr Gowda was worried that the mood of voters could quickly sour, hurting the prospects of the ruling coalition in the next general election. The poll may be no more than a month away; the government faces a confidence vote scheduled for April lth. 
The truckers were protesting against a huge rise in insurance premiums, and a 5% tax imposed in the budget. Though the government-owned General Insurance Corporation has a monopoly on vehicle insurance, it has managed to make heavy losses-chiefly because political pressure long obliged it to hold down its rates. Then, suddenly, it proposed increases of up to 800%. The corporation said that even with such increases it would barely break even. The truckers regarded them as extortionate. 
The finance minister, Palaniappan Chidambaram, had also sought in his budget to extend indirect taxes from goods to services. He said this was essential now that services accounted for over 40% of GDP. But truckers predicted new taxes would merely open the way to more harassment by corrupt inspectors and policemen. To support their case, they issued details of the illegal payments they have to make to get around (all stoutly denied by the police). Each lorry entering Delhi has to pay loo rupees ($2.8). That, say the owners, adds up to12.5m rupees a day or more than 45 billion rupees a year-more than Delhi's annual budget. Bus owners say they pay soo-1,ooo rupees for ignoring a radar speed check, and 2,ooo rupees for getting bail after an accident. Getting a driving licence involves a payment of 2,200 rupees. 
What the bus and lorry operators fail to mention is that these payments earn them virtual immunity from traffic rules and checks. A driving licence may be bought for someone without experience. No wonder Delhi's buses kill, on average, more than one person a day. 
From an economic point of view, the new tax made sense. The government says it will try to find ways to resurrect it. But the strike shows that even a sensible tax can look unjust if it is corruptly administered. If only Mr Chidambaram could collect a 5% tax on all bribes, his budget deficit would probably vanish.

On April 11th, India's fragile coalition government was thrashed in a confidence vote in parliament by 338 votes to 90. Pretty decisive,you might think. Yet it looks like staying in power, under a new prime minister. 
The 13-party United Front survived in power for ten months as a minority government because it was being propped up by the Congress party. Congress, in turn, was willing to vote with the United Front, in order to keep the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) out of power. But at the end of March, Sitaram Kesri, Congress's president, decided to topple the government and bid for power himself His party has only 143 seats in a house of 544, but he hoped that once he pulled down the government, the United Front would shatter and regroup behind him. Mr Kesri believed that members of the United Front would come over to him, rather than risk losing their seats in a fresh election. 
But the front remained united, and suddenly Mr Kesri found his own MPS panicking at the prospect of a fresh election which is likely to benefit the BJP most. So he pulled back from the brink, even before the confidence vote, announcing that he did not seek the top job, and would settle for a new leader of the United Front to replace Deve Gowda, the prime minister. Mr Kesri claimed that Mr Gowda had been using the police to target members of Congress and ruin their reputations. Most United Front members will cheerfully sacrifice Mr Gowda to stay in power, and a new leader may be elected soon. There are no really strong contenders and an infinite number of weak ones. India's next prime minister could be any one of the following: 
G.K. Moopanar, the president of the Tamil Maanila Congress, a regional party of the south. He is a formidable politician, but was a member of the Congress party until recently and so is viewed with suspicion by the Communists, whose support he needs. 
Inder Gujral, the foreign minister. Well liked, but a political lightweight. 
Laloo Prasad Yadav, the chief minister of Bihar. Embroiled in a financial scandal. 
Ram Vilas Paswan, the railway minister. He is one of India's untouchables, by caste, and the United Front would boost its propoor credentials by electing him. 
Mr X. A dark horse, may be more acceptable than any of the well-known names. 
If Congress and the United Front cannot agree on a new leader, a fresh election may yet ensue. Even if the two sides patch things up, the combination looks too shaky to last long. The silver lining is that economic liberalisation may go on regardless of the political crisis (or future crises Congress withdrew support from Mr Gowda on March 30th, and the vote of confidence took place on April lth. Normally, decision-making would have been paralysed in this period. But, if anything, the political crisis seems to have stirred up a positive frenzy of activity. 
In the past fortnight a new export-import policy for the period to 2001 has been adopted, which abolishes quantitative restrictions on 542 categories of imports, and rationalises trade rules and incentives. Borrowing limits for individual companies have been liberalised. A new civil-aviation policy has been announced, allowing up to 40% foreign investment in Indian private airlines (but not by foreign airlines). Foreign investment proposals totalling $35om have been cleared. Fourteen industries formerly reserved for small-scale operators are now open to all. And a new oil-exploration policy has been agreed by the cabinet, liberalising rules for foreign investors. 
In the past, opposition parties would have screamed themselves hoarse if a government on the verge of falling had announced any important decision.

THE good news is that in place of the venal opportunists who have lately dominated Indian politics, a new prime minister has emerged who is almost universally regarded as clean, decent and intelligent The bad news is that he will probably not last very long. Inder Kumar Gujral has replaced Deve Gowda as head of the United Front government, which survives in office with the support of the Congress party. Mr Gowda lasted ten months. Sceptics doubt if Mr Gujral will last any longer. 
He rules over a fragile coalition, and faces an immediate problem because one of its constituents, the Tamil Maanila Congress (TMC), a regional party, has opted out of the government in a huff. The TMC president, Gt Moopanar, was the frontrunner in the race to succeed Mr Gowda, but was finally vetoed by the Communists, who regarded him as too close to Congress. The TMC says its pride has been hurt by this accusation of double-dealing, and its four ministers (including Palaniappan Chidambaram, the finance minister) have pulled out. Mr Gujral is trying hard to woo them back, and may succeed. But he will face many more such political challenges in the coming months. 
A lifelong socialist, Mr Gujral was the left's candidate in the contest for the prime ministership. This at first led to fears that he might try to reverse economic liberalisation, especially since Mr Chidambaram had left the government. A writer in the Asian Wall Street Journal even suggested that Mr Gujral's resemblance to Lenin was not entirely accidental. A few years ago, he headed a parliamentary committee that had wanted India to pull out of the GATT rather than accept its new rules on patents. When he visited Moscow recently as foreign minister, he talked fondly of India's old strategic relationship with the Soviet Union, and supported Mr Yeltsin's opposition to any expansion of NATO in Europe. 
However, by reinstating virtually every member of the outgoing cabinet, Mr Gujral has sent a clear message that he seeks continuity, not change. No matter what his own predilections are, he has to focus on survival, and this means he cannot risk policy changes that may antagonise any coalition member. To woo back the TMc, he has kept vacant the four portfolios earlier allotted to the party. He has pledged to continue with economic liberalisation, and to press on with Mr Chidambaram's tax-cutting budget. The left is disappointed, but investors are delighted. 
Neighbouring countries will welcome Mr Gujral's elevation, since as foreign minister he propounded what came to be called the Gujral doctrine-go out of your way to be friendly with smaller neighbours and offer them unilateral concessions, since you will create an improved atmosphere that will yield major gains later. The main success of the doctrine was an agreement on sharing the waters of the Ganges with Bangladesh, which later responded by offering India transit rights through its territory. Mr Gujral also unilaterally liberalised the granting of visas to Pakistanis wanting to visit India. He will press on with his doctrine as prime minister, and will retain the foreign-affairs portfolio. 
The Congress party brought down his predecessor, Mr Gowda, because it was angry that he had authorised police investigations of some of its members. Mr Gujral has promised he will allow no witch-hunts. But the truth is that many Congress members would be quite at home on a broomstick, and Mr Gujral is not going to drop cases already under way. To reduce the chances of a future misunderstanding between Congress and the United Front, a co-ordinating committee is being formed, with five members from each side. 
Optimists hope that this arrangement will ensure stability for at least some time. Yet it can hardly satisfy Congress. The party is far larger than any constituent of the United Front. It keeps the government alive, yet it enjoys none of the perks of office. Some members of the United Front (notably the Communists) say they will walk out if Congress joins the government. Others want Congress to come in for the sake of stability, but will not accede to the demand of Sitaram Kesri, the president of Congress, that his party should be the majority partner. The tussle for power will continue, and many observers believe the arrangement will break down by the end of the year. The main reason why the government might stagger on is the enormous reluctance of most MPS to face voters again in a fresh election. 
If an election nevertheless takes place, the betting is that the Hindunationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will fare best. Along with its allies, it holds 204 seats out of 544 in parliament today, and a recent opinion poll suggests that its tally could rise to 253 in a fresh election. Congress could lose a quarter of its existing 143 seats. 
So is Congress, the party that ruled for most of the past five decades, in irreversible decline? Some observers are already predicting that it will fade away into nothingness. That is an exaggeration. More likely, Congress will be obliged to give up any hope of ruling on its own, as it did for so many years. It may have to trim its ambitions and decide that its future lies in being part of a coalition. In a state election in Uttar Pradesh last year, it agreed to be junior partner to a regional party, and reaped the benefits when it improved its vote. 
The party has yet to debate its future at the national level, but many of its members think that coalition politics are here to stay, and that the party must reshape its ideas accordingly. One new strategy would be to join an anti-Bjp alliance. The main divide in Indian politics would then run between the secular parties and the BJP. 
If Congress and the United Front could fight the next election together, they would whip the BJP. The problem is that the United Front consists mainly of regional parties, which regard Congress as the main enemy in any state election. They are uneasy about allying themselves with the enemy in Delhi. How to get around this problem will be one of the central dilemmas of Indian politics in the future.

NOT often does a prime minister have to prosecute his party's president for corruption. But within a week of taking office, Inder Gujral has had to give his assent to the prosecution of Laloo Prasad Yadav in connection with a racket in the state of Bihar, where he is chief minister. Mr Yadav is president of Janata Dal, a party in India's ruling United Front coalition, which also happens to be the prime minister's party. Mr Yadav has said he is innocent and refuses to resign as chief minister. But four leftist constituents of the United Front have said he must go. 
If pushed, Mr Yadav could split the Janata Dal and form a regional party. He is the only charismatic Janata Dal leader in Bihar and says he will, if necessary, take the matter to the ""people's court"" (an election) He controls around 25 members of the Delhi parliament, not enough to topple Mr Gujral's government but enough to cause it problems. 
The racket in which, according to India's Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Mr Yadav was involved centres on Bihar's animalhusbandry department. The fiddle has allegedly been going on for some 20 years, though it was unearthed only two years ago. The unusually high death rate for animals and poultry purchased by the department was originally ascribed to incompetence. It now seems the animals were never bought and their ""deaths"" were invented to explain their absence. Vehicles supposedly used to transport cattle have also turned out on investigation to include mopeds and oil tankers. 
The 56 people charged in connection with the fraud include three ministers in Mr Yadav's state government. Not surprisingly, investigators have been under political pressure to go slow. The initial police charge-sheet last year did not list a single politician, and attempts were made to oust the main investigator. But the High Court intervened and threatened the director of the cBI, Joginder Singh, with contempt of court. That kept the investigation on track. 
The previous prime minister, Deve Gowda, was accused by his political foes of selectively targeting them with police investigations. Mr Gujral had to promise on coming to power that he would not go in for witch-hunts. This led to worries that he would go slow on crooks. It also led to the expectation that Mr Singh, a Gowda appointee, would be replaced. Now, by naming politicians, Mr Singh may have ensured that he keeps his job (the High Court will smell a rat if he is sacked) Politicians of all parties have been given notice that they cannot count on the police being as pliable as in the past. Voters are delighted. 
There is further good news. The Tamil Maanila Congress, a constituent of the United Front, had walked out after its leader lost the prime ministerial race to Mr Gujral. Now it has returned to the fold. This means that Palaniappan Chidambaram is back as finance minister, and will pilot his sensible budget through parliament. The stockmarkets have zoomed joyously. Mr Yadav in decline, Mr Chidambaram on the up: the formula delights investors. Mr Gujral is more ambivalent. ","DELHI

Even internal ballots in political parties are watched with intense interest. At the moment, Indians of every kind--politicians, journalists and tea drinkers at roadside stalls--are fixated on increasingly bitter struggles within the country's oldest political organisation, the Congress party, and one of its newest, the Janata Dal. 
Congress's options might seem uninspiring to those who consider charisma, oratory or vision important attributes in a politician. The clear front-runner is the incumbent, Sitaram Kesri--a portly, smiling bachelor of 78, whose age and clownish appearance belie his guile and backroom skills. The dog-loving Congress leader (he keeps four impeccably groomed Pomeranians, and insists that press photographers include them in their pictures) recently brought down a prime minister, Deve Gowda, by withdrawing Congress's support from his coalition. But he then failed to achieve his stated aim of becoming prime minister in his own right. 
Mr Kesri's name keeps popping up in the strangest places. Police investigating the grisly murder and mutilation of one of his acquaintances may want to question him as a possible witness. There are also unproven allegations of involvement in some of the more infamous financial scandals of recent years--charges that are almost inevitable, given Mr Kesri's long-time position as the Congress party's treasurer. 
But despite all the allegations and the debacle of his failed attempt to become prime minister, Mr Kesri's victory in next week's vote is almost assured. This owes everything to his ability to manipulate the complex electoral college that chooses the party president, and to take advantage of Congress's obsessive desire to opt for the devil it knows, rather than take even moderate risks. Other senior Congress figures may also back him because he is too old to be a long-term obstacle to their own ambitions. The Congress front rank is made up of septuagenarians, balanced by the occasional octagenarian. Mr Kesri's two challengers, by contrast, are mere striplings. 
First is 56-year-old Sharad Pawar, a wily political boss from the industrial state of Maharashtra. Mr Pawar is said to have a deep understanding of the complex and often shady workings of India's main financial centre, Mumbai (Bombay). He began the electoral race with some influential supporters, but Mr Kesri's machinations have prised many of them away. Many think Mr Pawar is not really serious about being party president, or even prime minister--but wants his old job back, chief minister of Maharashtra. 
The most interesting candidate is Rajesh Pilot, a former minister who is a relative infant at just 52. He acquired his unusual surname during his 15 years as a squadron-leader in the air force. Despite his name change, he is proud of his origins as a Gujar--a caste of cattle herders. On the hustings, he drives his own vehicle from village to village, tying a colourful cattleman's turban around his head before addressing the crowds. Unlike the Congress party as a whole, Mr Pilot increased his share of the vote at the last election. But his very charisma and youth make him suspect in the eyes of party elders. 
If such a contest does not bode well for India's once invincible founding party, then the Janata Dal - the party of the prime minister, Inder Gujral - may be even feebler. A fratricidal contest is in prospect that could divide a grouping that already has relatively few seats in parliament, despite its leadership of the coalition government. 
The battle is between two colourful lowcaste politicians from the northern state of Bihar. Both are named Yadav, a reference to their caste. One is the state chief minister, Laloo Prasad Yadav, the current party president. He is the Janata Dal's most popular figure but federal police want to charge him in an embezzlement scandal worth hundreds of millions of dollars. His opponent, Sharad Yadav, is also tainted by scandal. His most recent contribution to federal politics was to lead a vocal rebellion against his own prime minister's attempts to introduce a bill to set aside a third of parliamentary seats for women.

The problem is the prices of petrol and petroleum products. These are heavily subsidised so the poor can afford to cook, buy fertiliser and travel by public transport.

Its deficit grows each day by $8m, creating an ever-expanding hole in the middle of India's public finances-and in its hopes of staging an Asian economic miracle. 
The one sure way to close the gap in the oil account is to raise prices. Indian drivers get the cheapest diesel in the world. Kerosene for cooking costs a few pennies for a month's supply.

Our first article deals with India,which has paid heavily for a failed economic experiment, but is justly proud of its political achievements. Our second article argues that Pakistan has done better than India economically, but worse politically 
ON AUGUST 15th 1947, India became the first British colony to win independence. Its new leaders swore to make democracy work in a multi-religious, multi-lingual, multi-ethnic region that had never been under unified rule. In speeches to enthusiastic crowds around the country, they pledged to end poverty and help India regain its pre-colonial glory as a great economic power. 
Today, the euphoria is gone. The champagne bottles will pop on the 5oth anniversary of independence, but the bubbly will taste a trifle flat. At best, India has been a qualified political success and a barely qualified economic failure. 
Indian leaders believed in 1947 that colonial exploitation had kept the country poor, and that when the British went, so would poverty. In fact 320m Indians remain below the poverty line today, almost as many as India's entire population was in 1947. A mistaken socialist experiment has cost India dear. 
India's first prime minister,Jawaharlal Nehru, wanted to attack what he saw as the two main evils of the colonial era. The first was rural feudalism-under which princes and aristocrats creamed off one-fifth of national income while the poor starved, and were denied basic civil rights. The second evil, according to Nehru, was the de-industrialisation of India by the Raj. Before the British came, India and China were the world's biggest manufacturers. When the British left, India was relatively poor and backward. Nehru attributed this not to Britain's industrial revolution but to the net transfer of capital from India to its colonial master, which averaged 1.5% of GDP annually throughout the two centuries of the Raj. This transfer was financed because, throughout the colonial period, India had a persistent trade surplus with Britain, and thus exported capital. So Indian leaders regarded export-orientation as an instrument of colonial exploitation. And since colonial India's exports were overwhelmingly commodities, free trade was regarded as a hypocritical ploy to force British manufactures on India while stifling local industry. Thus the colonial experience led Indian leaders to turn to autarkic socialism. 
Nehru wanted an activist state to enact egalitarian laws, transfer land from the aristocracy to the peasants, and make India a great industrial power again. He succeeded, despite many shortcomings in land reforms, in gradually giving power to India's rural peasantry. The peasants reelected Nehru repeatedly with massive majorities, convincing him of the need for ever-more state activism. 
Besides, state activism was fashionable at the time. Capitalism was widely seen as having failed between the world wars, while the Marshall Plan, Keynesian demand management and the rise of the welfare state seemed to vindicate government intervention. Rapid Soviet industrialisation made five-year plans look such a good idea that they were adopted even by antiSoviet countries like South Korea and Taiwan, with the blessing of the World Bank. 
Unlike future East Asian tigers, however, Nehru's India neglected primary education. He viewed universal literacy as socially desirable but not as a key economic input, and instead emphasised higher and technical education. A far-reaching consequence after 50 years is that India's literacy rate is a pathetic 52%, lower even than in Kenya (78%) or Tanzania (68%). 
East Asian countries sometimes used state intervention to help support competitive private-sector giants. But Nehru, impressed by the Soviet model, wanted the public sector to capture the commanding heights of the economy. He saw industry, especially the heavy sort, as the key to prosperity, and thought the potential of agriculture and exports was limited. So he decided to protect industry heavily against trade, and left agriculture relatively unprotected. This implicit tax on agriculture skewed Indians' investment decisions. And the investment that flowed into industry was often wasteful because Nehru forsook exportorientation for import substitution, with no checks to ensure efficiency. 
Under Nehru, GDP growth averaged 3.5% per year. This was almost three times as fast as the 1.3% averaged during the first half of the century under the Raj, and faster than Britain's own growth rate during its industrial revolution. Many economists the world over hailed India as a success, convincing Indian leaders that they had nothing to learn from free-marketeers in the West. Only much later did East Asia demonstrate that, in the new post-war conditions, growth of 3.5% was slow rather than fast. But by then Indian planners had become knowledge-proof. 
Planning created a veritable jungle of controls on production, prices and employment. Companies could not sack workers or close down without permission, which was virtually never given. The planners regarded competition as wasteful because it allowed an excess number of competitors, and then forced some to close down. As they saw it, this caused unemployment and wasted capital. Instead, the planners proposed a licensing regime that would create exactly the planned capacity in each industry, and keep it going no matter how badly it was run. The result was a proliferation of uneconomic units and corruption, and a collapse in productivity. 
Nehru's daughter, Indira Gandhi, became prime minister in 1966, and in the next decade took the command economy to new heights. Using the slogan garibi hatao (abolish poverty), she nationalised banks and several industries, increased price and trade controls, and squeezed foreign investment. This socialist economic agenda masked a private political one. The main opposition party at the time, the Swatantra Party, was led by a coalition of princes and businessmen. Mrs Gandhi abolished the princes' principal source of income, ""privy purses"" (annual payments from the government as compensation for the loss of their fiefs) and imposed harsh income and wealth taxes on businessmen, whose cumulative effect at the margin exceeded 100%. Gari.bi hatao killed the Swatantra Party. Poverty, alas, survived. Mrs Gandhi reversed Nehru's neglect of her complete supremacy. 
Mrs Gandhi was a ruthless centraliser of power who eroded many of the independent institutions her father had created. She converted her Congress party from the proud party of the independence movement into something that sometimes seemed little more than a bunch of family retainers. In 1975, a court disqualified her from holding office for a minor technicality in election expenditure. She responded by imposing an ""emergency"", suspending civil rights and jailing political opponents. In many developing countries, such a person would have gone on to become dictator for life. But Mrs Gandhi did not institutionalise the emergency. Instead she held a fair election in 1977 in which she was routed. 
The rag-tag coalition of parties that ousted her soon fell apart. This enabled Mrs Gandhi to win the next election in 198o. Many of her supporters claimed this was a vote for a new emergency. But she found herself unable to shake off the Nehruvian tradition completely. So ingrained was her desire for public approbation that she stayed democratic. Indian democracy had proved its resilience. 
A strong current of violence, however, continued to mar politics. Mrs Gandhi was assassinated by Sikh militants in 1984. Her son, Rajiv, won a landslide election victory later that year, leading some to believe that the Gandhi dynasty was unshakeably established. But the Congress party was rotting beneath the Gandhis' feet. Over four decades it had become increasingly corrupt. Other parties had grown steadily, and now ruled several states. Rajiv lost the 1989 election and was then himself assassinated by Tamil militants from Sri Lanka. Although some Congress party activists still hanker after bringing Rajiv's widow, Sonia, into politics, his death seems to have marked the end of the Gandhi dynasty. 
With the passing of the Gandhis, India in the 199os shifted from single-party rule to coalition politics. Earlier prime ministers were charismatic members of a charismatic family. But the most recent threeNarasimha Rao, Deve Gowda and now Inder Gujral-have been political lightweights who got the top job mainly because they were too lacklustre to have many enemies. This does not make for strong leadership. But a system that propels nonentities to the front does not lend itself to dictatorship either. 
In the authoritarian parts of East Asia, India's democracy is sometimes blamed for its relative backwardness. But to democracy goes the credit for one of India's key achievements in the past 50 years-the conquest of mass starvation. This was a recurring problem in every drought, and thousands died in the twin droughts of 1965 and 1966, despite 21m tonnes of food aid. One much-discussed book of the time even argued that India was fundamentally unviable and should be left to starve, conserving scarce food aid for savable countries. 
Yet within a decade, India had conquered starvation. The credit for this is widely but mistakenly given to the green revolution. In fact food production between 1965 and 198o grew by just 2.8% annually, no faster than in the preceding 15 years. Several developing countries, including many in Africa, fared much better. 
India ended starvation by better distribution, not accelerated food production. A drought decimates agricultural activity and hence the earnings of farm labourers. Indians proved that if they are given purchasing power through employment schemes, they will survive even when food is scarce. In the Indian state of Maharashtra, in the early 1970s more food was available than in the Sahel. Yet there was famine in the Sahel but not in Maharashtra. 
Apart from employment schemes, an affected country needs grain reserves, rural roads, and the ability to spot distress and move grain quickly. By the 1970s India had created all these facilities, but most African countries had not. The pressures of a free press and opposition parties in India forced the government to act. Such pressures were rare in Africa. 
A similar tale can be told of China, where about 3om people starved during the ""Great Leap Forward"" of 1958-60. China had no free press to give warning of impending disaster, no opposition demanding action. Instead it had sycophants unwilling to tell Mao how bad things were. In China, as in the Sahel, the needy were killed as much by a lack of democracy as by a lack of food. 
The virtues of Indian democracy must not, however, be exaggerated. It may have helped prevent famine. But it has not prevented mass hunger, illiteracy, or policies guaranteed to keep people poor. Nor has democracy checked growing corruption and the emergence of a political class that is widely held in contempt by ordinary Indians. These days it is a common complaint in India that public services and government work only for those with money, muscle or influence. 
In 1947,joining politics meant sacrificing your career for public service. Today, joining politics increasingly means joining the race for money, power and influence. Every political party now has links with gangsters, many of whom have elbowed their way into the legislatures. In some states the distinction between lawmakers and lawbreakers has virtually disappeared. A former home secretary estimates that in recent municipal elections hundreds of suspected criminals stood for election in Mumbai (formerly Bombay) Similar calculations were made by newspapers at the time of the Delhi elections earlier this year. 
For all the flaws in India's democratic system, however, most middle-class Indians remain proud that their country can claim to be a rare democracy in the third world. If India can achieve economic success as well, the dreams of its founding generation may finally be fulfilled. ","Partition in 1947 created two nations .

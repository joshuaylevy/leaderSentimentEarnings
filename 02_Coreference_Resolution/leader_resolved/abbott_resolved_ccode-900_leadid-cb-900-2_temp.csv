VISITORS off the train at Parramatta, a suburb in western Sydney, behold a shining glass tower that Deloitte, a financial-services firm, opened this month. The tower is a symbol of the changes in what was once a white, working-class area, loyal to Australia's traditionally left-leaning Labor Party. These days, a new wave of skilled immigrants, many from Asia and the Middle East, has turned Parramatta into unpredictable political territory. 
On March 3rd, and facing an election in September, the country's prime minister and Labor Party leader, Julia Gillard, ventured into Parramatta, spending a whole week there in a bid to rekindle the suburb's support. National opinion polls show the Labor Party trailing behind the opposition conservative coalition. Her government's fate may well be decided by Sydney, Australia's biggest city--and especially in the western suburbs around Parramatta. 
During her week in western Sydney, Ms Gillard conspicuously made her base not Kirribilli House, the elegant official residence overlooking Sydney harbour, but a utilitarian hotel in Rooty Hill, some 40km (25 miles) west. In so doing, she played up social markers that have long characterised Australia's oldest city: the rich, privileged centre versus the sprawling suburbs where most of Sydney's 4.6m people live. Ms Gillard reminded audiences that she did not grow up on Sydney's north shore, the wealthy district where Tony Abbott, the opposition leader, comes from. She, too, began her political career in a gritty west (even if hers lies in Melbourne). She understood, she said, ""a region's yearning for recognition and respect"". 
Yet Sydney's character is evolving so fast that such homilies may no longer hit their mark. Peter Spearritt, an historian, reckons the rest of Australia looks upon Sydney with a mixture of envy and pity. They still envy its wealth as Australia's finance and business hub, and its world-city status. But they now pity Sydney for its soaring house prices, which make homes unaffordable for many, and for its political scandals. One such scandal, unfolding around the land dealings of Eddie Obeid, a former government minister in New South Wales state, is corroding federal Labor's image. 
Meanwhile, immigration has made Sydney's old voting habits less predictable. Parramatta is one of several constituencies across western Sydney that Labor holds on slim margins; the futures of three of Ms Gillard's ministers are at stake among them. Whereas about a third of Sydney's overall population was born overseas, the proportion in Parramatta is more than half, and rising. Many arrivals work in finance, engineering and other fields without unions, Labor's traditional base. Deloitte aims to double staff in western Sydney by 2015. And even many people from union-based trades now run their own businesses. The upshot, says Nathan Rees, a former Labor premier of New South Wales, who still holds a western constituency, is that for many young workers in western Sydney relations with Labor are now more ""historical than practical"". 
Nonetheless, in a speech to party faithful in Parramatta, Ms Gillard tried to sooth workers' worries about jobs. A week before her visit, the government signalled tighter rules for employers importing overseas workers on temporary visas. Officials cite a 68% rise in such visas for the IT industry. Parramatta has high IT employment. Ms Gillard promised a fight ""to stop foreign workers being put at the front of the queue with Australian workers at the back"". For a leader who claims to champion an open economy, her language seemed an odd throwback to a more regulated, less diverse era. Some saw her apparent defence against foreign invaders as a coded pitch on a wider front. The opposition's attacks on the government over asylum-seekers arriving in Australia by boat have struck a chord even among western Sydney's big immigrant communities. 
A national opinion poll on March 12th, the first since her trip out west, gave Ms Gillard some hope. Her minority government narrowed its losing gap against the opposition to four points, while Ms Gillard won back her lead over Mr Abbott as the preferred prime minister. But the unpredictable Sydney suburbs will take some convincing before her government can count the west as won.","The prime minister canvasses in fast - changing suburbs

ONE thing that sets Australia apart from its Asian neighbours is the interminable, vicious public infighting that scars its politics. On March 25th Julia Gillard, the prime minister, shuffled her cabinet for the fourth time since scraping home in an election in August 2010. She purged it of supporters of Kevin Rudd, her predecessor, whom some of her Labor Party colleagues had tried and failed to install as her replacement on March 21st. Australian commentators wrung their hands at the tawdry politicking. ""Our long national nightmare continues,"" lamented Sam Roggeveen on a blog on the website of the Lowy Institute, a foreign-affairs think-tank in Sydney, fretting that Australia was becoming a laughing-stock. It is true that its politics provokes a smirk or two elsewhere in Asia. Few could argue with Ms Gillard's assessment that the coup attempt was ""unseemly"" and ""self-indulgent"". 
The Labor Party's troubles date back to Mr Rudd's stint as prime minister, from 2007-10. He alienated his colleagues and was losing popularity, so the party toppled him ahead of the 2010 election. Many were taken aback both by the suddenness of his downfall, and the ruthlessness with which Ms Gillard knifed him. He seems never to have given up hope of a comeback. A Mandarin-speaking former diplomat, in public he is an appealing character: erudite, eloquent, witty and even, on occasion, self-deprecating. In opinion polls he has consistently scored much higher than Ms Gillard as the leader who might secure victory in the next election, which she has called for September 14th. 
The sad truth for Mr Rudd, however, is that many of his Labor parliamentary colleagues, who choose the leader, cannot stand him. According to James Button, who worked briefly as a speechwriter for Mr Rudd, writing in the Sydney Morning Herald, ""behind closed doors he consistently treated people with rudeness and contempt."" He had no chance of unseating Ms Gillard and, for the second time in their three leadership contests, did not even compete in the leadership ballot she called. Hence the ""Chicken Kev"" taunt thrown by another columnist and former Labor speechwriter, Tim Soutphommasane. 
Ms Gillard, on the other hand, a former industrial-relations lawyer with strong ties to the trade unions that back Labor, has again shown her toughness. In a recent interview with the Canberra Times she said that, in politics, you have to be ""a pretty hard bastard"". Tony Blair, a former British prime minister dogged by intraparty conspiracies, had told her politics was afflicted with a ""new brutality"". She spoke of how technology has transformed the media, encouraging ""more drama, more shock, more horror"". 
At least now Mr Rudd has promised Ms Gillard his ""100% support"". Even if he had his fingers crossed when he spoke, Ms Gillard can probably concentrate for the next six months on fighting the opposition rather than looking over her shoulder. Still, if the opinion polls are to be believed, she needs quite a turnaround to avoid a humiliating defeat in September. 
Perhaps her best hope is that the conservative opposition coalition has as self-destructive a recent history as Labor's. Its leading force, the Liberal Party, has had four leaders in the past six years. Tony Abbott, the incumbent and probable coalition candidate for prime minister, is not its most popular politician. The man he ousted in 2009, Malcolm Turnbull, is a bigger vote-winner. Ms Gillard, whose finest moment as prime minister was a blistering attack last year on Mr Abbott for alleged misogyny, may feel she still has a chance. 
Australian politics seems locked in a culture of democratic coups, with the perverse effect that the leading parties fail to field their best candidates. And, when not dominated by tales of back-stabbing leaders and their muck-spreading sidekicks, they are taken over by scandals of sleaze and graft. 
Asia's big democracies--India, Indonesia and Japan--have all faced difficulties in finding leaders acceptable both to their parties and to the electorate. India's Congress party seems likely to resort, by default, to a dynastic succession; the most popular politician in Indonesia, Joko Widodo, Jakarta's governor, is not yet even a candidate in next year's presidential election; Japan is on its seventh prime minister in seven years (and it is his second go in that period). In all three countries politics is even more unseemly, self-indulgent and even corrupt. 
Just like the Politburo 
This sounds like an advertisement for autocracy. On a superficial view, China, for example, does not suffer from this leadership instability. One ten-year regime has just given way, in a choreographed transition, to another, expected to endure until 2022. But in fact, Chinese politics also closely resembles Australia's. There, too, no politician forgets that, as Mr Rudd put it in 1998, ""politics is about power"". There, too, leaders are chosen by factional intrigue. There, too, politics is dominated by personal rivalry. And there, too, the public's preferences are of secondary importance. 
The difference is that Australia's politics is played out in the open. Uniquely in the rich world, Australia is enjoying its 22nd consecutive year of economic growth. If this is a national nightmare, who wants to wake up? Moreover, as Mr Roggeveen forecast, the leadership kerfuffle played out peacefully according to the rules of Australia's democracy: ""No troops on the streets and probably not even a demonstration."" Australia may in fact be Asia's most stable country. 
By comparison, China's politics inhabits the shadows, except when some scandal, such as the Bo Xilai affair last year, casts a lurid light. And when that happens it calls the whole closed system into question. As Mr Roggeveen noted a day after his doom-laden blogpost, the latest Rudd-Gillard tussle did not make Australia a laughing-stock after all. It was widely seen as a non-event. It must be chastening for Australia's leaders that their squabbles seem irrelevant. But it is also a lesson in the benefits of transparency.","Politics in Australia is not as unAsian as it appears

AS ANNIVERSARIES go, it could hardly have been unhappier. On June 24th, Julia Gillard marked three years since she overthrew Kevin Rudd as leader of the ruling Labor Party and became Australia's first female prime minister. Her coup never achieved its purpose of steering Labor into safer electoral waters. Two days after her anniversary, Mr Rudd finally took his revenge. With their party predicted to lose a federal election due on September 14th, panicked Labor parliamentarians dumped Ms Gillard and reinstalled him as leader. This was their fourth leadership showdown in three turbulent years. Having triumphed over Mr Rudd in the first three, Ms Gillard lost by 45 votes to 57. 
She called the ballot on June 26th to pre-empt a move against her by Mr Rudd's supporters. Mr Rudd had launched an undeclared leadership campaign, as frantic press speculation and dire opinion polls threatened to destabilise the party. Raising the stakes, Ms Gillard insisted that the loser quit politics at the forthcoming election. When she lost, she kept her word: she will not recontest her Melbourne constituency, bringing to an end a dazzling but controversial 15-year parliamentary career. 
After Mr Rudd was sworn in again as prime minister on June 27th, the victory glow quickly dulled. Six of Ms Gillard's ministers resigned, declaring they could not work with him. They included Wayne Swan and Greg Combet, who held the vital posts of treasurer and climate-change minister respectively. Penny Wong, the finance minister and another Gillard supporter, stays on as government leader in the Senate, the upper house. As he chose a new cabinet, Mr Rudd also scrambled to keep the parliamentary votes of five independents, on whose support Ms Gillard's minority government had depended. 
The Rudd revival capped one of the most dramatic eras in Australian politics. Mr Rudd was a Labor hero after he led the party to power in 2007, ending 11 years of rule by a conservative coalition. But his autocratic style alienated many colleagues. Mark Latham, a former Labor leader, calls him a ""phenomenal egotist"" who ""looks at politics through the prism of vanity"". 
When Ms Gillard took his job, critics predicted an early death for her minority government. She proved them wrong. The parliament survived its three-year term, passed more than 500 bills and endorsed Ms Gillard's pet policies: a new financial deal for schools and an insurance scheme for disabled Australians. Yet many Australians, bewildered by the knifing of a prime minister before his first term was up, never warmed to her. Mr Rudd played on his martyr-like popularity in the wider electorate, and relished Ms Gillard's struggle to stamp herself as a legitimate leader. She revealed her frustration when she called the latest leadership ballot. As well as fighting Tony Abbott, the opposition leader, she said, ""I've also been in a political contest with people from my own party."" 
Some of Ms Gillard's backers reckon sexism also stalked her prime ministership. In her book ""The Misogyny Factor"", Anne Summers, a feminist editor, says Ms Gillard has been ""fair game for anyone in Australia who objects to our having a woman in charge"". A week before the leadership crisis, a story emerged of sexist jokes about her printed on a menu at a recent fundraising event for an opposition candidate in Queensland. After her downfall, Ms Gillard said a focus on ""gender wars"" during her prime ministership would make it easier for other women to follow in the job. ""I'm proud of that."" 
Mr Rudd seemed to prepare the ground for his putsch last month when he dropped his opposition to gay marriage, which polls show is supported by a majority of Australians but is opposed by Ms Gillard. He pounced after two fresh election opinion polls showed Labor's support at 29%. This suggested that Labor could lose almost half its 71 seats in the 150-seat House of Representatives. One poll showed Labor's vote rising to neck-and-neck with the opposition, after the distribution of second-preference votes, if it restored Mr Rudd as leader. 
After the party did so, Mr Rudd acknowledged Ms Gillard as a ""remarkable reformer"". But he said Australians wanted a ""real choice"" against Mr Abbott. Mr Rudd has been a formidable campaigner before. He is likely to focus on Labor's strengths: the economy, education and health. Mr Abbott's policies on all are woolly. Mr Rudd will also aim to blunt Mr Abbott's campaign against Ms Gillard's carbon tax to fight climate change. The business world welcomed Mr Rudd's return.

FRESHLY restored as Australia's Labor prime minister, Kevin Rudd insists that the cabinet he appointed on July 1st contains the ""best players on the field"". Tony Abbott, meanwhile, the leader of the conservative coalition opposition, dismisses it as the ""C-team"". 
Certainly, Mr Rudd drew on depleted ranks for his ministers. Since his overthrow of Julia Gillard as Labor leader and prime minister on June 26th, some of the party's leading lights have rushed for the exit. Seven ministers quit rather than serve under Mr Rudd. Labor's most traumatic division in years will test Mr Rudd's pledge to unite the party ""with every effort I have in my being"". 
He has precious little time. Ms Gillard had called a federal election for September 14th. Since he toppled her, Mr Rudd has hinted it could be a bit later. He is keen to attend the G20 leaders' summit in Russia a week earlier. He started the first weekend of his second prime ministership barnstorming. Mr Rudd's first stop was an opposition constituency in western Sydney. Friendly locals crowded him in a shopping centre. Then he flew almost 3,000km (1,800 miles) to the Northern Territory for the state funeral of an aboriginal man, a notable singer known as Mr Yunupingu. 
In restoring Mr Rudd and defenestrating Ms Gillard, Labor parliamentarians hoped to cut the opposition's crushing lead in opinion polls. Their gamble shows early promise. A poll on July 1st showed Labor's support six points higher than a week earlier, when Ms Gillard was prime minister, though the government was still behind after second preference votes were distributed. Mr Rudd, on the other hand, grabbed a 14-point lead over Mr Abbott as preferred prime minister, compared with Ms Gillard's earlier 12-point deficit. 
The poll, and the cabinet departures, highlight the conundrum Mr Rudd will have to solve if he hopes to lead Labor back to power. Although many voters prefer him to Ms Gillard, plenty of his colleagues despair of his micromanagement--autocratic but not often decisive--which was on display when he was prime minister in 2007-10. The opposition has already prepared a video for YouTube of his colleagues citing ""dysfunction"", ""contempt for the cabinet"" and other bitter memories. 
Mr Rudd's ousting of Australia's first woman prime minister could also hurt him with some voters. On the other hand, six women sit in the new cabinet. Some ministers, such as Chris Bowen, the new treasurer, supported him in previous leadership battles, but others are new faces. Mr Rudd protests that he has learned from his past mistakes and that he will listen better to his ministers. After the first cabinet meeting Tanya Plibersek, who survived in her job as health minister, said Mr Rudd had taken a ""very collegiate"" approach. 
He will need more of that as he seeks to fix some policies that had made Ms Gillard unpopular, including a carbon tax and dealing with asylum-seekers arriving by boat. But at least Mr Rudd has shown that Mr Abbott can no longer expect the election to be a cakewalk.","The new prime minister says his bad old ways are history 
 FRESHLY restored as Australia 's Labor prime minister , Kevin Rudd insists that the cabinet he appointed on July 1st contains the "" best players on the field "" . Tony Abbott , meanwhile , the leader of the conservative coalition opposition , dismisses it as the "" C - team "" . 
 Certainly , Mr Rudd drew on depleted ranks for his ministers . Since his overthrow of Julia Gillard as Labor leader and prime minister on June 26th , some of the party 's leading lights have rushed for the exit . Seven ministers quit rather than serve under Mr Rudd . Labor 's most traumatic division in years will test Mr Rudd 's pledge to unite the party "" with every effort I have in my being "" . 
 He has precious little time . Ms Gillard had called a federal election for September 14th . Since he toppled her , Mr Rudd has hinted it could be a bit later . He is keen to attend the G20 leaders ' summit in Russia a week earlier . He started the first weekend of his second prime ministership barnstorming . Mr Rudd 's first stop was an opposition constituency in western Sydney . Friendly locals crowded him in a shopping centre . Then he flew almost 3,000 km ( 1,800 miles ) to the Northern Territory for the state funeral of an aboriginal man , a notable singer known as Mr Yunupingu . 
 In restoring Mr Rudd and defenestrating Ms Gillard , Labor parliamentarians hoped to cut the opposition 's crushing lead in opinion polls . Their gamble shows early promise . A poll on July 1st showed Labor 's support six points higher than a week earlier , when Ms Gillard was prime minister , though the government was still behind after second preference votes were distributed . Mr Rudd , on the other hand , grabbed a 14 - point lead over Tony Abbott as preferred prime minister , compared with Ms Gillard 's earlier 12 - point deficit . 
 The poll , and the cabinet departures , highlight the conundrum Mr Rudd will have to solve if he hopes to lead Labor back to power . Although many voters prefer him to Ms Gillard , plenty of his colleagues despair of his micromanagement -- autocratic but not often decisive -- which was on display when he was prime minister in 2007 - 10 . The opposition has already prepared a video for YouTube of his colleagues citing "" dysfunction "" , "" contempt for the cabinet "" and other bitter memories . 
 Mr Rudd 's ousting of Australia 's first woman prime minister could also hurt him with some voters . On the other hand , six women sit in the new cabinet . Some ministers , such as Chris Bowen , the new treasurer , supported him in previous leadership battles , but others are new faces . Mr Rudd protests that he has learned from his past mistakes and that he will listen better to his ministers . After the first cabinet meeting Tanya Plibersek , who survived in her job as health minister , said Mr Rudd had taken a "" very collegiate "" approach . 
 He will need more of that as he seeks to fix some policies that had made Ms Gillard unpopular , including a carbon tax and dealing with asylum - seekers arriving by boat .

BORROWING from the Book of Ecclesiastes, with yellow bulldozers providing the backdrop, Rick Perry, Texas's Republican governor, told a group of supporters in San Antonio this week that there is ""a time to weep, a time to laugh, a time to mourn and a time to dance"". But if there is a time to declare a second bid for the Republican presidential nomination, this was not it. Instead, the governor merely said he would not seek re-election next year. ""Any future considerations,"" he added, would be announced ""in due time"". 
Mr Perry has perched over Texan politics since George W. Bush left for the White House in 2000. His office is weak, but he has stuffed state agencies with loyalists; their influence will outlast his tenure. He has also presided over a booming economy; Texas, he crows, accounts for a third of American net job creation in the past decade (see chart). Since 2007 unemployment has been below the national average even as the population has shot up. (Naysayers point to low health-insurance rates and cash-starved schools.) 
Mr Perry's reign has long kept a lid on anyone else's ambitions. ""It's like a big house with only one bathroom, and daddy's been in there too long,"" says Jason Stanford, a Democratic strategist. The first beneficiary of Mr Perry's decision will be Greg Abbott, the attorney-general, who is likely to run for and win the governorship next year thanks to his record of getting angry with the federal government. Other statewide races will be lively. James Henson at the University of Texas, Austin, expects splits to emerge among the state's Republicans. The sudden success of Ted Cruz, a hard-edged conservative who won a Senate race last year, may spawn imitators. 
America's attention last turned Texas-wards in June, when Wendy Davis, a Democratic state senator, filibustered an anti-abortion bill. Mr Perry thwarted her by calling a special legislative session to pass the law, which should happen soon. The governor has always been pro-life, even if his priority has been the economy. But the abortion spat gives him a chance to court social conservatives nationwide. Why might he want to do that? 
To mount a serious second presidential bid, Mr Perry must muddy voters' memories of the first one. A late entrant to the Republican race, in August 2011, Mr Perry briefly led the polls but soon fizzled. Accusing the head of the Federal Reserve of treason was not statesmanlike. Nor was suggesting that Turkey was led by terrorists. And few were impressed by Mr Perry's ""Oops"" moment, when he forgot the name of a department he planned to eliminate. 
But his campaign was already faltering by then. Primary voters had booed his defence of a Texas law lowering university fees for young illegal immigrants. The Republican electorate of 2016 may be less hostile to such views--the coming House debate on immigration will clarify the party's stance--but by then other candidates, such as Marco Rubio, may be better placed to take advantage. More broadly, the potential 2016 bench looks far stronger than the weaklings who thrashed Mr Perry in 2012. 
Still, Mr Perry will have a fine story to tell on jobs and growth, particularly if America's recovery fails to gather speed. Unlike the previous time he has left himself plenty of time to prepare, and he has a good record as a campaigner (notwithstanding 2011's hiccups). In April he said he would make his intentions clear by the end of the year. For now, watch out for visits to early-primary states, or even trips abroad, though probably not to Turkey.","America's longest-serving governor keeps everyone guessing

JUST before he was dumped as leader of the Labor Party and prime minister three years ago, Kevin Rudd warned his colleagues against ""lurching to the right"" over asylum-seekers arriving in Australia by boat. Less than four weeks after he seized his old job back, Mr Rudd ditched his own advice. With Peter O'Neill, prime minister of Papua New Guinea (PNG), at his side, Mr Rudd declared on July 19th that all boat people pitching up on Australia's shores from now on would be sent to PNG, Australia's nearest northern neighbour. Even if they prove to be ""genuine refugees"", they will have ""no chance"" of a new life in Australia. Instead, they will be resettled in PNG, one of the Pacific's poorest countries. 
Facing an election this year, Mr Rudd has set about clawing back support over two issues that had damaged Julia Gillard, his predecessor: a carbon tax to deal with climate change, and rising numbers of boat people. So far this year more than 16,000 asylum-seekers on 220 boats have arrived, almost as many as in all of 2012. Tony Abbott, leader of the conservative opposition, has scored points in Labor's heartland with two slogans: ""Axe the tax"" and ""Stop the boats"". If elected as prime minister, he pledges to turn boats back to Indonesia, their main embarkation point. 
On July 16th Mr Rudd declared that the government would ""terminate"" the carbon tax next year and switch to a floating-price emissions-trading scheme, a year earlier than first planned. On the boats, he admits his ""regional resettlement arrangement"" with PNG is a ""very hardline decision"". Some refugee-law experts go further. James Hathaway, of the University of Melbourne, calls it the ""most bizarre overreaction"". He reckons refugees are paying the price for Mr Rudd's ""wanting to appear more butch than Julia Gillard and more reactionary than Tony Abbott"". Australia does not have an asylum problem, says Mr Hathaway. ""It has a political problem."" 
The figures bear him out. Political leaders of all stripes tend to underrate Australia's capacity to absorb outsiders. Last year the country admitted almost 200,000 immigrants. Most of the 47,000 boat people of the past five years were found to be ""genuine refugees"". In 2011 Australia received 3% of asylum applications lodged in industrialised countries, a proportion roughly in line with its population. 
The corrosive politics over asylum started with John Howard, a former conservative prime minister. In 2001 he opened camps for boat people in Nauru and on Manus Island in PNG. He hailed this as a ""Pacific Solution"". In his first stint as prime minister, Mr Rudd closed the camps. 
Australia has since processed most boat people on its Indian Ocean territory of Christmas Island, near Indonesia. But Ms Gillard when prime minister, facing opposition alarm over the boats, grabbed a lifeline offered by an expert panel. It suggested reopening the camps in a bid to deter boats and save lives. The lifeline neither saved Ms Gillard's prime ministership nor stopped boats and drownings. Just this week at least nine people drowned, 180 were rescued and an unknown number were missing after a boat sank off the Indonesian island of Java. Over 1,000 people are thought to have drowned trying to reach Australia in the past ten years. Iran, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and Pakistan are now the main sources of asylum-seekers. 
Since their hasty reopening last year, the camps have proved politically more explosive than ever. Much of the Nauru one burned down in a riot among its 544 detainees on July 19th. And after an outcry earlier this year about the children held at the Manus Island camp in PNG, Australia moved them and their families to Christmas Island and the Australian mainland. After a visit to Manus Island in June, the UN's refugee agency reported that conditions were still below international standards. On July 23rd Rod St George, who used to work there, told Australian television that men had been sexually and physically abused by fellow detainees. 
Mr Hathaway calls Manus Island ""the hellhole of PNG"". With Mr Rudd's PNG idea, Australia plans to expand the camp's capacity fivefold to hold about 3,000 asylum-seekers. It will also give Mr O'Neill's government more aid, on top of the A$500m ($463m) a year Australia already provides, for health, policing and university education. Ben Saul, a human-rights lawyer, reckons the PNG solution could breach the spirit of Australia's obligations under the UN's refugee convention, which stipulates that countries capable of dealing with refugee flows should not shift responsibility onto others. For Mr Rudd that seems of less importance than shoring up votes at home. He calculates that the prospect of living indefinitely in PNG will stop the boat people, where earlier lurches to the right have failed. It is a gamble.","The shadow of a looming election falls on desperate asylum - seekers

WITH his sights on the G20 leaders' summit in Russia early next month, Kevin Rudd, Australia's prime minister, faced a conflict. Mr Rudd takes credit for boosting Australia's role in the G20, and is happy on the world stage. So after he toppled Julia Gillard as Labor Party leader and prime minister in June, Mr Rudd had hoped to put back Australia's expected date for a general election in order to glad-hand world leaders first. Yet party barons warned him not to try his luck. Famous for once ignoring advice, this time Mr Rudd listened. Dropping his travel plans, he has called an election for September 7th, the day after the summit ends. 
Mr Rudd casts himself as underdog in a five-week campaign he says will be ""pretty rough"". When they reinstalled Mr Rudd as leader, Labor power-brokers aimed to escape the electoral drubbing that opinion polls showed the government faced when Ms Gillard was prime minister. Mr Rudd led Labor to power in 2007, ending 11 years of conservative government, only to be unseated as leader by Ms Gillard three years later. He took his revenge on June 26th to make a comeback as prime minister. In spite of Labor's turmoils, Mr Rudd's return has changed the party's game. 
It has turned the election into a competitive race against the conservative Liberal-National coalition and Tony Abbott, its leader. An opinion poll on August 5th, the day after Mr Rudd announced the election, showed Labor trailing the opposition by just four points, once second-preference votes were counted; the last poll under Ms Gillard had Labor 14 points behind. Other polls since Mr Rudd's return suggests that the parties are neck-and-neck. 
Yet turning improvements in the polls into electoral victory will be hard. In the 150-seat House of Representatives, where government is decided, Labor holds 71 seats to 72 for the opposition parties. Two independents in New South Wales who supported Ms Gillard's minority government have stepped down, and the opposition seems likely to win both seats. Mr Rudd's salvation might lie in Mr Rudd's home state of Queensland. Voters there turned against Ms Gillard for her knifing of Mr Rudd. Peter Beattie, a former Queensland Labor state premier, reckons they will reward their favourite son's return with enough seats to offset losses elsewhere, delivering victory to Mr Rudd. Mr Beattie himself is coming out of retirement to contest an opposition-held seat. The political terrain is altered by the rise of small parties, such as the WikiLeaks Party, aiming to rob both Labor and the coalition of control of the Senate, the upper house. WikiLeaks's seven candidates include Julian Assange, standing for the Senate from the Ecuadorean embassy in London, where he is holed up fighting extradition to Sweden. 
Labor's campaign also faces an enemy in the two-thirds of Australia's big-city newspapers that are controlled by News Corporation, Rupert Murdoch's empire. Mr Murdoch made his stand plain in Sydney's Daily Telegraph, his most influential tabloid. Its first edition of the campaign covered the front page with the prime minister's picture and a call to readers to ""Kick This Mob Out"". Some say this fits Mr Murdoch's pattern of backing the candidate he thinks will win (the Telegraph supported Mr Rudd before his victory in 2007). The prime minister himself says the mogul's strategy is commercial. He told journalists in Brisbane that Mr Murdoch wanted ""his mate, Mr Abbott, in"" because a high-speed broadband network the government is building around Australia could ""challenge"" Foxtel, a cable-television company that News Corporation half-owns with Telstra, a telecoms giant. 
But if Mr Rudd has clawed back voters' support, it is partly by racing Mr Abbott to the bottom on issues that resonate in the tabloids' heartlands, notably getting tough with asylum-seekers arriving in Australia by boat. Mr Rudd's plan to resettle them in Papua New Guinea, Australia's nearest northern neighbour, seems to have gone down well in Sydney's sprawling, multi-ethnic western suburbs, where Labor faces losses. Nationally, voters like Mr Rudd more than Mr Abbott: an early campaign poll gave him a 14-point lead as preferred prime minister. 
The leaders are likely to slug out most of the campaign over which of them can do a better job on the economy. On August 2nd the Treasury revised its outlook for growth in 2013-14 to 2.5%, slightly lower than its forecast three months ago. It projected a A$33 billion ($29 billion) drop in forecast tax revenues over the next four years, partly because of falling commodity prices and a slowdown in China, Australia's biggest trading partner. That leaves little room for big spending promises. The election could boil down to a contest between ""trust"", as Mr Rudd puts it, or ""who is more fair dinkum"", in Mr Abbott's spin.","What promises to be a bruising election campaign gets under way 
 WITH his sights on the G20 leaders ' summit in Russia early next month , Kevin Rudd , Australia 's prime minister , faced a conflict . Mr Rudd takes credit for boosting Australia 's role in the G20 , and is happy on the world stage . So after he toppled Julia Gillard as Labor Party leader and prime minister in June , Mr Rudd had hoped to put back Australia 's expected date for a general election in order to glad - hand world leaders first . Yet party barons warned him not to try his luck . Famous for once ignoring advice , this time Mr Rudd listened . Dropping his travel plans , he has called an election for September 7th , the day after the summit ends . 
 Mr Rudd casts himself as underdog in a five - week campaign he says will be "" pretty rough "" . When they reinstalled Mr Rudd as leader , Labor power - brokers aimed to escape the electoral drubbing that opinion polls showed the government faced when Ms Gillard was prime minister . Mr Rudd led Labor to power in 2007 , ending 11 years of conservative government , only to be unseated as leader by Ms Gillard three years later . He took his revenge on June 26th to make a comeback as prime minister . In spite of Labor 's turmoils , Mr Rudd 's return has changed the party 's game . 
 It has turned the election into a competitive race against the conservative Liberal - National coalition and Tony Abbott's . An opinion poll on August 5th , the day after Mr Rudd announced the election , showed Labor trailing the opposition by just four points , once second - preference votes were counted ; the last poll under Ms Gillard had Labor 14 points behind .

EXCEPTIONALLY among rich-world economies, Australia is now enjoying its 22nd year of uninterrupted growth. Much of the lucky country's recent prosperity came easily--from shipping coal and iron ore, Australia's two biggest exports, to China, its biggest market. But now that the Chinese boom is fading and commodity prices are slumping, that luck may be on the turn. 
This backdrop makes the election on September 7th critical. Australia needs a government that can take difficult decisions when forecasts of budget surpluses are turning into deficits, and a bit of inspired leadership to help it face a trickier future. The choice for voters, frankly, is not great. 
Daggy Abbott and rude Rudd 
Of the country's two main parties, the Liberal Party, now in opposition in a Liberal-National coalition, is the natural home of The Economist's vote: a centre-right party with a tradition of being pro-business and against big government. But the coalition's leader, Tony Abbott, does not seem an instinctive fan of markets, and one of the few key policies he has let on to possessing is a hugely expensive federal scheme for parental leave. That may help him persuade women voters that charges of misogyny are unfair, but he has not properly explained how he intends to pay for it . His social conservatism does not appeal to us: he opposes gay marriage and supports populist measures against Afghans, Sri Lankans, Vietnamese and others who have attempted to get from Indonesia into Australia in rickety craft that have drowned thousands in recent years. Indeed his promise to ""turn back the boats"" seems to be his only foreign policy. 
The argument for the protean Mr Abbott is that he might change yet again--and prove more pragmatic in office. He has certainly waged a disciplined campaign, helped by the strident support of Rupert Murdoch's newspapers, and is ahead in the polls. But to switch to Mr Abbott requires a leap of faith. So how bad has the Labor Party been? 
The main mark against Labor's policy card is that it has shifted a long way towards Mr Abbott's position on asylum-seekers. Aside from that, it has a reasonable record. It has loosened its traditional ties to the trade unions and promoted growth and enterprise. It has managed the economy well while introducing popular social programmes, including an insurance scheme for disabled people, reforms to schools aimed at raising teaching standards and a high-speed fibre-optic network that is now being laid out across the vast country. It put a price on carbon emissions by introducing a carbon tax in July 2012. Given that Australia is both the world's biggest coal exporter and heavily reliant on coal for its electricity, this is a laudable achievement. Mr Abbott, once a climate-change denier, vows to scrap the tax (as well as cut spending on Labor's schools and broadband projects). 
The trouble with Labor is twofold. Its internecine strife makes the Chinese Communist Party look harmonious--warfare within its ranks has undermined Labor's governance during its six years in office--and there are questions over the character of its mercurial leader, Kevin Rudd. 
The two are connected. After leading Labor to a landslide victory in 2007, Mr Rudd was suddenly defenestrated by his deputy prime minister, Julia Gillard, in 2010. Though still popular among voters, he had forfeited the trust of his colleagues through his contemptuous treatment of them, his meddling and his indecisiveness. Ms Gillard's legislative record was better than Mr Rudd's (she introduced the carbon tax), but the party barons ousted her this year and reinstalled Mr Rudd, in the hope that he could work his old magic with voters. 
The choice between a man with a defective manifesto and one with a defective personality is not appealing--but Mr Rudd gets our vote, largely because of Labor's decent record. With deficits approaching, his numbers look more likely to add up than Mr Abbott's. Despite his high-handed style, Mr Rudd is a Blairite centrist. A strategic thinker about Asia, he has skills that will be useful, especially as Australia has to balance its economic dependence on China with its security dependence on America. It would be nice if he revived his liberal approach to asylum-seekers. And, who knows, he may even live up to his promise to be less vile to his colleagues.","Kevin Rudd just about deserves a second turn

TWO notable apologies came from the political leaders invited to the India Australia Friendship Fair on August 25th. Kevin Rudd, the Labor prime minister (pictured, above, left), was called to Canberra for a briefing on Syria so could not attend. Tony Abbott, the opposition leader (above, right), flew to Brisbane to launch his campaign for Australia's general election on September 7th. Opinion polls suggest Mr Abbott and his Liberal-National coalition will end six years of Labor rule. 
The two federal leaders missed a colourful day of Bollywood music, Indian food and speeches from across Australia's political divide. Anglo-Celtic politicians who did show up mingled with a 15,000-strong crowd of Indians, Sri Lankans, Bangladeshis, Nepalese and Chinese. Understanding the jamboree's importance, Mr Rudd and Mr Abbott each sent along their minister and shadow minister for immigration. 
The fair happened in Homebush, a suburb in the heart of western Sydney. Australia's biggest city is a chief battleground for the election. Its sprawling western suburbs, home to almost half of metropolitan Sydney's 4.7m people, will see some of the closest contests. Over the past three decades immigration has transformed what were once white, working-class Labor heartlands into modern Australia's new frontier. Some 27% of Australians were born overseas. In some parts of western Sydney, the proportion is more than half. 
Parramatta, one of the oldest suburbs, has drawn many settlers from India, now Australia's biggest source of immigrants. Cabramatta, about 12 kilometres (7.5 miles) to the south-west, is home to thousands of boat people and their descendants who fled Indochina after the Vietnam war. Political allegiances have swung unpredictably. Chris Hayes, who holds the constituency around Cabramatta for Labor, predicts a lot more volatility in how the west votes this time. 
It was partly in the hope of containing that volatility that Labor Party barons dismissed Julia Gillard in June as leader and prime minister and reinstalled Mr Rudd. Under the less popular Ms Gillard, Labor faced big losses in Sydney and other parts of New South Wales, the most populous state. At first the gamble seemed to work, with some opinion polls showing Labor neck-and-neck with the opposition. But they now point to a coalition win. Mr Rudd has had trouble selling to voters the government's strongest story: its success in keeping the economy growing through the global financial crisis and holding unemployment down to 5.7%. Instead, voters are put off more by Labor's turmoils since it came to power in 2007: two leadership changes, from Mr Rudd to Ms Gillard and back again, and bitter personal rivalry between the pair. An opinion poll the day before the Homebush fair suggested several Labor-held seats in western Sydney could fall. Labor will also struggle in Queensland, Mr Rudd's home state; he may even battle to hold his own seat in suburban Brisbane. A senior Labor parliamentarian at the fair thought that ""people have stopped listening to Kevin"". 
Mr Abbott has played ruthlessly on Labor's troubles. He asks Australians if they can ""afford another three years like the last six"". A junkyard dog by his own admission, Mr Abbott once had a reputation for gaffes. He has run a disciplined campaign on this occasion, however. The big question is over his sprawling spending plans, which put him at odds with the Liberal Party's pro-market, small-government stance. He has failed to explain convincingly how he would fund them, especially after the Treasury recently cut forecasts of government revenues over the next four years by A$33 billion ($29 billion). 
If he wins, Mr Abbott promises that his first act will be to abolish Labor's carbon tax, introduced last year. In place of a market means of fighting climate change, he offers ""direct action"": spending more than A$3 billion over four years on inducements for big carbon-emitters to clean up their acts. Critics argue that such a scheme would be open to abuse. 
But Mr Abbott's most controversial policy involves the federal government giving maternity leave to women earning up to A$150,000 a year at full salary for six months. He plans to cover half the cost with a 1.5 percentage-point rise in the corporate tax rate on high-earning companies. Mr Abbott hatched the maternity-leave idea as a bid to improve his poor standing among women voters. Several prospective ministerial colleagues disapprove of it, and economists have slammed it. Saul Eslake, of Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Australia, calls it a ""dreadful policy"" that would not bear out Mr Abbott's claim that it would raise productivity. Mr Eslake says Mr Abbott's ""dubious view of markets"" and ""greater enthusiasm for government intervention"" could dull any business and investor confidence that might follow a coalition win. 
Mr Rudd started his campaign's last stages on August 27th with a speech on foreign policy, a field in which Mr Abbott has shown minimal interest. Hugh White, a thinker on foreign policy, reckons Mr Rudd's ideas on Australia's international standing are ""incomparably better informed"" than either Ms Gillard's or Mr Abbott's. But they are less likely to swing votes in regions such as western Sydney than the strong anti-Rudd campaign from the two-thirds of Australia's big-city newspapers run by News Corporation, Rupert Murdoch's vehicle. National polls still show that Australians would prefer Mr Rudd to Mr Abbott as prime minister, but they are fed up with Labor.

WHAT an economist, Ross Garnaut, has called ""the Australian great complacency"" may be coming to an end. Since 1990-91, Mr Garnaut has pointed out, Australians ""have enjoyed the longest period of economic expansion unbroken by recession of any developed country ever."" In recent years that boom has been sustained by the relatively simple business of digging Australia up and selling it to China. The campaign for the general election on September 7th was fought against the backdrop of a Chinese economy growing more slowly, and a sense that, with Australian luck running out, the country needs new ideas. 
In ending six years of Labor Party rule and electing the conservative Liberal-National coalition--and hence Tony Abbott as prime minister--voters certainly plumped for change. In part, Labor can blame the tiresome, self-destructive infighting that characterised its rule. The prime minister elected in 2007, Kevin Rudd, was toppled in a party coup three years later, only to scheme his way back into the job just ahead of this election. But the vote also marks a distinct shift to the right in Australian politics: on economic and social policy, and on climate change. 
Mr Abbott said the election was a referendum on the tax that the Labor government imposed on carbon emissions and which he wants to abolish. If so, voters spoke decisively. The coalition looks likely to have a majority of at least 30 in the 150-seat lower house of Parliament. But a problem for Mr Abbott looms in the Senate, where only 40 of the 76 seats were contested at this election. A fiendishly complicated voting system appears to have handed the balance of power to perhaps eight independents and minor parties. They include the Palmer United Party of Clive Palmer, a mining billionaire from Queensland, which may have two Senate seats. One of his possible senators-elect has indicated she may not vote to scrap the carbon tax. Other likely winners include the Australian Sports Party and the Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party (core values: minimal government, freedom of assembly and ""mateship""). Their voting plans are unpredictable. 
From his earlier days as a student politician in the 1970s, Mr Abbott emerged as one of Australia's roughest political brawlers. He was a Rhodes scholar at Oxford, where he boxed for the university, and later spent a brief stint in a Catholic seminary and also worked as a journalist before entering Parliament 19 years ago. The press used to call him the ""mad monk"" for his aggressive style and gaffes. But in late 2009, with behind-the-scenes support from John Howard, the Liberal prime minister from 1996 to 2007, an influential figure who is both Mr Abbott's biggest champion and hero, Mr Abbott won the Liberal leadership, by a single vote. 
He is a social conservative in Mr Howard's mould, opposing gay marriage for example. But though he casts himself in the Thatcher and Reagan tradition, Mr Abbott is less predictable when it comes to the pro-market stance of the Liberal Party. Some detect in his religious background a suspicion of big business, and approval of government intervention. His plan for an expensive federal scheme for parental leave, for example, is not the stuff of small-government conservatism, his party's usual fare. 
Foreign affairs barely featured in the campaign, perhaps reflecting a bipartisan consensus on most big issues. But Mr Rudd, a Mandarin-speaking former diplomat, mocked Mr Abbott's foreign-policy credentials, suggesting his analysis of the war in Syria (""baddies v baddies"") belonged to the ""John Wayne school of international relations"". Mr Abbott probably did not mind too much. Often photographed in Lycra, he plays up his image as a kind of Australian superbloke, whose natural habitat is the beach (he is a volunteer lifeguard), barbecue (firefighter, too) or gym. 
The coalition spelled out only two clear foreign policies: a controversial plan to use the navy to turn back asylum-seeker boats at sea; and a $4.5 billion ($4.2 billion) cut over four years in the budget for foreign aid. For the rest, the coalition's policy was summarised as ""more Jakarta; less Geneva"". The slogan acknowledges that Australia's destiny is now bound up with its immediate Asian neighbourhood, which accounts for more than two-thirds of its trade; and that the new prime minister gets this. 
Mr Abbott has had to distance himself from his loyalty to the ""Anglosphere"". In his 2009 memoir, ""Battlelines"", Mr Abbott wrote of his support for Australia's alliance with America and its ties with Britain and its monarchy. But now, says Julie Bishop, who will be his foreign minister, his policy will focus ""not exclusively but unambiguously"" on the Indo-Pacific. His first foreign trip will be to Indonesia. It might be sticky. Indonesia, a staging post for most of Australia's boat-people, is not impressed with Mr Abbott's plans to push them back there. 
Even more important is how to handle China, Australia's biggest market. Mr Rudd, far from being admired for his mastery of the language, was reviled in Beijing almost as much as in his own parliamentary party. In contrast, Mr Howard managed to improve ties with both America, sending troops to Iraq and Afghanistan, and with China. Mr Abbott hopes to do the same.

Since Mr Howard's day, however, China has grown more assertive, while America, with its trumpeting of a strategic ""pivot"" to Asia, has pushed back. One aspect of that is the agreement in 2011 to rotate 2,500 marines through Australia's Northern Territory. Ms Bishop argues that China's anger at this deployment was a result of not having been consulted; Mr Abbott will avoid such pitfalls with a ""no surprises"" approach. But more than diplomatic courtesy will be needed as military rivalry between a rising China and the incumbent superpower intensifies. In ""Battlelines"" Mr Abbott argued that China's growing strength ""may not mean much change for Australia's international relationships or foreign-policy priorities."" So far, that has been true enough. But it may yet turn out to be another facet of the great complacency.","Tony Abbott's remarkable progression from junkyard dog to prime minister 
 WHAT an economist , Ross Garnaut , has called "" the Australian great complacency "" may be coming to an end . Since 1990 - 91 , Mr Garnaut has pointed out , Australians "" have enjoyed the longest period of economic expansion unbroken by recession of any developed country ever . "" In recent years that boom has been sustained by the relatively simple business of digging Australia up and selling it to China . The campaign for the general election on September 7th was fought against the backdrop of a Chinese economy growing more slowly , and a sense that , with Australian luck running out , the country needs new ideas . 
 In ending six years of Labor Party rule and electing the conservative Liberal - National coalition -- and hence Tony Abbott as prime minister -- voters certainly plumped for change . In part , Labor can blame the tiresome , self - destructive infighting that characterised its rule . The prime minister elected in 2007 , Kevin Rudd , was toppled in a party coup three years later , only to scheme his way back into the job just ahead of this election . But the vote also marks a distinct shift to the right in Australian politics : on economic and social policy , and on climate change . 
 Tony Abbott said the election was a referendum on the tax that the Labor government imposed on carbon emissions and which Tony Abbott wants to abolish . If so , voters spoke decisively . The coalition looks likely to have a majority of at least 30 in the 150 - seat lower house of Parliament . But a problem for Tony Abbott looms in the Senate , where only 40 of the 76 seats were contested at this election . A fiendishly complicated voting system appears to have handed the balance of power to perhaps eight independents and minor parties . They include the Palmer United Party of Clive Palmer , a mining billionaire from Queensland , which may have two Senate seats . One of his possible senators - elect has indicated she may not vote to scrap the carbon tax . Other likely winners include the Australian Sports Party and the Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party ( core values : minimal government , freedom of assembly and "" mateship "" ) . Their voting plans are unpredictable . 
 From Tony Abbott's earlier days as a student politician in the 1970s , Tony Abbott emerged as one of Australia 's roughest political brawlers . Tony Abbott was a Rhodes scholar at Oxford , where Tony Abbott boxed for the university , and later spent a brief stint in a Catholic seminary and also worked as a journalist before entering Parliament 19 years ago . The press used to call Tony Abbott the "" mad monk "" for Tony Abbott's aggressive style and gaffes . But in late 2009 , with behind - the - scenes support from John Howard , the Liberal prime minister from 1996 to 2007 , an influential figure who is both Tony Abbott's biggest champion and hero , Tony Abbott won the Liberal leadership , by a single vote . 
 Tony Abbott is a social conservative in Mr Howard 's mould , opposing gay marriage for example . But though Tony Abbott casts Tony Abbott in the Thatcher and Reagan tradition , Tony Abbott is less predictable when it comes to the pro - market stance of the Liberal Party . Some detect in Tony Abbott's religious background a suspicion of big business , and approval of government intervention . Tony Abbott's plan for an expensive federal scheme for parental leave , for example , is not the stuff of small - government conservatism , Tony Abbott's party 's usual fare . 
 Foreign affairs barely featured in the campaign , perhaps reflecting a bipartisan consensus on most big issues . But Mr Rudd , a Mandarin - speaking former diplomat , mocked Tony Abbott's foreign - policy credentials , suggesting Tony Abbott's analysis of the war in Syria ( "" baddies v baddies "" ) belonged to the "" John Wayne school of international relations "" . Tony Abbott probably did not mind too much . Often photographed in Lycra , Tony Abbott plays up Tony Abbott's image as a kind of Australian superbloke , whose natural habitat is the beach ( Tony Abbott is a volunteer lifeguard ) , barbecue ( firefighter , too ) or gym . 
 The coalition spelled out only two clear foreign policies : a controversial plan to use the navy to turn back asylum - seeker boats at sea ; and a $ 4.5 billion ( $ 4.2 billion ) cut over four years in the budget for foreign aid . For the rest , the coalition 's policy was summarised as "" more Jakarta ; less Geneva "" . The slogan acknowledges that Australia 's destiny is now bound up with its immediate Asian neighbourhood , which accounts for more than two - thirds of its trade ; and that Tony Abbott gets this . 
 Tony Abbott has had to distance Tony Abbott from Tony Abbott's loyalty to the "" Anglosphere "" . In Tony Abbott's 2009 memoir , "" Battlelines "" , Tony Abbott wrote of Tony Abbott's support for Australia 's alliance with America and its ties with Britain and its monarchy . But now , says Julie Bishop , who will be Tony Abbott's foreign minister , Tony Abbott's policy will focus "" not exclusively but unambiguously "" on the Indo - Pacific . Tony Abbott's first foreign trip will be to Indonesia . It might be sticky . Indonesia , a staging post for most of Australia 's boat - people , is not impressed with Tony Abbott's plans to push them back there . 
 Even more important is how to handle China , Australia 's biggest market . Mr Rudd , far from being admired for his mastery of the language , was reviled in Beijing almost as much as in his own parliamentary party . In contrast , Mr Howard managed to improve ties with both America , sending troops to Iraq and Afghanistan , and with China . Tony Abbott hopes to do the same .

A judge in New Orleans overturned the convictions of five former police officers for the Danziger Bridge shootings that took place in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, because of misconduct by prosecutors. The five had been convicted in 2011 for shooting six people, killing two, and for covering it up.

Dilma Rousseff, Brazil's president, called off a state visit to Washington due next month, following revelations that the United States National Security Agency (NSA) had monitored her e-mails and phone calls and spied on Petrobras, the national oil company. She failed to obtain from Barack Obama the apology and assurances she sought that the NSA would not continue to spy on her government. 
Mexico was battered by simultaneous tropical storms on both its coasts, killing at least 80 people and destroying 35,000 homes. Acapulco, a resort that has waned in popularity because of violent crime, was badly hit, stranding thousands of tourists there. 
Brazil's supreme court voted six to five to hear appeals against their sentences by senior figures in the ruling Workers' Party convicted of corruption. The appeal could mean they will not face jail. 
Colombia's former president, Alvaro Uribe, announced that he would run for the Senate in an election in March. Mr Uribe, who is barred from running again for the presidency, has become a bitter opponent of President Juan Manuel Santos's effort to strike a peace deal with the FARC guerrillas. 
Little indicators 
Iran's new president, Hassan Rohani, freed 11 prominent political prisoners and briefly unblocked access to Western social media. In a rare interview with American television Mr Rohani said Iran would never ""seek weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons"" and that he had ""full power and complete authority"" to strike a nuclear deal.

Bahrain's main opposition withdrew from talks with the government, following the arrest of a prominent dissident leader, Khalil Marzook, on terrorism charges. 
The ruling party in Rwanda received three-quarters of the votes in parliamentary elections, giving it a majority big enough to change presidential term limits. That would allow Paul Kagame to extend his long rule.

In the week before Germany's general election on September 22nd the centre-right and opposition centre-left parties were both polling around 44%. The leaders of the centre-right CDU and the centre-left SPD were said to be discreetly preparing for a ""grand coalition"" to form a government.

WHEN Cecil Rhodes, a 19th-century mining magnate, provided in his will for scholarships to Oxford university, he created the first international study programme. Since 1902 it has funded fees and living expenses for students from the British empire (later the Commonwealth), America and Germany. 
On September 19th, a Canadian advertising entrepreneur followed in Rhodes's philanthropic footsteps. John McCall MacBain, president of an eponymous foundation which supports graduate scholarships, medical and environmental research, has made a Pounds 75m ($120m) gift to the Rhodes Scholarships Trust, the biggest since its inception. It is structured to encourage matching donations, which it is hoped will lift the total to Pounds 100m. That should enable the Trust to offer more scholarships (there are currently 83 a year). The alumni list is impressive, including Tony Abbott, the newly elected Australian prime minister, Bill Clinton, the former American president and Arthur Mutambara, the former deputy prime minister of Zimbabwe, as well as senior judges, university and business leaders and three Nobel prize-winners. 
Already the money man behind a new graduate centre at Oxford's Wadham College (where he studied law on a Rhodes scholarship in 1980), Mr MacBain wants to expand the scheme to Brazil, China, Japan and Russia. A bigger pool of graduates, he says, will expand Rhodes's original mission: ""to secure the peace of the world"" in changed times. 
Casting the net wider might require making it easier for applicants in more remote places to undergo interviews. They might, for instance, be grilled via computer link. Attracting bright Asian and Russian students, Mr MacBain adds, might also draw donors from countries struggling to reconcile wealth creation and inequalities. Rhodes insisted his beneficiaries ""shall not be merely bookworms,"" but charismatic leaders and public servants. 
Oxford is gratified by the gift as it seeks to nudge its fund-raising towards American levels. But international competition for largesse is getting fiercer. Even excluding Bill Gates's bounty, large individual gifts to universities in America, Indian and Taiwan are proliferating. Several run to over $400m (Pounds 250m). Rhodes's magnanimous example is a fine one. As a big spender he might well have enjoyed seeing the price tags rise too.","A major bequest to Oxford follows in philanthropic footsteps

THE cover of Texas Monthly shows Greg Abbott sitting in a wheelchair, holding a shotgun. A Republican running for governor of Texas, his passion for firearms is hardly unusual. When he vows to defend the Second Amendment, that is about as brave as saying he won't ban motherhood. 
Nonetheless, Mr Abbott is rather unusual, and rather brave. Since a falling tree paralysed him when he was 26, he has overcome both physical pain (for example, when bone fragments pierced his spinal cord) and daunting obstacles. The accident spurred him to outstrive his peers, first as a lawyer, next as a judge and then, since 2002, as his state's attorney-general. 
His highly visible disability (unlike Franklin Roosevelt, he makes no effort to disguise it) is probably an electoral asset. Voters can see how hard he works: at one public event he moved his wheelchair back and forth, by hand, 1,600 times. Having dealt with ""a life-altering physical challenge"", he says, helps him empathise with the challenges that all Texans face, whether physical, financial or emotional. 
Mr Abbott wants to help Texans rise above their difficulties, as he has--a line that fits with the Lone Star state's bootstrapping ethos. And he is the one candidate who can crack jokes about disability, lightening the mood on the stump. ""Some politicians talk about having a steel spine,"" he tells supporters; ""I actually have one."" 
Rick Perry, the governor of Texas since 2000 (when George Bush junior quit to become president), will not run for re-election next year. Mr Abbott is the favourite to succeed him. His main opponent in the Republican primary, Tom Pauken, a former chairman of the Texas Republican Party, has raised less than $250,000 to Mr Abbott's $22m. 
However, Mr Abbott could face a tough opponent in the general election. Wendy Davis, a state senator, was expected to announce her candidacy as The Economist went to press. Nationally, Ms Davis is much better known than Mr Abbott. In June she donned pink sneakers and staged an 11-hour filibuster of an anti-abortion bill. She won only a brief victory, but became an instant star among progressives. 
No Democrat has won statewide office in Texas since 1994--longer than in any other state. Texas has not backed a Democrat for the White House since Jimmy Carter in 1976. Democrats are desperate to change this. As the Texan population becomes less Anglo and more Hispanic, they think they have a chance. And in Ms Davis, they think they have a champion: one, moreover, whose struggle to keep abortion more widely available in Texas fits the Democratic narrative that Republicans are waging a ""war on women"". 
The party ""need[s] a face"", says Harold Cook, a Democratic strategist, and Ms Davis is ""incredibly charismatic"". With her ""national celebrity"" she can raise the $40m or so she will need to compete, Mr Cook predicts. He thinks she will appeal to suburban women who have long voted Republican for lack of a credible alternative; and some polls agree. Looking further ahead, some Democrats argue that if they can make Texas competitive, it will have national repercussions. ""If we win Texas, it'll be no contest for the White House,"" says Andy Brown, a Democrat running for local office in Travis County, which includes the city of Austin. Yet the smart money still says Ms Davis will lose, unless an independent Tea Party candidate enters the race, in which case all bets are off. 
Texan voters are conservative, and Mr Abbott knows how to stroke them. As attorney-general, he has sued the federal government 30 times, largely to keep the Environmental Protection Agency, which he accuses of overreaching, at bay. ""I go into the office, I sue the federal government and I go home,"" he tells voters. 
He also offers continuity in a state that has prospered under Mr Perry. Texas has created far more jobs than any other state, and attracted hordes of newcomers. The population grew by 21% between 2000 and 2010, as jobseekers poured in not only from Mexico but also from the rest of America. Population growth has strained the state's schools and roads, but plenty of people still vote for Texas with their feet. Mr Abbott praises the Texan model of less government, low taxes and a predictable business environment, and accuses Ms Davis of wanting to foist the ""Detroit model"" on the state. 
Republicans dispute the idea that, as Texas becomes more Hispanic, it will turn Democratic. As Hispanics get richer, their attitude to government may evolve, suggests Mr Perry. Imagine, he says, a young Latino who five years ago had a minimum-wage job but is now making $100,000 a year driving a truck: ""He wants to know who the hell this Mr FICA is that's taking [so much] of his pay cheque."" (FICA being a federal payroll tax.) 
Republicans insist that Hispanics are patriotic, family-oriented and enterprising, and therefore natural Republicans. Maybe so, but the national Republican Party's loud anti-immigration wing could hurt Texan Republicans, even candidates who are personally pro-immigrant. Mr Abbott stresses that he has been married to a Latina for 32 years. ""I understand diversity in this state,"" he says. 
The Democrats' best hope, says one Democratic consultant, is that Mr Abbott will say something stupid or offensive. The trouble is, he has so far shown few signs of indiscipline. And the usual approach of having a party operative hassle the candidate with a camera until he slips up is problematic when the candidate is Mr Abbott. Democrats do not want to appear to be bullying a guy in a wheelchair.

IN HIS election campaign Tony Abbott, Australia's new prime minister, promised ""more Jakarta"" (focus on Asia and bilateral ties) and ""less Geneva"" (historic Western links, multilateral bodies). So it was important that he fulfilled his promise to make his first foreign trip in office to Indonesia, Australia's closest neighbour. He also probably needed to do so before attending the annual meeting of the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation group in Bali on October 7th-8th. Of all multilateral talking-shops, APEC struggles most to justify its existence. 
Mr Abbott's visit to Jakarta, Indonesia's capital, this week with his foreign minister and a business delegation was never going to be plain sailing, however. Not only had his opponents made much of his alleged ignorance about foreign affairs and the flat-footed simplifications with which he summed them up. He had also riled Indonesian leaders with his approach to the one foreign-policy issue that loomed large in the campaign: how to handle the thousands of asylum-seeking boat people from Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and elsewhere heading for Australian shores (over 18,500 in 250 boats so far this year). Most use Indonesia as a staging post. Thirty-six asylum-seekers lost their lives at sea just before Mr Abbott's visit. 
Mr Abbott had suggested using the navy to turn boats back, and paying Indonesians for information about the trade. This had raised hackles about Indonesian sovereignty--how would he like it if a foreign state publicly offered to pay Australians to spy on each other? 
Mr Abbott's supporters, however, were able to portray his maiden sortie as something of a triumph. After repeated pledges of respect for Indonesian sovereignty, the prime minister secured the agreement of Indonesia's president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, to hold bilateral talks on the people-smuggling issue--a concession from Indonesia's previous stand that it had to be dealt with in a multilateral forum. 
In return, Mr Yudhoyono was able to make much of Mr Abbott's remark that his government ""takes a very dim view...of anyone seeking to use our country as a platform for grandstanding against Indonesia"". This was taken as a pledge to act tough against those agitating for the independence of the troubled Indonesian province of West Papua. 
Mr Abbott was able to blame the previous government for a serious hiccup in the bilateral relationship--a temporary Australian ban in 2011 on the export of live cattle to Indonesia. This, introduced after a television programme alleged cruelty in Indonesian slaughterhouses, hurt the industry in both countries. ""Never again"", said Mr Abbott, would Australia play fast and loose with the food security of such an important neighbour. 
Perhaps by coincidence, good news emerged on the issue that probably resonates most among Australians--the detention in Bali of Schappelle Corby, a 36-year-old Australian serving a 15-year sentence for smuggling marijuana into Indonesia in 2004. Her bid for parole passed another hurdle this week. 
On the negative side, the Indonesian press was outraged at being excluded from an Abbott press conference. Some suggested this might even be illegal under Indonesian law. The more old-fashioned of Indonesian politicians might relish this chance to lecture Australia about press freedom. But looking at this, and his remarks about pro-Papua protesters in Australia, they might also conclude that Mr Abbott is their sort of bloke.","Trying to move relations beyond the old bugbears

FIVE weeks after it lost power to a conservative coalition under Tony Abbott, Australia's Labor Party has installed a new leader.

After six turbulent years in government under Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard, Mr Shorten must now reunite the party. 
It was Mr Rudd who pushed through the new rules. In the past, Labor parliamentarians had decided the leadership. Mr Rudd proposed giving equal weight to votes from ordinary party members, arguing that a Labor leader who wins an election should stay for a full term. 
Mr Shorten, from the party's right in Melbourne, defeated Anthony Albanese, a left-wing figure from Sydney, in the leadership contest. Trained as a lawyer, Mr Shorten is a former head of the Australian Workers' Union, one of the country's most powerful. He entered federal parliament only in 2007, but has already been a minister for workplace relations, education and financial services. 
Although keen to project himself as a new face, offering ""big ideas"" for a ""diverse nation"", Mr Shorten is still seen by some as part of Labor's old faction-ridden ways. He helped to engineer a coup against Mr Rudd in 2010 that installed Ms Gillard as leader. When she looked likely to lead Labor to defeat this year, Mr Shorten helped to reinstate Mr Rudd. Some rancour still lingers. Nicola Roxon, a former Rudd and Gillard minister, accepts Mr Rudd's ousting was ""an act of political bastardry"". But she says it only happened ""because Kevin had been such a bastard himself"". 
Mr Shorten's first test as opposition leader will come when Parliament resumes in November. Mr Abbott has pledged legislation to abolish the former Labor government's carbon tax. Mr Shorten supports carbon pricing.

WHEN he made Jakarta his first foreign destination after he was elected as Australia's prime minister in September, Tony Abbott promised a relationship with Indonesia ""of no surprises, based on mutual trust"". Only two months later, Indonesia has decided to downgrade its relationship with Mr Abbott's government. The country has been enraged by revelations by Guardian Australia and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that in 2009 Australia's Defence Signals Directorate (DSD), an intelligence agency, tried to tap the phones of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, Indonesia's president, his wife and several in his innermost circle. 
Australia has survived crises with its closest northern neighbour before, especially over their disagreements over East Timor (now Timor-Leste) and Indonesia's policies in West Papua. This one may be more damaging than any. Indonesia's leaders seem livid. 
Mr Yudhoyono took to Twitter this week to lodge a ""strong protest"" at the ""hurtful action"" by Australia. (He had already ordered the return of Indonesia's ambassador from Canberra.) He complained that the Australian prime minister had ""belittled"" the matter, making a statement on it that carried no remorse. An Indonesian minister has cancelled a planned trip to Australia. 
Indonesia's ambassador to America, Dino Patti Djalal, was a presidential spokesman in 2009 when his phone was one of those allegedly tapped. He says Indonesians are realistic enough to know that bugging is commonplace, ""but we also believe that, between 'strategic partners', some things should be off-limits."" Mr Djalal warns Australia ""not to underestimate the sense of anger felt by Indonesian leaders and common people"". 
Mr Abbott, who during his election campaign had promised ""More Jakarta, less Geneva"", has put Indonesia at the centre of his foreign policy in a way no other Australian leader has. ""Stop the boats"", his other foreign-policy pledge, meant stemming the flow of asylum-seekers arriving in Australia, many of whom stop off in Indonesia and embark from there. 
Indonesia has long been a target of Australia's snooping as part of an intelligence-sharing club known as ""Five Eyes"", whose other members are America, Britain, Canada and New Zealand. The revelations of Australia's 2009 phone-bugging appear to have come from secret documents leaked by the former American National Security Agency contractor, Edward Snowden. The documents listed ""leadership targets"" and their types of mobile phones. Experts believe it is a safe assumption that this was not the only month in which Australia's intelligence agencies dabbled in Indonesian ""leadership communications"". 
Mr Abbott could argue that this bugging, at least, happened under Kevin Rudd's former Labor government. But he chose not to, and Labor, now in opposition, rallied to his support. Mr Abbott's response to the furore has hardly been conciliatory. He has offered ""regret"" for any embarrassment that Mr Yudhoyono suffered from the reports. But he insisted that ""Australia should not be expected to apologise for the steps we take to protect our country now or in the past."" 
That mirrors the language Mr Abbott used in his election campaign to promote his policy of turning back asylum-seekers' boats to Indonesia. This policy in itself angered the Indonesian government, especially Mr Abbott's plan for Australia to buy boats from fishermen believed likely to rent or sell them to people-smugglers. The main achievement of his recent visit to Jakarta was to secure Indonesia's agreement to talk about this. It is one of the areas of co-operation Indonesia has now cancelled. 
Mr Abbott sees Indonesia as the ""most important single relationship that we have"". But his clumsiness may have put that at risk. Hugh White at the Australian National University reckons that the row will only strengthen the impression in Indonesia that when the prime minister offered ""respect for Indonesia's sovereignty"" during his Jakarta visit, it was ""not so much deft diplomacy as insincerity"".

WHEN Texas passed its new voter-identification law, in 2011, the Republicans who dominate state politics rejoiced. This, they said, would help guarantee ""the integrity of state elections"". 
Nonsense, said Democrats, who accuse Republicans of using voter-ID laws to make it harder for poor people and minorities to vote. Republicans retort that electoral fraud is real. In 2012 Texas's attorney-general, Greg Abbott, boasted that his office had caught more than 50 cheats between 2002 and 2012. That is not a big number, among the more than 13m registered voters in Texas. But it is not nothing. 
In November Texans (at least, those with a state-issued photo ID) had their first chance to vote since the law was implemented. The delay was caused by the usual legal wrangling round voter-ID laws. In 2012 a federal court blocked Texas's law from taking effect. Similarly strict regulations were already in place elsewhere, but under the Voting Rights Act of 1965 Texas was subject to federal ""preclearance"" on any new voting rules. ""Preclearance"" is a sort of naughty step for states that, in the past, have hindered voting by minorities. 
The Texan law was therefore in limbo until June, when the Supreme Court addressed the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County v Holder, a dispute between an Alabama county and the attorney-general of the United States, Eric Holder. The court held that the preclearance requirement was constitutional in itself, but that the formula used to establish preclearance had to be binned. It had not been revised since 1975, and therefore punished states for the sins of officials who retired long ago. Texas first came under preclearance because the 1975 revision added a note about jurisdictions that provided voter information only in English, despite having a lot of Spanish speakers.

The effect of the Shelby County ruling was that all the states and parts of states that had been subject to preclearance were freed to make their own electoral rules, at least for now.

 WHEN Texas passed its new voter - identification law , in 2011 , the Republicans who dominate state politics rejoiced . This , they said , would help guarantee "" the integrity of state elections "" . 
 Nonsense , said Democrats , who accuse Republicans of using voter - ID laws to make it harder for poor people and minorities to vote . Republicans retort that electoral fraud is real . In 2012 Tony Abbott's boasted that Tony Abbott's office had caught more than 50 cheats between 2002 and 2012 . That is not a big number , among the more than 13 m registered voters in Texas . But it is not nothing . 
 In November Texans ( at least , those with a state - issued photo ID ) had their first chance to vote since the law was implemented . The delay was caused by the usual legal wrangling round voter - ID laws . In 2012 a federal court blocked Texas 's law from taking effect . Similarly strict regulations were already in place elsewhere , but under the Voting Rights Act of 1965 Texas was subject to federal "" preclearance "" on any new voting rules . "" Preclearance "" is a sort of naughty step for states that , in the past , have hindered voting by minorities . 
 The Texan law was therefore in limbo until June , when the Supreme Court addressed the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County v Holder , a dispute between an Alabama county and the attorney - general of the United States , Eric Holder . The court held that the preclearance requirement was constitutional in itself , but that the formula used to establish preclearance had to be binned . It had not been revised since 1975 , and therefore punished states for the sins of officials who retired long ago . Texas first came under preclearance because the 1975 revision added a note about jurisdictions that provided voter information only in English , despite having a lot of Spanish speakers . Yet Texas has changed dramatically in the past four decades . It is much less bigoted and more Hispanic : no sane candidate today would fail to produce Spanish campaign ads .

But the resolve by some governments to punish the Assad regime with an American-led missile strike crumbled after the British Parliament surprisingly rejected such action. Russia brokered a deal, backed by the UN and America, under which Syria is destroying its chemical stockpile. The war rumbles on. The UN estimates that three-quarters of Syria's population will need aid in 2014. 
Civil strife enveloped Egypt whenMuhammad Morsi, its Islamist president, was ousted by the army after days of street protests against his government that were bigger than the anti-Mubarak demonstrations in 2011. A crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood led to more bloodshed; most of its leaders were imprisoned. 
Pakistan's election marked the country's first civilian transition of power at the end of a full five-year term. Nawaz Sharif returned as prime minister; he had last held the job in 1999. Bombings and mayhem continued unabated. At least 50 people were killed on the day that Mr Sharif held a press conference with David Cameron, Britain's prime minister, that discussed security issues. 
Although less frequent than in previous years, American drone strikes against militants in Pakistan were bitterly condemned by its government. Drone technology was also more widely talked about elsewhere for other purposes, such as distributing aid to rural areas and delivering packages. 
Iraq had its worst year for sectarian violence since 2008, with over 8,000 people killed. 
The nutcracker 
A new governing coalition was formed in Italy, headed by Enrico Letta of the centre-left Democrats, after an election in which a quarter of Italians registered their discontent by opting for a new party led by a comedian. Mr Letta got on with the serious business of trying to reduce public debt. The fun ended for Silvio Berlusconi when he was booted out of the Senate, after having been definitively convicted of a crime for the first time. 
Cyprus became the fourth country in the euro zone to get a full bail-out, though only after an anxious week in which it had to resubmit a plan to restructure its banks. Ireland became the first country to exit its bail-out programme. 
Pope Benedict shook the Catholic church by stepping down, the first pope to retire in 600 years. His successor, Pope F rancis, an Argentine Jesuit, shook the church further by saying it should worry less about sexuality and by moving to reform the Vatican. 
Tech companies dominated the year's business news. Twitter completed a successful IPO, with its share price up 73% on the first day of trading. Struggling BlackBerry called off a deal whereby its largest investor would have taken it private; it then sacked its chief executive. And Microsoft bought Nokia's mobile-device business. 
Dell rebooted its business by agreeing to a $25 billion offer from its founder, Michael Dell, to take it private, but not before rebellious investors submitted a counterbid for the computer-maker. Dell's was the largest buy-out since the start of the financial crisis in 2007. 
Some of the world's big central banks gotnewgovernors, including Raghuram Rajan at the Reserve Bank of India, Haruhiko Kuroda at the Bank of Japan and Mark Carney at the Bank of England. Janet Yellen was picked to be chairwoman of America's Federal Reserve; Ben Bernanke steps down early next year. Investors spent most of the year anticipating the start of the Fed's ""tapering"" of its asset-buying programme. 
Glad tidings we bring 
Most stockmarkets in Europe and America had a good year (those in emerging markets did not fare so well). The Dow Jones Industrial Average had broken a score of record highs by the beginning of December. 
China's new leadership under Xi Jinping announced the boldest set of reforms for decades. These included more market pricing and a promise to abolish labour camps. China also further relaxed its one-child policy, in place since the 1970s, by allowing parents to have two children if one of the parents is an only child. In 2012 $2 billion-worth of fines were imposed on families that broke the one-child rule. 
China tried to stamp its authority on its region by imposing an air defence zone over a swathe of the East China Sea that covers islands contested by Japan. Japan and America ignored China's demand that it should be notified about flight plans by sending aircraft into the zone without warning. In December China accused Japan of ""malicious slander"" for suggesting its zone was threatening stability. 
In March North Korea startled the world when it said it was preparing for a ""state of war"" with South Korea. Kim Jong Un, the North's young dictator, closed the year by executing his uncle for forming ""factions"" against him. 
Edward Snowden provoked a debate about government mass-surveillance programmes when he leaked classified documents about the activities of America's National Security Agency. The extent of the snooping angered many, though Mr Snowden was accused of putting the security of America and its allies at risk. Some of those allies, including Angela Merkel of Germany and Dilma Rousseff of Brazil, were furious that their personal communications had been monitored. 
Typhoon Haiyan unleashed some of the strongest winds ever recorded at up to 315kph (195mph), leaving at least 6,000 people dead in the Philippines. 
Israel's general election returned Binyamin Netanyahu to power. After two months of tortuous negotiations he formed a broad coalition government and appointed Tzipi Livni, who leads the Hatunah party, as chief negotiator with the Palestinians. 
Joyful and triumphant 
Among other big elections, Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats won a third term in Germany and formed a grand coalition with the centre-left Social Democrats. She is the only leader in the euro zone to have been re-elected since the start of its debt crisis. Australia went through three prime ministers over the course of the year; the centre-right Liberals, led by Tony Abbott, won an election. Michelle Bachelet became Chile's president again; her first term ended in 2010. Malaysia's ruling Barisan Nasional coalition had its worst election showing since 1969; it still formed a government. And Uhuru Kenyatta was declared the victor in a presidential election in Kenya. His trial at the International Criminal Court on charges of orchestrating the ethnic violence that followed Kenya's 2007 election begins in February. 
Problems with battery systems led to the temporary grounding of Boeing's new 787 Dreamliner around the world. It was the first time America's Federal Aviation Administration had grounded a type of aircraft since 1979. 
In Bangladesh the collapse of a building that housed clothing factories killed 1,100 workers. They had been ordered to return to work despite warnings about cracks in the structure. It was South Asia's worst industrial disaster in 30 years. 
Ding-dong merrily on high 
America's government was temporarily shut down for the first time in 17 years, after a bickering Congress failed to pass a spending bill. The Republicans frustrated the White House with their blocking tactics, causing the Democrats to introduce a curb on filibustering in the Senate. Barack Obama's approval ratings headed to the emergency room after the botched roll-out of his health-care reforms. 
In Turkey a protest against developing a park in Istanbul snowballed into nationwide demonstrations against the authoritarian tone of Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government. Elsewhere, an increase in fares on Sao Paulo's buses was the catalyst for bringing millions of disaffected Brazilians out onto the streets in 100 cities. There was a sense of deja vu about protests in Thailand (against a government run by a member of the Shinawatra family), Ukraine (against an unreconstructed pro-Russian president) and Greece (against just about everything). 
Diplomats hailed an apparent breakthrough on Iran's nuclear programme that gives it six months to curtail its activities, though in December Iranian negotiators walked out of a meeting to discuss implementing the deal. Earlier, Hassan Rohani, Iran's new president, was given a cautious welcome by the West. The American and Iranian presidents talked for the first time since 1979. 
Although he faced mounting criticism at home, President Francois Hollande of France was praised abroad for sending French troops to Mali to help fight Islamist separatists. A peace deal was signed in the summer. France also sent troops to the Central African Republic to join a peacekeeping force, led by the African Union, to try to prevent the rebels who had taken over the country from wreaking havoc. 
A group affiliated to al-Qaeda and purportedly demanding an end to French operations in Mali seized a gas plant in Algeria and held 800 people hostage. Algerian security forces stormed the complex, but 39 foreign workers were killed during the operation. 
In some of the year's other audacious terrorist attacks, Islamist Somalis attacked a shopping mall in Nairobi, Kenya's capital, resulting in scores of deaths during a four-day siege; two brothers, motivated by Islamist beliefs, bombed the Boston marathon, killing three people; and two British Islamists of Nigerian descent shocked Londoners when they ran down an off-duty soldier and tried to decapitate him. 
Britain's Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition produced ever more spending cuts. But the government declared that austerity was bearing fruit after several international forecasts of British growth were revised upwards. 
After Hugo Chavez's death from cancer, power was transferred in Venezuela to Nicolas Maduro, who won a presidential election. Mr Maduro carried on where his predecessor left off, accusing the opposition of economic sabotage, expelling American diplomats and forcing through price controls. 
Bitcoin, an online currency run on cryptographic software and favoured by drug dealers, gained some respectability this year, with even Ben Bernanke saying it ""may hold long-term promise"". But its price is volatile, soaring from $15 in January to above $1,200 in early December and crashing to under $600 a week later.

AS POLITICAL honeymoons go Tony Abbott's has proved elusive, even invisible. Mr Abbott (pictured above) became Australia's prime minister almost four months ago, when he led the conservative Liberal-National coalition to a comfortable victory over an unpopular Labor government. By the end of the year, however, the unpopularity had shifted to the new government. No prime minister in memory has fallen so quickly from voters' grace. 
Surveys conducted in November and December by Australia's two main pollsters, Nielsen and Newspoll, both showed Labor ahead of the coalition by 52 points to 48. The coalition won 53.5% of the vote at the election last September against Labor's 46.5%, after distribution of second preference votes. John Stirton, of Nielsen, says that in 40 years of polling, his firm has never seen a swing of such magnitude against a new administration. Governments have usually basked in polling honeymoons of up to two years. This time, the post-election swing is against it. 
Besides bad polls, problems now loom over the government's handling of the economy. On December 17th a Treasury update on the fiscal year from July 2013 painted a chilling picture. The budget deficit had more than doubled from its original projection last May to A$47 billion ($42 billion). Growth had slowed, and unemployment was forecast to rise slightly, to 6%. Falling revenue and the legacy of stimulus spending under Labor played some part in what the Treasury called the ""deterioration"". The Treasury also cited the new government's promised grant of almost A$9 billion to the central bank to help it manage future crises, and some of its policies such as the projected repeal of a carbon tax. Mr Abbott has retreated from his promise a year ago of a surplus in each of his government's first three years. 
Even before this sober reality, the government was looking clumsy. Mr Abbott's apparent insouciance over revelations in November that Australia had spied on Indonesia's leaders made that furore worse. The government in Jakarta then withdrew co-operation over dealing with people-smugglers who were sending asylum-seekers in boats to Australia. This imperils another of Mr Abbott's election promises, to ""stop the boats"". 
Damage from arrogant performances by two of Mr Abbott's senior ministers has also been self-inflicted. Once, the immigration department revealed numbers and nationalities of asylum-seekers arriving by boat. Scott Morrison, the new government's immigration minister, banned such disclosures. Instead, flanked by an army commander to highlight the government's military-led operation against boat people, Mr Morrison holds weekly briefings, where he reveals only what he chooses. In a statement on December 27th to mark the ""first 100 days of Operation Sovereign Borders"", Mr Morrison declared: ""The boats have not yet stopped, but they are stopping."" The press lampooned him. 
In November Christopher Pyne, the education minister, reneged on the coalition's promise to implement the former Labor government's education-finance reforms. They stemmed from a report two years ago by David Gonski, a leading business figure, who called on Canberra and the states to spend an extra A$5 billion a year, especially to raise public-school standards, where Australia has slipped lower in world league tables. The Abbott government underestimated the public backlash to its ditching of this popular measure; it was forced to reinstate it. Mr Abbott even tried to explain his original promise as one ""that some people thought that we made"". 
Collectively, the government's performance has fed voters' long-standing doubts about Mr Abbott. The doubts have surfaced in the conservative Liberal Party, which Mr Abbott leads. John Fahey, a finance minister in the former coalition government, under John Howard, says Mr Abbott was not ""known for his judgment"" then, and has not taken his ""best team into government"" now. 
As opposition leader, Mr Abbott played tough against a divided Labor government, but offered few sturdy policies. Mr Stirton reckons Australians changed government in September mainly to be rid of Labor. Mr Abbott, he says, is ""the least popular opposition leader ever to be elected to the prime ministership"". 
Mr Abbott has plenty of time to hone his judgments; the next election is due in 2016. In a report to Australians on his government's first 100 days, he said it was ""purposefully, carefully and methodically"" building its ""policy foundations"". So far, at least, voters seem uncertain about both the policies and their foundations.","Not long after voting in Tony Abbott's team , Australians are having second thoughts

THE Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, likens his government's campaign to stop asylum-seekers landing in the country by boat to a military campaign. Four months after he led the conservative Liberal-National coalition to power promising to ""stop the boats"", Mr Abbott is claiming victory in ""Operation Sovereign Borders"". On January 24th his immigration minister, Scott Morrison, claimed that no boat people had arrived in Australian waters for more than a month, the longest boat-free period for nearly five years. Yet Australia's relations with Indonesia, its northern neighbour and the main embarkation point for boat people, have suffered. Marty Natalegawa, Indonesia's foreign minister, calls the Australian approach a ""slippery slope"" which could ""get out of hand"". 
In promising to turn back the boats, Mr Abbott has taken the populist path on boat people that John Howard, his mentor and a former coalition prime minister, promoted over a dozen years ago. Tapping voters' fears about boats swarming from Asia, Mr Howard banished their passengers to camps in Papua New Guinea and Nauru. Ensuing Labor governments were critical of the hardline policy. But in July the then Labor government, under Kevin Rudd, turned more draconian itself. It decreed that those in the camps who won refugee claims would be resettled in Papua New Guinea but never in Australia. After 16,000 asylum-seekers on 220 boats arrived in the first seven months of last year, boat numbers dropped sharply. The slowdown, for which Mr Abbott claims credit, began before he won power in September. 
In ordering the navy to stop vessels carrying asylum-seekers from entering Australian waters--by pushing them back towards Indonesia instead--Mr Abbott has acted in the face of Indonesian objections. In contrast to previous governments, he has also shrouded the operation in secrecy. War against people-smugglers, Mr Abbott says, should not involve giving out ""information...of use to the enemy"". 
Press reports in Australia and Indonesia suggest the navy has pushed up to six boats back. Asylum-seekers on one boat in early January told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) that they were badly burned when Australian sailors forced them to touch parts of their boat's engine. Mr Abbott endorsed the navy's denials of having done anything wrong and accused ABC of lacking patriotism. 
It has since emerged that in at least one operation, navy vessels entered Indonesian waters without authority. Indonesia is livid. It has deployed its own warships and military radar to monitor Australia's movements. Mr Natalegawa says Indonesia is ""keen to ensure our sovereign border is properly protected"". Australia has since apologised to Indonesia. But Mr Abbott's explanation of how a modern navy could inadvertently have entered Indonesian waters raises more questions. On January 28th he suggested the ships' commanders could have been distracted by winds, tides and ""all sorts of things"" at sea. His tone echoed the evasive response to revelations in November about Australia's phone-tapping of Indonesian leaders. 
Mr Abbott had promised that Indonesia would be at the heart of his foreign policy. Yet the boats controversy is as damaging as the phone-tapping scandal. Legal experts also say that Australia might have breached its obligations under the United Nations refugee convention by pushing asylum-seekers to another country. (Australia holds more than 4,000 boat people in camps on Christmas Island, an Australian territory, and in Papua New Guinea and Nauru.) 
Criticisms are mounting at home. John Ingram, a retired navy captain, calls the boats policy ""morally corrupt and indefensible"". He worries that sailors are being used ""for political purposes"". John Menadue, a former immigration head, calls the operation ""provocative, insensitive, crass"", a blot on a hitherto good Australian record on refugees. ""With cruelty over boats behind us,"" Mr Menadue says, the government should make amends by sharply lifting Australia's refugee intake through conventional UN channels, from 20,000 last year. The prospect that the Abbott government will take his advice is slight.","Tony Abbott's has Tony Abbott's costs

WHEN Australia's first locally made car, a Holden FX, rolled off the production line in 1948 it was greeted with an excitement that befitted a symbol of a youthful nation taking its place among advanced economies. Such was the enthusiasm for an indigenous car that around 18,000 punters paid deposits to buy one without even seeing it. 
Toyota's announcement on February 10th that it would join Ford and Holden in pulling out of carmaking in Australia, closing its assembly line in 2017, was greeted with commensurate dismay. Yet beneath the obligatory political blame-mongering was an acceptance that everything has turned against carmaking in Australia. 
The departure of the last big carmaker is as inevitable as an argument at a barbecue over the merits of a Ford versus a Holden. Mitsubishi closed its plant in Adelaide six years ago. The latest exodus began last May, when Ford said it would go in 2016. Holden, part of General Motors, said just before Christmas that it would quit in 2017. 
The industry has been in decline for years. A decade ago Australia produced 400,000 cars a year; in 2013 it churned out just over 200,000. Although Australians bought a record 1.14m cars in 2013, the market is small in global terms, and fragmented, with the three most popular models each clocking up just 40,000 sales. Sadly, none of these was assembled at home. 
Australia makes the wrong sort of motors. As in most rich countries, drivers increasingly want smaller fuel-efficient vehicles and fashionable SUVs. Of the six models made in the country only two, the Holden Cruze and the Ford Territory, fall into these categories. For cheap mass-market vehicles, on which profit margins are slender, high-volume, low-cost production is vital. But Australian factories are small: the biggest, Toyota's, makes just 100,000 cars a year. As a rule, plants making mass-market vehicles need to turn out at least 200,000 a year to have a hope of making them cheaply enough. 
Australian plants lack economies of scale but not employees with bulging wage packets. Only German car workers earn more. The lack of scale works its way down to local component-makers. These are also small by global standards, so parts are pricey. The result, according to both Ford and Holden, is that manufacturing costs are four times those in Asia and even twice European levels. That is a death sentence in a global market with plenty of spare capacity, even before considering the added burden of Australia's strong currency, buoyed by commodity exports. This hits locally made cars' competitiveness both at home compared with imported ones and abroad, where two-fifths of production ends up. 
Decades of generous state handouts have ""forestalled but not prevented"" the car industry's problems, concluded a recent report by the government's Productivity Commission. Since it came to power last September, the conservative administration led by Tony Abbott has declined to prop up struggling firms. It refused Holden's plea for more subsidies in December. Last month it rejected an A$25m ($22.5m) bail-out for SPC Ardmona, a fruit-canning business that Australians regard with a sentimentality matched only by that for Holden. Mr Abbott says the role of creating jobs belongs to business, not government. 
One commentator lamented that Australia will join Saudi Arabia as the only G20 countries without a car industry. But carmaking is a small and unprofitable part of a shrinking manufacturing sector, employing relatively few, in an economy dominated by services and resources. The main damage caused by the carmakers' departure is to Australians' self-esteem.

THE IRISH ECONOMY has had a dreadful time since the 2007-08 banking crisis. Output from peak to trough fell by 21% in nominal terms and unemployment rose from 5% to 15%. As house prices plummeted by 47%, the banks collapsed and had to be rescued, which pushed the debt-to-GDP ratio to 123%. The country was forced to enter an EU bail-out programme from which it has only just emerged.
But throughout the crisis the Irish government refused to shift on one issue: the 12.5% tax rate on corporate profits that has helped the country become a big draw for American companies. The Irish Development Agency (IDA) reckons that America accounts for 70% of Ireland's foreign direct investment. Overall FDI fell from 23.9% of Irish GDP in 2009 to 10.5% in 2011 but rebounded to 19.4% in 2012. In 2009-12, despite its problems, Ireland was still among the world's ten biggest recipients of FDI as a proportion of GDP. The very predictability of Ireland's regime adds to its appeal; companies have no reason to fear that taxes will suddenly shoot up.
Without the presence of those foreign companies the Irish recession would have been even worse. The IDA calculates that between them they employ 270,000 people, pay out EUR 17 billion a year in wages, generate exports worth EUR 122 billion and contribute EUR 2.8 billion in corporation tax. Moreover, the people who work for these companies are paying income tax, buying goods in local shops, making regular mortgage payments and are drawing no unemployment benefit. Despite the low tax rate on corporate profits, the government gets the equivalent of 2.6% of GDP from that source, the same as the EU average.
Barry O'Leary of the IDA points out that many of the businesses that have settled in Ireland are technology companies that have yet to make a profit and thus do not benefit from the low rate of corporation tax. Rob Skinner of PayPal, an online-payments company, says the group was one of the first technology companies to arrive, back in 2003. It started with 25 people. It has since been taken over by eBay, which has also moved to Ireland, and the combined group now employs 2,000 there.
It was not just the tax rate that attracted PayPal. Mr Skinner says the Dublin office provides a base for the group's operations throughout Europe, the Middle East and Africa. ""Ireland has people who speak many languages, allowing us to deal with customers across Europe,"" he explains.
The Gilt Groupe, an online fashion retailer, established an operation in Ireland in 2011. Michelle Peluso, its chief executive, describes Ireland as ""a really exciting market. It doesn't matter if you have low costs and a good office if you don't have the right talent. The quality score of staff in Ireland is high and there is real talent in maths and science."" Being in a different time zone from the country's American headquarters allows work to continue around the clock; the company's American team can arrive at work in the morning and find that the Irish staff have dealt with yesterday's problem overnight.
The IDA has focused on attracting businesses from five sectors, says Mr O'Leary: technology (led by companies such as IBM and HP); pharmaceuticals (including Novartis and Abbott Laboratories); financial services (many asset-management groups use Dublin as a base for their European mutual funds); digital media (Google and PayPal); and food (where the country is able to build on its experience in the dairy industry). 
Dublin, Cork and Galway get 65-70% of Ireland's FDI, but the IDA has been trying to persuade companies to go farther afield. The Gilt Groupe, for example, agreed to set up in Limerick with IDA support. Although EU rules prevent countries from subsidising particular industries, they do allow incentives to be offered to companies to move to particular locations--provided they are poor enough to qualify for regional aid.
Ireland's low tax rates have prompted some carping from other EU countries, but it is not easy to see what else the country could have done. As a small, open economy at the EU's periphery, it has to work hard to attract multinational companies, whereas a big country like America will get them anyway. The main competition there is among individual states. ","Special incentives to lure foreign direct investment can prove worthwhile

""I'M A very staunch supporter of the Second Amendment, but why talk about it?"" said J. Allen Carnes in a recent interview with a state newspaper. ""It has nothing to do with this job, unless you're talking about hog eradication."" Similarly, he said, he would steer clear of the state's debates about abortion and sexual ethics: ""Abstinence doesn't work for cows."" Mr Carnes is a farmer, the mayor of the small Texas town of Uvalde, and a candidate for state agriculture commissioner. He is also one of the few Republicans running in Texas this year who has not raced to convince voters of his far-right credentials in advance of the primary, which will be held on March 4th. 
The Texas elections have drawn more national attention than usual this year, because Democrats have an unusually prominent candidate for governor in Wendy Davis, a state senator from Fort Worth who became a hero to the left last summer after filibustering a strict new abortion bill. In January her campaign announced a whopping $12.2m fundraising haul for the previous six months. It has, however, been 20 years since the state elected a Democrat to any office of consequence, and she seems to be better at raising money than campaigning. At this point, at least, there is little to suggest that Ms Davis is the Democrat who can topple Goliath. Come 2015, Republicans will probably still hold all the top jobs. 
Most of those offices, however, will change hands. Last year Rick Perry, the governor, decided not to run for re-election. The attorney-general, Greg Abbott, is hoping to replace him. The comptroller, Susan Combs, is retiring. The lieutenant-governor, David Dewhurst, is running for re-election, but he has several primary challengers, including the incumbent land commissioner, Jerry Patterson, and the incumbent agriculture commissioner, Todd Staples. Texas will have new leaders in at least five of those jobs, and possibly six, and the game of musical chairs has created a fair number of openings further down the ballot. The top Republican candidates for attorney-general, for example, are a state representative, a state senator and a member of the powerful state agency that oversees oil and gas production. 
The change has been a long time coming. Mr Perry is the longest-serving governor in Texas history, having taken over the job after George W. Bush was elected president in 2000. Mr Abbott, Mr Dewhurst and Mr Patterson have served in their current roles nearly as long; all three were elected in 2002. Plenty of people will welcome the shake-up after more than a decade of Mr Perry's affable hegemony. The transition, however, may be more challenging than anyone expects. Mr Perry's years as governor marked a momentous time in Texas. The state has added more than 5.5m people since 2000, and by most economic-development measures it has easily outperformed the national average. Growth has also brought problems--the schools are underfunded, the roads are overcrowded--but Texas is broadly better off than it was 13 years ago. Regardless of how much credit the current leaders deserve for that, they are the ones who have been at the helm. 
All too many of the candidates in this year's Republican primaries seem to have forgotten what the party has got right, and why they have maintained their power in a state where demography increasingly favours the Democrats. Few are stressing the economy which is, under the circumstances, the only thing any of them should be talking about. Instead, they are debating whether people should be allowed to carry guns openly in public, whether the state should allow abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy if the mother's health is at risk, and so on. Such fringe issues are not a priority for most Texans--though they may be more exercised by the decision of a federal judge, on February 26th, to overturn the state's ban on gay marriage. 
Texan conservatives can be a fairly pragmatic lot. As recently as 2012, the state Republican Party added a plank to its platform in favour of an expanded guest-worker programme. This year, however, one of the candidates for lieutenant-governor has been vowing to stop what he calls an ""illegal invasion"". That is, first of all, dubious; unauthorised migration to the United States has apparently stalled since the recession. It is also unwise rhetoric in a state where Hispanics, most of whom are American citizens, will soon be a majority of the population. 
Many Republicans admit, sotto voce, that they are uncomfortable with the party's lurch to the petty and paranoid side of the spectrum. Last week Mr Abbott came under fire after holding several campaign events with Ted Nugent, an ageing rock musician who recently called the president, Barack Obama, a ""subhuman mongrel""--a comment that elicited a rebuke from Mr Perry and a passive-aggressive apology from Mr Nugent himself. (""I apologise, though not necessarily to the president."") It is not unusual for elections to become overheated in the home stretch; political operatives refer to these last few weeks as the ""silly season"". This time round, ""stupid"" may be a better word.","With primaries looming , Texas gets ready for new political leaders

Such fringe issues are not a priority for most Texans -- though they may be more exercised by the decision of a federal judge , on February 26th , to overturn the state 's ban on gay marriage . 
 Texan conservatives can be a fairly pragmatic lot . As recently as 2012 , the state Republican Party added a plank to its platform in favour of an expanded guest - worker programme . This year , however , one of the candidates for lieutenant - governor has been vowing to stop what he calls an "" illegal invasion "" . That is , first of all , dubious ; unauthorised migration to the United States has apparently stalled since the recession . It is also unwise rhetoric in a state where Hispanics , most of whom are American citizens , will soon be a majority of the population . 
 Many Republicans admit , sotto voce , that they are uncomfortable with the party 's lurch to the petty and paranoid side of the spectrum . Last week Tony Abbott came under fire after holding several campaign events with Ted Nugent , an ageing rock musician who recently called the president , Barack Obama , a "" subhuman mongrel""--a comment that elicited a rebuke from Mr Perry and a passive - aggressive apology from Mr Nugent himself . ( "" I apologise , though not necessarily to the president . "" ) It is not unusual for elections to become overheated in the home stretch ; political operatives refer to these last few weeks as the "" silly season "" . This time round , "" stupid "" may be a better word .",900,Australia,cb-900-2,IN TERM,True,Mr Abbott,3,True

WHEN Tony Abbott became Australia's prime minister in 2013, almost his first acts were to abolish the country's Climate Commission and to promise the repeal of a carbon tax. Soon after, Japan scrapped plans to cut carbon emissions by 25% by 2020, citing its post-tsunami shutdown of nuclear-power plants. Such actions in large countries--Japan is the fifth biggest carbon emitter; Australia the 17th--give the impression that the world as a whole is stepping away from environmental rules and laws. 
But according to lawmakers themselves, that impression is false. In a review published on February 27th of national climate legislation in 66 countries, accounting for 88% of carbon emissions, they calculated that almost half of their parliaments passed climate-change or energy-efficiency acts in 2013. Only Japan and Australia went the other way. 
The new laws varied hugely. Some were sweeping--take Bolivia's whimsically named Law on Mother Earth and Integral Development to Live Well. Others were narrowly targeted but could have a big impact: Canada introduced rules on exhaust from heavy lorries. Still others, including an environmental-protection law in the poor and violent Democratic Republic of Congo, may have all too little effect. The review considered only the quantity of legislation, not its quality. It says nothing about whether laws are implemented or effective. 
All the same, the patient accumulation of domestic decisions is striking. The survey by GLOBE International, a group of lawmakers, and the Grantham Research Institute of the London School of Economics, shows that the world's stock of climate laws has risen steeply, from fewer than 50 in 2000 to almost 500 in 2013. The most active period was in 2008-09, in the run-up to an international climate conference in Copenhagen, at which the signing of a treaty restricting carbon emissions was widely expected. Those hopes were dashed, but have since been rekindled, this time focused on a meeting to be held in Paris in 2015. Countries like to have new climate laws to show off at such gatherings, which may partly explain why the pace of legislation did not slacken much in 2013. 
The nature of the laws, though, is changing. During the busy years countries put broad framework legislation on the books. All but five of the 66 passed laws to promote low-carbon energy, for instance. Now, many laws are fleshing out details of that framework legislation. 
GLOBE started as a talking shop for a few parliamentarians. It has now set up a formal arrangement, helped by the World Bank, to provide policy advice and swap ideas about good practice among lawmakers. They need help. As the review says, there may be a lot of laws. But this does not necessarily make for better policies--let alone a more stable climate.","Domestic climate legislation is booming

Eight assailants wielding knives killed 29 people and injured about 140 in an attack at the train station in Kunming, a city in south-western China.

VODAFONE'S latest figures appear at first glance to vindicate the most powerful management idea of the past two decades: that firms should expand in fast-growing emerging economies. Sales at the mobile-phone company fell in the rich world while those in the developing world rose smartly. Corporate strategy is usually a contentious subject: there are fierce debates about how big, diversified and financially leveraged firms should be. But geography has seduced everyone. Vodafone is one of countless Western companies that have bet on the developing world. 
Look closer, however, and those figures contradict accepted wisdom. At market exchange rates Vodafone's sales in the emerging world fell, reflecting the widespread currency depreciations in mid-2013, when America's Federal Reserve signalled it would taper its bond purchases. This drag may linger: in January the lira and rand tumbled in Turkey and South Africa, two biggish markets for Vodafone. On longer-term measures things look cloudy, too. Over a decade Vodafone has invested more than $25 billion in Turkey and India. These operations made a paltry 1% return on capital last year. Vodafone has created a lot of value for its shareholders--but through its American investments, which it has sold to Verizon for a stonking price. 
This year Western firms' giant bet on the emerging world will come under more scrutiny. Most multinationals are far more profitable in emerging markets than Vodafone. American firms made a 12% return on equity in 2012, roughly in line with their global average. But having grown fast, profits are now falling in dollar terms. There has been a long bout of share-price underperformance as investors have lost their euphoria. An index run by Stoxx, a data firm, of Western firms with high emerging-market exposures has lagged the broader S&P 500 index by about 40% over three years (see chart 1). And the recovery in the rich world will mean there will be more competition for resources within firms. 
All this will bring strategic questions into sharp relief. Divisional chiefs from Brazil or Asia will no longer get a blank cheque from their boards. Although the average company has prospered, there have been disasters; plenty of firms and some whole industries need a rethink. The emerging-market rush may end up like a giant version of the first internet boom 15 years ago. The broad thrust was right but some big mistakes were made. 
The companies suffering a slowdown in profits come in three buckets. Consumer firms including Coca-Cola, Nestle, Unilever and Procter & Gamble have suffered a gentle weakening in demand and a currency drag. Most are still upbeat about the long term, says Andrew Wood of Sanford C. Bernstein, an analysis firm. 
Companies in the second bucket face a sharper slowdown. They are in cyclical and capital-intensive industries. Fiat Chrysler's profits in Latin America, a vital cash cow, halved in 2013. This week Volkswagen and Renault joined the ranks of Western carmakers warning of weak emerging-market sales. Last month Peugeot wrote off $1.6 billion of assets, mainly in Russia and Latin America. Emerging-market sales have fallen at Cisco, a technology firm; its boss, John Chambers, reckons it is ""the canary in the coal mine"". Industrial giants such as ABB and Alstom have seen orders falter for infrastructure projects, for example the building of power stations, says Andreas Willi of J.P. Morgan. 
Those firms with mismatches--costs or debts in firm currencies but sales in depreciating ones--face a nasty squeeze. Margins in emerging markets have halved at Electrolux, which makes fridges and other appliances. Codere, a Spanish firm with an empire of gaming and betting shops in Latin America paid for with debts in euros, is now on life support and restructuring its balance-sheet. 
In the third bucket are firms with idiosyncratic problems. China's war on graft has hurt luxury-product makers that have grown fat by selling bling to the Middle Kingdom. Sales at Remy Cointreau, which makes cognac that Communist Party big-shots quaff, fell by a fifth in the quarter to December, compared with the previous year. Russia's once-frothy beer market is shrinking as the country conducts one of its periodic crackdowns on alcoholism. 
All this may be breezily dismissed as short-term turbulence. But emerging-market wobbles can have a profound impact on corporate strategy. After the 1997-98 Asian crisis many multinationals tilted back towards the rich world. Citigroup and HSBC, two big banks, played down their Asian heritages and spent the next decade building subprime and investment-banking operations in America. Unilever's operating profits fell in 1997. It felt obliged to tell shareholders that the rich world was its ""backbone"" and by 2000 it too had made a huge American acquisition, of Bestfoods. 
Rising exposure 
The emerging world's troubles are not as bad as in 1997-98. But the exposure of rich-world firms is far higher than then (see chart 2). Big European firms make one-third of their sales in the developing world, almost triple the level in 1997, reckons Graham Secker of Morgan Stanley. For big, listed American companies the total has doubled, to about one-fifth. For Japanese firms it is about one-tenth, says Kathy Matsui of Goldman Sachs. The bigger a firm is, the greater its exposure tends to be. Rich-world firms do business across the emerging world, with China accounting for 10-20% of it. Consumer goods, cars, natural resources and technology are the industries with most exposure. Property, construction and health care have the least. 
Many of these operations pre-date the boom. European firms have footprints in Asia and Africa from colonial times. American firms dominated foreign direct investment (FDI) flows in the 1970s and 1980s. By the 1990s manufacturing firms were creating global production chains. A wave of privatisations in Latin America enticed a new generation of conquistadores from Iberia and North America. 
But by the mid-2000s the process had accelerated dramatically as executives and boards latched on to the idea of the fast-growing BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, China) and their ilk. Once the subprime and euro crises began, the urge to escape the Western world was irresistible. FDI into China in 2010 was more than double the level in 1998. Takeovers became common. In 2007 purchases in emerging markets by rich-world firms reached $225 billion. That was five times the level just half a decade earlier. One measure of how discipline slipped is the valuation of those deals. In 2007 rich-world buyers stumped up a dizzy 17 times operating profits for their targets, double the multiple paid in 2000-03. 
Some firms had unexpected identity changes. Suzuki, a Japanese carmaker, found that its formerly sleepy Indian arm accounted for the biggest chunk of its market value. Portugal Telecom's Brazilian unit kept it afloat during the euro crisis. Having taken control of a beer firm in St Petersburg, Carlsberg, a Danish brewer, became a ""Russia play"". Mandom, an 87-year-old Japanese firm, found itself a giant of the Indonesian male-cosmetics market. 
Other firms' efforts to peacock their emerging-market credentials look, with hindsight, like indicators of excess. Having been bailed out for its toxic credit exposures back in America, Citigroup rebranded itself as an emerging-market bank. Schneider Electric, a French engineering firm, and HSBC relocated their chief executives from Europe to Hong Kong (HSBC has since backtracked). 
Historians may judge the peak of the frenzy to have been in June 2010. Nathaniel Rothschild, a scion of a banking dynasty (some of whose members are minority shareholders in The Economist), raised $1.1 billion for a shell company in London, set up to buy emerging-market mining assets. Months later it invested in Indonesian coal mines with the Bakrie family, known in that country for its political ties and web of businesses. According to Bloomberg, Mr Rothschild shook hands on the deal without visiting the main mine in question, in Borneo. The transaction was a ""terrible mistake"", he later admitted. 
Every corporate-investment cycle creates triumphs and disasters, and a lot of mediocrity. The emerging-markets boom will be no exception. Hard figures are elusive but the book value of the equity that Western firms have invested in the emerging world has probably risen by at least $3 trillion since 1998. This is a colossal sum, equivalent to 11% of the emerging markets' combined GDP in 2013. Many firms have prospered, such as the banks that braved Mexico in the 1990s. But there is plenty of rot, too. 
Start with takeovers. There have been $1.6 trillion-worth since 2002. A rule of thumb is that half of all deals destroy value for the acquirer. Like Vodafone, many firms paid dizzy prices justified by pepped-up forecasts. In 2010 Abbott Laboratories, an American drugs firm, paid $4 billion for the small Indian drugs unit of Piramal, predicting it would grow at 20% a year for a decade. Two years later sales were stagnant in dollar terms. Daiichi Sankyo, a Japanese drugs firm, has been badly burned in India, as the company it bought into, Ranbaxy, has hit serious quality problems. Lafarge paid $15 billion for Orascom, a North African and Middle Eastern rival, in 2007. The French cement giant predicted sales would rise by 30% a year. Since then its shares have almost halved, partly due to the crippling debt burden incurred. 
Big greenfield projects have broken hearts, too. ThyssenKrupp, a German steel colossus, launched an ambitious project in 2006 to make steel slabs in Brazil and process them in America. Rising costs have made it unviable, and most of the $10 billion sunk has been written off. The firm's boss has labelled the episode a ""disaster"". Anglo American, a mining company, buried $8 billion and the career of its former chief executive, Cynthia Carroll, in a Brazilian project called Minas-Rio. Cost overruns have led to a $4 billion write-off. 
Besides such eye-catching failures, there are pockets of serious underperformance tucked away in corners of sprawling multinationals. Consumer-goods firms have made hay in emerging markets, but even the best have some iffy businesses. Procter & Gamble's margins outside America are half those it enjoys at home. Profits are weak in India and Brazil, where it is a laggard. A.G. Lafley, who returned as the firm's boss last year, has promised more discipline. 
It is the same story with Spanish investments in Latin America. Telefonica makes good money across most of the continent, says Bosco Ojeda of UBS, a bank. But Mexico is a running sore. For 14 years Telefonica has poured in billions of dollars without threatening Carlos Slim, who dominates telecoms there. Even the world's two biggest brewers, Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller, which have been huge successes, have bought some businesses with low market shares and commensurately weaker profits and returns on capital. 
In some cases the underperformance is spread across an entire industry. During a boom every firm thinks it can be a winner, leading to excess investment and saturation. The more capital-intensive the industry is, the greater the pain in store for its weakest members. Insurance is a case in point. India has more than 20 foreign firms slugging it out for tiny market shares while bleeding cash. Turkey is also an insurers' graveyard. Most European firms have a motley collection of emerging-market assets, but only a few, such as Prudential, AXA and Allianz, have scale. ""There are trophy markets where everyone has decided they have to be in. Typically they don't make a lot of money,"" says an executive. 
The car industry also has a long tail of flaky businesses. It has invested more than $50 billion in factories in China, with great success, reckons Max Warburton, also of Bernstein. But ""China has affected the judgment of a lot of chief executives,"" making them too bullish about other emerging markets. More than $30 billion has been invested in developing countries other than China. New factories are opening just as demand has slowed. Ford's number two, Mark Fields, this week expressed worries about excess carmaking capacity building up in Brazil, Russia and India. Mr Warburton thinks such operations could burn billions of dollars this year. ""Everyone is bracing to lose a lot of money."" 
Taking the beer goggles off 
Some rich-world firms need to take a long, cold look at their emerging-market businesses and work out if they make sense. But there are psychological barriers to this. One is that most Western businesses have low gearing--usually it is only when they have a debt problem that they make difficult decisions quickly. Without their emerging-markets pep pill many firms would have dire revenue growth. The developing world has supplied 60-90% of the growth of Europe's big firms in recent years. And a whole generation of chief executives has learned that quitting emerging markets is a mug's game. Bosses who panicked and left after the 1997-98 crisis ended up looking like idiots. 
Yet companies should allocate capital carefully, regardless of the spare funds they have. Sales growth without profits is pointless. And comparisons with 1997-98 are imperfect. Most industries have become more competitive, as emerging economies' local firms get into their stride. The low-hanging fruit is gone. Reflecting this logic, a few big industries have already begun to trim their emerging-markets arms. 
Exhibit one is banking. After being bailed out, some firms such as ING and Royal Bank of Scotland have largely retreated from the developing world. Bank of America has sold out of its Chinese affiliate. But even big, successful firms which are dedicated to emerging economies are trying to boost returns by trimming back. HSBC has got out of 23 emerging-market businesses. The world's biggest five mining firms are also adapting to lower emerging-market demand. They have cut capital investment by a quarter since 2012, says Myles Allsop of UBS. 
The supermarkets are in retreat after decades of empire-building that led them to invest $50 billion in the emerging world. Synergies have proved elusive, local rivals have got stronger and tastes more particular. In Turkey shoppers prefer discount stores to hypermarkets--the four biggest foreign firms there lost money in 2012. Aside from Walmart's Mexican unit, most rich-country grocers' operations in the developing world have low market shares and do not cover their cost of capital. Casino, a French firm, has already shrunk, says Edouard Aubin, of Morgan Stanley. He thinks Carrefour could slim down to five countries from a peak of more than 20 (although it said this week it would keep expanding in China and Brazil). Walmart is cutting the number of stores it has in emerging markets. Tesco seems to have abandoned its dream of controlling big businesses in Turkey and China. 
In the next few years more firms may follow the example of some supermarkets and retreat from the developing world. Most, though, will adapt, cutting capital investment and pruning their portfolios. All this will create opportunities for rising local firms. On February 19th, as Peugeot announced its giant write-off of emerging-market assets, Dongfeng, its Chinese partner, said it would take a 14% stake in the French firm and that technology-sharing between the two would speed up. There are rumours that General Motors may sell its loss-making Indian plant to its Chinese partner, SAIC. In 2011 ING sold its large Latin American business to Grupo Sura, a Colombian conglomerate intent on becoming a regional player. 
The rich-world firms that remain will need to make their business models weatherproof, not just suited for the sunny days of a boom. That means shifting even more production to emerging markets and borrowing in local currencies--both are a natural hedge against currency turbulence. 
As others falter, the strongest multinationals are making bolt-on acquisitions. In 2013 Unilever bought out some minority shareholders in its Indian business for $3 billion and Anheuser-Busch InBev took control of Grupo Modelo, a Mexican rival, for $20 billion. The year before Nestle spent $12 billion buying Pfizer's baby-food business, which is mainly exposed to the emerging world. Rather than being the panacea envisioned by many Western firms during the boom, emerging markets are governed by the oldest business rule of all--survival of the fittest.

VODAFONE'S latest figures appear at first glance to vindicate the most powerful management idea of the past two decades: that firms should expand in fast-growing emerging economies. Sales at the mobile-phone company fell in the rich world while those in the developing world rose smartly. Corporate strategy is usually a contentious subject: there are fierce debates about how big, diversified and financially leveraged firms should be. But geography has seduced everyone. Vodafone is one of countless Western companies that have bet on the developing world. 
Look closer, however, and those figures contradict accepted wisdom. At market exchange rates Vodafone's sales in the emerging world fell, reflecting the widespread currency depreciations in mid-2013, when America's Federal Reserve signalled it would taper its bond purchases. This drag may linger: in January the lira and rand tumbled in Turkey and South Africa, two biggish markets for Vodafone. On longer-term measures things look cloudy, too. Over a decade Vodafone has invested more than $25 billion in Turkey and India. These operations made a paltry 1% return on capital last year. Vodafone has created a lot of value for its shareholders--but through its American investments, which it has sold to Verizon for a stonking price. 
This year Western firms' giant bet on the emerging world will come under more scrutiny. Most multinationals are far more profitable in emerging markets than Vodafone. American firms made a 12% return on equity in 2012, roughly in line with their global average. But having grown fast, profits are now falling in dollar terms. There has been a long bout of share-price underperformance as investors have lost their euphoria. An index run by Stoxx, a data firm, of Western firms with high emerging-market exposures has lagged the broader S&P 500 index by about 40% over three years (see chart 1). And the recovery in the rich world will mean there will be more competition for resources within firms. 
All this will bring strategic questions into sharp relief. Divisional chiefs from Brazil or Asia will no longer get a blank cheque from their boards. Although the average company has prospered, there have been disasters; plenty of firms and some whole industries need a rethink. The emerging-market rush may end up like a giant version of the first internet boom 15 years ago. The broad thrust was right but some big mistakes were made. 
The companies suffering a slowdown in profits come in three buckets. Consumer firms including Coca-Cola, Nestle, Unilever and Procter & Gamble have suffered a gentle weakening in demand and a currency drag. Most are still upbeat about the long term, says Andrew Wood of Sanford C. Bernstein, an analysis firm. 
Companies in the second bucket face a sharper slowdown. They are in cyclical and capital-intensive industries. Fiat Chrysler's profits in Latin America, a vital cash cow, halved in 2013. This week Volkswagen and Renault joined the ranks of Western carmakers warning of weak emerging-market sales. Last month Peugeot wrote off $1.6 billion of assets, mainly in Russia and Latin America. Emerging-market sales have fallen at Cisco, a technology firm; its boss, John Chambers, reckons it is ""the canary in the coal mine"". Industrial giants such as ABB and Alstom have seen orders falter for infrastructure projects, for example the building of power stations, says Andreas Willi of J.P. Morgan. 
Those firms with mismatches--costs or debts in firm currencies but sales in depreciating ones--face a nasty squeeze. Margins in emerging markets have halved at Electrolux, which makes fridges and other appliances. Codere, a Spanish firm with an empire of gaming and betting shops in Latin America paid for with debts in euros, is now on life support and restructuring its balance-sheet. 
In the third bucket are firms with idiosyncratic problems. China's war on graft has hurt luxury-product makers that have grown fat by selling bling to the Middle Kingdom. Sales at Remy Cointreau, which makes cognac that Communist Party big-shots quaff, fell by a fifth in the quarter to December, compared with the previous year. Russia's once-frothy beer market is shrinking as the country conducts one of its periodic crackdowns on alcoholism. 
All this may be breezily dismissed as short-term turbulence. But emerging-market wobbles can have a profound impact on corporate strategy. After the 1997-98 Asian crisis many multinationals tilted back towards the rich world. Citigroup and HSBC, two big banks, played down their Asian heritages and spent the next decade building subprime and investment-banking operations in America. Unilever's operating profits fell in 1997. It felt obliged to tell shareholders that the rich world was its ""backbone"" and by 2000 it too had made a huge American acquisition, of Bestfoods. 
Rising exposure 
The emerging world's troubles are not as bad as in 1997-98. But the exposure of rich-world firms is far higher than then (see chart 2). Big European firms make one-third of their sales in the developing world, almost triple the level in 1997, reckons Graham Secker of Morgan Stanley.

MOST people believed the island state of Tasmania had at last found peace after a 30-year war between environmentalists and loggers. Both sides signed a deal two years ago that gave everyone something: secure supplies for timber companies and protection for native forests. 
Now, though, Tony Abbott, Australia's prime minister, has reignited the war. Australia, he says, has too much ""locked-up forest"". Mr Abbott wants to open up a swathe of Australia's most fought-over forest and hand it to loggers. His government has asked UNESCO to remove 74,000 hectares (183,000 acres) from the World Heritage-listed wilderness region that covers about a fifth of Tasmania. 
On March 15th the Liberal Party, a pro-logging soul mate of Mr Abbott's federal conservative coalition, swept to power in Tasmania's state election. Will Hodgman, the new premier, vows to do Canberra's bidding and tear up the peace deal. After 16 years in opposition, the Liberals reduced the centre-left Labor Party to six seats in the 25-seat parliament. But, despite Mr Hodgman's strong mandate, ripping up the forest deal will not be easy. 
Mr Abbott laid the groundwork in a speech on March 4th to a gathering of forest-industry grandees in Canberra. The environment, he told them, ""is meant for man, and not just the other way around"". He saw loggers not as ""environmental bandits"", but as ""people who are the ultimate conservationists"". Even for a leader who has made political combat his hallmark, this was provocative stuff. 
The areas Mr Abbott wants to strip from World Heritage listing belong to 170,000 hectares that the organisation recognised only last year. This approval brought to about 1.5m hectares the World Heritage-listed wilderness region covering central and south-west Tasmania. This latest addition was a crucial part of the 2012 peace deal, known as the Tasmanian Forests Agreement, signed by timber companies, unions and green groups. 
Forests cover half of Tasmania: in Australia as a whole it is less than a quarter. Battles over access to the land harmed the logging industry. Fearing that supplies would be disrupted, customers in Asia had started looking elsewhere for their timber. For this reason alone, many loggers welcomed the calm that came with the peace as much as greens did. Ta Ann, a Malaysian-based outfit that turns eucalyptus logs into veneer, says it was ready to quit Tasmania, but the peace deal persuaded it to stay. 
Mr Hodgman plans talks with timber companies, although his ideas for managing the island's forests remain a mystery. He will not include environmental groups, he says, unless they drop their demand to stick to the peace deal. But the unlikely alliance created by the deal seems to have pre-empted the premier. Two days after the election, industry leaders, unions and environmentalists met in Hobart, Tasmania's capital, to reaffirm their support for the agreement. Terry Edwards, head of the Forest Industries Association of Tasmania, which signed the deal, says it was ""absolutely imperative"" in giving the industry certainty. Mr Abbott's talk of World Heritage excisions is ""not warranted"", says Mr Edwards. Indeed, ditching the deal could upset its plan to certify Tasmanian timber to the sustainable international standards that many customers ask for. 
Questions remain about Mr Abbott's reasons for stripping 74,000 hectares from World Heritage listing. He suggests the entire area had already been logged, ""degraded"" or planted with timber to be logged. The Wilderness Society, one of the environmental groups that signed the deal, calculates that just 10% of the area had in fact been logged; about 40% was ""old-growth"" forest, barely disturbed before; and much of the rest was natural vegetation. 
A real feller 
At 7.6% Tasmania's unemployment rate is Australia's highest (compared with 6% nationally). Mr Abbott blames ""Green ideology"" for many of the island's woes, even for Australia's lowest life expectancy. He wants a ""renaissance"" of forestry in Tasmania. The industry employs around 4,000 people, about 2,000 fewer than six years ago. The Australia Institute, a think-tank, reckons that Tasmania's industry can survive only with government subsidies. Delisting World Heritage regions, it argues, will create hardly any jobs. The World Heritage Committee is due to rule on the Abbott government's request in June.","Tony Abbott reignites an environmental battle

 Forests cover half of Tasmania : in Australia as a whole it is less than a quarter . Battles over access to the land harmed the logging industry . Fearing that supplies would be disrupted , customers in Asia had started looking elsewhere for their timber . For this reason alone , many loggers welcomed the calm that came with the peace as much as greens did . Ta Ann , a Malaysian - based outfit that turns eucalyptus logs into veneer , says it was ready to quit Tasmania , but the peace deal persuaded it to stay . 
 Mr Hodgman plans talks with timber companies , although his ideas for managing the island 's forests remain a mystery . He will not include environmental groups , he says , unless they drop their demand to stick to the peace deal . But the unlikely alliance created by the deal seems to have pre - empted the premier . Two days after the election , industry leaders , unions and environmentalists met in Hobart , Tasmania 's capital , to reaffirm their support for the agreement . Terry Edwards , head of the Forest Industries Association of Tasmania , which signed the deal , says it was "" absolutely imperative "" in giving the industry certainty . Tony Abbott's talk of World Heritage excisions is "" not warranted "" , says Mr Edwards . Indeed , ditching the deal could upset its plan to certify Tasmanian timber to the sustainable international standards that many customers ask for . 
 Questions remain about Tony Abbott's reasons for stripping 74,000 hectares from World Heritage listing . Tony Abbott suggests the entire area had already been logged , "" degraded "" or planted with timber to be logged . The Wilderness Society , one of the environmental groups that signed the deal , calculates that just 10 % of the area had in fact been logged ; about 40 % was "" old - growth "" forest , barely disturbed before ; and much of the rest was natural vegetation . 
 A real feller 
 At 7.6 % Tasmania 's unemployment rate is Australia 's highest ( compared with 6 % nationally ) . Tony Abbott blames "" Green ideology "" for many of the island 's woes , even for Australia 's lowest life expectancy . Tony Abbott wants a "" renaissance "" of forestry in Tasmania . The industry employs around 4,000 people , about 2,000 fewer than six years ago . The Australia Institute , a think - tank , reckons that Tasmania 's industry can survive only with government subsidies . Delisting World Heritage regions , it argues , will create hardly any jobs . The World Heritage Committee is due to rule on the Abbott government 's request in June .",900,Australia,cb-900-2,IN TERM,True,Tony Abbott,16,True

""ALL right, good night,"" were the last words heard by air-traffic controllers from Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 on March 8th. That makes them a rarity in the baffling story of the disappearance of a Boeing 777 carrying 239 passengers and crew from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing: an undisputed fact. In the days following, the Malaysian government provided information only in dribs and drabs, much of it confusing, even contradictory. 
As The Economist went to press, it seemed possible that the agonising wait for the passengers' families might be nearing an end. On March 20th Australia's prime minister, Tony Abbott, told parliament that satellite pictures showed debris in the southern Indian Ocean, some 2,500km southwest of Perth, in an area where the 777 might plausibly have crashed. At 20 metres or so, one object seemed the size of a wing or tail fin. Aircraft and ships were headed to the area to investigate further. If the plane's wreckage is found, and especially if its ""black box"" flight recorder can be recovered, what happened to flight 370 should become clearer. What is already beyond doubt is that air-traffic communication protocols need to be updated to ensure that, however rare, such a disappearance cannot be repeated. 
The distressed relatives of the mostly Chinese passengers are not alone in their bewilderment that, in a world of pervasive electronic surveillance, a 200-tonne passenger plane can vanish. With little concrete information, speculation has run wild. Commentators of varying degrees of authority have attempted to fill the blank canvas with theories ranging from an accident to suicidal tendencies on the flight deck, and conspiracies of a complexity that would seem farfetched in a disaster film. 
Hijacking seems unlikely: flight-deck doors are locked and sturdy. And investigations into the backgrounds of the crew and passengers have so far turned up no plausible motive. The first credible theory was that the plane had suffered a catastrophic mechanical failure and crashed, probably at sea. But a search along its flight path failed to turn up any sign of wreckage. 
Then news emerged that Malaysian military radar had tracked the plane apparently turning west off its route shortly after the final radio message. Malaysian authorities added that its ACARS, an on-board system which transmits intermittent data about the performance of engines and other parts, appeared to have stopped functioning just before that, and that the transponder, another device that communicates a plane's position to air-traffic control radars, appeared to have been switched off around the time of the turn. The fact that the pilots had not reported the switch-off led the authorities to infer foul play. On March 15th the Malaysian prime minister blamed ""deliberate action"", with suspicion falling on the pilot or co-pilot. That the plane vanished between signing off with Malaysian air-traffic controllers and establishing contact with Vietnamese ones, and apparently continued flying for several hours under the control of a skilled aviator, lent credence to the assertion. 
But this version of events was later revised by the Malaysian authorities. The ACARS, which sends messages intermittently, might have ceased functioning at exactly the same time as the transponder, it turned out. This makes the notion of an emergency more likely, perhaps a fire that incapacitated crew and passengers, leaving the plane to fly on ungoverned. The risk of an electrical fire is one reason why pilots are able to switch off on-board equipment, including that responsible for communications. But many are now calling for an automatic alert to be sent in such circumstances, so that ground authorities know that they should start tracking the plane with conventional radar. 
The ACARS has at least provided information about the jet's continued path, albeit wildly imprecise. Though it stopped transmitting data it continued to ""ping"" (send out a signal with no information other than that it was still operating) for six hours. That is about how long the plane's fuel tanks would have taken to empty. But the pings were only picked up by one satellite, making triangulation to establish the plane's path during that time impossible. 
Malaysian military radar apparently lost contact with the plane as it flew over the Indian Ocean. (According to reports on March 19th, Thai military radar may also have tracked it turning off course.) That suggests it is somewhere on an arc hundreds of miles wide running from Kazakhstan almost to Antarctica (see map). Planes and ships from 26 countries have now joined the hunt. The northern part seems less plausible: it approaches land and passes through several countries with military radar primed to look for unidentified aircraft. But to the south, where the search is now focused, there is little coverage. 
The information age is taking to the skies only slowly. Planes far out at sea keep in touch using VHF radio, and the newer ones send ACARS data continuously via satellite. Many are also equipped with ADS-B, another system that uses satellites and GPS to pinpoint their location when they are out of radar range. But flight 370's ADS-B seems to have stopped transmitting about the time its transponder went off. 
Clearer skies 
Aircraft-tracking websites use several of these newer sources of data. They will eventually replace radar when their safety and reliability are beyond dispute, a long process in the plodding world of aviation regulation. And the next generation of communications technology, due in around a decade, will relay all flight information at once, acting like a real-time version of the black box that all planes now carry. Adding internet connectivity, as many airlines are doing, will provide another way to get a message to the ground. 
Until parts of the plane are examined, how it came to grief will remain unknown. In the meantime, for the grieving relatives, there is little comfort to be taken from the fact that such mysteries should soon be a thing of the past.","The disappearance of a Malaysia Airlines passenger jet shows how air-traffic communications need to be updated

RANBAXY has brought Daiichi Sankyo nothing but trouble. The Japanese drugmaker paid $4.6 billion for Ranbaxy in 2008. Daiichi Sankyo wanted to expand into the burgeoning market of generic medicines; the Indian company was supposed to be expert at producing such copycat drugs. Instead, it produced scandals, and not the fun sort. American regulators have banned imports from four of its factories. Last year America's Justice Department fined Ranbaxy $500m for, among other things, inventing safety data for some of its medicines. 
Though Ranbaxy has been a curse for Daiichi Sankyo, Sun Pharma views it as a shining opportunity. On April 7th Sun, another Indian generic-drug maker, said it would buy Ranbaxy in a deal valuing it at $3.2 billion, 2.2 times its annual sales. The deal, said Sun's founder and boss, Dilip Shanghvi, is a ""landmark"" in his company's history. Although Sun will remain the world's fifth-largest generic-drug maker, it will no longer trail far behind the bigger four, and thus will become a strong competitor to them. 
Sun is an experienced shopper--it has snapped up 16 companies over the past 20 years--and has improved the performance of a recent target, Taro. But integrating those firms was simple compared with the task ahead. Much depends on whether Sun can yank Ranbaxy out of its regulatory mire. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which regulates medicines in America, is scrutinising Indian manufacturers ever more closely. Margaret Hamburg, its commissioner, visited India in February to drive home the point. Even Sun has run into trouble of late. In March the FDA banned imports from one of its Indian plants. 
Nevertheless, Mr Shanghvi reckons that Ranbaxy will be a boon. Sun is as well-respected a firm as Ranbaxy is toxic. With margins greater than 40%, it is popular among investors. Sun's expertise in formulating copycat drugs helped it ink a deal with Merck, a much bigger American pharmaceutical firm, to develop and sell generic medicines to emerging markets. With Ranbaxy, Sun contends that it can do much more. 
The combined company will still be half the size of the world's largest generics maker by sales, Teva of Israel. But Sun's sales will nearly double, to $4.3 billion, with more revenue coming from more corners of the world. The generics market will swell in both rich and emerging markets, as governments and patients demand more medicines at lower prices. Generics made up about one-quarter of all drug sales in 2012; by 2017 they will account for more than one-third, thinks IMS Health, a data firm. 
Sun will now be better able to profit from this growth. Before the Ranbaxy deal, Sun earned only 17% of its revenue in markets beyond India and America. Now it will have broader reach, with that share rising to 31%. 
Most important, says Sujay Shetty of PwC, a consulting firm, Sun will have new dominance in its two main markets. The deal makes Sun the biggest Indian drugmaker in America, with sales of more than $2 billion. Crucially, Sun will acquire Ranbaxy's impressive list of ""patent challenges"": in America, the first firm to challenge successfully a branded drug's patent is rewarded by having all other competitors kept out of the market for six months, enough time to make lots of money. 
The merger also makes Sun the biggest drugmaker in India, where demand continues to grow quickly. The combined company will have a 9.2% market share, nearly 50% larger than that of its closest competitor, Abbott. ""To get all of that for this price, I think it's a very good deal,"" says Mr Shetty.","Buying a troubled rival will make Sun Pharma a global contender

THE prime minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe, flew to the Australian outback's red desert on July 9th to inspect the commodity that once defined his country's relations with Australia: iron ore. He left behind policy wonks in Canberra, the capital, digesting his blunt call a day earlier for a ""truly new base"" for the relationship between the two countries. After acknowledging the second world war, in which Australia and Japan were mortal enemies, Mr Abe told Parliament that Australia and Japan must now ""join up in a scrum, just like in rugby"" to nurture regional peace. Many Australians read his remarks as recruiting Australia as an ally in Japan's disputes with China, creating a growing dilemma for some in the host country. 
Mr Abe had arrived from New Zealand, where John Key, the prime minister, opposed any attempt by Japan to resume whaling in the Antarctic Ocean following the International Court of Justice's ruling against Japan's ""scientific"" whale hunts in April. In Canberra, however, Mr Abe's sights were fixed more on the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Mr Abe's speech made no mention of China, yet it was all about that country, its growing military posturing and its challenges to neighbours' maritime claims. Mr Abe called on Australia to join Japan in keeping the Asia-Pacific region's ""vast seas"" and its skies ""open and free"". 
Mr Abe played on historical resonance in a visit that could go down as a key moment in the two countries' relations. In 1957 Mr Abe's grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, became Japan's first post-war prime minister to visit Australia, signing a commerce treaty. Yet Japan's attacks in 1942 on northern Australia and Sydney, and the brutal treatment of Australian prisoners-of-war in New Guinea, Borneo and elsewhere, overshadowed relations for decades. 
As the first Japanese prime minister to address Parliament, Kishi's grandson ""humbly"" offered his ""most sincere condolences"" to those who lost their lives. Mr Abe's reference to the ""evils and horrors of history"" was the most expansive such acknowledgment by a Japanese leader on Australian soil. The speech was intended to sound frank and open-minded--though not for the first time in the history of Japanese apologetics, it amounted neither to full-blown acceptance of Japanese war guilt nor a clear apology. 
But Tony Abbott, Australia's prime minister, was not going to let that get in the way. He approved heartily when Mr Abe pronounced that the two countries had cast off ""one old layer"" to form a new ""special relationship"". The two leaders signed a free-trade agreement, and another pact to share defence equipment and technology. Australia needs to replace ageing submarines, and Japan has world-beating engine technology. 
More closely than anyone, China is watching this cosying up between two of America's key Pacific allies, and it does not approve. That unsettles a number of Australians who worry about the growing dilemma of relying on China for prosperity and the United States for security. Ever since China displaced Japan as Australia's biggest trading partner seven years ago, debate in Australia has focused on how the country should balance its relations with China, America and Japan. Mr Abbott unsettled some last October when he (accurately) called Japan Australia's ""best friend in Asia"". He supports Japan's decision earlier this month to ditch a ban on coming to the military aid of allies if Japan itself is also under threat. Mr Abbott welcomes Japan's becoming a ""more capable strategic partner in our region"". 
Mr Abbott claims that ""ours is not a partnership against anyone"". But that is precisely where doubts remain in the wake of the Abe visit. China's bullying of neighbours over maritime claims is behind much anxiety in Asia, and a chief reason why Japan wants to bolster its own security and recruit friends. Yet Japan's poor relations with neighbours, mainly over wartime history, allows China to tout the myth that Japanese militarism is on the prowl once more. Australians care more than most when China chooses to be angry. 
In the nearly six decades since Mr Kishi's visit, Australia's relations with Japan have spun peaceably around strong trade ties and a mutual alliance with America. China's rise has complicated that. Hugh White at the Australian National University argues that Australia has never had to face a country in its region that is positioning itself as a strategic rival to both Japan and America. For Australia to assume that its interests can be comfortably yoked to Japan's, he says, would be a ""very big risk"". The problem is, to yoke Australia's interests with China's would be an even bigger one.","Closer security ties with Japan unsettle some Australians

William Hague stepped down as foreign secretary and Michael Gove (above), who was entangled recently in a row about Muslim extremists in schools, was removed as education secretary. The reshuffling of the cabinet and of the junior ministerial ranks brought in younger faces, some of them female, to break the government's image of being ""male, pale and stale"", but it also brought in more Eurosceptics.

A court in the Netherlands ruled that the Dutch state is liable for the deaths of more than 300 Bosnian Muslim men and boys who had sought shelter in the UN compound in Srebrenica in July 1995 but were turned over to Bosnian-Serb forces. The compound had been under the protection of Dutch peacekeepers. Bosnian-Serb paramilitaries went on to massacre around 7,000 Bosnian men of military age in and around Srebrenica.

Fighting in eastern Ukraine continued between the army and pro-Russian separatists. Violence escalated after a Ukrainian military transport aircraft was shot down. With more civilians being killed the conditions for agreeing another ceasefire seemed to slip out of reach. America imposed a new round of sanctions on Russian companies, causing share prices to tumble in Moscow and a fall in the rouble.

The ruin to roads 
America's House of Representatives passed a temporary patch to fund federal highway projects after months of delay had put hundreds of thousands of construction jobs at risk. But Barack Obama said that Congress was merely ""kicking the can down the road""; he has proposed a $300 billion transportation programme to repair America's crumbling infrastructure. 
Congress also prepared a bill in response to Mr Obama's request for emergency funding to tackle the influx of unaccompanied children from Central America, mostly on the Texas border.

Operation Protective Edge, an Israeli military campaign to stop Hamas, a Palestinian Islamist movement, from firing rockets from Gaza into Israel, continued into a second week, leaving more than 220 Palestinians dead. Most of the victims were civilians. One Israeli was killed by a mortar fired by Hamas, which rejected a ceasefire proposed by Egypt and accepted by Israel. 
Salim al-Juburi, a Sunni Islamist, was elected Speaker of Iraq's parliament, raising hope that the prime minister, Nuri al-Maliki, will strengthen his Shia-dominated government by including more Sunnis and Kurds in senior posts.

The World Health Organisation said that the number of Ebola cases in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone had risen by 14% in the past week, bringing the death toll since the outbreak of the disease a few months ago to more than 600. 
Troubled waters 
China began the removal of an oil rig near the Paracel islands in the South China Sea. Its deployment in May had provoked intense anti-Chinese protests in Vietnam, which claims the waters, and criticism from America that China was being ""aggressive"". The Chinese state oil firm involved said it would analyse data before deciding its next step. 
More than 40 people were killed as a car, packed with explosives and being chased by police, detonated in a crowded market in Paktika in a border area of east Afghanistan. Afghan Taliban insurgents denied responsibility, but said they were behind an attack two days later on Kabul's airport, in which four militants were killed. 
Australia became the first country in the world to repeal a measure to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions when the Senate voted to overturn the carbon tax, which Tony Abbott, the prime minister, promised to ditch when his party won an election last year. In a bad week for Australia's image, it was also heavily criticised by the UN and Amnesty for returning a boat filled with Tamil asylum-seekers to Sri Lanka. 
Thailand's military junta, which seized power in May, gave Yingluck Shinawatra, the ousted prime minister, permission to travel abroad, because she has not violated her ban from politics.

Leaders of the BRICS countries, meeting in Brazil for their sixth annual summit, announced the launch of a BRICS development bank, to be headquartered in Shanghai. A $100 billion reserve fund, to be drawn on by members during crises, was also created. 
The leaders of Russia and China took advantage of the summit to tour Latin America. Vladimir Putin sealed energy deals with Cuba, Argentina and Brazil; he also made the first visit by a Russian president to Nicaragua.

William Hague stepped down as foreign secretary and Michael Gove ( above ) , who was entangled recently in a row about Muslim extremists in schools , was removed as education secretary . The reshuffling of the cabinet and of the junior ministerial ranks brought in younger faces , some of them female , to break the government 's image of being "" male , pale and stale "" , but it also brought in more Eurosceptics .

WORKING out a way to deal with climate change by cutting carbon emissions has long tied Australia in political knots. The country relies so much on coal and other fossil fuels for its energy that it is one of the world's highest emitters per head of population. Bitter rows over carbon pricing have cost two prime ministers and an opposition leader their jobs. When he led the conservative Liberal-National coalition to power ten months ago, Tony Abbott, the prime minister today, made it his chief electoral promise to ""axe the tax"". On July 17th Mr Abbott claimed victory when parliament approved legislation to abolish the previous Labor government's tax on carbon emitters. 
Mr Abbott rose to the top of the Liberal Party as a sceptic about climate-change. It was how he toppled Malcolm Turnbull as the party's leader in late 2009, after Mr Turnbull had struck a bipartisan deal with the Labor prime minister of the time, Kevin Rudd, over a cap-and-trade scheme for carbon emitters. Mr Rudd's party, in turn, ditched him as leader when he walked away from that plan. Julia Gillard, Mr Rudd's successor as prime minister, introduced the carbon tax in 2012. 
More than conviction, it was populism that drove Mr Abbott's campaign to abolish the tax. As voters' support for action on climate change wavered, he branded the tax a ""wrecking ball across the economy"", raising the cost of business and destroying jobs. He forecast that industrial cities such as Whyalla in South Australia would be ""wiped off the map"". These predictions have not come to pass. Indeed, there were signs that the tax was starting to work, by encouraging Australians to switch to cleaner forms of energy. The Climate Institute, a research outfit committed to green policies, says the proportion of Australia's electricity sourced from brown and black coal has fallen by a tenth in the two years since the tax started, while that from renewable sources, such as wind and solar, has risen by more than a third--though from a very low base. 
The carbon tax brought the federal government revenue of more than A$7 billion ($6.5 billion) last fiscal year. In its place, Mr Abbott proposes a ""direct action"" plan. Details are sketchy, but its main feature is a public fund worth about A$2.5 billion over four years to pay big polluters to cut emissions. The plan is a nod to greens, and suits business by shifting the cost to taxpayers. But it sits oddly with the Liberal Party's free-market instincts, and there are doubts about whether it will achieve Australia's (bipartisan) commitment to cut carbon emissions by 5% from 2000 levels by 2020. Mr Abbott, meanwhile, is resisting a bid by Barack Obama to include climate change on the agenda of the G20 leaders' summit in Brisbane in November. 
Fulfilling his pledge to axe the tax has not gone entirely Mr Abbott's way. An alliance in the Senate between Labor and the Australian Greens at first blocked the bill after the lower house had approved it. A new upper house, reflecting the result of last year's election, took over on July 1st. Enter Clive Palmer, a legislator and a Queensland mining billionaire. Though he sits in the lower house, three new members of his Palmer United Party gave Mr Abbott, on the third try, the votes needed to get the abolition through the Senate. 
Some of Mr Palmer's tactics are calculated to grab political attention. At a recent press conference in Canberra, where he was flanked by Al Gore, a former American vice-president and a climate-change campaigner, Mr Palmer laid out his conditions for supporting Mr Abbott. He insisted that two public bodies Mr Abbott had wanted to chop be saved: the Climate Change Authority, which advises the government, and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, which offers loans for energy-efficient projects. Mr Palmer also wants an emissions-trading scheme to replace the tax, but with the price pegged at zero until Australia's main trading partners adopt similar schemes (some already have). 
No one is sure whether or how this will happen. And even Mr Abbott's modest direct-action plan now faces its own hurdles in the Senate.

WITH his pledge to ""stop the boats"", Tony Abbott, then the leader of Australia's opposition, made a crusade against asylum-seekers a key part of last year's victorious election campaign. Last month the prime minister claimed victory: Mr Abbott boasted that his conservative Liberal-National government had notched up six months without one ""people-smuggling venture"" landing on Australian shores. It has done so mainly by using the navy to push boats back to Indonesia, from where most asylum-seekers set out. 
Days after his declaration, Australia seized 157 Sri Lankan Tamil asylum-seekers from a boat near Christmas Island, an Australian territory in the Indian Ocean. The government has since held them on a customs vessel at sea, though it will not say where. The boat people's fate has now moved to Australia's High Court, where refugee advocates say the government is acting illegally. The case could affect the policy of turning back the boats. 
When reports of the boat's seizure first surfaced, Scott Morrison, the immigration minister, refused even to acknowledge the interception. The government calls ""Operation Sovereign Borders"" against boats a ""military-led"" affair, and has shrouded it in secrecy. It then emerged that Australia had intercepted another vessel, carrying 41 Sri Lankan asylum-seekers, both Tamil and Sinhalese. It handed these people over to a Sri Lankan naval vessel off the coast of Sri Lanka in early July. 
That prompted lawyers, backed by the Human Rights Law Centre in Melbourne, to go to the High Court. On July 7th a judge issued a temporary injunction stopping the larger group of boat people from being delivered to Sri Lanka, too. In preliminary hearings since, some details have come out. The 157 Sri Lankans had left for Christmas Island from southern India. Since their interception, they have been allowed out of their cabins on the Australian vessel for meals and three hours of daylight a day. Family members, among them three dozen children, have been split up. 
According to court documents, the cabinet's national-security committee, which Mr Abbott chairs, ruled two days after the Sri Lankans' interception on June 29th that they be taken to ""a place other than Australia"". A destination has not been spelled out. But the government has undertaken to the court that it will not send them to Sri Lanka without notice. Mr Morrison's visit to Delhi on July 22nd sparked speculation that Australia hoped to send the asylum-seekers to India instead. 
The government says the Sri Lankans were intercepted in a ""contiguous zone"" just outside Australia's territorial waters around Christmas Island. It argues this makes them ineligible to claim asylum in Australia, and that the country's Maritime Powers Act allows it to transfer them elsewhere. The boat people's lawyers contend that Australia's obligations under international and human-rights laws apply as much as Australian law on the high seas. They say this means Australia should give the boat people a fair hearing and not send them to a country such as Sri Lanka, where some may fear for their safety. 
The government has acknowledged that the 41 people from the earlier boat were given a rather compressed form of screening before being handed over to Sri Lanka. Australia has used a blunt process of shortened questioning, often without access to lawyers, since 2012--mainly with boat people from Sri Lanka. Many have been returned there as a result. The UN refugee agency has condemned the practice. On July 7th some 53 legal scholars from 17 Australian universities declared jointly that Australia's ""reported conduct under Operation Sovereign Borders clearly violates international law"". 
Some critics worry about other cosy aspects of Australia's relations with Sri Lanka. Two months after its election last year, the Abbott government gave Sri Lanka two patrol boats to help it stop asylum-seekers from leaving the country. Gillian Triggs, head of Australia's human-rights commission, speaks of a ""dangerous environment"" after Sri Lanka's bitter civil war ended in 2009 with the government's crushing victory. But Mr Abbott sounds sanguine. Sri Lanka, he says, ""is not everyone's idea of the ideal society, but it is at peace"". 
The High Court is due to hear the Tamils' challenge on August 5th. Meanwhile, about 2,300 asylum-seekers intercepted at sea in recent years are waiting to have their claims processed in two detention camps, one on the tiny island-state of Nauru and the other on Manus Island, in Papua New Guinea. David Manne, a lawyer for refugees, says that if the court ruling went against the government, it would force a profound change in how Australia treats them and other asylum-seekers at sea.","A court challenges a hardline policy towards boat people

AT THEIR nearest points, India and Indonesia are barely 160 kilometres (100 miles) apart across the Malacca Strait. Yet almost nobody thinks of these two big countries as neighbours. One reason has been India's historic isolation. Distracted by Pakistan, India long fretted over its western border. Under Nehru, its leader after independence, a principled policy of non-alignment led to moralising that was of little relevance to the rest of Asia. Under his protectionist daughter, Indira Gandhi, India looked to the Soviet Union and closed itself to foreign capital and trade, spurning the policies that made East Asia rich. As long as India's economic and military muscle atrophied at home, it wielded little influence abroad. 
There have been steps forward. Back in 1991, a reformist prime minister, Narasimha Rao, started to open the economy and laid down a policy of ""looking east"". In 2009 India signed a free-trade deal in goods with the Association of South-East Asian Nations, which has helped lift trade with those countries to a handy $80 billion a year, potentially rising to $280 billion in a decade. Two-way trade with China is up from $7 billion ten years ago to $65 billion. India now hosts regional joint maritime exercises every two years in the Indian Ocean; in February navies from 17 countries took part. And India's ties with Japan have gradually grown, as Asia's two ""middle powers"" have both watched the rise of China. 
So it would be unfair to say that Narendra Modi is starting Indian foreign policy afresh. But the country's new prime minister is making more of a noise than his predecessors. On August 30th he heads off on a five-day trip to Japan. It is the first salvo in an intense few weeks that will see visits from China's leader, Xi Jinping, and Tony Abbott, Australia's leader. Meanwhile India's foreign minister, Sushma Swaraj, visited Hanoi this week as part of a South-East Asian tour. India's president, Pranab Mukherjee, follows in September--a sign of how India's defence co-operation with South-East Asia is growing. 
A fresh broom 
Good. Tighter relations with Japan are important for security (see page 44). With Australia, India is likely to sign a deal to buy uranium. It is welcome that the world's most populous democracy should make its influence felt in its region. But India will not realise its true promise so long as it is held back by three legacies that still linger from the days of Nehru. 
First, it has differences with two of its neighbours, which are at best a distraction and at worst an obstacle. Given how much it has to gain from peace with Pakistan, India should strive to launch talks that were recently put off because it objected to contacts between Pakistani diplomats and Kashmiri separatists. For Mr Modi, a Hindu nationalist who is feared by many Indian Muslims, a settlement with Pakistan should be a special priority. But Mr Modi also has a disputed border with China in the Himalayas. That too is a flashpoint for conflict, which he needs to discuss with Mr Xi--if only because India's relations with China will count for more commercially and strategically than its relations with any other Asian country. 
Second, to promote India as a trading nation, Mr Modi should ditch protectionism. He blundered in July when he rescinded India's agreement to a World Trade Organisation deal to ease trade, opting instead to protect food and farm subsidies at home. Since India plays no part in many other regional trade forums, such as the Trans Pacific Partnership, it risks falling behind others who will set higher standards. 
Last of all, he needs a government service that can support his diplomacy. India's foreign service is roughly the size of New Zealand's. The country's defence-procurement system is rotten and dependent on second-rate state-owned firms. Newly eased restrictions on foreigners investing in defence could help. And India's armed forces need skilled employees, modern equipment, more outside scrutiny and better co-operation between commands. For India to become influential abroad, Mr Modi has to do some tightening up at home.","Asia will gain from India finally taking foreign policy seriously

Since India plays no part in many other regional trade forums, such as the Trans Pacific Partnership, it risks falling behind others who will set higher standards. 
Last of all, he needs a government service that can support his diplomacy. India's foreign service is roughly the size of New Zealand's. The country's defence-procurement system is rotten and dependent on second-rate state-owned firms. Newly eased restrictions on foreigners investing in defence could help. And India's armed forces need skilled employees, modern equipment, more outside scrutiny and better co-operation between commands. For India to become influential abroad, Mr Modi has to do some tightening up at home.",900,Australia,cb-900-2,,False,,0,True

INDIA'S restless prime minister, Narendra Modi, likes to brag that he sleeps for only three or four hours a night and replenishes his energy with yoga. He will need all the vigour he can muster in the coming month, during a punishing diplomatic tour to the rest of Asia. By the end, if he keeps up the pace, Mr Modi may have clarified what sort of policy he intends for India in a region where it punches below its weight. 
The marathon begins in Japan on August 30th, where India's leader travels with a delegation of billionaires and industrialists for a five-day trip. Mr Modi is close to Japan's prime minister, Shinzo Abe, a fellow nationalist with whom he shares suspicions of China. He gratefully visited Mr Abe in 2007 and 2012 as chief minister for Gujarat, even as Western politicians shunned him after Hindu-Muslim riots in his state in 2002. Gleeful Indian pundits note that social media give a clue to their friendship. Mr Abe follows only three people on Twitter; one of them is his eager fellow tweeter, Mr Modi. 
The Indian prime minister had been due to visit Japan in July, soon after taking office in late May, as a reciprocal gesture following Mr Abe's visit to India in January and a rare visit by Emperor Akihito late in 2013. It was put off, say diplomats, so that they could work out some eye-catching deals to announce as a sign of their friendship. Japan, formerly a big donor to China, now counts India as its largest aid recipient and will probably pledge some funds for Indian cities. It will also urge its car and electronics firms to invest more in India, a fillip to Mr Modi's plans to boost manufacturing at home. 
In return, Japan wants Mr Modi to say, or hint, that Japanese firms and technology will build India's first high-speed rail line, stealing a march on cheaper Chinese rivals. Two security-related matters probably count for more. India wants a deal, similar to one it struck with America six years ago, that would allow co-operation between the two countries in the civilian nuclear realm. But obstacles remain: India is not a signatory to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, so it will be difficult for Mr Abe to persuade Japanese lawmakers to agree to a civil-nuclear pact. And Japan's nuclear firms look no readier than American ones to risk India's burgeoning nuclear-power industry until tough Indian liability laws, in case of an accident, are rewritten. 
Another possible deal, which would be highly significant if it comes off, is the sale of 15 Japanese amphibious US-2 aircraft to India for its navy to use for long-range surveillance, rescue and support. Mr Modi wants joint production of the US-2 in India by local, private and Japanese firms. That would boost manufacturing and serve as a high-profile boost to the defence industry after India said, in July, that foreigners would be allowed to own up to 49% of local ventures. A Japanese official, however, warns that unless India rules out sales to third parties of dual-use civilian-military products, the deal could fail. 
Still, the timing for stronger ties between India and Japan is auspicious. Mr Abe looks eager to bind India into broader security co-operation between Asian ""middling powers"" that are anxious about the military rise of China but doubt that America can be trusted to guarantee their security. Like the Japanese leader, ""Mr Modi's outlook in Asia is more expansive"", argues Bharat Karnad, a hawkish analyst at the Centre for Policy Research, a think-tank in Delhi. With two assertive men in office, he expects fewer worries than under previous regimes about provoking China's ire. 
Australia's prime minister, Tony Abbott, fits a similar nationalist mould. Shortly after Mr Modi returns from Japan he is due in Delhi, also to talk nuclear. A deal is ready to be signed, allowing Australian uranium exports to India, seven years after John Howard, a predecessor, first tried to lift a ban. That matters for security, as imported uranium can be used for power generation, leaving India's smaller domestic stocks for military use. 
Relations with Australia have also grown warmer of late. The first joint naval exercises are due to be staged next year. Rory Medcalf of the Lowy Institute, a think-tank in Sydney, calls new ties between Australia, India and others in the region a ""ballet of hedging and balancing"" against China. Mr Modi is due to visit Australia in November. 
In that context the visit of China's Xi Jinping to India, in mid-September, could prove uncomfortable, even if it is likely to focus on Chinese investment and trade ties. Before Mr Modi came to office, some observers speculated that he could try to strike an early deal with China to settle the countries' long-disputed border in the Himalayas. In fact, rather than accommodating, Mr Modi looks cautiously assertive. In May he welcomed the elected leader of Tibetans in exile, Lobsang Sangay, to his inauguration--though the spiritual Tibetan leader, the Dalai Lama, was not invited. 
Another potential annoyance for China this week was Mr Modi's dispatch of his foreign minister, Sushma Swaraj, on a tour of Myanmar, Singapore and Vietnam. India's president, Pranab Mukherjee, will next go to Vietnam, more or less at the same time as Mr Xi is in India. Partly with China in mind, India is strengthening its security ties with South-East Asia. It recently sent warships to visit the Philippines. This month the Indian navy conducted joint exercises in Vietnam off Haiphong in the far north, close to China. Its co-operation with Vietnam has also included training submariners, repairing military aircraft and selling patrol boats. India's state-run oil company, ONGC, this month saw its rights renewed for two oil blocks off Vietnam's coast in an area of the South China Sea that is contested with China. India has long spoken of developing a ""Look East"" policy, but has lagged behind China in forging ties with emerging economies in South-East Asia. In Vietnam though, which is deeply sceptical of China's ambitions, Mr Modi finds an open door. A Vietnamese diplomat said recently that Vietnam saw India as an ""all-weather friend"", a reference to how China describes its close links to Pakistan. Mr Modi might like such language, but he will be careful not to push too far: he does not want to infuriate China. There is little public appetite in India for conflict between the Asian giants. 
Next month Mr Modi will travel to the United States for the UN General Assembly and a meeting with President Barack Obama in Washington to repair ties that turned frosty under his predecessor, Manmohan Singh. One area of co-operation the two leaders might discuss is joint naval exercises in the Indian Ocean. After so many state visits, Mr Modi's head is likely to be left in a yoga-like spin.","India's government is embarking on a whirlwind month of Asian diplomacy

IT WAS a sombre Stephen Harper who addressed Canadians on October 22nd. A lone gunman had fatally shot a young soldier standing guard at the National War Memorial in the capital, Ottawa, and then entered Canada's parliament building where he was killed. The prime minister linked the shooting to the murder earlier in the week of another Canadian soldier. Both, he said, were a grim reminder that Canada is not immune to the type of terrorist attacks seen around the world. 
His government would redouble its efforts to work with its allies in fighting terrorist organisations abroad, the Conservative prime minister vowed. It would also ""take all the necessary steps"" to identify and counter threats at home. 
In fact, this was not the first time Canada's parliament had been a target, nor was it the biggest terrorist attack in the country's history. An inept bomber intent on killing as many MPs as possible blew himself up in the same building in 1966, and an armed man hijacked a bus and fired shots outside parliament in 1989. The 1985 bombing of an Air India flight to London from Toronto, in which 329 people died, remains the largest terror attack originating in Canada. 
But two things gave this week's strike added impact. It badly frightened MPs, most of whom had gathered for weekly caucus meetings in rooms on either side of the corridor where the gunman exchanged fire with security officers. They used furniture to construct makeshift barricades and had to remain shut away for hours. Second, it took place amid a heated debate over the Conservative government's decision to increase anti-terrorist powers at home and to join the military campaign led by the United States against Islamic State in Iraq. 
Mr Harper chose to interpret the shooting as part of a broader bid by terrorist groups to bring ""their savagery to our shores"". Missives from his office after the attack underlined this message. He had telephone conversations with President Barack Obama, and with Binyamin Netanyahu and Tony Abbott, the prime ministers of Israel and Australia. John Baird, the foreign minister, took up the theme of global solidarity against terror: he said in a tweet that he had told John Kerry, America's secretary of state, ""This is why we're with you. This only makes our resolve stronger."" 
It was unclear as The Economist went to press whether the gunman, a Canadian named Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, had links to any terrorist group, but he was described by a person who met him at a mosque in British Columbia as having a ""disturbing"" side, suggesting mental-health problems. Nor was there any sign of a link to Martin Couture-Rouleau, shot dead by police on October 20th after he struck two soldiers with his car, killing one, near a military academy in Quebec. Mr Couture-Rouleau was under sporadic surveillance and his passport had been seized because he was one of an estimated 130 Canadians whom the security services suspected of terrorist leanings. Mr Zehaf-Bibeau had also been barred from travelling. 
The two main opposition leaders, Thomas Mulcair of the New Democrats and Justin Trudeau of the Liberals, avoided making any political hay out of the incident, and neither posited any theory about a terrorist plot. ""We woke up this morning in a country blessed by love, diversity and peace, and tomorrow we will do the same,"" said Mr Mulcair, leader of the official opposition. Mr Trudeau referred to the gunman as a criminal and said that Canada was a nation of fairness, justice and the rule of law, and should not be intimidated into changing that. 
Yet intimidation seemed contagious. Legislatures across the country boosted security, as did some large cities like Toronto. An ice-hockey game scheduled for October 22nd in Ottawa between two National Hockey League teams was cancelled. In the province of Quebec, soldiers were warned they could be targets and should avoid wearing their uniforms when off duty. 
Such an atmosphere will make it easier for the government to pass counterterrorism legislation which would give the Canadian Security Intelligence Service a freer hand to pursue investigations and work with foreign counterparts. Yet that will not deal with one immediate problem revealed by the gunman--security in the parliamentary precinct. In the days ahead, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the national force responsible for guarding Parliament Hill, will have to explain how it was possible for an armed man to walk across the lawn in broad daylight and gain access unhindered into Canada's seat of government. It should surely be possible to prevent that without a draconian regime.","Attacks on soldiers in a mainly tranquil land stir talk of global action against terror

A HEATWAVE hovered over Brisbane, the state capital of Queensland, as world leaders gathered on November 15th for a Group of 20 (G20) summit, the biggest such meeting Australia has hosted. Tony Abbott, the prime minister, had hoped to limit their talks to topics that chimed with his domestic political agenda: growth and jobs. Barack Obama, America's president, had other ideas. On his way to the talks, Mr Obama delivered a speech to cheering students at the University of Queensland, calling on Australia to do more to tackle climate change. To rub his message in, Mr Obama worried about the ""incredible natural glory of the Great Barrier Reef"", off the coast of Queensland, which is threatened by global warming. 
The president's speech was carefully calculated. Three days earlier, Mr Obama had struck a deal with Xi Jinping, China's president, at another summit in Beijing, in which the world's two biggest emitters of carbon set targets to lower their outputs of greenhouse gases. The deal apparently caught Mr Abbott by surprise. He had wanted to limit the G20's climate commitments to a line about energy efficiency. But climate change dominated the Brisbane summit in the wake of Mr Obama's proclamation that ""here in the Asia Pacific, nobody has more at stake"". Few can recall such a sharp public rebuke from Australia's main strategic ally. 
Australia is responsible for about 1.5% of global carbon emissions; measured by its output per person, it is one of the highest polluters. Yet Mr Abbott has staked his political career on a combative approach to climate action. As opposition leader four years ago, he unseated his predecessor as leader of the conservative Liberal Party over a deal with the then Labor government for an emissions-trading scheme; that deal sank. Mr Abbott won power last year after waging a scare campaign against a carbon tax Labor had introduced instead; his government has since abolished it. Mr Abbott argued in Brisbane that climate talks should happen elsewhere, not at meetings of the G20. 
But the summit's climate pledges left Australia isolated. Mr Obama pointedly used his speech in Brisbane to announce a $3 billion contribution to the Green Climate Fund, a UN body to help poor countries deal with climate change. Japan, Germany and Canada also promised money. 
Mr Abbott felt in warmer company after Mr Xi and Narendra Modi, India's prime minister, left Brisbane to address Australia's parliament separately in Canberra. As Mr Xi spoke, Australia concluded a free-trade agreement with China. It includes tariff cuts on Australian shipments of coal, demand for which in China has grown rapidly in recent years. India is also a big market. Defiantly, Mr Abbott told the G20 leaders he would be ""standing up for coal"".

THE siege on December 15th in the Lindt Chocolate Cafe in Martin Place, in the heart of Sydney's business district, was the first terrorist act in Australia based on a political message about Islam. The morning had started with regulars queuing for coffee on their way to work. Shortly before 10am the doors were locked from the inside. For the next 16 hours, a gunman held 17 staff and customers hostage, forcing them to display a black flag with an Islamic creed against the window. Some but not all managed to slip out. In the early hours of the following morning, police stormed the cafe, apparently responding to shots inside. In a heavy exchange of gunfire, the gunman and two hostages died. 
For some time Australian authorities have warned of a possible terrorist event. Islam has been a fast-growing religion. The number of Muslims in the country grew by two-thirds in the decade to 2011. Muslims now account for just over 2% of the country's population of 23m, many of them in the outer suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne. In a recent speech to journalists David Irvine, a former head of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), the country's domestic spy agency, insisted that violent extremists comprise a tiny minority--""a few hundred aberrant souls"". ASIO and police, he claimed, have thwarted plans for ""a number of mass-casualty attacks on our soil"". But his ""recurring nightmare"" had always been an attack by a ""lone wolf"": someone who had failed to come ""across our radar"". 
As it happened, the gunman in the Sydney siege was well-known to the authorities--who nevertheless underestimated his danger to society. Man Haron Monis, aged 50, was born in Iran and moved to Australia after receiving political asylum more than a decade ago. Via a website, Mr Monis had recently announced his conversion from Shia to Sunni Islam. Greg Barton, a terrorism expert at Monash University in Melbourne, believes Mr Monis was attracted by the way Islamic State (IS), the jihadist group in Iraq and Syria, encourages lone-wolf attacks against Westerners. But he doubts that IS would have recruited such a lost, disturbed individual. 
Mr Monis was facing charges of sexual and indecent assault, and of being an accessory to the murder of his former wife last year, for which he was out on bail. He had also been convicted of sending offensive letters to the families of Australian soldiers who had died in Afghanistan; a few days before the siege Australia's High Court had refused his bid to appeal against the conviction. For many Australians absorbing the shock of the siege, questions may centre less on Mr Monis's jihadism and more on how he was out on bail for his various charges, as well as how he had access to weapons. 
The prime minister, Tony Abbott, says it will take time to find out exactly what happened at Martin Place, and why. Political debate is certain to be stirred about tough anti-terror laws that the conservative coalition government has passed, as well as about its hard approach towards asylum-seekers making for Australia by boat. The anti-terror laws expand ASIO's powers, including its ability to demand access to computers, while journalists disclosing intelligence operations face up to ten years in prison. Constitutional and human-rights lawyers are uneasy over the laws. Others will question the impact of the siege on disaffected young Muslims, some of whom may see themselves as targets of the tougher security laws. But with Mr Monis's refugee background, the Sydney siege is also likely to entrench some Australians in their views that asylum policy is bound up with security. 
ASIO has identified about 60 Australians fighting with IS and Jabhat-al-Nusra, another extremist group, in Iraq and Syria; another 100 people in Australia are said to be supporting them and recruiting new fighters. Whether by a lone wolf or not, another attack in broad daylight is now a new worry for Sydneysiders.

For some time Australian authorities have warned of a possible terrorist event. Islam has been a fast-growing religion. The number of Muslims in the country grew by two-thirds in the decade to 2011. Muslims now account for just over 2% of the country's population of 23m, many of them in the outer suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne. In a recent speech to journalists David Irvine, a former head of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), the country's domestic spy agency, insisted that violent extremists comprise a tiny minority--""a few hundred aberrant souls"". ASIO and police, he claimed, have thwarted plans for ""a number of mass-casualty attacks on our soil"". But his ""recurring nightmare"" had always been an attack by a ""lone wolf"": someone who had failed to come ""across our radar"". 
As it happened, the gunman in the Sydney siege was well-known to the authorities--who nevertheless underestimated his danger to society. Man Haron Monis, aged 50, was born in Iran and moved to Australia after receiving political asylum more than a decade ago. Via a website, Mr Monis had recently announced his conversion from Shia to Sunni Islam. Greg Barton, a terrorism expert at Monash University in Melbourne, believes Mr Monis was attracted by the way Islamic State (IS), the jihadist group in Iraq and Syria, encourages lone-wolf attacks against Westerners. But he doubts that IS would have recruited such a lost, disturbed individual. 
Mr Monis was facing charges of sexual and indecent assault, and of being an accessory to the murder of his former wife last year, for which he was out on bail. He had also been convicted of sending offensive letters to the families of Australian soldiers who had died in Afghanistan; a few days before the siege Australia's High Court had refused his bid to appeal against the conviction. For many Australians absorbing the shock of the siege, questions may centre less on Mr Monis's jihadism and more on how he was out on bail for his various charges, as well as how he had access to weapons. 
The prime minister, Tony Abbott, says it will take time to find out exactly what happened at Martin Place, and why. Political debate is certain to be stirred about tough anti-terror laws that the conservative coalition government has passed, as well as about its hard approach towards asylum-seekers making for Australia by boat. The anti-terror laws expand ASIO's powers, including its ability to demand access to computers, while journalists disclosing intelligence operations face up to ten years in prison. Constitutional and human-rights lawyers are uneasy over the laws. Others will question the impact of the siege on disaffected young Muslims, some of whom may see themselves as targets of the tougher security laws. But with Mr Monis's refugee background, the Sydney siege is also likely to entrench some Australians in their views that asylum policy is bound up with security. 
ASIO has identified about 60 Australians fighting with IS and Jabhat-al-Nusra, another extremist group, in Iraq and Syria; another 100 people in Australia are said to be supporting them and recruiting new fighters. Whether by a lone wolf or not, another attack in broad daylight is now a new worry for Sydneysiders.

FOR years, Doug, who lives in Binghamton, New York, suffered from bipolar disorder. In 2003 he enrolled in the federal disability insurance (DI) programme. With his illness now properly treated, he has been looking for work since 2013, without much luck. Because he worked full-time in a shop a decade ago, he would lose his disability benefits if he returned to full-time work now. He worries that he couldn't handle it, and would end up without a job or benefits. So he is hunting for part-time work that won't overtax him, and will let him keep his benefits. 
His dilemma is about to get even trickier. DI, on which he depends, is fast running out of money. In the past quarter-century the share of working-age Americans on disability has doubled, to 5% (see chart). Some 11m Americans--9m workers plus their dependants--now receive benefits, nearly as many as work in manufacturing. The result is that DI now pays out far more in benefits than it receives in payroll tax. Its trust fund will run dry by the end of 2016. 
When danger-point has been reached in previous years, money has been shifted to DI from payroll tax or the Social Security trust fund (which is meant to cover public pensions); but a rule passed this month by the House of Representatives says this cannot be done any more without reform. Republicans say this will force Congress to grapple with the problem. Maybe. 
The programme owes its dire state, in part, to the same demographic forces undermining Social Security and Medicare. Baby-boomers who haven't yet retired are now at the age when they are most likely to become disabled. Their numbers have been swollen by the entry of more women to the workforce. And a gradually rising retirement age means beneficiaries collect disability payments longer before they switch to a pension. 
But demography explains only a bit more than half the rise in the rolls since 1980, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The rest is because workers of any age or sex are now much more likely to qualify. Americans are no sicker than before. As David Autor of MIT and Mark Duggan of Stanford note, the number of 40- to 59-year-olds reporting any kind of disability has remained stable at about 10%. The health of older workers has improved. 
However, in 1984 the eligibility criteria were changed. It is now easier to qualify with hard-to-verify ailments, such as stress and back pain. Meanwhile, wage stagnation among the low-skilled makes disability benefits--which come with automatic annual increases and health insurance--more appealing, especially during recessions. One study found that ten years after starting on disability benefits, less than 4% of recipients had returned to work. 
Some people are ripping off the programme. Last year New York City prosecutors charged 134 people for defrauding DI of about $30m. Applicants, many of them former police officers or firemen, were coached in how to fake psychiatric illnesses such as depression or anxiety. Many were plainly not disabled; one flew a helicopter, another rode a jet-ski and one taught martial arts. But fraud is only a small part of the problem. DI's whole design is antiquated. It presumes that people, once disabled, cannot work. If they do, they usually lose their benefits. Yet lots of people with disabilities can work: wheelchairs did not stop FDR from becoming president or Greg Abbott (pictured) from becoming governor of Texas. 
Since 1999 the federal government has encouraged experiments to get beneficiaries back to work. Recipients can generally work full-time for up to a year, or part-time indefinitely, without losing their benefits. Randy Cook, who administers one such effort for a state-county agency in Binghamton, says many don't know that, so they are reluctant even to try. 
Matthew, a builder in New York, went on disability after a car accident left him seriously injured. It was six years before he felt able to work again, but his first efforts to do so were half-hearted. ""You get out of the [habit] when you're sitting at home, and the most you have to look forward to is 'The Price is Right' coming on at 11 in the morning,"" he says. ""Even though you didn't make a lot of money it was easy to sit there, on the couch, collect a cheque, go to doctor's appointments. I might read the classifieds and see something that interested me, and never act on it. But I was fed up with it."" Eventually Matthew met Mr Cook, who told him how to work without losing benefits, and to use acquaintances to look for jobs. In 2011 he found full-time work as an electrician. 
Doug, who is also a client of Mr Cook's, has been less lucky. He applies almost every day for jobs online, but has had few interviews and, so far, no offers. ""One of my major fears at this point is that because I've been out of work for so long that I'm unemployable. Where I live, there are a lot of job seekers and not a lot of jobs to go around."" 
Fixing DI will not be easy. Pilot projects which allow people to keep more of their benefits have increased the number working, but not by enough to save much money, reckons Dave Stapleton of Mathematica, a consultancy. A more promising approach is to staunch the flow of people entering the programme by toughening eligibility criteria. Several European countries have tried this. The Netherlands in 1994 and 2002 required employers to pay disability benefits for up to two years, a spur to rehabilitating the employee as soon as possible. To receive long-term state benefits thereafter, beneficiaries must document their efforts to return to work. Sweden has restricted eligibility to those who can't do any job. In America, Mr Autor and Mr Duggan suggest expanding private disability cover, thus giving employers an incentive to keep workers working and speeding the return of the disabled. 
Such reforms, though, would take years to show results. In all likelihood, a long-lasting fix to DI may require fixing Social Security as well, by restricting benefits for higher-paid workers, indexing annual benefit increases less generously, or raising the payroll tax. All are political poison. So although there will be much talk of fixing disability in the year to come, little is likely to get done.","Many disabled people can work.

ADMIRE Barack Obama's endurance on January 26th, when he becomes the first American president to be guest of honour at India's annual Republic Day parade in Delhi. For two long hours he will inhale the capital's smog as he and India's prime minister, Narendra Modi, review a procession of military hardware, trick-motorcycle riders and troupes of dancers. A chilly winter morning on Rajpath, New Delhi's main ceremonial boulevard, can be an eternity. 
Mr Obama is coming to India on a three-day trip to improve an already strong bond with the country's barrel-chested leader. He will become the only sitting American president to visit India twice, and he arrives barely four months after Mr Modi went to Washington. The two men also got together on the sidelines of an Asian summit in Myanmar in November. 
So frequent are their encounters that underlings hardly have time to prepare substantial matters to discuss. (Speculation this time centres on a possible deal to lessen the potential liability American firms face if they invest in the nuclear-power industry--Indian law holds contractors liable for all costs.) Yet mere symbolism can be useful. Indeed, it may help banish memories of an awkward clash between the two countries last year, after police in New York clumsily arrested an Indian diplomat over the immigration status of her Indian maid. 
That incident aside, bilateral relations have steadily improved over the past 15 years, often against the opposition from older Indian diplomats who cling to a belief in non-alignment--isolationism mixed with leftist moralising. Younger ones, however, grasp what there is to gain by engaging with a country with so much capital, technology and trade potential to offer. Most Indians view America positively. 
Mr Modi's recent predecessors forged closer American relations. But they were wary both of China and of their own stuffy bureaucrats, and were shy of making a tilt to the West too explicit. The difference now, according to Tanvi Madan of the Brookings Institution, a think-tank in Washington, is that under Mr Modi India is at last taking America ""home to meet Mum"". Ms Madan emphasises the importance of the Indian diaspora in America (over 3m Indian-Americans, many of them rich, educated and influential in government, politics and business) and of tapping America to strengthen India's economy and military capacity. 
Today India and America co-operate on intelligence (especially since terrorist attacks in Mumbai in 2008 killed 166, among them six Americans). The two share a certain mistrust of Pakistan, formerly a close American ally, and are alarmed at Islamist extremism there. Where India, the world's biggest arms importer, once turned to Russia as its traditional supplier of defence equipment, it now increasingly favours higher-tech gear offered by America, Israel and others. In November Russia sent its defence minister to Islamabad, Pakistan's capital, for the first time in over two decades, signalling that it might begin arms sales to Pakistan. So expect further Indian diversification. Mr Modi's hope is to have some American defence equipment made in India. But given that India caps foreign ownership of local defence firms at 49%, it is unclear how realistic that hope is. 
Beyond defence, the two leaders share the idea of promoting India as capable, one day, of taking on bigger foreign roles. Rudra Chaudhuri, author of a recent book on how the two countries get on, sees ""a serious shift"" under Mr Modi in terms of a more active role for India abroad, beginning in its region. Indian strength would inevitably rest, first, on its economy expanding faster. That notion was boosted this week by the IMF, which forecast that India's pace of growth will outstrip China's in 2016 (China remains much the larger economy). 
Mr Chaudhuri points also to Mr Modi's personal rapport with other Asian leaders, notably Shinzo Abe and Tony Abbott, respectively prime ministers of Japan and Australia. Both countries are close allies of America. Mr Abe was last year's guest at the Republic Day parade. Now Mr Modi shows a keen desire to raise India's profile further, at a time when America is pushing for more co-operation among Asian democracies, partly in response to a more assertive China. Myanmar aside, Mr Modi has travelled abroad only to visit democratic countries since he became prime minister last year, and talks up democracy. 
Instructive, too, is that relations are likely to flourish with Sri Lanka, ending years of strain, after voters there replaced an authoritarian government--with Indian spies lending a hand, according to reports. Even if that detail turns out not to be true, Indian diplomacy looks more active than for a long time. Not a bad moment for Mr Obama to drop in for a parade.

Islamic State militants broadcast their beheading of a Japanese journalist and murder of a Jordanian fighter pilot, whom they burnt alive in a cage. Jordanians, hitherto ambivalent about the bombing of Sunni jihadists, turned against the movement strongly, welcoming King Abdullah's continued participation in the American-led coalition as well as his execution of two jailed militants in revenge.

Meanwhile, Egypt's courts jailed 230 people for anti-government activity, including a liberal activist, Ahmed Douma, who was sentenced to life in prison. 
Houthi rebels who have overrun the capital of Yemen, Sana'a, refused to release the country's president, Abd Rabbo Mansour Hadi, and his cabinet from house arrest until a deal is reached on integrating the rebels into the regular army. They said that without a deal, ""a revolutionary leadership"" under their command would take full control. 
Forces from Chad and Cameroon backed by French planes fought their most serious battle since entering north-eastern Nigeria to suppress Boko Haram, a jihadist group. They claimed to have killed 250 militants and ""wiped out"" their bases near the border with Cameroon. But the fighting spilled into Cameroon, with Boko Haram reportedly killing at least 70 people in the town of Fotokol.

Mexico's president, Enrique Pena Nieto, ordered an investigation into conflict-of-interest allegations against him, his wife and the finance minister, Luis Videgaray. Mr Pena also backed a constitutional reform to create a set of interlocking institutions to fight corruption. 
Pope Francis declared that Oscar Romero, an archbishop from El Salvador who was shot dead while celebrating mass in 1980, was a martyr. This opens the way to his beatification. Earlier popes had regarded the archbishop, who was an exponent of ""liberation theology"", as a Marxist. 
Budget gambit 
Barack Obama presented a $4 trillion budget that he said is intended ""to replace mindless austerity with smart investments"". It includes plans to increase capital-gains tax for top earners from 23.8% to 28%, various levies on business and expanded tax credits for the less well-off. The Republicans who control Congress will not pass it. 
Just a few weeks after confounding the pundits by declaring that he was seriously interested in running for president again, Mitt Romney announced that, upon reflection and a great deal of data-crunching, he was not going to enter the race after all. 
Harper Lee said she was ""humbled and amazed"" that her second novel would be published, 55 years after ""To Kill a Mockingbird"". The new book, ""Go Set a Watchman"", acts as a sequel, featuring Scout Finch as an adult woman. Ms Lee had written it prior to penning her seminal work, but the manuscript was lost for decades. She says the work is ""a pretty decent effort"".","The new prime minister of Greece, Alexis Tsipras, and his finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis (above left), toured Europe in search of debt relief and support against austerity. Mr Varoufakis floated a plan to replace Greek debt with bonds linked to GDP growth. For the most part, they met a dusty response; the European Central Bank stopped taking Greek government bonds as collateral. Markets were volatile but seemed hopeful that a deal would eventually be done. 
America and Europe prepared a new peace initiative to present to the Russians to end the war in eastern Ukraine, amid heavy fighting and more military and civilian deaths. Earlier, the pro-Russian rebel leader said he would expand his force to 100,000 men. More Russian equipment and, according to NATO, troops poured across the border. 
The International Court of Justice in The Hague rejected claims by both Croatia and Serbia that the other was guilty of genocide during their wars of 1991-95, when some 20,000 people were killed. 
Italy's parliament picked a new president, Sergio Mattarella, a former judge. He was the candidate of Matteo Renzi, the prime minister. By securing his choice quickly, Mr Renzi improved his chances of pushing through his reforms. 
Tightening the net 
China stepped up controls over the internet. It is now requiring users of blogs and chat rooms to register their real names with internet providers and they must promise to avoid attacking the political system. Censors have also been trying to restrict access to ""virtual private networks"", which are often used to circumvent the blocking of politically sensitive websites. 
Myanmar accused a senior UN official of interfering in its affairs after she had raised concerns about discrimination against members of the Muslim Rohingya minority. The Rohingya are stateless and have been the target of attacks by members of Myanmar's Buddhist majority. 
The coalition government in Australia suffered a resounding defeat in state elections in Queensland. The foreign minister, Julie Bishop, denied that she is planning to oust the prime minister, Tony Abbott, whose popularity has slumped, by mounting a challenge for the leadership of the Liberal Party. 
Barbaric State 
Islamic State militants broadcast their beheading of a Japanese journalist and murder of a Jordanian fighter pilot, whom they burnt alive in a cage. Jordanians, hitherto ambivalent about the bombing of Sunni jihadists, turned against the movement strongly, welcoming King Abdullah's continued participation in the American-led coalition as well as his execution of two jailed militants in revenge. 
Egypt's president deported an Australian journalist who had reported for Al Jazeera, ending his incarceration of 400 days for broadcasting ""false"" news. Meanwhile, Egypt's courts jailed 230 people for anti-government activity, including a liberal activist, Ahmed Douma, who was sentenced to life in prison. 
Houthi rebels who have overrun the capital of Yemen, Sana'a, refused to release the country's president, Abd Rabbo Mansour Hadi, and his cabinet from house arrest until a deal is reached on integrating the rebels into the regular army. They said that without a deal, ""a revolutionary leadership"" under their command would take full control. 
Forces from Chad and Cameroon backed by French planes fought their most serious battle since entering north-eastern Nigeria to suppress Boko Haram, a jihadist group. They claimed to have killed 250 militants and ""wiped out"" their bases near the border with Cameroon. But the fighting spilled into Cameroon, with Boko Haram reportedly killing at least 70 people in the town of Fotokol. 
Petro dollars 
Maria das Gracas Foster, the chief executive of Petrobras, Brazil's state-controlled oil company, resigned amid a corruption scandal centred on claims that Petrobras solicited billions of dollars in payments from construction companies, some of which were funnelled to political parties. These include the Workers' Party, which is led by Dilma Rousseff, Brazil's president. The lower house of Brazil's Congress has elected as its Speaker Eduardo Cunha, who has often clashed with Ms Rousseff.

TONY ABBOTT, Australia's prime minister, reportedly called it a ""near-death"" experience. On February 9th MPs of his Liberal Party voted against a motion to open the party's leadership to a ballot. But the margin, 61 votes to 39, was hardly a ringing endorsement of Mr Abbott's leadership, just 17 months after he became prime minister. His struggle to keep his job is far from over. 
Since he led the conservative Liberal-National coalition to power in September 2013, Mr Abbott has spent much of his term fighting to win voters' confidence. But a Newspoll survey--published as his Liberal colleagues in Canberra, the capital, cast their votes on his future--showed just how much he has failed. It gave the opposition Labor Party a 14-point lead, and gave its leader, Bill Shorten, an 18-point lead over Mr Abbott. More than two-thirds of those surveyed were dissatisfied with Mr Abbott's performance. 
Mr Abbott was not hugely popular to begin with. Voters backed him at least partly out of despair with the former Labor government and its debilitating leadership wars. The public mood soured after his government announced its first budget last May. Its aim to reduce Australia's deficit was worthy enough. But it contained cuts in spending on health, education and welfare that Mr Abbott had once promised not to make, and which seemed to fall most heavily on poorer Australians. Mr Abbott and Joe Hockey, Australia's treasurer, did a bad job of selling the budget to voters, appearing dismissive of their concerns. 
The prime minister had promised a fresh start to 2015 by ""scraping one or two barnacles off the ship"". Instead he got into a scrape of his own on January 26th when he awarded a knighthood to Prince Philip, the husband of Australia's (British) head of state, Queen Elizabeth. An ardent monarchist, Mr Abbott reintroduced knighthoods and dames to Australia's honours system last year, 40 years after they were abolished. The ""knightmare"" brought ridicule on Mr Abbott, and further stoked concerns that he was out of touch with modern Australia. Its impact was felt in Queensland, where a government allied to Mr Abbott's coalition could lose power after a state election on January 31st, the results of which were expected to be declared soon after The Economist went to press. 
Grumbling about Mr Abbott's leadership has recently extended to his own backbench MPs. He angered colleagues by declaring that it was for the public to ""hire and fire"" leaders. Some felt Mr Abbott was casting himself in a presidential role, ignoring the conventions of Australia's Westminster system, in which parties elect their own leaders. 
The drama has reflected a growing pattern among Australian politicians from both sides to move against leaders when poor polling seems to threaten electoral oblivion. Leadership upheavals have only fed the cynicism of many Australians towards their politicians. It has also left business leaders dismayed. They fret about the turbulent political scene's impact on business confidence and certainty. Ian Marsh of the Australian National University argues that the country's governments have faced a ""slow-burn crisis of legitimacy that has been many years in the making"". 
Personality politics are only part of the problem. In a country where voting is compulsory, says Mr Marsh, about 40% of people now vote for minor parties and independents, spoil their ballots or do not vote. Liberal and Labor, which once shared most of the vote between them, now offer outdated ideologies to an increasingly diverse Australia. 
Mr Abbott declared the leadership motion a ""very chastening experience"". Critics now wonder if he will manage to soften his combative approach.

WESTERN leaders have long urged Muslims to do more to counter jihadist ideology. This month Barack Obama said moderate Muslims, including scholars and clerics, had a responsibility to reject ""twisted interpretations of Islam"" and the lie ""that America and the West are somehow at war with Islam"". On February 23rd Tony Abbott, Australia's prime minister, urged Muslim leaders to say that Islam is a religion of peace--""and mean it"". 
Muslims have not taken kindly to such hectoring. Yet they are starting to debate the role that Islamist ideology plays in extremism. On February 22nd Ahmed al-Tayeb, the grand imam of Egypt's al-Azhar mosque, part of a university that is the Sunni world's oldest seat of learning, declared that extremism was caused by ""bad interpretations of the Koran and the Sunna [the doings of the Prophet Muhammad]"", and that what was taught in Islamic schools and universities needed to change. 
The doctrines of jihad and takfir are central to the debate. Extremists interpret jihad as mandating offensive holy war, though they may disagree about when and against whom it should be waged. The evidence from the hadith (the Prophet's sayings) and renowned scholars that Islam is a religion of the sword is ""so profuse that only a heretic would argue otherwise"", claims the most recent issue of Dabiq, the magazine of Islamic State (IS). Extremists differ, too, about takfir, the process whereby Muslims declare other Muslims to be apostates or unbelievers, for which the penalty is death. Al-Qaeda applies the doctrine with some limits to avoid alienating Muslims from its cause; IS invokes takfir wholesale, especially against Shias, perhaps in the belief that cinematic gore is the stronger lure. 
Mainstream clerics are trying to rebut such views. ""Jihad does not mean holy war but striving to achieve peace and anything good in obedience to Allah,"" says Dauda Bello, an imam from Nigeria's north-eastern region, where Boko Haram, an Islamist insurgent group, rampages. Last year 120 Muslim scholars wrote to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, IS's leader, saying that he had misconstrued Islam by ignoring the context of the Koran, classical teaching and the current era. Takfir, they said, can only be pronounced on those who have openly professed unbelief. It is properly carried out only by ulema (a group of recognised experts in sacred law and theology), which will first offer the opportunity to repent. To prove the point, al-Azhar will not call IS non-Muslims. 
The authority of al-Azhar, Tunisia's Zitouna mosque and Saudi Arabia's University of Medina rests on their long histories and tradition of scholarship. The approach of al-Azhar, which was founded in 970 and led the integration of Islamic and secular subjects, is ""based on teachings which the Muslim umma [community] has approved over thousands of years"", says Muhammad Mehanna, an adviser to Mr Tayeb. 
But Sunni Islam, unlike the Shia form, has no pre-eminent doctrinal authority, nor, since Ataturk ended the already weakened caliphate in 1922, anything resembling a single leader. This makes it harder to hold the line against extremists. Four schools of sharia law and thousands of hadith allow much room for interpretation. Both IS and Boko Haram argue from primary sources and ancient scholars. Supporters of IS point out that their leader has a PhD in Islamic studies from Baghdad University and claims to be of noble and learned stock. 
Governments in the Middle East are trying to counter such new claims of authority by imposing their own versions of Islam. Last year Egypt sacked 12,000 preachers and replaced them with al-Azhar graduates, who must preach on government-approved themes. Saudi Arabia, which itself espouses a puritanical form of Islam, has long co-opted clerics with cash and is adding CCTV in mosques (ostensibly to prevent theft). Overhauling religious education in schools is being discussed, too. In 2012 the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a think-tank in Washington, DC, found that Egyptian textbooks embraced jihad against both infidels and enemy countries. Callers to a recent radio show about radicalisation on FM Masr, an Egyptian station, said such books needed to be rewritten. In Nigeria imams are setting up schools that combine secular and Islamic education, since teachers in traditional religious schools are often low-level imams barely out of their teens. 
Complicating attempts to shore up traditional sources of authority is the fact that the establishment is precisely what many extremists reject. Salafists (devout Muslims who seek to emulate the times of the Prophet), both of the quietist and the violently jihadist sort, see much of the centuries-old tradition of Islamic jurisprudence as distorting the true religion. When denounced by the emir of Kano, a former central banker who is now Nigeria's second-most-important Muslim leader, Boko Haram retorted: ""We do not practise the religion of Lamido Sanusi...but the religion of Allah."" 
And Muslim-majority populations that have risen up against dictators are less willing to trust religious authorities--especially those they regard as captured by political or government interests. Egypt's government appoints the head of al-Azhar. Members of Dar al-Ifta, Lebanon's official body for teachings and fatwas (rulings on Islamic law), come from its two main political groupings. Middle Eastern rulers have a history of alternately backing religious groups and denouncing them as terrorists for short-term political gain. 
The internet, social media and improving literacy in the region make other sources easier to find. ""I think about religion myself by searching and seeing the different opinions,"" says Muhammad Gamal, a chemistry teacher at Cairo University. Alternatives are often better packaged and more appealing to young people, too. A region-wide joke says that Mr Baghdadi, in his 30s, is the youngest person to head an Arab organisation. 
""You see ISIS videos, all slick Hollywood style, and what a stark contrast with the turbans and robes of the sheikhs of Al-Azhar,"" says Raphael Lefevre, a French scholar who studies Lebanon's Sunnis. ""Radical groups seem closer to the people. Institutions are seen as bourgeois, stuffy and speaking a language people don't understand."" Some Muslim scholars compare the appeal of jihadism to that of fundamentalist Christianity: the message is clear and certain. 
Firm government action against those who preach violence is probably worthwhile. And traditional centres of Islamic authority could surely do more to explain their interpretations of Islam, and in more appealing ways. But the result of the debate within Islam about the roots of extremism may not be entirely to the taste of liberal Muslims--or Western politicians. 
Imposing state-sanctioned creeds has in the past pushed jihadists underground. And these versions of Islam are by no means sure to be more liberal: the Saudi regime uses harsh sharia punishments such as beheading and last year al-Azhar launched a campaign to rid Egypt of unbelief after a survey claimed the country held precisely 866 atheists. But the alternative, attempting to promote liberal doctrines in a free market of religious ideas, has dangers, too. Georges Fahmi, an Egyptian scholar, detects a conservative mood among Muslims: ""What is shocking is how many people support IS's actions even if they would not do them themselves.""","There is a heated debate about the role of Islam in jihadism. Will it makea difference? 
WESTERN leaders have long urged Muslims to do more to counter jihadist ideology. This month Barack Obama said moderate Muslims, including scholars and clerics, had a responsibility to reject ""twisted interpretations of Islam"" and the lie ""that America and the West are somehow at war with Islam"". On February 23rd Tony Abbott, Australia's prime minister, urged Muslim leaders to say that Islam is a religion of peace--""and mean it"". 
Muslims have not taken kindly to such hectoring. Yet they are starting to debate the role that Islamist ideology plays in extremism. On February 22nd Ahmed al-Tayeb, the grand imam of Egypt's al-Azhar mosque, part of a university that is the Sunni world's oldest seat of learning, declared that extremism was caused by ""bad interpretations of the Koran and the Sunna [the doings of the Prophet Muhammad]"", and that what was taught in Islamic schools and universities needed to change. 
The doctrines of jihad and takfir are central to the debate. Extremists interpret jihad as mandating offensive holy war, though they may disagree about when and against whom it should be waged. The evidence from the hadith (the Prophet's sayings) and renowned scholars that Islam is a religion of the sword is ""so profuse that only a heretic would argue otherwise"", claims the most recent issue of Dabiq, the magazine of Islamic State (IS). Extremists differ, too, about takfir, the process whereby Muslims declare other Muslims to be apostates or unbelievers, for which the penalty is death. Al-Qaeda applies the doctrine with some limits to avoid alienating Muslims from its cause; IS invokes takfir wholesale, especially against Shias, perhaps in the belief that cinematic gore is the stronger lure. 
Mainstream clerics are trying to rebut such views. ""Jihad does not mean holy war but striving to achieve peace and anything good in obedience to Allah,"" says Dauda Bello, an imam from Nigeria's north-eastern region, where Boko Haram, an Islamist insurgent group, rampages. Last year 120 Muslim scholars wrote to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, IS's leader, saying that he had misconstrued Islam by ignoring the context of the Koran, classical teaching and the current era. Takfir, they said, can only be pronounced on those who have openly professed unbelief. It is properly carried out only by ulema (a group of recognised experts in sacred law and theology), which will first offer the opportunity to repent. To prove the point, al-Azhar will not call IS non-Muslims. 
The authority of al-Azhar, Tunisia's Zitouna mosque and Saudi Arabia's University of Medina rests on their long histories and tradition of scholarship. The approach of al-Azhar, which was founded in 970 and led the integration of Islamic and secular subjects, is ""based on teachings which the Muslim umma [community] has approved over thousands of years"", says Muhammad Mehanna, an adviser to Mr Tayeb. 
But Sunni Islam, unlike the Shia form, has no pre-eminent doctrinal authority, nor, since Ataturk ended the already weakened caliphate in 1922, anything resembling a single leader. This makes it harder to hold the line against extremists. Four schools of sharia law and thousands of hadith allow much room for interpretation. Both IS and Boko Haram argue from primary sources and ancient scholars. Supporters of IS point out that their leader has a PhD in Islamic studies from Baghdad University and claims to be of noble and learned stock. 
Governments in the Middle East are trying to counter such new claims of authority by imposing their own versions of Islam. Last year Egypt sacked 12,000 preachers and replaced them with al-Azhar graduates, who must preach on government-approved themes. Saudi Arabia, which itself espouses a puritanical form of Islam, has long co-opted clerics with cash and is adding CCTV in mosques (ostensibly to prevent theft). Overhauling religious education in schools is being discussed, too. In 2012 the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a think-tank in Washington, DC, found that Egyptian textbooks embraced jihad against both infidels and enemy countries. Callers to a recent radio show about radicalisation on FM Masr, an Egyptian station, said such books needed to be rewritten. In Nigeria imams are setting up schools that combine secular and Islamic education, since teachers in traditional religious schools are often low-level imams barely out of their teens. 
Complicating attempts to shore up traditional sources of authority is the fact that the establishment is precisely what many extremists reject. Salafists (devout Muslims who seek to emulate the times of the Prophet), both of the quietist and the violently jihadist sort, see much of the centuries-old tradition of Islamic jurisprudence as distorting the true religion. When denounced by the emir of Kano, a former central banker who is now Nigeria's second-most-important Muslim leader, Boko Haram retorted: ""We do not practise the religion of Lamido Sanusi...but the religion of Allah."" 
And Muslim-majority populations that have risen up against dictators are less willing to trust religious authorities--especially those they regard as captured by political or government interests. Egypt's government appoints the head of al-Azhar. Members of Dar al-Ifta, Lebanon's official body for teachings and fatwas (rulings on Islamic law), come from its two main political groupings. Middle Eastern rulers have a history of alternately backing religious groups and denouncing them as terrorists for short-term political gain. 
The internet, social media and improving literacy in the region make other sources easier to find. ""I think about religion myself by searching and seeing the different opinions,"" says Muhammad Gamal, a chemistry teacher at Cairo University. Alternatives are often better packaged and more appealing to young people, too. A region-wide joke says that Mr Baghdadi, in his 30s, is the youngest person to head an Arab organisation. 
""You see ISIS videos, all slick Hollywood style, and what a stark contrast with the turbans and robes of the sheikhs of Al-Azhar,"" says Raphael Lefevre, a French scholar who studies Lebanon's Sunnis. ""Radical groups seem closer to the people. Institutions are seen as bourgeois, stuffy and speaking a language people don't understand."" Some Muslim scholars compare the appeal of jihadism to that of fundamentalist Christianity: the message is clear and certain. 
Firm government action against those who preach violence is probably worthwhile. And traditional centres of Islamic authority could surely do more to explain their interpretations of Islam, and in more appealing ways. But the result of the debate within Islam about the roots of extremism may not be entirely to the taste of liberal Muslims--or Western politicians. 
Imposing state-sanctioned creeds has in the past pushed jihadists underground. And these versions of Islam are by no means sure to be more liberal: the Saudi regime uses harsh sharia punishments such as beheading and last year al-Azhar launched a campaign to rid Egypt of unbelief after a survey claimed the country held precisely 866 atheists. But the alternative, attempting to promote liberal doctrines in a free market of religious ideas, has dangers, too. Georges Fahmi, an Egyptian scholar, detects a conservative mood among Muslims: ""What is shocking is how many people support IS's actions even if they would not do them themselves.""",900,Australia,cb-900-2,,False,,0,True

JUST 18 months after Tony Abbott became Australia's prime minister, pundits are writing his political obituary. A string of gaffes, disastrous polls and bitter divisions within his conservative Liberal Party sparked a motion last month to open his leadership to a party ballot. He survived, just. But the drama continues to feed a febrile mood in Canberra, the capital. On March 2nd an opinion poll gave Mr Abbott some breathing space. For how long is another matter. 
The Ipsos poll showed the Liberals and their coalition partner, the National Party, trailing the opposition Labor Party by only two percentage points, after including second-preference votes. A month earlier the government had lagged by eight points. Mr Abbott's personal approval rating edged up slightly, though only to a measly 32%. His allies jumped to defend him. Andrew Robb, the minister for trade and investment, says that in the poll the voters ""have spoken"" and that the push by colleagues to topple the prime minister is ""dying"". 
That may be optimistic. Asked who they would like to lead the Liberals, 39% of voters chose Malcolm Turnbull, the communications minister, and 24% chose Julie Bishop, the foreign minister. Just 19% plumped for Mr Abbott. Some pollsters read the rise in positive sentiment towards the government as a sign that some voters expect to see Mr Turnbull in charge before the next election, due in 2016. 
Backed by the Liberals' conservative wing, Mr Abbott unseated the centrist Mr Turnbull as party leader in 2009. In the latest jostling, Mr Turnbull has taken a steady approach that voters seem to prefer to Mr Abbott's street-fighting style. A telling clash came over a recent report by Australia's Human Rights Commission that criticised both Labor and coalition governments for locking child asylum-seekers in detention centres. Mr Abbott responded by attacking the commission's boss, Gillian Triggs. Mr Turnbull defended Ms Triggs as a ""very distinguished"" legal scholar, adding that the main issue ""is the children"". 
Ordinary Australians have never really taken to Mr Abbott. But he also has problems in his cabinet. His colleagues resent the power wielded by his chief of staff, Peta Credlin. She happens to be married to the Liberal Party's director, Brian Loughnane. A leaked memo from the party treasurer to Liberal party officials fretted about a potential conflict of interest. The press have made much of the leak as an apparent attempt to damage Mr Abbott. He dismissed it as a storm in a teacup. 
After the respite produced by the latest poll, Mr Abbott issued a flurry of policy announcements. He pledged 300 more Australian troops for Iraq, on top of 170 special forces there now, to serve with about 100 New Zealand soldiers training the Iraqi army. A much-ballyhooed report was published about the pressure on budgets that can be expected from an ageing population over the next 40 years. And the prime minister finally dropped one of the most unpopular measures in his government's first budget last year: a plan to charge those using public health insurance for visiting doctors. 
Mr Robb says the Liberals will now give Mr Abbott ""clear air"" to carry on as leader until the next budget, due in May, ""and beyond"". Other colleagues are less happy with that prospect, given that the first budget was bungled between Mr Abbott and his treasurer, Joe Hockey. Moreover, a state election is due on March 28th in New South Wales, Mr Abbott's home state, which is currently governed by the Liberals. Recent defeats of one-term conservative state governments in Victoria and Queensland have rocked the Liberals. If Mike Baird, the popular state premier, does badly, the ""Abbott effect"" could take most of the blame.

THE BUSINESS CAPITAL of the Philippines is a part of Manila called Makati. But it might be called Ayala, after the country's most powerful company, which seems to dominate it. Ayala's 35-storey headquarters stands in the heart of Makati, in Ayala Triangle just off Ayala Avenue. Its tenants include the Philippines Stock Exchange as well as a roster of the world's big banks. The local museum is called the Ayala Museum (and houses a stunning collection of pre-colonial gold). Even the headquarters of the Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI), which challenges the Ayala Tower for dominance of the skyline, is not really a rival: BPI is the financial arm of the vast Ayala empire. 
Ayala has six divisions: property (Ayala Land), banking, mobile phones, utilities, call-centres and electronics. But this list understates the company's ambitions. Ayala Land is in the business of turning plots of Philippine land into parcels of the American dream (and lifting their market value sky-high). 
The Ayala empire has been run by the Ayala-Zobel dynasty for the past 181 years. The family started out in agriculture, then diversified into everything from construction to phones. The Zobels have professionalised and focused the company in recent years. The six main businesses have been listed on the stock exchange and put in the hands of professional CEOs, but the family remains at the heart of the firm. Two brothers from its sixth generation, Jamie Augusto and Fernando, run the holding company that sets the strategy. Three children from the eighth generation are working their way up the corporate hierarchy. 
Jamie Augusto has a glowing vision of the company as the driver of his country's modernisation. It has always taken a leading role in this, from building infrastructure to supporting corporate philanthropy; the Ayala Foundation is one of the country's largest. But in recent years it has increasingly focused on the mass market in an effort at ""nation-building"". Jamie Augusto, an alumnus of Harvard Business School, says this change of direction has been influenced by eminent management gurus. C.K. Prahalad urged companies to look for the ""fortune at the bottom of the pyramid"" and Michael Porter advised them to embrace ""shared value"". But it would be just as accurate to credit the influence of Globe, the family's communications business: you cannot build a mobile-phone empire without considering the poor. 
It is hard to know what to make of this vision of the family company as nation-builder. On the one hand Ayala is an unelected body with an interest in keeping new businesses out of the market. On the other, it is an efficient organisation that has had to compete with other conglomerates, some of them run by overseas Chinese, notably Henry Sy's SM Group. Whatever their faults, these conglomerates do a better job of providing services than does the Philippine state, with its noxious mixture of incompetence and rent-seeking. 
Ayala Land provides Makati with much of its public infrastructure in the form of walkways and parks. In 1997, when Ayala took over Manila Water, the taps in the utility's headquarters did not work. Today it offers a reliable water supply to more than 8m customers. The company is good at long-term thinking and co-ordinating activities across a broad range of industries. In one of Ayala Land's projects, Nuvali, it is building not just houses but also schools and churches for the people who work in the company's factories and call-centres. 
The commanding heights of the world's fastest-growing region, Asia, are dominated by great business families. At first glance companies such as Samsung and Hutchison Whampoa may look like regular public companies, but closer examination quickly reveals a family dynasty and a family saga. The partial exception to this rule is China, where state-owned enterprises (SOEs) still dominate. But even there the country's own brand of family capitalism flourishes wherever the state allows it to. 
Family companies were at the heart of the development of capitalism in Asia. Family names acted as a guarantee of honesty for fellow businesspeople and quality for consumers. Family ties allowed businesspeople to operate across countries and regions. Some families such as the Tatas added further lustre to their name by standing up to the colonial oppressors. Indians love to tell the (probably apocryphal) story of how Jamsetji Tata built the Taj Palace, the grandest hotel in Mumbai, because he was refused entry to a European-owned hotel. 
For some observers these family companies are turning into eye-catching relics as specialised firms move in and contracts are enforced by lawyers. The great patriarchs who once presided over these dynasties are being replaced by professional managers who could just as easily work in London or New York as in Hong Kong or Mumbai. Many hereditary businesspeople share these doubts. Anand Mahindra, the boss of Mahindra Group, a conglomerate that has been run by a member of the Mahindra family for three generations, is uncomfortable with talk of family capitalism. Family companies are mostly stuffed with family members ""99% of whom should not be there"", he says. 
But the numbers tell a different story. Asian countries are far more family-oriented than Western ones, and well over half the largest business groups in South-East Asia and India are controlled by families. Family companies continue to draw on time-honoured advantages such as their good names and deep connections, and continue to reinforce their positions through judicious marriages. 
Family companies can also draw on new advantages, such as modern management techniques and their connections with Western companies. The local princes and princesses are almost invariably educated at famous Western business schools (to which they make generous donations) and then polished in well-known Western companies such as McKinsey and J.P. Morgan. 
Vikram Bhalla, of the Boston Consulting Group, points to an even more important competitive advantage of Asian family businesses: their entrepreneurial zeal. They are more likely than public companies to make big bets and take big risks, and better than lone entrepreneurs at making things happen because they can mobilise far more resources. Being able to take a long-term view and co-ordinate activities across a wide range of sectors allows them to shape entire industries. 
Which is yours? 
Mr Bhalla divides Asian family companies into five main categories. The first is family-driven conglomerates, formed as the company repeatedly expands into new areas to provide jobs for the children. Boys tend to get ""hard"" industries such as construction whereas girls are given ""soft"" sectors such as hotels. The second is splitters, the opposite of the first: the family undergoes a strategic split to avoid (or disentangle) family conflicts. This can work smoothly, but is more often messy. The Birla family has repeatedly divided its empire amid furious arguments. The third group is institution-builders: the family hands over the day-to-day management of its businesses to professional CEOs and consolidates family power in holding companies. Anand Mahindra rules his group from his holding company. He likens himself to a ""private-equity player"" who chooses where to invest in the ""Mahindra federation"". 
The fourth category is joint families, in which several family members manage a company together. The main example of this is Asian Paints, which is flourishing under the joint control of three brothers. The fifth is serial entrepreneurs. Here the business platform is the family rather than the company: it moves from one industry to another but continues to use its name and connections to power its business dealings. The Piramals are a good example. Having started life in textiles, they shifted to pharmaceuticals, then used the profits from a judicious sale of their generic-drugs business to America's Abbott Laboratories to go into big data and financial services. 
But even such typologies risk understating the role of families in Asian business. Most of them are far more deferential to their patriarchs than their equivalents in the West, even in the face of dubious business decisions. They are also far more all-enveloping, even if they seem completely Westernised. Ajay Piramal, chairman of the Piramal Group, is a habitue of Davos; his wife, Swati, a doctor, is a member of Harvard University's Board of Overseers; his two children were educated at ""all the brand-name universities and business schools"". But the entire Piramal clan, numbering 40 in all, lives together as a huge extended family, discussing business and family affairs over every meal. ""We go to Harvard,"" says Mrs Piramal, ""but we also wear saris."" 
Perhaps the best place to learn the secrets of Asian capitalism is not the business sections of the newspapers but the gossip pages of glossy magazines. The stories of family feuds and scheming mistresses that can be found there are far more likely to change the balance of corporate power than the latest hostile takeover. As in family businesses the world over, the most important dramas are to do with succession. Many of the great patriarchs who created modern Asian capitalism have been useless at succession planning. They hold on to power until they have one foot in the grave. Talking about succession, they reckon, ""is almost like putting a curse on someone"", in the words of Yupana Wiwattanakantang, of the National University of Singapore Business School. Sir Run Run Shaw, the chairman of Television Broadcasting Limited, waited until he was 103 to announce his retirement, handing his position to his 79-year-old wife. Joseph Fan of the Chinese University of Hong Kong studied succession in 250 family firms in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore and found that on average the firms lost 60% of their value in the period spanning five years before succession and three years afterwards. Many lost a great deal more. 
Again, feuds are commonplace. One of the highest-profile ones was the bitter dispute between Mukesh and Anil Ambani over their conglomerate, Reliance, after their father, Dhirubhai, died without leaving a will. Mukesh has proved the more talented of the two, celebrating his relative success by building a 27storey house in Mumbai for his family. 
The tale of the Kwok family is even more colourful. Kwok Tak-Seng built up his company, Sun Hung Kai, to become the second-largest business group in Hong Kong and then left it to his wife and three sons, Walter, Raymond and Thomas. This quartet got on well until Walter was kidnapped and held in a wooden cage for a few days until a ransom was paid. The aftershocks of the kidnapping tore the family apart. Walter accused his brothers of quibbling over the size of the ransom, the rest of the family tried to oust him from his role as chairman of the family trust, and the fight continued for years. 
Asian family politics are further complicated by Chinese patriarchs' tendency to have several families. Stanley Ho's gambling empire has repeatedly been convulsed by fights over inheritance between different branches of his family (he has had four wives). Given that the company once accounted for 40% of the Macau economy, these quarrels have aroused keen local interest. And since Wang Yung-ching's death in 2008, his Formosa Plastics group has been rocked by rows among the nine offspring he had with his three wives. 
Fixing family capitalism 
As the patriarchs who built Asian capitalism after the second world war retire or die, Asia is seeing one of the biggest transfers of wealth in history. Some families are learning how to prepare their companies for a different age, preserving a measure of family power while also modernising their patrimonies. 
The retiring generation has given its children two things that they need to succeed in this new world: personal wealth and a privileged education. But they are also wired into the old world of ""Asian values"". Victor Chu, the boss of First Eastern Investment Group, is one of the rising generation of middlemen-cum-dealmakers. He earned his reputation in Japan by founding Peach Aviation, a low-cost carrier. (""He may not have his own plane but he does have his own airline,"" quips a friend.) But his real talent lies in connections: he spends his life introducing Western companies to the East and vice versa. 
The best example of a successful transition is Asia's richest man, Li Ka-shing. When he put together his property and trading empire, Cheung Kong, political and family connections were vital. He had a genius for establishing monopolies through licences and building businesses with astonishing speed. But he has been preparing his empire for a different world for decades. He chose the cleverer of his two sons, Victor, to succeed him and set up his other son, Richard, in a different business to head off any quarrels. He has consolidated his empire into a more formal structure, with Hutchison Whampoa at its heart, and is moving its centre of gravity from Hong Kong to the global stage. 
The Zobels of Ayala fame also look likely to be around for generations to come. They have made use of all the tools of sensible family government and are training up the next generation of Zobels in the family business. In a society given to flashiness, they come over as relatively modest. That helps at a time when the gap between the new business aristocracy and the poor is opening ever wider.","In the world's most dynamic region, family companies occupy the commanding heights of capitalism

Even the headquarters of the Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI), which challenges the Ayala Tower for dominance of the skyline, is not really a rival: BPI is the financial arm of the vast Ayala empire. 
Ayala has six divisions: property (Ayala Land), banking, mobile phones, utilities, call-centres and electronics. But this list understates the company's ambitions. Ayala Land is in the business of turning plots of Philippine land into parcels of the American dream (and lifting their market value sky-high). 
The Ayala empire has been run by the Ayala-Zobel dynasty for the past 181 years. The family started out in agriculture, then diversified into everything from construction to phones. The Zobels have professionalised and focused the company in recent years. The six main businesses have been listed on the stock exchange and put in the hands of professional CEOs, but the family remains at the heart of the firm. Two brothers from its sixth generation, Jamie Augusto and Fernando, run the holding company that sets the strategy. Three children from the eighth generation are working their way up the corporate hierarchy. 
Jamie Augusto has a glowing vision of the company as the driver of his country's modernisation. It has always taken a leading role in this, from building infrastructure to supporting corporate philanthropy; the Ayala Foundation is one of the country's largest. But in recent years it has increasingly focused on the mass market in an effort at ""nation-building"". Jamie Augusto, an alumnus of Harvard Business School, says this change of direction has been influenced by eminent management gurus. C.K. Prahalad urged companies to look for the ""fortune at the bottom of the pyramid"" and Michael Porter advised them to embrace ""shared value"". But it would be just as accurate to credit the influence of Globe, the family's communications business: you cannot build a mobile-phone empire without considering the poor. 
It is hard to know what to make of this vision of the family company as nation-builder. On the one hand Ayala is an unelected body with an interest in keeping new businesses out of the market. On the other, it is an efficient organisation that has had to compete with other conglomerates, some of them run by overseas Chinese, notably Henry Sy's SM Group. Whatever their faults, these conglomerates do a better job of providing services than does the Philippine state, with its noxious mixture of incompetence and rent-seeking. 
Ayala Land provides Makati with much of its public infrastructure in the form of walkways and parks. In 1997, when Ayala took over Manila Water, the taps in the utility's headquarters did not work. Today it offers a reliable water supply to more than 8m customers. The company is good at long-term thinking and co-ordinating activities across a broad range of industries. In one of Ayala Land's projects, Nuvali, it is building not just houses but also schools and churches for the people who work in the company's factories and call-centres. 
The commanding heights of the world's fastest-growing region, Asia, are dominated by great business families. At first glance companies such as Samsung and Hutchison Whampoa may look like regular public companies, but closer examination quickly reveals a family dynasty and a family saga. The partial exception to this rule is China, where state-owned enterprises (SOEs) still dominate. But even there the country's own brand of family capitalism flourishes wherever the state allows it to. 
Family companies were at the heart of the development of capitalism in Asia. Family names acted as a guarantee of honesty for fellow businesspeople and quality for consumers. Family ties allowed businesspeople to operate across countries and regions. Some families such as the Tatas added further lustre to their name by standing up to the colonial oppressors. Indians love to tell the (probably apocryphal) story of how Jamsetji Tata built the Taj Palace, the grandest hotel in Mumbai, because he was refused entry to a European-owned hotel. 
For some observers these family companies are turning into eye-catching relics as specialised firms move in and contracts are enforced by lawyers. The great patriarchs who once presided over these dynasties are being replaced by professional managers who could just as easily work in London or New York as in Hong Kong or Mumbai. Many hereditary businesspeople share these doubts. Anand Mahindra, the boss of Mahindra Group, a conglomerate that has been run by a member of the Mahindra family for three generations, is uncomfortable with talk of family capitalism. Family companies are mostly stuffed with family members ""99% of whom should not be there"", he says. 
But the numbers tell a different story. Asian countries are far more family-oriented than Western ones, and well over half the largest business groups in South-East Asia and India are controlled by families. Family companies continue to draw on time-honoured advantages such as their good names and deep connections, and continue to reinforce their positions through judicious marriages. 
Family companies can also draw on new advantages, such as modern management techniques and their connections with Western companies. The local princes and princesses are almost invariably educated at famous Western business schools (to which they make generous donations) and then polished in well-known Western companies such as McKinsey and J.P. Morgan. 
Vikram Bhalla, of the Boston Consulting Group, points to an even more important competitive advantage of Asian family businesses: their entrepreneurial zeal. They are more likely than public companies to make big bets and take big risks, and better than lone entrepreneurs at making things happen because they can mobilise far more resources. Being able to take a long-term view and co-ordinate activities across a wide range of sectors allows them to shape entire industries. 
Which is yours? 
Mr Bhalla divides Asian family companies into five main categories. The first is family-driven conglomerates, formed as the company repeatedly expands into new areas to provide jobs for the children. Boys tend to get ""hard"" industries such as construction whereas girls are given ""soft"" sectors such as hotels. The second is splitters, the opposite of the first: the family undergoes a strategic split to avoid (or disentangle) family conflicts. This can work smoothly, but is more often messy. The Birla family has repeatedly divided its empire amid furious arguments. The third group is institution-builders: the family hands over the day-to-day management of its businesses to professional CEOs and consolidates family power in holding companies. Anand Mahindra rules his group from his holding company. He likens himself to a ""private-equity player"" who chooses where to invest in the ""Mahindra federation"". 
The fourth category is joint families, in which several family members manage a company together. The main example of this is Asian Paints, which is flourishing under the joint control of three brothers. The fifth is serial entrepreneurs. Here the business platform is the family rather than the company: it moves from one industry to another but continues to use its name and connections to power its business dealings. The Piramals are a good example. Having started life in textiles, they shifted to pharmaceuticals, then used the profits from a judicious sale of their generic-drugs business to America's Abbott Laboratories to go into big data and financial services. 
But even such typologies risk understating the role of families in Asian business. Most of them are far more deferential to their patriarchs than their equivalents in the West, even in the face of dubious business decisions. They are also far more all-enveloping, even if they seem completely Westernised. Ajay Piramal, chairman of the Piramal Group, is a habitue of Davos; his wife, Swati, a doctor, is a member of Harvard University's Board of Overseers; his two children were educated at ""all the brand-name universities and business schools"". But the entire Piramal clan, numbering 40 in all, lives together as a huge extended family, discussing business and family affairs over every meal. ""We go to Harvard,"" says Mrs Piramal, ""but we also wear saris."" 
Perhaps the best place to learn the secrets of Asian capitalism is not the business sections of the newspapers but the gossip pages of glossy magazines. The stories of family feuds and scheming mistresses that can be found there are far more likely to change the balance of corporate power than the latest hostile takeover. As in family businesses the world over, the most important dramas are to do with succession. Many of the great patriarchs who created modern Asian capitalism have been useless at succession planning. They hold on to power until they have one foot in the grave. Talking about succession, they reckon, ""is almost like putting a curse on someone"", in the words of Yupana Wiwattanakantang, of the National University of Singapore Business School. Sir Run Run Shaw, the chairman of Television Broadcasting Limited, waited until he was 103 to announce his retirement, handing his position to his 79-year-old wife. Joseph Fan of the Chinese University of Hong Kong studied succession in 250 family firms in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore and found that on average the firms lost 60% of their value in the period spanning five years before succession and three years afterwards. Many lost a great deal more. 
Again, feuds are commonplace. One of the highest-profile ones was the bitter dispute between Mukesh and Anil Ambani over their conglomerate, Reliance, after their father, Dhirubhai, died without leaving a will. Mukesh has proved the more talented of the two, celebrating his relative success by building a 27storey house in Mumbai for his family. 
The tale of the Kwok family is even more colourful. Kwok Tak-Seng built up his company, Sun Hung Kai, to become the second-largest business group in Hong Kong and then left it to his wife and three sons, Walter, Raymond and Thomas. This quartet got on well until Walter was kidnapped and held in a wooden cage for a few days until a ransom was paid. The aftershocks of the kidnapping tore the family apart. Walter accused his brothers of quibbling over the size of the ransom, the rest of the family tried to oust him from his role as chairman of the family trust, and the fight continued for years. 
Asian family politics are further complicated by Chinese patriarchs' tendency to have several families. Stanley Ho's gambling empire has repeatedly been convulsed by fights over inheritance between different branches of his family (he has had four wives). Given that the company once accounted for 40% of the Macau economy, these quarrels have aroused keen local interest. And since Wang Yung-ching's death in 2008, his Formosa Plastics group has been rocked by rows among the nine offspring he had with his three wives. 
Fixing family capitalism 
As the patriarchs who built Asian capitalism after the second world war retire or die, Asia is seeing one of the biggest transfers of wealth in history. Some families are learning how to prepare their companies for a different age, preserving a measure of family power while also modernising their patrimonies. 
The retiring generation has given its children two things that they need to succeed in this new world: personal wealth and a privileged education. But they are also wired into the old world of ""Asian values"". Victor Chu, the boss of First Eastern Investment Group, is one of the rising generation of middlemen-cum-dealmakers. He earned his reputation in Japan by founding Peach Aviation, a low-cost carrier. (""He may not have his own plane but he does have his own airline,"" quips a friend.) But his real talent lies in connections: he spends his life introducing Western companies to the East and vice versa. 
The best example of a successful transition is Asia's richest man, Li Ka-shing. When he put together his property and trading empire, Cheung Kong, political and family connections were vital. He had a genius for establishing monopolies through licences and building businesses with astonishing speed. But he has been preparing his empire for a different world for decades. He chose the cleverer of his two sons, Victor, to succeed him and set up his other son, Richard, in a different business to head off any quarrels. He has consolidated his empire into a more formal structure, with Hutchison Whampoa at its heart, and is moving its centre of gravity from Hong Kong to the global stage. 
The Zobels of Ayala fame also look likely to be around for generations to come. They have made use of all the tools of sensible family government and are training up the next generation of Zobels in the family business. In a society given to flashiness, they come over as relatively modest. That helps at a time when the gap between the new business aristocracy and the poor is opening ever wider.",900,Australia,cb-900-2,,False,,0,True

MULTICULTURAL and prosperous, Australia is notable for its welcome to migrants--and for its intolerance of boat people. In 1992, the Labor government of Paul Keating introduced a policy of ""mandatory detention"": asylum-seekers in boats would be locked up, pending assessment of their claims. 
But the number of boat people only rose. By the turn of the millennium it was 4,000 a year, at which point John Howard, head of the (conservative) Liberal government, resorted to his ""Pacific solution"". Boat people would be sent to new detention camps on Manus Island, in Papua New Guinea, and on the island-state of Nauru. The contentious policy was overturned in 2008 by the Labor prime minister, Kevin Rudd, but reinstated by Julia Gillard, his Labor successor. 
Tony Abbott, the current Liberal prime minister, campaigned on a promise to ""stop the boats"". He has been tougher even than Mr Howard. On April 17th an Australian naval vessel offloaded 46 Vietnamese asylum-seekers in Vung Tau in southern Vietnam after intercepting them at sea. The UN and others question whether their asylum claims had been screened properly. Australia has struck a deal with Cambodia to resettle some of the 485 people in Nauru now recognised as refugees (about four-fifths of those assessed). But those offered this ""new life in a safe country, free from persecution and violence"" have not taken the offer up. 
Australia admits about 200,000 immigrants a year through regular channels. It also resettles some 13,750 refugees a year from other parts of the world. But when it comes to boat people, it is bent on deterring irregular migration. 
The government claims that just one ""people smuggling venture"" has made it to Australian waters since December 2013, and that boat's passengers were transferred to Nauru. But the policy has financial and reputational costs. The detention centres cost A$3 billion ($2.3 billion) in the 2014-15 fiscal year. Human-rights groups chastise Australia for abandoning its obligation to protect asylum-seekers. Mr Abbott, though, is unrepentant and thinks Europe should get tougher.

Aaron Connelly , of the Lowy Institute in Sydney , argues that withdrawing the ambassador could prove counter - productive . As Tony Abbott spoke , the bodies of Mr Chan and Mr Sukumaran were handed over to their families . But the latest flounder in the relationship will last long after they have been put to rest .

CARLY FIORINA (pictured), a former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard and one of the latest Republican candidates for the presidency, has a simple pitch. She is a woman and she is not Hillary Clinton. To make this point as subtly as possible her campaign launch video, released on May 4th, begins with a scene of Ms Fiorina turning off a television showing Mrs Clinton's launch video. On the stump she repeatedly accuses the Democratic frontrunner of being untrustworthy. She adds: ""Mrs Clinton, name an accomplishment?"" 
Ms Fiorina is one of three new candidates who have jumped into the Republican melee this week. She was joined a day later by Mike Huckabee, a former governor of Arkansas who announced his intention to run from his hometown of Hope, where Bill Clinton was also born. He delivered a bombastic speech, lamenting ""the slaughter of over 55m babies in the name of choice"". The elderly audience chanted ""We love Huck"". The third contender is Ben Carson, a retired brain surgeon who was the first to separate twins joined at the head. Mr Carson has also dabbled as a Fox News pundit, and is the only black presidential candidate from either party. A week before, on the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton gained her first formal challenger: Bernie Sanders, a senator from Vermont. 
None of these new candidates has much chance of winning. Mr Sanders is an experienced politician but, as the only self-described socialist in Congress, he is a tough sell outside the Green Mountain State. His real aim is probably to pull Mrs Clinton to the left economically. 
Ms Fiorina was once a technology titan, but she has never won an election. In 2010 she ran for one of California's seats in the Senate. She lost by 42% to 52% against a veteran incumbent. Mr Carson has never fought an election. He has built a political career out of his life story (he was raised by a single mother in a rough part of Detroit), his soft-spoken faith and his habit of saying outrageous things--he once described America under Barack Obama as being ""very much like Nazi Germany"". 
Only Mr Huckabee has ever been a serious contender. In 2008 he came second in the Republican primaries, charming evangelical voters with his wisecracks, guitar-playing and Biblical allusions. Since then he has written books (his latest is called""God, Guns, Grits and Gravy"") and made a lot of money as a television pundit. He will not win, but he may force other candidates to fight harder for the votes of older, religious conservatives. His launch speech featured a defence of Social Security and Medicare, two government programmes for the old which many Republicans would like to reform (ie, restrain). 
The Republican campaign unfolds against a backdrop of intense distrust of Mr Obama among conservatives. Some of this is nutty: conspiracy theorists have decided that an army exercise in Texas is the precursor to a federal takeover. The governor, Greg Abbott, who should know better, has asked the state guard to monitor it. On May 5th Ted Cruz, a Texan senator and presidential candidate, said he understood people's concerns, though he personally did not doubt the Pentagon's explanation that the exercise was just an exercise. Rick Perry, a former governor of Texas who may also run for president, dismissed the conspiracy theory out of hand.","Three Republicans with little chance of victory but who may influence the race

BEFORE he led the conservative Liberal-National coalition to power in 2013, Tony Abbott promised to fix Australia's ""budget emergency"" by turning a string of deficits under the previous Labor government into surpluses. He endorsed a pledge by Joe Hockey, now the treasurer, to deliver a surplus in each year of his government's three-year term. Surpluses, the prime minister said, were in the coalition's ""DNA"". 
On May 12th Mr Hockey delivered the government's second budget--and second deficit. It has grown to A$41 billion ($32 billion), equivalent to 2.6% of GDP, for the fiscal year ending in June, from a projected A$30 billion a year ago. The deficit is forecast to be A$35 billion for the coming fiscal year, with deficits of A$47 billion in all for the following three years. 
A resources boom linked to China, Australia's biggest trading partner, helped Australia chalk up a quarter-century of continuous economic growth this year. But earnings from iron ore and coal, Australia's two biggest exports, have waned. Iron-ore prices have almost halved since last year. The government has written off A$52 billion in tax revenues, more than a third of that due to the falling price of iron. Feeble wage growth has not helped. The central bank sees unemployment rising a quarter of a percentage point to 6.5% by mid-2016. 
The treasury still forecasts robust GDP growth of 2.75% for the coming fiscal year, rising to 3.5% three years later. That is despite the central bank predicting that mining investment will ""fall sharply"" over the next two years, as Chinese demand for Australia's commodities weakens. A week before the budget, the bank cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, to 2%. It seems to think that more than Mr Hockey's budget will be needed to stimulate a cooling economy. 
Mr Hockey is relying mainly on owners of small businesses to boost the economy. He is cutting their tax rates from 30% to 28.5%, and they will now be able to write off A$20,000-worth of new equipment. He has also promised to crack down on multinational companies avoiding taxes in Australia. Authorities have already identified 30 firms (unnamed as yet) suspected of diverting profits from Australia. 
The populist ring to Mr Hockey's second budget is a far cry from his first. The budget a year ago imposed big spending cuts that fell most heavily on Australians least able to bear them. Some of its measures remain blocked in the upper house, where the government lacks a majority. A political backlash from that budget almost cost Mr Abbott his position as Liberal Party leader (and hence prime minister). The government has trailed the Labor Party in opinion polls ever since. 
Now, talk of budget emergencies has faded. Some economists worry that Mr Hockey's second budget has abandoned the government's earlier commitment to a robust fiscal plan, presumably in hopes of restoring its political fortunes before an election due next year. Still, the budget has won support from some business leaders, who say it will boost investment. 
Others are reserving judgment. Warren Hogan, chief economist with ANZ Bank, says that the political fallout from the first budget was ""extraordinarily damaging"" for business and consumer confidence. The test of the latest budget will be whether it boosts the competitiveness of Australian firms during a ""painfully slow"" transition away from mining to other sectors of the economy, mainly in services. Mr Hockey insists that the government is still on a ""clear and credible path back to surplus"". But the budget suggests that will not happen before 2020 at the earliest.","Tony Abbott's tries to restore Tony Abbott's political fortunes

""FOREIGN POLICY IS fun, to an extent it is theatre,"" says Shivshankar Menon, who was India's national security adviser until last year. He recalls a prime minister who so enjoyed talking about foreign policy that he let meetings on the subject run for three times their scheduled length. 
Narendra Modi obviously loves it too. As Gujarat's chief minister he showed unusual interest in other countries, visiting Japan, China and Britain, and hosting investor jamborees. As prime minister he has put more energy into foreign policy than anything else. 
By giving so much attention to foreign affairs, Mr Modi has sidelined his foreign minister, Sushma Swaraj. By now he has spent 52 days of his first year abroad, visiting America, Japan, Brazil and Germany, among other countries. Many trips were overdue. It had been 28 years since an Indian prime minister had last paid a bilateral call on Sri Lanka or Australia; for Canada, the gap was 42 years. 
India's top diplomat, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, says this is about more than appearances. India, he explains, now aspires to be a ""leading power, not just a balancing power"". That means it has become less self-effacing, abandoning talk of a ""no-frills"" foreign policy of non-alignment. India is also hoping to boost its share of world trade from 2% to 3.5% by 2020. Mr Modi is playing his part. He has established warm relations with Japan's Shinzo Abe and Australia's Tony Abbott. In his first year, he says, he has met 50 national leaders for direct talks. 
An immediate goal, of being seen to play an important international role, has been achieved. ""India is back in the news,"" says Tanvi Madan, of the Brookings Institution, a think-tank. Mr Menon claims his successors are mostly continuing with the country's previous policy, ""but they present it more forcefully."" Making a greater impact requires more manpower, including a bigger diplomatic corps. India has long been famous for having a mere 800 diplomats. The foreign ministry claims it actually has 2,500, but that figure results from a new way of counting them, not extra recruitment. 
A more determined approach is showing up in two areas. One is the immediate neighbourhood. Mr Jaishankar says that ""you cannot be a leading power if your neighbourhood is not with you, you need it to root for you."" So India is promoting cross-border trade and a regional electricity grid (some of its neighbours have massive hydropower potential), creating infrastructure on its borders, relaxing visas and doling out aid. After last month's devastating earthquake in Nepal, India was quick to take a leading role in the relief effort. It wants to end the perception that it meddles and bullies, though rumours still swirled that it helped sway Sri Lanka's election in January. 
Old enemies, new friends 
The obvious problem is Pakistan. India has a ""SAARC-minus-one"" strategy of integrating South Asia's economies over the next decade, working with the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation but isolating Pakistan. So far Mr Modi's handling of the old rival has not been coherent: he welcomed Nawaz Sharif, its prime minister, to his inauguration in May last year, then used a pretext to cancel talks between the two countries' foreign secretaries. Relations deteriorated as the bloodiest border clashes in 11 years broke out in October, but this relationship looks unlikely to shift much for better or worse. 
The second new emphasis in foreign policy concerns ties with America and the West generally. In Mr Menon's day India was already drifting westwards as memories of the cold war faded, economic ties strengthened and Pakistan's relations with the West became more strained. But India hedged, keen to avoid confrontation with China. 
Under Mr Modi the westward tilt has become more explicit. That was partly China's doing. During a visit to India by Xi Jinping, the Chinese leader, Chinese soldiers crossed a disputed border and camped in Himalayan territory that India considers its own, humiliating a man who had boasted he would secure the frontier. Later, China twice sent a military submarine to Colombo, Sri Lanka's capital. Mr Modi took offence. 
In January Barack Obama was the chief guest at India's Republic Day celebrations. The countries issued a joint security statement on stability in Asia, calling for freedom of navigation in and over the South China Sea, where China is needling its neighbours. The same visit delivered what Mr Obama called a ""breakthrough in understanding"" over the liability of suppliers to any civil-nuclear power plants. Details remain fuzzy, but heavy American investment in energy would deepen ties. 
Defence is another area ripe for co-operation. India is opening its defence industry to foreign, most likely Western, investors. In July 2014 a cap on foreign investment in domestic defence projects was increased to 49%, though investors may not be tempted to put money in until the government starts buying more defence kit. Bizarrely, on a trip to France in April Mr Modi announced an order for 36 Rafale fighter jets to be made in France, undercutting his own procurement strategy. 
Even so, India's co-operation with the West will become closer as it buys less military hardware from Russia (and as Russia becomes friendlier with Pakistan). That co-operation extends even into space: last September India got a spacecraft to orbit around Mars, with some navigational help from NASA. India's public seems to approve. Surveys by the Pew Research Centre show that it generally favours the West. In a poll in 2014, 55% of Indians said they liked America. One reason is that many millions of them have relatives who live, study and work there.

FOR nearly three months a small green fishing boat has chugged around South-East Asia's vast blue waters, packed with people no one wants. At first the 300 or so refugees on board--most of them Rohingyas, a Muslim ethnic-minority persecuted in Myanmar--were guided by people-smugglers. But after their traffickers fled, fearing arrest, they sailed on alone and with no clear destination, prevented from reaching the shores of Thailand and Malaysia by naval patrols. When a small vessel carrying journalists from the BBC and New York Times pulled alongside, hurling bottled water onto the decks, one passenger claimed that ten of their number had died. Their voyage finally ended on May 20th when Indonesian fishermen rescued them. 
The ship was one of many which have drifted in the Strait of Malacca and the Andaman Sea in recent weeks, bearing thousands of people. Some of them are escaping poverty and oppression in their home countries, mainly Myanmar and Bangladesh; a few are victims of kidnappings, their captors intending to demand ransoms for their release. Since the start of May, when a police crackdown in Thailand started to block the land routes over which criminals have long smuggled Rohingyas and other migrants, more than 3,000 of them have scrambled onto beaches in Malaysia and Indonesia. Yet all three countries have turned boats away in sight of shore, at times giving them directions to their neighbour's waters. On May 20th Malaysia and Indonesia at last agreed to stop pushing away boats, but only after much international pressure. It has been a callous and haphazard response from a region that boasts of its deepening integration, and which wants to bolster its standing in the world. 
South-East Asian countries rightly insist that the problem's source, and its only lasting solution, lies in Myanmar. For years it has persecuted its Rohingya minority. The country's government--and, as far as can be gauged, almost all its people--regards Rohingyas as illegal Bengali immigrants; violence against them by other ethnic groups has given officials an excuse to herd some 140,000 of them into rancid refugee camps. In recent years the trafficking networks that sprang up to sneak Rohingyas away from such horrors have also successfully targeted better-off people living on the shores of neighbouring Bangladesh. 
Yet Myanmar's neighbours share considerable blame for the emergency. Only Cambodia, the Philippines and Timor-Leste have signed the UN Convention on Refugees, under which ""pushbacks"" are outlawed. Regional politicians agree they are morally obliged to resupply the boats, and to rescue those whose vessels have capsized. But until this week they said that allowing seaworthy boats to land only encouraged more to attempt the crossing. That reasoning was largely accepted by their electorates, even though it was flawed. Increasing migrant deaths in the Mediterranean have not reduced the numbers of those attempting to get from Africa to Europe. Some of the Asian boat people had taken to flinging themselves into the water at first sight of land, believing (correctly) that coastguards would usually take them to shore when seeing lives at immediate and grave risk. 
Several South-East Asian countries have tolerated--and benefited from--the people-smuggling they decry. For years Thai officials are thought to have quietly allowed refugees discovered within its borders to proceed to Malaysia. That gave the smuggling networks space to flourish, and helped enrich a few corrupt locals (many Thai fishing and seafood businesses have used migrants forced into what amounts to slavery). Malaysians, for their part, have sometimes turned a blind eye to the influx--Rohingyas help make up a shortage of cheap, unskilled labour. 
The crisis has highlighted the woeful inadequacy of regional governance and of its main implementer, the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)--a talking-shop with minuscule resources and a shared belief in the dubious principle of ""non-interference"". The region's leaders promise not to meddle in each other's internal affairs, thus helping Myanmar (which chaired ASEAN last year) escape broad censure for its treatment of Rohingyas. It has also allowed ASEAN leaders to sign flowery declarations--such as a convention in 2012 in support of human rights--without having to fear that their neighbours will actually hold them to account. ASEAN leaders mutter that quiet diplomacy is more likely to lead to reform than public hectoring would. They are sometimes right, but often wrong. 
Since the start of the year ASEAN bigwigs have been talking up how much more closely bound the region is becoming with the formation of the ASEAN Economic Community, a collection of regional trade agreements which are supposed to take effect by the end of 2015. But attempts to co-operate on tricky social and security issues are lagging far behind. ASEAN was sluggish in its response to the devastation wreaked by Typhoon Haiyan, which struck the Philippines in 2013. So far it has bungled again. 
Here be dragons 
Richer countries would be in a better position to criticise if they could set high standards in dealing with their own refugee problems. They do not push boat people back to sea. But Europe's approach in the Mediterranean is clearly inadequate; hundreds might have been saved from shipwrecks in April had it kept up spending on maritime rescue. Australia diverts migrant boats before they reach its waters; on May 17th Tony Abbott, its prime minister, refused to criticise his South-East Asian neighbours. 
It is tempting for ASEAN countries to think that these weak records excuse their own failure. But by swiftly resettling the rescued migrants, and by better handling Myanmar, a region that tires of Western moralising could seize an opportunity to lead. Many South-East Asians see ASEAN as a tool to enrich its elites, not as a bulwark against egregious abuses and suffering. Here is a chance to change their minds.","South - East Asia 's boat people shame the whole region

The country 's government -- and , as far as can be gauged , almost all its people -- regards Rohingyas as illegal Bengali immigrants ; violence against them by other ethnic groups has given officials an excuse to herd some 140,000 of them into rancid refugee camps . In recent years the trafficking networks that sprang up to sneak Rohingyas away from such horrors have also successfully targeted better - off people living on the shores of neighbouring Bangladesh . 
 Yet Myanmar 's neighbours share considerable blame for the emergency . Only Cambodia , the Philippines and Timor - Leste have signed the UN Convention on Refugees , under which "" pushbacks "" are outlawed . Regional politicians agree they are morally obliged to resupply the boats , and to rescue those whose vessels have capsized . But until this week they said that allowing seaworthy boats to land only encouraged more to attempt the crossing . That reasoning was largely accepted by their electorates , even though it was flawed . Increasing migrant deaths in the Mediterranean have not reduced the numbers of those attempting to get from Africa to Europe . Some of the Asian boat people had taken to flinging themselves into the water at first sight of land , believing ( correctly ) that coastguards would usually take them to shore when seeing lives at immediate and grave risk . 
 Several South - East Asian countries have tolerated -- and benefited from -- the people - smuggling they decry . For years Thai officials are thought to have quietly allowed refugees discovered within its borders to proceed to Malaysia . That gave the smuggling networks space to flourish , and helped enrich a few corrupt locals ( many Thai fishing and seafood businesses have used migrants forced into what amounts to slavery ) . Malaysians , for their part , have sometimes turned a blind eye to the influx -- Rohingyas help make up a shortage of cheap , unskilled labour . 
 The crisis has highlighted the woeful inadequacy of regional governance and of its main implementer , the Association of South - East Asian Nations ( ASEAN)--a talking - shop with minuscule resources and a shared belief in the dubious principle of "" non - interference "" . The region 's leaders promise not to meddle in each other 's internal affairs , thus helping Myanmar ( which chaired ASEAN last year ) escape broad censure for its treatment of Rohingyas . It has also allowed ASEAN leaders to sign flowery declarations -- such as a convention in 2012 in support of human rights -- without having to fear that their neighbours will actually hold them to account . ASEAN leaders mutter that quiet diplomacy is more likely to lead to reform than public hectoring would . They are sometimes right , but often wrong . 
 Since the start of the year ASEAN bigwigs have been talking up how much more closely bound the region is becoming with the formation of the ASEAN Economic Community , a collection of regional trade agreements which are supposed to take effect by the end of 2015 . But attempts to co - operate on tricky social and security issues are lagging far behind . ASEAN was sluggish in its response to the devastation wreaked by Typhoon Haiyan , which struck the Philippines in 2013 . So far it has bungled again . 
 Here be dragons 
 Richer countries would be in a better position to criticise if they could set high standards in dealing with their own refugee problems . They do not push boat people back to sea . But Europe 's approach in the Mediterranean is clearly inadequate ; hundreds might have been saved from shipwrecks in April had it kept up spending on maritime rescue . Australia diverts migrant boats before they reach its waters ; on May 17th Tony Abbott's , refused to criticise Tony Abbott's South - East Asian neighbours . 
 It is tempting for ASEAN countries to think that these weak records excuse their own failure . But by swiftly resettling the rescued migrants , and by better handling Myanmar , a region that tires of Western moralising could seize an opportunity to lead . Many South - East Asians see ASEAN as a tool to enrich its elites , not as a bulwark against egregious abuses and suffering . Here is a chance to change their minds .",900,Australia,cb-900-2,IN TERM,True,"Tony Abbott , its prime minister",2,True

ALAMO RANCH, at the edge of San Antonio's outer ring road, is hardly a glamorous place. New strip malls stretch along access roads; neon signs advertise a Walmart, a Target and a Men's Wearhouse. Yet it is here that Richard Cash, a local who runs a party-equipment rental company, is fighting a suburban war. Sitting on the patio of a branch of BJ's, a chain restaurant and bar, he denounces the city above the hum of traffic. ""We moved out here for a reason: we don't want to be part of San Antonio,"" he says. ""We don't want our tax dollars being poured into downtown projects we won't benefit from."" 
Mr Cash is the head of a local committee which is trying to incorporate Alamo Ranch--which sits on San Antonio's border--as its own city, in an attempt to head off a proposed annexation by the city proper. He has little hope of success. But in his battle, he has plenty of allies, including many state politicians. Increasingly, America's biggest divide is not so much between red states and blue states but between cities, suburbs and rural areas. Nowhere is this more clear than in Texas. 
San Antonio, much like Austin, Houston and Dallas (Texas's other big cities), is run by Democrats; Julian Castro, Barack Obama's housing and urban-development secretary, was previously the city's mayor. The state at large, however, is a Republican stronghold: as well as the bulk of the congressional delegation, the GOP controls both houses of the legislature and the governor's mansion. Nationally, Republicans control both houses of 30 states, against a figure of just 11 for Democrats. Yet the biggest city in America with a Republican mayor is San Diego in California. 
In Texas, where power has long been devolved downwards, and government is generally distrusted, this has created a scramble by state politicians to pull power back upwards again. In the latest session of Texas's state legislature, which meets for five months every two years in Austin, a series of bills were proposed to rein in cities: limiting annexation rates, capping taxation powers. Most failed, but on May 18th Greg Abbott, the governor, signed a law to prevent cities from banning fracking. That was inspired by the case of Denton, a university town near Dallas where 60% of voters opted in a referendum last November to outlaw the practice within its city limits. 
Mr Abbott argues that cities are bringing about a ""California-isation"" of Texas. In January he accused them of introducing ""a patchwork quilt of bans and rules and regulations"", which will undermine the low-tax, low-regulation economic model which draws so many people to Texas in the first place. The problem, he argues, is as bad as federal overreach (that too concerns Mr Abbott: in April he ordered the state to ""monitor"" military exercises which some conspiracy theorists believe are a federal plot to conquer the south-west). 
Yet despite these attempts, the reach of Texan cities is actually widening. According to the Census Bureau, five out of ten of the fastest-growing cities in America are in the Lone Star State. Thanks to an unusually permissive annexation law, in Texas cities can chase the sprawl outwards, incorporating neighbouring land: San Antonio is adding 66 square miles (171 square kilometres) to its existing 465 (see map). Its population could increase by 1m from its current 1.4m by 2040. Some rural and suburban residents who thought they had escaped the city are clawed back into it--and often compelled to pay higher property taxes. 
City leaders say this is fair: people who live at the edge of big cities benefit from the urban environment and so they should contribute to it. ""It's annexation that's made Texas cities healthy and grow relative to north-eastern and Midwestern counterparts,"" says Bennett Sandlin, head of the Texas Municipal League, which lobbies for cities. He points to economic failures in places like St Louis and Detroit as evidence for what can happen when a single city government isn't in control. 
But it upsets plenty of Texans such as Mr Cash. ""People don't want to have a city council issue diktats down to them,"" says Jess Fields, a researcher at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a conservative-leaning think-tank. He argues that cities are expanding because they need newer, richer taxpayers to cover their overspending and their hefty municipal debts. A law that would have introduced new restrictions on cities' annexation powers narrowly failed in the state's Senate. 
If Texas genuinely is turning into a new California, Texas's Republicans have a lot more municipal activism to look forward to. There, Los Angeles recently opted to introduce a citywide minimum wage of $15. San Francisco maintains a citywide rent-control scheme. Though they may be controlled by Democrats, Texas's cities are by comparison bastions of free-market enterprise. And confrontation does not always work. California's Republicans spent a lot of energy resisting change--and there are not that many of them left.

WHEN Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi proclaimed the restoration of the Muslim caliphate a year ago this month, the call for Muslims to come to fight for, and build, his Islamic State (IS), was heard not just in the collapsing Arab heartland, but also in Muslim communities as disparate as China, the Philippines and Australia. More than half the world's Muslims live in Asia, so the rise of a violent and swaggeringly self-confident strain of global jihadism is bound to disrupt the region. Pre-existing groups of jihadists have been emboldened by the success of IS in establishing and defending its domain in large parts of Iraq and Syria. Asian governments worry that young people are being radicalised by IS propaganda, encouraged to travel to the caliphate or inspired to make bloody mischief at home. Of the thousands of Asians who have fought with IS, many will return home, bringing with them the ideology, networks and know-how of murderous terrorism. 
The danger is perhaps most acute in Afghanistan and Pakistan, countries already torn by terrorism and insurgency. But there is also cause for alarm in the volatile post-Soviet republics of Central Asia, where political Islam is an alternative to nasty authoritarian regimes, and an estimated 2,000-4,000 people are among the 20,000 foreigners who have joined IS. China has strived in the past few years to root out extremism among members of the mainly Muslim Uighur minority in the vast western region of Xinjiang, and to blame global jihadism. It has estimated that 300 Uighurs have travelled to Iraq and Syria. But China's countermeasures seem only to have sharpened resentment at what Uighurs see as colonial oppression by the Chinese state and its ethnic-Han majority. 
Even in South-East Asia, where the numbers of IS recruits seem quite modest (some 500 Indonesians, 100 Filipinos, 50 Malaysians and a handful of Singaporeans), the question of how to respond to IS has political repercussions. In the Philippines, for example, peace between the government and Muslim rebels on the island of Mindanao is threatened by extremist groups that have pledged fealty to IS. Even in democratic Malaysia the introduction in April of new anti-terrorism legislation, including provisions for detention without trial, has angered not just Islamists but also a range of opposition politicians. Many see it as a pretext to restore powers granted by the colonial-era Internal Security Act, which was at times abused for political ends and was lifted only in 2012. Governments everywhere grapple with an impossible calculation: if they underestimate the threat, they expose their people to terrorist attacks; if they exaggerate it, their heavy-handed reactions may further strengthen the terrorists' cause. 
Concerns about the influence of IS have grown even in peaceful countries far from the main battlefronts. At a regional conference on ""countering violent extremism"" in Sydney this month, Australia's prime minister, Tony Abbott, denounced its ""brazen claim to universal dominion"". He lamented that ""the tentacles of the death cult have extended even here,"" recalling a bloody siege at a cafe in Sydney last December by an apparently deranged gunman with IS sympathies. Several dozen Australians are reported to have joined IS or Jabhat Al-Nusra, a Syrian rival affiliated to al-Qaeda. Controversially, Australia plans to strip citizens with dual nationality who are ""known terrorists"" of their Australian passports. 
A few days before Mr Abbott spoke, Lee Hsien Loong, Singapore's prime minister, had devoted part of his keynote speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual security forum, to the problem of IS. The public talk focused on China's expansion in the South China Sea, but much of the backroom talk was about the gathering jihadist threat. Most striking was Mr Lee's sobering assessment that this was a struggle that would last for generations. Looking forward 50 years, he suggested that jihadist ideology would surely have been seen to fail, or at least to have ""weakened its hold on the imagination of troubled souls"". But he noted that Soviet Communism, ""another historical dead end"", survived for 70 years before it collapsed. And that, for all its pretensions to absolute truth, was not a creed rooted in religion. 
In comfortable, well-off Singapore, Malay Muslims are a largely well-integrated minority. But it was nonetheless a target for Jemaah Islamiah, a regional jihadist group whose spiritual leader, Abu Bakar Basyir, once linked to al-Qaeda, has pledged allegiance to IS. Jemaah Islamiah, guilty of terrorist atrocities in Indonesia, also planned bombings in Singapore shortly after the September 11th attacks in America. And even in Singapore, the internet is producing fanatics. Recently the authorities arrested a 17-year-old, radicalised online, and detained a 19-year-old student who was planning to join IS or, failing that, to assassinate government leaders at home. Singapore knows that it is both a rich country full of attractive targets for terrorists and a ""little red dot"" surrounded by largely Muslim Indonesia and Malaysia. IS has said it wants to establish a wilayat, a province of the caliphate, in South-East Asia. ""Pie in the sky"", scoffed Mr Lee. But he worried that IS could establish a base in some ungoverned space in the region. 
What do they see in IS? 
The difficulty is global: everywhere, efforts to fight extremism make the governments behind them even more of a target. Both Australia and Singapore are contributing to the coalition fighting IS in the Middle East. And, as all over the world, governments are becoming more vigilant at home and stepping up ""deradicalisation"" measures by working with moderate Muslims to counter jihadist propaganda. That is not easy, however. Propaganda--especially the astute use of the internet and social media--is IS's forte. As both Mr Lee and Mr Abbott suggested, the appeal IS holds for ""troubled souls"" is incomprehensible to the leaders of prosperous modern states. And it is hard to marshal good arguments against a point of view you do not begin to understand.","Islamic State prompts alarm and soul - searching across Asia 
 WHEN Abu Bakr al - Baghdadi proclaimed the restoration of the Muslim caliphate a year ago this month , the call for Muslims to come to fight for , and build , his Islamic State ( IS ) , was heard not just in the collapsing Arab heartland , but also in Muslim communities as disparate as China , the Philippines and Australia . More than half the world 's Muslims live in Asia , so the rise of a violent and swaggeringly self - confident strain of global jihadism is bound to disrupt the region . Pre - existing groups of jihadists have been emboldened by the success of IS in establishing and defending its domain in large parts of Iraq and Syria . Asian governments worry that young people are being radicalised by IS propaganda , encouraged to travel to the caliphate or inspired to make bloody mischief at home . Of the thousands of Asians who have fought with IS , many will return home , bringing with them the ideology , networks and know - how of murderous terrorism . 
 The danger is perhaps most acute in Afghanistan and Pakistan , countries already torn by terrorism and insurgency . But there is also cause for alarm in the volatile post - Soviet republics of Central Asia , where political Islam is an alternative to nasty authoritarian regimes , and an estimated 2,000 - 4,000 people are among the 20,000 foreigners who have joined IS . China has strived in the past few years to root out extremism among members of the mainly Muslim Uighur minority in the vast western region of Xinjiang , and to blame global jihadism . It has estimated that 300 Uighurs have travelled to Iraq and Syria . But China 's countermeasures seem only to have sharpened resentment at what Uighurs see as colonial oppression by the Chinese state and its ethnic - Han majority . 
 Even in South - East Asia , where the numbers of IS recruits seem quite modest ( some 500 Indonesians , 100 Filipinos , 50 Malaysians and a handful of Singaporeans ) , the question of how to respond to IS has political repercussions . In the Philippines , for example , peace between the government and Muslim rebels on the island of Mindanao is threatened by extremist groups that have pledged fealty to IS . Even in democratic Malaysia the introduction in April of new anti - terrorism legislation , including provisions for detention without trial , has angered not just Islamists but also a range of opposition politicians . Many see it as a pretext to restore powers granted by the colonial - era Internal Security Act , which was at times abused for political ends and was lifted only in 2012 . Governments everywhere grapple with an impossible calculation : if they underestimate the threat , they expose their people to terrorist attacks ; if they exaggerate it , their heavy - handed reactions may further strengthen the terrorists ' cause . 
 Concerns about the influence of IS have grown even in peaceful countries far from the main battlefronts . At a regional conference on "" countering violent extremism "" in Sydney this month , Tony Abbott's , denounced its "" brazen claim to universal dominion "" . Tony Abbott lamented that "" the tentacles of the death cult have extended even here , "" recalling a bloody siege at a cafe in Sydney last December by an apparently deranged gunman with IS sympathies . Several dozen Australians are reported to have joined IS or Jabhat Al - Nusra , a Syrian rival affiliated to al - Qaeda . Controversially , Australia plans to strip citizens with dual nationality who are "" known terrorists "" of their Australian passports . 
 A few days before Tony Abbott spoke , Lee Hsien Loong , Singapore 's prime minister , had devoted part of his keynote speech at the Shangri - La Dialogue , an annual security forum , to the problem of IS . The public talk focused on China 's expansion in the South China Sea , but much of the backroom talk was about the gathering jihadist threat . Most striking was Mr Lee 's sobering assessment that this was a struggle that would last for generations . Looking forward 50 years , he suggested that jihadist ideology would surely have been seen to fail , or at least to have "" weakened its hold on the imagination of troubled souls "" . But he noted that Soviet Communism , "" another historical dead end "" , survived for 70 years before it collapsed . And that , for all its pretensions to absolute truth , was not a creed rooted in religion .

WHEN big social shifts happen in America, most people outside the corridors of Capitol Hill wonder what the response of the federal institutions will be. Washington's politicos, by contrast, quickly set to thinking up a dozen reasons why fresh legislation should not be passed. Then, with surprising speed, something that hitherto looked impossible becomes the law of the land. The Supreme Court's ruling on gay marriage, on June 26th, is the latest example of this. 
America is a country that changes rapidly, governed by a set of national institutions with a bias towards inertia. A 50-year-old American was born into a world where some states had laws banning her from marrying a black man. Now she finds herself inhabiting one where she is allowed to marry a woman. In 2004 political consultants wondered whether John Kerry's support of same-sex civil unions damaged his chances of becoming president; 11 years later, a rainbow was projected onto the White House to celebrate the court's decision, and some pundits are wondering whether hostility to gay marriage will damage Republican chances in the next presidential election. 
Views on gay marriage have shifted unusually quickly, but that is not an isolated example. In 2002 only 45% of Americans thought that having a baby outside marriage was morally acceptable, according to polling by Gallup. Now 61% do. Stem-cell research, one of the most controversial ethical questions during George W. Bush's presidency, now has the backing of 64% of Americans. On climate change, where America has long been an outlier in the rich world, the country now looks less exceptional: 64% of adults support stricter limits on carbon emissions from power plants, according to polling by Pew, including half of all those who identify themselves as, or say they lean, Republican. 
In another political system, these changes might result in new laws. In America's, which combines the most energetic conservative movement found in any rich country with a proliferation of vetoes over federal legislation, they do not. This leads to a build-up of pressure in the tubes that connect Americans to their government. Increasingly, this pressure finds an escape through the Supreme Court, as the court's most recent term shows. 
In his tenth year as chief justice, John Roberts has presided over an unusually large bundle of important cases. As well as embracing gay marriage, the justices rescued Obamacare from a potentially fatal semantic glitch, rejected a challenge to a lethal-injection drug that seems to result in botched executions, scolded the Environmental Protection Agency for failing to consider costs before regulating power plants, clarified the meaning of racial discrimination under the Fair Housing Act, and allowed Arizonans to take action against partisan gerrymandering. 
And that was just in the last five days of the term. Earlier the justices expanded the rights of pregnant women in the workplace, issued two rulings favourable to Muslims seeking accommodations for their religious views, told the feds to keep their hands off a Californian farmer's raisins, clarified the rules when police stop drivers on the highway and reversed the conviction of a man who had threatened to kill his wife on Facebook. 
The role of a judge, Mr Roberts told senators during his confirmation hearings in 2005, is that of an umpire who calls balls and strikes. That is true, he insisted, despite the public's sense that the justices may be little more than politicians in robes. ""I'm worried about people having that perception, because it's not an accurate one,"" Mr Roberts told an audience at the University of Nebraska last autumn. ""It's not how we do our work, and it's important that we make that as clear as we can to the public. We're not Republicans or Democrats."" 
The Roberts court has indeed shown that the justices are willing to wander out of their ideological comfort zones. In February two liberal justices, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan, found themselves on opposite sides of a dispute over John Yates, a fisherman who tossed overboard some fish he had caught which were smaller than the rules permitted. Justice Ginsburg held that because fish do not qualify as ""tangible objects"" under an evidence-tampering law passed in the wake of the Enron scandal, Mr Yates should not face up to 20 years in prison. Justice Kagan disagreed, writing that ""a 'tangible object' is an object that's tangible"". 
There were other examples of unusual splits. In Zivotofsky v Kerry Clarence Thomas, the court's most conservative justice, voted with Anthony Kennedy and the four liberals to expand presidential power in international diplomacy. In Walker v Sons of Confederate Veterans, Justice Thomas again departed from his fellow conservatives in allowing Texas to refuse to print a licence-plate emblazoned with the Confederate flag. This decision, when combined with the murder of nine blacks in a church in Charleston, South Carolina on June 17th, led to the swift removal of the flag--which had lingered on sentimentally for decades--not only from public places in the South but also from Walmart and eBay. 
For the second time in three years, too, Mr Roberts gravely disappointed conservatives when he voted to save the Affordable Care Act (ACA), Barack Obama's biggest legislative accomplishment and the target of more than 50 repeal attempts in the House of Representatives. The legal nub of the case, King v Burwell, was a mere four words in the 900-page law involving the allocation of tax credits to low- and middle-income Americans. These subsidies, the law reads, are for people buying policies through ""exchanges established by the state"". But 34 states had left the job of setting up these marketplaces to the federal government. Were millions of Americans ineligible for support because their states had not set up their own exchanges? 
No, Mr Roberts wrote. Though the plaintiffs' interpretation of the four words might be the ""most natural"" reading, dropping the subsidies would make health insurance unaffordable for as many as 8m Americans, leading to fewer enrolments and higher premiums. The result, the chief justice wrote, would be a ""death spiral"" that would bring the law to a ""calamitous"" end. ""Congress, he concluded, ""passed the Affordable Care Act to improve health-insurance markets, not to destroy them."" 
Chief Justice Roberts, a natural pragmatist, had no interest in making his court appear overtly partisan. Yet that is how the rulings of this session have been received anyway. Ted Cruz, a former Supreme Court clerk and now a Republican presidential candidate, accused the court of lawless behaviour ""that undermines [...] the very foundations of our representative form of government"". Kevin Williamson, writing in the right-wing National Review, declared that the decisions marked the moment of ""peak leftism"". The greatest outrage, though, came from within the court in Obergefell v Hodges, the landmark 5-4 ruling that opened marriage to gays and lesbians nationwide. ""Allow[ing] the policy question of same-sex marriage to be considered and resolved by a select, patrician, highly unrepresentative panel of nine,"" wrote Antonin Scalia, the court's chief conservative scourge, ""is to violate a principle even more fundamental than no taxation without representation: no social transformation without representation."" 
The public pulse 
Unlike Congress, though, the Supreme Court is obliged to take a position when confronted by social change. Even the dissenting opinions in the gay-marriage decision showed a sensitivity to public opinion which some politicians lack. In his dissent in Obergefell, Chief Justice Roberts spoke directly to Americans, using conciliatory tones. ""If you are among the many Americans--of whatever sexual orientation--who favour expanding same-sex marriage, by all means celebrate today's decision,"" he wrote. ""Celebrate the achievement of a desired goal. Celebrate the opportunity for a new expression of commitment to a partner. Celebrate the availability of new benefits."" Were he a legislator, he went on, he ""would certainly consider"" the benefits of marriage equality ""as a matter of social policy"". As a judge, however, he had to hold that the constitution demands nothing of the sort. ""I have no choice,"" he wrote, almost apologetically, ""but to dissent."" 
The Supreme Court rarely likes to get very far ahead of public opinion. Before issuing rulings giving rise to a major social change like the desegregation of public schools (Brown v Board of Education in 1954), the legalisation of interracial marriage (Loving v Virginia in 1967), or abortion (Roe v Wade in 1973) the justices seem to like at least half of Americans to be on board. In this light, the justices' tones in the Obergefell opinions owe much to the environment into which they were released. 
When he dissented from the pro-gay- rights holding in United States v Windsor in 2013, a ruling striking down the heart of the Defence of Marriage Act, Chief Justice Roberts included no words of support for the gay-rights advocates he was voting against. Same-sex marriage was legal then in only a dozen states. But the tide changed significantly over the ensuing two years. While he was writing his dissent in Obergefell, the number of states with gay nuptials had surged to 37 and popular support for gay marriage had reached 60%. 
Next autumn, two racially charged cases await the justices. In Fisher v University of Texas (II), the court will rehear a challenge from a white woman who says the university violated the 14th Amendment when it rejected her because of race-conscious admissions criteria. And they will consider Evenwel v Abbott, a major case deciding whether Latino votes are ""over-weighted"" in Texan legislative districts. In either case it may become the turn of Democrats to denounce the court for judicial meddling. 
The pattern of Congress leaving the court to rule on social changes that Congress cannot rouse itself to address is troubling for American democracy. But if the alternative is no change--which, given the political polarisation of the country, is highly probable--it is also hard to regret. The danger is that, relieved of responsibility for legislating on some of the most charged social questions, elected politicians are left free to posture without having to face the consequences of their positions, and the polarisation gets worse.","Nine judges are being asked to compensate for political stalemate.

AUSTRALIANS have long viewed the north of their country the way America once regarded its West: as the last frontier. The region of red deserts and steamy coasts above the Tropic of Capricorn sprawls across the states of Queensland and Western Australia and the Northern Territory (NT), a federal domain (see map). It is the size of India, yet its population is tiny. Barely more than 1m of Australia's 23m people live there. But the north is changing. Once a haven for misfits and fortune-seekers, it is now attracting people at a faster rate than the rest of Australia, thanks largely to a boom resulting from the sale of its iron ore, coal and gas to Asia's resource-hungry economies. Tony Abbott, Australia's conservative prime minister, goes so far as to call the region an emerging ""economic powerhouse"". 
On June 18th Mr Abbott's government published a white paper outlining plans for developing northern Australia over the next 20 years. Such attention is long overdue. Six of Australia's top ten trading partners are located in Asia. Darwin, the NT's capital, is closer to some Asian capitals than it is to Canberra, Australia's capital. Yet to succeed, Mr Abbott's scheme must overcome other tyrannies of distance that have crushed earlier dreams to unlock the north: scorched landscapes, few roads and high investment costs. 
The plan drew on proposals by the Institute of Public Affairs, a libertarian think-tank. The institute has promoted its ideas in tandem with a group in Western Australia founded by Gina Rinehart, whose iron-ore wealth from the Pilbara region, in that state's north, has made her Australia's richest person. Both outfits want northern Australia to become a hub for Asian investment. To encourage this, they have pressed the government to make the region a ""special economic zone"". They want it to have lower business and income taxes than the rest of Australia. 
The lobbyists have clout among Australia's political leaders. Five months before he became prime minister in 2013, Mr Abbott told those attending a dinner at the institute, including Mrs Rinehart, that his support for northern Australia's development was tantamount to a ""big fat yes"" to policies ""you urged upon me"". Later in that year's election campaign, Kevin Rudd, the former Labor prime minister, unsuccessfully tried to trump Mr Abbott by promising a 20% business-tax rate for the NT, a third lower than the national rate. 
Now that Mr Abbott has unveiled his plan, the government has dropped the idea of a distinct ""special economic zone"" (a disappointment to China, perhaps, which helped to popularise the term and may have enjoyed the notion of being invited to invest in one set up by a supplicant rich country). Andrew Robb, the trade minister, says officials ""looked closely"" at the idea. But Australia's constitution bans the levying of different levels of federal tax on different states. Instead, there are pledges to invest in infrastructure such as roads and dams (to trap water from monsoon rains). One aim is to boost the population, though the target for as far in the future as 2060 is still only 4m-5m. The government wants to relax visa rules to allow mining companies to recruit more overseas workers, and to abolish caps on seasonal workers from Pacific Island nations and Timor-Leste. 
Potential investors face problems, however. Aboriginal Australians hold or claim much northern land under laws which recognise their traditional links to it. Other swathes of the north, known as pastoral leases, can only be used for livestock farming: a legacy of 19th-century laws aimed at stopping land grabs. The government wants to loosen rules governing both types of land. Mr Robb argues that more ""certainty and flexibility"" on land tenure could help ""woo new investment"". 
But Noel Pearson, an aboriginal elder from north Queensland, worries that such developments could leave indigenous people with ""scraps"". Such views carry weight. Two years ago Woodside, one of Australia's biggest energy producers, ditched plans to build a liquefied natural gas plant in Western Australia after a bitter dispute involving traditional landowners and environmentalists. 
The scheme does have some promise. Northern Australia has already grabbed much of the foreign direct investment in Australia's booming mining business. In 2012 alone there was A$206 billion ($213 billion) of it. China, Australia's biggest trading partner, with which it recently signed a free-trade deal, has welcomed the latest plan. But coaxing post-boom investment in the food and service industries may not be so easy. And China's enthusiasm is not to be counted on. As its economy slows, so too does its demand for Australian minerals. As Saul Eslake, an economist, observes, the north's harsh landscape and remoteness are always likely to triumph over ""emotional appeals"" to the notion of populating vast empty spaces.","Australia wants to turn its most remote region into an Asian investment hub

The institute has promoted its ideas in tandem with a group in Western Australia founded by Gina Rinehart , whose iron - ore wealth from the Pilbara region , in that state 's north , has made her Australia 's richest person . Both outfits want northern Australia to become a hub for Asian investment . To encourage this , they have pressed the government to make the region a "" special economic zone "" . They want it to have lower business and income taxes than the rest of Australia . 
 The lobbyists have clout among Australia 's political leaders . Five months before Tony Abbott became prime minister in 2013 , Tony Abbott told those attending a dinner at the institute , including Mrs Rinehart , that Tony Abbott's support for northern Australia 's development was tantamount to a "" big fat yes "" to policies "" you urged upon Tony Abbott "" . Later in that year 's election campaign , Kevin Rudd , the former Labor prime minister , unsuccessfully tried to trump Tony Abbott by promising a 20 % business - tax rate for the NT , a third lower than the national rate . 
 Now that Tony Abbott has unveiled Tony Abbott's plan , the government has dropped the idea of a distinct "" special economic zone "" ( a disappointment to China , perhaps , which helped to popularise the term and may have enjoyed the notion of being invited to invest in one set up by a supplicant rich country ) . Andrew Robb , the trade minister , says officials "" looked closely "" at the idea . But Australia 's constitution bans the levying of different levels of federal tax on different states . Instead , there are pledges to invest in infrastructure such as roads and dams ( to trap water from monsoon rains ) . One aim is to boost the population , though the target for as far in the future as 2060 is still only 4m-5 m. The government wants to relax visa rules to allow mining companies to recruit more overseas workers , and to abolish caps on seasonal workers from Pacific Island nations and Timor - Leste . 
 Potential investors face problems , however . Aboriginal Australians hold or claim much northern land under laws which recognise their traditional links to it . Other swathes of the north , known as pastoral leases , can only be used for livestock farming : a legacy of 19th - century laws aimed at stopping land grabs . The government wants to loosen rules governing both types of land . Mr Robb argues that more "" certainty and flexibility "" on land tenure could help "" woo new investment "" . 
 But Noel Pearson , an aboriginal elder from north Queensland , worries that such developments could leave indigenous people with "" scraps "" . Such views carry weight . Two years ago Woodside , one of Australia 's biggest energy producers , ditched plans to build a liquefied natural gas plant in Western Australia after a bitter dispute involving traditional landowners and environmentalists . 
 The scheme does have some promise . Northern Australia has already grabbed much of the foreign direct investment in Australia 's booming mining business . In 2012 alone there was A$ 206 billion ( $ 213 billion ) of it . China , Australia 's biggest trading partner , with which it recently signed a free - trade deal , has welcomed the latest plan . But coaxing post - boom investment in the food and service industries may not be so easy . And China 's enthusiasm is not to be counted on . As its economy slows , so too does its demand for Australian minerals . As Saul Eslake , an economist , observes , the north 's harsh landscape and remoteness are always likely to triumph over "" emotional appeals "" to the notion of populating vast empty spaces .",900,Australia,cb-900-2,IN TERM,True,"Tony Abbott , Australia 's conservative prime minister ,",10,True

Mrs Bishop has generated controversy since she entered parliament 28 years ago, grilling senior civil servants with unusual bellicosity over government spending. In 2013 the prime minister argued she would bring ""dignity"" to the post of speaker. Yet in the job Mrs Bishop played the partisan warrior. Ignoring the speaker's supposed independence, she attended meetings of Liberal parliamentarians. Of her 400 ejections of members from the chamber during parliamentary debates, 393 were of opposition Labor Party politicians. 
The travel row erupted with reports on July 15th that Mrs Bishop had spent A$5,227 ($3,800) last November chartering a helicopter to fly from Melbourne to Geelong, two cities little more than an hour's car ride apart; she was attending not parliamentary business but a party fund-raising event. At first Mrs Bishop agreed to repay the money but not to apologise. The outcry, she complained, had ""taken the heat off"" Bill Shorten, the Labor leader. 
A stream of disclosures followed about Mrs Bishop charging taxpayers thousands of dollars for travel to weddings of Liberal colleagues, cultural events and a visit to Europe. Before the Abbott government's first, cost-cutting budget last year the Treasurer, Joe Hockey, lectured Australians about thrift. ""The age of entitlement is over,"" he declared, while ""the age of personal responsibility has begun."" 
Ordinary Australians have little truck with hypocrisy. But, five days into the storm, Mr Abbott said merely that Mrs Bishop was ""on probation"". That was mild rebuke. As opposition leader in 2012 he had demanded that the speaker, Peter Slipper, resign for abusing A$954-worth of taxi charges. Mr Slipper did indeed promptly step down. He was later convicted of dishonesty, but appealed and won. 
Mr Abbott allowed Choppergate to drag on for almost three weeks before Mrs Bishop finally apologised to Australians for ""letting them down"". By then, even the government's strongest supporter, Rupert Murdoch's media empire, was demanding that she go. Indeed on August 1st the Daily Telegraph, a Sydney tabloid owned by Mr Murdoch, published fresh claims that Mrs Bishop had spent A$6,000 to charter an aircraft to another Liberal event. 
The next day Mrs Bishop resigned. Yet the prime minister still seemed intent on shielding her from blame. The problem, he told the press, was ""not any particular individual,"" but rather ""the entitlements system more generally."" Mr Shorten ascribed the problem to ""Mrs Bishop's addiction to privilege"". Yet the Murdoch papers revealed on August 5th that Tony Burke, a fierce Labor critic of Mrs Bishop, himself had claimed almost A$13,000 for a visit to central Australia in his capacity as a minister in the former Labor government, taking his family along. Mr Burke claimed he had travelled ""in accordance with the rules"". Politicians from all parties support a review of politicians' entitlements ordered by Mr Abbott. 
Whoever succeeds Mrs Bishop, Mr Abbott's allowing personal loyalty to Mrs Bishop to override public outrage will focus attention on his management of government. In private senior ministers fume at the damage from Choppergate. Early this year, Mr Abbott survived a bid by some Liberal parliamentarians to open the party's leadership to a ballot. The government faces crucial decisions, especially on economic reform, before an election due in 13 months. Mr Abbott has little room for more mistakes.

MOST playwrights are afraid of silence. Much of life's drama lurks in the gaps between words, but few know how to dramatise this for the stage. To handle silence properly, a writer must have a keen ear for the way people actually talk, with all the stammers, stumbles and speed bumps. It is only when these rhythms are understood that a playwright can convincingly convey what is left unsaid. 
Annie Baker, a rising young writer for the theatre, is well attuned to the ""ums"" and ""whatevers"" of real speech. On the face of it, her plays seem uneventful. They feature ordinary people talking about ordinary things, often at great length and to no great purpose. ""The Flick"", which won the Pulitzer prize in 2014 and is now being restaged at the Barrow Street Theatre in New York, consists of more than three hours of patter and griping among workers at a cinema as they clean between screenings. But the power of Ms Baker's work--and what makes it stand apart--is the way every moment and hesitation feels acutely observed and quietly meaningful. 
This attention to detail has earned her a loyal following. Many have been patiently awaiting the premiere of ""John"", Ms Baker's fifth play, which has just opened at the Signature Theatre. It does not disappoint. Directed by Sam Gold, a regular collaborator (who bagged his first Tony earlier this year), the play follows a young couple from Brooklyn who spend a fraught weekend at a chintzy bed-and-breakfast in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. 
Jenny and Elias (played by Hong Chau and Christopher Abbott) are plainly going through a rough patch. Their alternating tenderness and tetchiness with each other is made slightly absurd by the almost oppressively cosy atmosphere; there are dolls and porcelain figurines everywhere. The inn's owner, an awkwardly cheerful older woman called Mertis (the excellent Georgia Engel), eagerly dotes on her only guests, serving biscuits and non-sequiturs as she hobbles about. 
""John"" is a subtle meditation on faith and love. The play lasts more than three hours, but never drags. Ms Baker keeps things lively with dialogue that is both realistic and unpredictable. Chatter about menstrual cramps or the secret needs of dolls can drift towards big questions about God and conviction. As with her other works, Ms Baker is not in the habit of offering answers. Rather, her gift is for creating characters that feel real enough to care about, who say a great deal when they talk, but reveal even more when they fall silent.

AUSTRALIA and New Zealand have never found it easy to corral Pacific-island leaders into supporting their initiatives. It is getting harder. Pacific politicians are no longer so dependent on aid from their rich neighbours, and they have greater capacity to embarrass them on issues such as climate change, fisheries policy and support for secessionists in West Papua, in eastern Indonesia. These all loomed large at the summit of the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) held in Port Moresby, capital of Papua New Guinea (PNG), from September 7th to 11th. 
It was attended by both Australia's prime minister, Tony Abbott, and New Zealand's, John Key. They were probably relieved not to be joined by Frank Bainimarama, the former military commander who led a coup in Fiji in 2006. Fiji was suspended from the forum in 2009, but readmitted after Mr Bainimarama won a general election last year. Some of his officials attended, but he himself is boycotting PIF meetings until the forum is reformed--and Australia and New Zealand are expelled. Other Pacific nations are less strident. But they too want to reshape the PIF's agenda, particularly on climate change. 
Mr Bainimarama has launched a rival group, the Pacific Island Development Forum, which held its third annual meeting in Fiji from September 2nd to 4th. The resultant communique endorsed the goal of keeping global average temperatures no more than 1.5degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels (the existing goal agreed among developed countries is 2degrees). It is part of a strategy of ""deep decarbonisation"" that Mr Bainimarama hopes to take to the UN's climate-change conference to be held in Paris in December. Tony De Brum, the Marshall Islands' foreign minister, says Australia's proposed 26-28% cut in emissions from 2005 levels is far too low to stop the atoll states from disappearing beneath the waves. He wants much bolder targets. Anote Tong, president of Kiribati, said that island leaders might ask Australia to leave the PIF; or they might stage a walkout if it refuses to sign up to the 1.5degrees target. 
Australia's moral authority in the region has been dented. It has cut its foreign-aid budget and disbanded its specialised aid agency, AusAID, with greater aid emphasis now on Australia's commercial interests. And the shunting of Australia's unwanted refugees to ""Offshore Processing Centres"" on Nauru and in PNG has looked mean-minded, despite sweeteners such as refurbished hospitals, roads and local jobs for the host countries. 
On tiny Nauru, with a population of only 10,000, the refugee centres have supplanted phosphates as the biggest source of earnings. Electoral self-interest means no politician dares oppose the centres. Nauru's politics are troubled. An authoritarian government, led by Baron Waqa, has removed most opposition MPs from parliament. One MP, Roland Kun, has had his passport seized and been prevented from rejoining his family in New Zealand. The Australian government has refrained from criticising its island ally. But, in a rare Pacific-policy split with Australia, New Zealand suspended its aid to Nauru's judicial sector in early September. 
Unlike Nauru, Papua New Guinea, which, with 7.2m people is the largest Pacific Island state, has other sources of foreign exchange, including a $19 billion ExxonMobil liquefied-natural-gas project. But PNG's politicians are more likely to turn on the unpopular detention centre on Manus island. Relations with Australia are often frosty. In July the prime minister, Peter O'Neill, announced a ban on foreign (mostly Australian) consultants. Then PNG stopped Australian vegetable imports. 
New donors, such as Indonesia and, most noticeably, China, are offering money to the island states. So island leaders have greater leeway to pursue independent foreign policies. But that too generates its own challenges. It is harder, for example, for regional groups such as the PIF to adopt a coherent policy towards pro-independence activists in Indonesian-ruled West Papua. Many Melanesians have instinctive sympathy for the freedom-fighters. But they are much less willing to antagonise Indonesia than to tell Australia and New Zealand to mind their own business.

 It was attended by Tony Abbott's . Tony Abbott were probably relieved not to be joined by Frank Bainimarama , the former military commander who led a coup in Fiji in 2006 . Fiji was suspended from the forum in 2009 , but readmitted after Mr Bainimarama won a general election last year . Some of his officials attended , but he himself is boycotting PIF meetings until the forum is reformed -- and Australia and New Zealand are expelled . Other Pacific nations are less strident . But they too want to reshape the PIF 's agenda , particularly on climate change . 
 Mr Bainimarama has launched a rival group , the Pacific Island Development Forum , which held its third annual meeting in Fiji from September 2nd to 4th . The resultant communique endorsed the goal of keeping global average temperatures no more than 1.5degrees Celsius above pre - industrial levels ( the existing goal agreed among developed countries is 2degrees ) . It is part of a strategy of "" deep decarbonisation "" that Mr Bainimarama hopes to take to the UN 's climate - change conference to be held in Paris in December . Tony De Brum , the Marshall Islands ' foreign minister , says Australia 's proposed 26 - 28 % cut in emissions from 2005 levels is far too low to stop the atoll states from disappearing beneath the waves . He wants much bolder targets . Anote Tong , president of Kiribati , said that island leaders might ask Australia to leave the PIF ; or they might stage a walkout if it refuses to sign up to the 1.5degrees target . 
 Australia 's moral authority in the region has been dented . It has cut its foreign - aid budget and disbanded its specialised aid agency , AusAID , with greater aid emphasis now on Australia 's commercial interests . And the shunting of Australia 's unwanted refugees to "" Offshore Processing Centres "" on Nauru and in PNG has looked mean - minded , despite sweeteners such as refurbished hospitals , roads and local jobs for the host countries . 
 On tiny Nauru , with a population of only 10,000 , the refugee centres have supplanted phosphates as the biggest source of earnings . Electoral self - interest means no politician dares oppose the centres . Nauru 's politics are troubled . An authoritarian government , led by Baron Waqa , has removed most opposition MPs from parliament . One MP , Roland Kun , has had his passport seized and been prevented from rejoining his family in New Zealand . The Australian government has refrained from criticising its island ally . But , in a rare Pacific - policy split with Australia , New Zealand suspended its aid to Nauru 's judicial sector in early September . 
 Unlike Nauru , Papua New Guinea , which , with 7.2 m people is the largest Pacific Island state , has other sources of foreign exchange , including a $ 19 billion ExxonMobil liquefied - natural - gas project . But PNG 's politicians are more likely to turn on the unpopular detention centre on Manus island . Relations with Australia are often frosty . In July the prime minister , Peter O'Neill , announced a ban on foreign ( mostly Australian ) consultants . Then PNG stopped Australian vegetable imports . 
 New donors , such as Indonesia and , most noticeably , China , are offering money to the island states . So island leaders have greater leeway to pursue independent foreign policies . But that too generates its own challenges . It is harder , for example , for regional groups such as the PIF to adopt a coherent policy towards pro - independence activists in Indonesian - ruled West Papua . Many Melanesians have instinctive sympathy for the freedom - fighters . But they are much less willing to antagonise Indonesia than to tell Australia and New Zealand to mind their own business .

THAT Australia now has its fourth prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, in little more than two years should be a worry--especially when you consider the manner in which all his predecessors were turfed out. Tony Abbott came to power in a general election in 2013, ending six years of Labor Party dominance, in part by claiming that his (conservative) Liberal-National coalition was above the kind of fratricide that had seen Labor's prime minister, Kevin Rudd, ousted by his rival, Julia Gillard, only for him to get his revenge by re-ousting Ms Gillard when opinion polls turned against Labor. Now Mr Turnbull has done to Mr Abbott what Mr Rudd and Ms Gillard did to each other--only with exceptional cold-bloodedness and guile (see page 52). 
The good news is that Mr Turnbull could prove the most competent leader since John Howard, who served 11 years before his coalition's defeat in an election in 2007. Had Mr Turnbull led the Liberals into the latest general election (he lost the Liberal Party leadership to Mr Abbott by a single vote), The Economist would have endorsed him rather than Mr Rudd, a bright mind but a lousy operator. Having made his money in law and business, Mr Turnbull has solid pro-market credentials. Unlike Mr Abbott, who downplays the risks of climate change, he sets store by using market mechanisms to bring down carbon emissions (per person, Australians are among the world's highest emitters). As a social liberal, he is closer to most Australians than was Mr Abbott, who is opposed to gay marriage. And in foreign policy, he will be less ""Manichean"", as one expert put it: less inclined to see the world--including China's rise--only through the prism of security. 
For the time being the new prime minister is signalling more a change of tone than of policy. He has replaced Mr Abbott's sneering negativism with more hopeful rhetoric--declaring, for instance, that these are ""exciting times"" to be Australian. Above all, he says he will provide competence and leadership at a time when, after more than two decades of unbroken growth, Australia's economy is slowing--crimped, not least, by the slowdown in its largest overseas market, China. Australia needs investment in services and new industries if it is to shift from an over-reliance on exporting iron ore and coal--the hope is that consistent pro-business government will help that where Mr Abbott's repeated U-turns hindered it. But the general election is due in less than a year. Mr Turnbull does not have long to prove that he can lead an effective government. 
Conviction politics 
A natural question to ask is whether the economy can be fixed without also mending a political system that produces so many revolving-door prime ministers. Three-year parliamentary terms are extremely short and would seem an obvious culprit. Yet they used not to prevent strong leaders from emerging--Mr Howard for one. 
Certainly, subsequent leaders--not least Mr Howard's protege, Mr Abbott--have been made of thinner stuff. But that is only part of the answer. The old class-bound lines, along which Liberal and Labor loyalties once ran, have gone. Both parties are now hunting on the same ground, among an urban, educated swing-voting middle class. When confronted by the findings of the latest opinion polls or focus groups, the parties' tendency is to panic; the next election is never far away. 
This is not healthy. Australia should now debate lengthening the parliamentary term. And Mr Turnbull must prove that connecting with the middle ground--which Mr Abbott abandoned--is a better method of governing than jumping at every opinion poll. Australians may even reward him for it.","Malcolm Turnbull ousts Tony Abbott at a critical juncture for the economy . Why so many political murders ?

THE coup's speed stunned everyone. Australia's Liberal Party had always denounced its Labor opponents for ruthlessly tossing their leaders to the sharks as soon as they looked wobbly. Faced with such a threat himself on September 14th Tony Abbott, the then Liberal leader and prime minister, declared: ""We are not the Labor Party."" But within a matter of hours, his party had ditched its high-mindedness and replaced Mr Abbott with Malcolm Turnbull, a former ministerial colleague, as Australia's 29th prime minister. 
Mr Turnbull (pictured) is the fourth occupant of the post in just over two years, a record pace of political change at the top. The former Labor government had ousted Kevin Rudd in 2010 in favour of Julia Gillard, whom Mr Rudd ejected in 2013, only for Australians to elect a conservative Liberal-National coalition under Mr Abbott shortly after. Mr Rudd and Mr Abbott had in common that both led their parties to victory from opposition. Yet that counted for little once opinion polls turned against them, and their colleagues feared being sent back into opposition. 
Australia's leadership convulsions reflect a country in which class identities and political allegiances have become more fluid than ever. No longer assured of support from their old conservative and working-class bases respectively, Liberal and Labor must battle for a shifting middle ground: educated, urban professionals whose votes are up for grabs. Norman Abjorensen of the Australian National University reckons that these ""fluctuations in public opinion and the constant soundings of focus groups"" can doom leaders such as Mr Abbott if they falter. Their fates depend not on the previous election, but on their prospects for the next one. 
Revolving-door prime ministers 
Under Mr Abbott's leadership, the coalition had trailed Labor in opinion polls for more than a year. A poll in early September put Labor eight points ahead, a margin wide enough to crush the government at an election due in just a year. Mr Abbott blamed what he called the changing nature of Australia's politics after his Liberal colleagues overthrew him for Mr Turnbull by 54 votes to 44. ""We have more polls and more commentary than ever before,"" he said. ""Poll-driven panic has produced a revolving-door prime ministership, which can't be good for our country."" 
But that is to ignore the part Mr Abbott's own misjudgments played in his downfall. His politics proved mean-spirited, and he was readier to alarm Australians about security--for instance the threat of militant Islam in their midst--than to develop an inspired economic agenda. 
Growth has slowed to 2%, lower than earlier forecasts and well below Australia's potential. An investment boom in mining, linked to demand from China, Australia's biggest trading partner, has waned. Investment in services, high-end manufacturing and other non-mining ventures must take up the slack. Yet Canberra's political turmoil in recent years, as well Mr Abbott's policy U-turns and gaffes, have sapped business confidence. Voters' trust in the Abbott government never recovered after its first budget in 2014, in which savage spending cuts seemed to fall most heavily on those who could least afford them. Mr Turnbull was scathing, saying Mr Abbott had proved incapable of ""providing the economic confidence that business needs"". 
The new leader, who is 60, had long hankered after the job. Like Mr Abbott, Mr Turnbull comes from a comfortable background in Sydney. He holds socially liberal views, at odds with those of his party's reactionary wing. When Mr Turnbull led the Liberal Party before, during their opposition years, the right wing unseated him in 2009 and installed Mr Abbott, by one vote. As Mr Abbott's fortunes sank, Mr Turnbull seized the chance to reclaim the leadership and persuaded enough of Mr Abbott's supporters to switch sides, if only to save their own seats. 
A recent survey suggested that 41% of Australians wanted Mr Turnbull as Liberal leader, with just 15% preferring Mr Abbott. Mr Turnbull's unflinching character strikes a chord with many. His father raised him after his mother, a writer and academic, left for America when he was a child. In the late 1970s Mr Turnbull was a Rhodes scholar at Oxford, where a don wrote of him that he was ""always going to enter life's rooms without knocking"". Back in Australia he made his name as a lawyer and a fortune as a banker and IT entrepreneur. 
Mr Turnbull earned a reputation for fighting for progressive causes long before he entered parliament 11 years ago. As a lawyer in the late 1980s he successfully challenged a bid by the British government to stop the publication in Australia of a memoir by Peter Wright, a former British intelligence agent. In 1999 Mr Turnbull led the Australian Republican Movement's campaign at a referendum on ditching Australia's ties to the British monarchy. After John Howard, then Liberal prime minister, successfully pushed for a no vote, Mr Turnbull called him ""the prime minister who broke this nation's heart"". 
Now that Mr Turnbull has seized the prime ministership, he must unite his party's conservative and liberal wings. He will not for now try to push the party into enacting two changes he supports: allowing gay marriage and creating a market mechanism to tackle climate change. His main priority is to revive an economy that is running out of puff. 
His first test comes with a by-election on September 19th in Canning, a federal constituency near Perth in the state of Western Australia. A Liberal parliamentarian, whose death precipitated the election, had held the seat with a 12-point margin. Until Mr Turnbull's coup, the election threatened to turn into a rebuke of Mr Abbott. The seat is home to many workers who fly in and out of the mining regions that--until a recent slump in Chinese demand for commodities (see next story)--have helped to underwrite the country's prosperity. The Labor opposition leader, Bill Shorten, played on jitters among Canning's voters about the potential impact of a free-trade agreement that Australia signed in June with China. He claims it could favour workers from China over Australians in big Chinese projects in the country. Mr Turnbull attacked Mr Shorten's ""catastrophically reckless approach"", while describing the deal as ""one of the most important foundations of our prosperity"". He predicted that a change of Liberal leadership ""would improve our prospects in Canning"". 
Mr Turnbull's business background and reforming instincts endear him to business leaders. In his first day in Parliament as prime minister, Mr Turnbull offered a narrative far removed from that of his predecessor. ""These are most exciting times to be an Australian,"" he declared, while calling on the country to be ambitious in seizing economic opportunities. As China slows and drags down demand for the things Australia sells, Mr Turnbull's challenge will be to create a climate of greater certainty for business and investment--and optimism for voters. Joe Hockey seems unlikely to survive as Treasurer. 
Already Labor senses that it faces a more formidable fight at the next election. Yet Mr Turnbull knows as well as any how quickly the ground under Australia's politicians can shift.","Yet another prime minister is removed , and the assassin , Malcolm Turnbull , promises happiness

 A recent survey suggested that 41 % of Australians wanted Mr Turnbull as Liberal leader , with just 15 % preferring Tony Abbott . Mr Turnbull 's unflinching character strikes a chord with many . His father raised him after his mother , a writer and academic , left for America when he was a child . In the late 1970s Mr Turnbull was a Rhodes scholar at Oxford , where a don wrote of him that he was "" always going to enter life 's rooms without knocking "" . Back in Australia he made his name as a lawyer and a fortune as a banker and IT entrepreneur . 
 Mr Turnbull earned a reputation for fighting for progressive causes long before he entered parliament 11 years ago . As a lawyer in the late 1980s he successfully challenged a bid by the British government to stop the publication in Australia of a memoir by Peter Wright , a former British intelligence agent . In 1999 Mr Turnbull led the Australian Republican Movement 's campaign at a referendum on ditching Australia 's ties to the British monarchy . After John Howard , then Liberal prime minister , successfully pushed for a no vote , Mr Turnbull called him "" the prime minister who broke this nation 's heart "" . 
 Now that Mr Turnbull has seized the prime ministership , he must unite his party 's conservative and liberal wings . He will not for now try to push the party into enacting two changes he supports : allowing gay marriage and creating a market mechanism to tackle climate change . His main priority is to revive an economy that is running out of puff . 
 His first test comes with a by - election on September 19th in Canning , a federal constituency near Perth in the state of Western Australia . A Liberal parliamentarian , whose death precipitated the election , had held the seat with a 12 - point margin . Until Mr Turnbull 's coup , the election threatened to turn into a rebuke of Tony Abbott . The seat is home to many workers who fly in and out of the mining regions that -- until a recent slump in Chinese demand for commodities ( see next story)--have helped to underwrite the country 's prosperity . The Labor opposition leader , Bill Shorten , played on jitters among Canning 's voters about the potential impact of a free - trade agreement that Australia signed in June with China . He claims it could favour workers from China over Australians in big Chinese projects in the country . Mr Turnbull attacked Mr Shorten 's "" catastrophically reckless approach "" , while describing the deal as "" one of the most important foundations of our prosperity "" . He predicted that a change of Liberal leadership "" would improve our prospects in Canning "" . 
 Mr Turnbull 's business background and reforming instincts endear him to business leaders . In his first day in Parliament as prime minister , Mr Turnbull offered a narrative far removed from that of his predecessor . "" These are most exciting times to be an Australian , "" he declared , while calling on the country to be ambitious in seizing economic opportunities . As China slows and drags down demand for the things Australia sells , Mr Turnbull 's challenge will be to create a climate of greater certainty for business and investment -- and optimism for voters . Joe Hockey seems unlikely to survive as Treasurer . 
 Already Labor senses that it faces a more formidable fight at the next election . Yet Mr Turnbull knows as well as any how quickly the ground under Australia 's politicians can shift .",900,Australia,cb-900-2,IN TERM,True,"Tony Abbott , the then Liberal leader and prime minister",26,True

IN THE minutes from the Australian central bank's latest meeting, one third of the text was devoted to analysing China's economy and markets. Little wonder. China's seemingly bottomless appetite for steel has sustained Australian growth over the past decade. With Chinese investment now slowing, those fat years are over. This helped to undermine the economic credentials of Tony Abbott, who lost his job as Australia's prime minister on September 14th. 
China's steel consumption is roughly half the global total. It peaked in 2013, and ebbed as the country's frenzied building slowed. Daniel Kang of J.P. Morgan, a bank, forecasts that China's annual demand for steel will continue falling until 2017 and will settle at about 10% below its high-water mark. 
That may not sound like a big drop but it has left Australia with a major hangover. It is the world's biggest exporter of iron ore, the main ingredient in steel, and its miners had assumed that China would sustain its ultra-fast growth. Instead, iron ore prices are nearly two-thirds lower than two years ago. 
Demand for steel in India and South-East Asia has started to improve, but is far from enough to replace the Chinese shortfall. The declining value of Australia's exports has become a drag on growth. As mining companies cut costs and cancel projects, the eventual impact on the economy could be even worse. Adding to the pain, Australia's coal exports to China have also plummeted, hit by China's industrial slowdown and its shift to cleaner energy. 
But compared to other Asian states, Australia is still the lucky country or, better said, the less unlucky one. It has a wide mix of commodities. While Indonesia, for instance, relies on fossil-fuel exports, Australia can turn to milk and meat. The weaker Australian dollar is luring even more Chinese tourists. Moreover, Australian miners have less to fret about than do steelmakers in Japan, India and South Korea. 
The latter not only have little hope of selling steel to China, but must now compete against shiploads of cheap Chinese metal (see chart). With so much excess capacity, China is likely to ship more of the metal abroad this year than Japan, the world's second-biggest producer, could make if its steel mills were running at full capacity. India and South Korea, the world's fourth- and fifth-biggest producers, have imposed anti-dumping duties to repel Chinese imports. 
As steel prices fall, Australia's biggest miners are using their high-quality, low-cost iron ore to take a bigger slice of the global market. For them, it does not matter much who is making the metal, so long as it is still being made.","A wave of cheap Chinese metal exports hits the region

THE bare expanse of Anna Creek cattle station (as Australians call ranches) belies its strategic attraction to investors. Straddling the river plains of the state of South Australia, and reputed to be the world's biggest cattle ranch by area, Anna Creek belongs to an empire of ten stations that Sidney Kidman, the ""cattle king"", started in 1899 (see map). Now, 116 years later, his descendants have put their inheritance on the market. The sale of S. Kidman & Co, due by the end of the year, has touched raw nerves over foreign investment, as Chinese and other overseas contenders circle a company that many Australians associate with their frontier heritage. 
The interest of would-be buyers is understandable. The Kidman herd of almost 200,000 cattle sprawls across a swathe of the outback about three-quarters the size of England, making it Australia's biggest private landholding. Australia is the world's biggest beef exporter after India and Brazil. Rising demand from China and elsewhere in Asia, as Australia's currency falls in value, has helped business boom. Kidman could sell for around A$325m ($228m). 
About half the 12 shortlisted bidders, whose identities have not been revealed, are foreign. Many may be Chinese. Doug Ferguson, a China expert at KPMG, a consulting firm, reckons that about 15 Chinese companies, some government-linked, would be capable of bidding for Kidman. 
Australians are becoming more used to Chinese investment. Four years ago, China ranked ninth by stock of foreign direct investment (America, Britain and Japan, three of Australia's oldest trading partners, top the list). Now Australia's biggest trading partner, China's inward investment has taken off: by 2014 it had moved up to fifth place. Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) says China has become a bigger investor by value than any country, measured by its share of the A$170 billion of proposed investments it examined last year. In the 2013-14 fiscal year, property worth A$12 billion represented China's biggest investment in Australia. 
Agricultural investments of all kinds, however, were just a fraction of that year's inflow: a mere A$32m. Chinese deals to buy farmland have been few and far between. Two years ago Shandong Ruyi, a Chinese textile company, bought most of Australia's biggest cotton farm, Cubbie Station in the state of Queensland. Tianma Bearing Group, another Chinese company, recently paid a reported A$47 million for Wollogorang and Wentworth, two cattle stations in the Northern Territory, where part of the Kidman empire is also located. Now the prospect of Kidman falling into Chinese hands has given extra piquancy to broader Australian anxieties about ""selling the farm"" to foreigners. 
Such anxieties are nothing new. When Tony Abbott, the recently-ejected prime minister, led the conservative Liberal-National coalition to government in 2013, he declared that Australia was ""open for business"". But a few weeks later Joe Hockey, then the treasurer, rejected a bid by Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), an American food-commodities giant, to take over GrainCorp, an Australian counterpart. Mr Hockey said foreign acquisition of ""this key Australian business"" would be against the national interest. He was bowing to pressure from the rural-based National Party, the coalition's junior partner. Similar pressures could come into play over the Kidman sale. The agriculture minister, Barnaby Joyce, who is from the National Party, opposes a ""foreign state-owned enterprise"" taking over Kidman. 
The ranch operator's sale could now be the first big test of Malcolm Turnbull, who deposed Mr Abbott as Liberal leader and prime minister on September 14th. Mr Turnbull is more of a free-market champion than his predecessor. He acknowledges Australia's ""long history of ambivalence to foreign investment"". But he identifies the country's key dilemma: ""resource-rich but capital-poor"". As soon as he took over as prime minister, there was speculation that ADM might make a fresh bid for full ownership of GrainCorp, of which it is already the largest shareholder. 
However, Mr Turnbull is bound by tighter foreign-investment rules that the government introduced under Mr Abbott. They require the FIRB to scrutinise all sales to foreign entities of rural land worth A$15m or more--the limit was previously A$252 million. The new rules will apply to bidders from China, Japan and South Korea, with which Australia recently signed free-trade agreements. But bidders from places like America, New Zealand and Chile, whose free-trade deals pre-dated the changes, can buy land worth more than A$1 billion before they are screened. 
Similar screening discrepancies will apply to bids for agri-businesses other than farms and ranches, such as GrainCorp. Critics charge that such a two-tier approach barely masks a quest to make life harder for investors from Asia. Peter Drysdale, an economist at the Australian National University, says it ""does not make any policy sense"". The FIRB only advises the government on foreign takeovers, but the very fact that a particular deal has fallen under the board's purview risks making it a political hot potato. 
Soaring house prices in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia's two biggest cities, have added to politicians' nervousness about foreign money coming into the country. Without presenting evidence, some press pundits and radio ""shock jocks"" have blamed Chinese investors for forcing Australians out of the market. But non-resident foreign investors are banned from buying houses in Australia. New dwellings are excepted on the ground that such sales help expand the housing stock. 
Some worry that the government risks scaring off foreign investors just when the country needs capital as its economy cools. Fears about foreign takeovers are exaggerated anyway. Australians still entirely own almost 99% of the country's farm businesses, and 90% of its agricultural land. Yet competition can only grow. Mr Ferguson reckons China's pursuit of food security will see a ""bigger shift"" in Chinese offshore farm investment. ""The Chinese have constantly declared they're looking for very large-scale properties,"" he says. ""Kidman is a classic example.""","The prospect of foreign ownership of two giant agri - businesses causes alarm

THE burial was swift. On November 2nd Malcolm Turnbull, Australia's prime minister, announced his government had removed the titles of knight and dame from among the honours that the country bestows. Tony Abbott, his predecessor, had resurrected them--40 years after they had been consigned to history as a quaint relic of Australia's British colonial past. In their latest life, they lasted just 20 months. 
Mr Turnbull unseated Mr Abbott as leader of the conservative Liberal Party, and prime minister, in mid-September, before Mr Abbott had served even a full term. The former prime minister's fondness for British-style gongs played a big part in his downfall. He astonished Australians when he revived them early last year, without consulting his cabinet. In January, on Australia's national holiday, he awarded a knighthood to Prince Philip (pictured), the husband of Australia's head of state, the British queen. The press ridiculed the award as ""Abbott's knightmare"", and accused him of being completely out of touch with Australia's egalitarian ethos. 
Unlike Mr Abbott, Mr Turnbull is a republican (he is also less impulsive: he discussed his plan with the cabinet first). He called the titles ""really anachronistic"" and ""not appropriate"" for Australia. Prince Philip and four other of Mr Abbott's knights and dames, will keep their honours. But the timing of Mr Turnbull's announcement hinted at a disregard for the monarchy. Prince Charles, Prince Philip's son who is next in line as Australia's head of state, is due to visit the country on November 10th with his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall. 
Tim Mayfield, who heads a republican group once led by Mr Turnbull, reckons support for a monarch-free Australia is higher now than it was 16 years ago when 45% of Australians voted in a referendum against keeping the tie with Britain (John Howard, then prime minister, and Mr Abbott's chief mentor, campaigned for the monarchy, ensuring the republicans' defeat.) Mr Mayfield may well be right. Apart from a handful of diehard monarchists, politicians across the spectrum and the media have welcomed Mr Turnbull's move to scrap the awards. 
He has been enjoying a political honeymoon generally. Opinion polls suggest that his steering of the Liberal Party towards the political centre is popular among voters. With a general election due in about a year, Mr Turnbull's conservative enemies within his own party have fallen unusually silent.

The group's barbarity was unrelenting. Gruesome propaganda included the burning alive in a cage of a Jordanian pilot whom IS had captured, the beheading of 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians in Libya and the murder of the 82-year-old head of antiquities at Palmyra, a heritage site in Syria that was looted by IS. 
Western governments felt compelled to counter the threat, especially after IS claimed responsibility for an assault on Paris in which gunmen mowed down people in restaurants and bars and at a rock concert, killing 130 and injuring hundreds. President Francois Hollande declared that France was at war with IS. 
After claiming that a Russian airliner had been bombed by IS affiliates in Egypt, Russia sent fighter jets to Syria, ostensibly to bomb IS. Most of its firepower, however, was directed at other opponents of the Syrian despot, Bashar al-Assad, a client of Vladimir Putin. In California 14 people were killed by a married couple inspired by IS. In December Barack Obama claimed that the American-led coalition was hitting IS hard, curtailing its operations in Iraq and Syria. 
Turkey alsoentered the fray, after a student gathering was bombed in a town near the Syrian border. But Turkey also targeted the Kurdish PKK. Suicide-bombers in Ankara attacked a peace rally that called for an end to Turkey's actions against the Kurds, killing 102 people. The chaos only strengthened the hand of the ruling Justice and Development party, which won an election in November. 
Je suis Charlie 
Other atrocities committed by jihadists included the killing of 148 people at Garissa University in Kenya, which the Shabab in next-door Somalia said it had carried out. A lone gunman slaughtered 38 tourists, most British, on a beach in Tunisia; three months earlier 22 people were killed at a museum in Tunis. In early January gunmen stormed the offices of Charlie Hebdo in Paris, killing 12. That attack prompted millions to protest worldwide in defence of free speech. But in some Muslim countries mass rallies were held denouncing the magazine for publishing cartoons of Muhammad the Prophet. 
Around half of the hundreds of thousands of people who streamed into Europe in the continent's worst refugee crisis since the Balkan wars came from Syria. The image of a three-year-old Syrian boy found drowned on a Turkish beach caused widespread outrage. Several summits were held to try to resolve the crisis. Germany threw open its borders and is on course to accept more than 1m asylum-seekers this year. 
China's stockmarkets plunged during the summer, sending out global ripples. China's ham-fisted attempts to stop the sell-off, such as directing large state investors (""the national team"") to buy shares, did nothing to calm nerves. Nor did a sudden devaluation of the yuan. The whole episode raised perturbing questions about the state of China's slowing economy and the competence of its regulators. 
The total value of announced takeovers in 2015 passed $4.3 trillion, breaking a record set in 2007. Pfizer's $160 billion purchase of Allergan, Dow Chemical's $130 billion merger with DuPont and Anheuser-Busch InBev's $110 billion acquisition of SAB Miller were three of the biggest in history. Other deals included Shell/BG Group ($70 billion), Charter Communications/Time Warner Cable ($55 billion), Anthem/Cigna ($52 billion) and Heinz/Kraft ($50 billion). 
The tech industry passed several milestones. Dell's $67 billion takeover of EMC was the biggest to date. Facebook set a new record when one billion people logged onto the social network in a single day. But there were fears that the heady valuations of many private tech startups, also known as ""unicorns"", might turn out to be another bubble. 
It was a dismal year for Volkswagen. A boardroom spat at the German carmaker led to the resignation of Ferdinand Piech as chairman. VW was then embroiled in crisis in the autumn after admitting it had installed software on diesel cars that cheated emissions tests in America. 
The president of everybody 
VW's wrongdoing came to light because of an American investigation. America also brought another institution based in Europe to task when it laid corruption charges against several officials at FIFA, football's world governing body. Football fans cheered when Sepp Blatter at last stepped down as FIFA's president. 
A UN summit on climate change, held in Paris, produced an agreement that aims to hold the increase in the global average temperature to ""well below 2[degrees]C above pre-industrial levels"", a more ambitious goal than had been expected. It marked an unprecedented political recognition of the risks of global warming, though some greens were sceptical that governments would follow through. 
Gay marriage took two giant steps forward. It became legal everywhere in America when the Supreme Court ruled that the constitution grants an ""equal dignity"" to gay couples. And Ireland became the first country to approve gay marriage by a popular vote. 
Two big elections in Latin America suggested that the continent's ""pink tide"" was turning. In Argentina Mauricio Macri was elected president, beating the candidate favoured by the departing Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner and bringing an end to 12 years of populist rule by the Kirchner family. In Venezuela, voters fed up with years of economic mismanagement rejected the party of President Nicolas Maduro in a parliamentary election. 
A career-defining election 
Britain's general election confounded the pollsters when the Conservative Party, which had governed in coalition with the Liberal Democrats for five years, secured its first overall majority in Parliament since 1992. The Lib Dems were reduced to a handful of MPs, whereas nationalists won all but three seats in Scotland. The opposition Labour Party went into self-destruct mode after the election by choosing Jeremy Corbyn, a leftist, as its new leader. 
The polls also got it wrong in Canada, where the Conservative Party was chucked out of office and a new Liberal government, headed by Justin Trudeau, was voted in. In Israel Binyamin Netanyahu wrong-footed the pundits when he was returned to power as prime minister. The Law and Justice Party, a group of xenophobic populists and conspiracy theorists, won two elections in Poland. 
Nigeria elected a new president, Muhammadu Buhari, who defeated an incompetent incumbent, Goodluck Jonathan. Malcolm Turnbull became Australia's fourth prime minister in five years, when Tony Abbott was ousted by his Liberal Party. 
An election in January brought the far-left Syriza party to power in Greece. It went on to win a referendum in July that rejected austerity imposed by the IMF and EU. But with markets jittery, and trading on the Athens stock exchange suspended for five weeks, Alexis Tsipras, the prime minister, was eventually forced to agree to another bail-out, much to the disgust of his more radical colleagues. Weary Greeks trudged to the polls for a third time in September and re-elected Mr Tsipras. With the euro zone still in the doldrums, the European Central Bank introduced a huge quantitative-easing programme in January. 
After years of talks, Iran and six world powers reached a deal on Iran's nuclear programme. Some hailed it as a chance for Iran to come out of the cold. Others, notably Israel, said the deal was a mistake that would allow Iran to develop nuclear weapons and throw its weight around. 
Dilma Rousseff had a terrible start to her second term as Brazil's president. A corruption scandal involving Petrobras, a state-controlled oil firm, ensnared members of her Workers' Party. The opposition threatened to impeach her because of allegedly illegal funding arrangements for the government. The economy shrank by 4.5% in the third quarter. 
Russia's economy stumbled. The IMF expects Russian GDP to contract by 3.8% this year and 0.6% in 2016. The country has been hammered by falling oil prices. Brent crude started the year trading at just under $60 a barrel; it is now below $38. Russia has also been hurt by sanctions in response to its military meddling in eastern Ukraine, though the fighting eased after a ceasefire was signed in February. 
Nepal was struck by an earthquake of magnitude 7.8 in April, the worst in the Himalayan country in 80 years. The death toll of 9,000 was the highest from a natural disaster since the earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan in 2011. 
Myanmar held its first freely contested election since 1990. The National League for Democracy, headed by Aung San Suu Kyi, trounced the party of the ruling junta. Cuba and the United States restored full diplomatic relations, which had been put in the deep freeze during the cold war. Travel restrictions were eased. America hopes its engagement with the Castro regime will push the island towards democracy. 
He'd like to build a great wall 
America's presidential candidates started their campaigns. Hillary Clinton wobbled under pressure about her use of an insecure private server for official e-mail, but remains the Democratic front-runner. The Republican establishment was unpleasantly surprised when D onald Trump soared into the lead in the party's race, despite badmouthing women, Mexicans, Muslims, etc. The primaries start in February. Paul Ryan became (somewhat reluctantly) Speaker of the House following the defenestration of John Boehner. 
America suffered several mass shootings. In one, inCharleston, South Carolina, nine people at a black church were gunned down by a white supremacist. Elsewhere the police were berated for their excessive use of force. The worst riots in Baltimore since the 1960s were triggered by the death of a black man in police custody. 
The aviation industry introduced rules ensuring at least two crew members remain in the cockpit during a flight, after a suicidal co-pilot deliberately crashed a German airliner into the French Alps, killing all 150 people on board. 
After a nine-and-a-half-year wait, the New Horizons space probe whizzed past Pluto at 14km per second (31,000mph). It took remarkable pictures that are only now filtering back to Earth, such as the ice-covered al-Idrisi mountains. 
Social media roared with indignation when Cecil the Lion was killed in a Zimbabwean national park by a dentist from Minnesota. Although the dentist had a permit, close to 1.5m people have signed a petition calling for him to face justice without anaesthetic.","Islamic State extended its bloody reach far beyond its base in Iraq and Syria . The group 's barbarity was unrelenting . Gruesome propaganda included the burning alive in a cage of a Jordanian pilot whom IS had captured , the beheading of 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians in Libya and the murder of the 82 - year - old head of antiquities at Palmyra , a heritage site in Syria that was looted by IS . 
 Western governments felt compelled to counter the threat , especially after IS claimed responsibility for an assault on Paris in which gunmen mowed down people in restaurants and bars and at a rock concert , killing 130 and injuring hundreds . President Francois Hollande declared that France was at war with IS . 
 After claiming that a Russian airliner had been bombed by IS affiliates in Egypt , Russia sent fighter jets to Syria , ostensibly to bomb IS . Most of its firepower , however , was directed at other opponents of the Syrian despot , Bashar al - Assad , a client of Vladimir Putin . In California 14 people were killed by a married couple inspired by IS . In December Barack Obama claimed that the American - led coalition was hitting IS hard , curtailing its operations in Iraq and Syria . 
 Turkey alsoentered the fray , after a student gathering was bombed in a town near the Syrian border . But Turkey also targeted the Kurdish PKK . Suicide - bombers in Ankara attacked a peace rally that called for an end to Turkey 's actions against the Kurds , killing 102 people . The chaos only strengthened the hand of the ruling Justice and Development party , which won an election in November . 
 Je suis Charlie 
 Other atrocities committed by jihadists included the killing of 148 people at Garissa University in Kenya , which the Shabab in next - door Somalia said it had carried out . A lone gunman slaughtered 38 tourists , most British , on a beach in Tunisia ; three months earlier 22 people were killed at a museum in Tunis . In early January gunmen stormed the offices of Charlie Hebdo in Paris , killing 12 . That attack prompted millions to protest worldwide in defence of free speech . But in some Muslim countries mass rallies were held denouncing the magazine for publishing cartoons of Muhammad the Prophet . 
 Around half of the hundreds of thousands of people who streamed into Europe in the continent 's worst refugee crisis since the Balkan wars came from Syria . The image of a three - year - old Syrian boy found drowned on a Turkish beach caused widespread outrage . Several summits were held to try to resolve the crisis . Germany threw open its borders and is on course to accept more than 1 m asylum - seekers this year . 
 China 's stockmarkets plunged during the summer , sending out global ripples . China 's ham - fisted attempts to stop the sell - off , such as directing large state investors ( "" the national team "" ) to buy shares , did nothing to calm nerves . Nor did a sudden devaluation of the yuan . The whole episode raised perturbing questions about the state of China 's slowing economy and the competence of its regulators . 
 The total value of announced takeovers in 2015 passed $ 4.3 trillion , breaking a record set in 2007 . Pfizer 's $ 160 billion purchase of Allergan , Dow Chemical 's $ 130 billion merger with DuPont and Anheuser - Busch InBev 's $ 110 billion acquisition of SAB Miller were three of the biggest in history . Other deals included Shell / BG Group ( $ 70 billion ) , Charter Communications / Time Warner Cable ( $ 55 billion ) , Anthem / Cigna ( $ 52 billion ) and Heinz / Kraft ( $ 50 billion ) . 
 The tech industry passed several milestones . Dell 's $ 67 billion takeover of EMC was the biggest to date . Facebook set a new record when one billion people logged onto the social network in a single day . But there were fears that the heady valuations of many private tech startups , also known as "" unicorns "" , might turn out to be another bubble . 
 It was a dismal year for Volkswagen . A boardroom spat at the German carmaker led to the resignation of Ferdinand Piech as chairman . VW was then embroiled in crisis in the autumn after admitting it had installed software on diesel cars that cheated emissions tests in America . 
 The president of everybody 
 VW 's wrongdoing came to light because of an American investigation . America also brought another institution based in Europe to task when it laid corruption charges against several officials at FIFA , football 's world governing body . Football fans cheered when Sepp Blatter at last stepped down as FIFA 's president . 
 A UN summit on climate change , held in Paris , produced an agreement that aims to hold the increase in the global average temperature to "" well below 2[degrees]C above pre - industrial levels "" , a more ambitious goal than had been expected . It marked an unprecedented political recognition of the risks of global warming , though some greens were sceptical that governments would follow through . 
 Gay marriage took two giant steps forward . It became legal everywhere in America when the Supreme Court ruled that the constitution grants an "" equal dignity "" to gay couples . And Ireland became the first country to approve gay marriage by a popular vote . 
 Two big elections in Latin America suggested that the continent 's "" pink tide "" was turning . In Argentina Mauricio Macri was elected president , beating the candidate favoured by the departing Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner and bringing an end to 12 years of populist rule by the Kirchner family . In Venezuela , voters fed up with years of economic mismanagement rejected the party of President Nicolas Maduro in a parliamentary election . 
 A career - defining election 
 Britain 's general election confounded the pollsters when the Conservative Party , which had governed in coalition with the Liberal Democrats for five years , secured its first overall majority in Parliament since 1992 . The Lib Dems were reduced to a handful of MPs , whereas nationalists won all but three seats in Scotland . The opposition Labour Party went into self - destruct mode after the election by choosing Jeremy Corbyn , a leftist , as its new leader . 
 The polls also got it wrong in Canada , where the Conservative Party was chucked out of office and a new Liberal government , headed by Justin Trudeau , was voted in . In Israel Binyamin Netanyahu wrong - footed the pundits when he was returned to power as prime minister . The Law and Justice Party , a group of xenophobic populists and conspiracy theorists , won two elections in Poland . 
 Nigeria elected a new president , Muhammadu Buhari , who defeated an incompetent incumbent , Goodluck Jonathan . Malcolm Turnbull became Australia 's fourth prime minister in five years , when Tony Abbott was ousted by Tony Abbott's Liberal Party . 
 An election in January brought the far - left Syriza party to power in Greece . It went on to win a referendum in July that rejected austerity imposed by the IMF and EU . But with markets jittery , and trading on the Athens stock exchange suspended for five weeks , Alexis Tsipras , the prime minister , was eventually forced to agree to another bail - out , much to the disgust of his more radical colleagues . Weary Greeks trudged to the polls for a third time in September and re - elected Mr Tsipras . With the euro zone still in the doldrums , the European Central Bank introduced a huge quantitative - easing programme in January . 
 After years of talks , Iran and six world powers reached a deal on Iran 's nuclear programme . Some hailed it as a chance for Iran to come out of the cold . Others , notably Israel , said the deal was a mistake that would allow Iran to develop nuclear weapons and throw its weight around .

WHEN people call Australia ""The Lucky Country"", they often do not realise that Donald Horne, the writer who coined that phrase in a book of the same name in 1964, meant it as a criticism. ""Australia is a lucky country run mainly by second-rate people who share its luck,"" he wrote. ""It lives on other people's ideas..."" Horne intended the phrase as a warning to Australians, and a plea for more curiosity from its leaders. 
The country's good fortune has long rested on wealth from its mineral resources and farmland. Now, however, with the prices of the commodities it exports hitting rock-bottom, Australians are beginning to realise that more must be done to encourage the formation of innovative businesses. Instead of living on other people's ideas, in other words, it needs to generate its own. 
Among Australia's 2.6m registered businesses, the survival rate compares well with America's and Canada's, and is better than New Zealand's. But a study published last month by the government's Productivity Commission found that few young Australians start their own firms; that only about 0.5% of newly formed businesses are startups as commonly understood (innovative, ambitious and with high growth potential); and that only 1-2% of existing businesses can be described as innovating. This puts Australia on a par with Canada, say, but behind America and Britain. The commission concluded that one reason why Australia lags is that entrepreneurs need ""other entrepreneurs nearby to connect and work with."" 
Fortunately, Australia now has both a shining example of a tech startup becoming a global success, and a former tech entrepreneur as prime minister. Atlassian, a software firm whose products are used by developers and project managers, listed on the NASDAQ exchange in America last month, making its founders, Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes, Australia's first tech billionaires. And in September Malcolm Turnbull, a lawyer and investor turned politician, unseated Tony Abbott as prime minister and leader of the Liberal Party. In the 1990s Mr Turnbull had made a fortune investing in OzEmail, an Australian internet-service provider. 
Atlassian's blunt slogan befits its Australian roots: ""Open company, no bullshit"". Though it has offices in San Francisco, its headquarters remain in Sydney. Its founders, two university friends, started it in 2002 with a A$10,000 (then $5,400) credit-card loan. Fourteen years later, Atlassian's customers include NASA, Netflix and Facebook and the company is valued at $5.6 billion. ""When we began, there was no startup culture in Australia to follow,"" says Mr Farquhar. ""The attitude, fear of failure, was a problem."" Some say it still is. 
Three days before Atlassian's listing, Mr Turnbull gave a speech that Australian business leaders hailed as a welcome change in official attitudes to promoting innovation. Mr Abbott had cut a backward-looking figure, stopping public funding for wind energy and describing coal as ""good for humanity"". Mr Turnbull called for an ""ideas boom"" to replace mining booms as the country's new growth source, and told Australians they were falling behind most other rich countries in turning their ideas into commercial ventures. He promised about A$1 billion ($720m) in incentives, including tax breaks for investors in startups and venture-capital partnerships. 
Mr Turnbull's pitch to brand himself as the leader of the future, and to get his compatriots to rethink their ""Lucky Country"" attitudes, may take more than tax breaks. To begin to create the sort of community of entrepreneurs and innovators the Productivity Commission called for, Atlassian tried to buy a 19th-century former railway workshop near Sydney's business district. In November, however, the New South Wales state government sold the site instead to a consortium led by Mirvac, a property company. 
Mirvac plans to use much of the site for new offices for the Commonwealth Bank, though it will convert a former locomotive shed into spaces for tech firms and other startups. Even so, Mr Farquhar laments the sale as a lost opportunity to build a larger tech ecosystem that could help spawn more companies like his. Australia, he says, must decide if it wants to be a software producer for the world or a consumer, ""missing this whole revolution and left wondering how we are going to pay for it"". 
Mr Turnbull is putting his faith in a strengthening of links between science and business. He has restored a A$111m budget cut that Mr Abbott made to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), Australia's chief science agency, the outfit that invented the technology behind Wi-Fi. 
Larry Marshall, the CSIRO's head, was struck by Australia's somewhat timid approach to business risk when he returned to his home country in 2015 after working as an entrepreneur for 26 years in Silicon Valley. He suggests would-be tech pioneers could find a model in Australia's ""incredibly risk-tolerant"" frontier economy. Facing enormous distances and tough terrain, miners and farmers have survived only by innovating. The CSIRO has, for instance, collaborated with BHP Billiton, Newcrest Mining and others on better ways to drill ores, detect their grades and raise productivity. Cotton farmers now mainly use varieties the CSIRO has developed, which need less water and pesticides to deliver high yields. The challenge, Mr Marshall argues, is to channel the old economy's risk-taking into new industries in which Australia has a good chance to excel: high-value food and biotechnology. 
Some are already following in Atlassian's wake. Alec Lynch and Adam Arbolino launched DesignCrowd in Sydney eight years ago after an earlier startup failed. Undeterred, Mr Lynch saw a chance to change the ""slow, risky and expensive"" way people procure projects from local graphic designers. DesignCrowd lets customers set budgets and receive ideas from designers around the world. After self-funding at first, capital came in from local angel investors and Starfish Ventures, a Melbourne venture-capital firm. DesignCrowd now has revenues of almost A$20m a year, four-fifths from outside Australia, and has opened offices in San Francisco and Manila. 
Mr Lynch foresees a ""mini startup boom"" emerging in Australia. And he is optimistic that the interventions of the tech-friendly prime minister can only help Australia go from being the Lucky Country to one that makes its own luck.","An entrepreneurial prime minister calls for a culture of innovation

RIGHT after Malcolm Turnbull defenestrated his Liberal Party boss last September, Australia's new leader, the fourth prime minister in three years, promised ""substantial change"" and a ""different style of leadership"" to that of Tony Abbott, his ousted predecessor. In place of the division and dysfunction of Mr Abbott's time as prime minister, Mr Turnbull would be a unifying force, promoting sound policy while dragging politics back to the centre ground. After Mr Abbott's rightist demagoguery, Mr Turnbull would lead through ""advocacy, not slogans"". 
Australians cheered, and the approval ratings of the government that the (conservative) Liberals lead in coalition with the smaller National Party leapt. Mr Turnbull talked of a new dawn. Yet until recently the sun has shone upon the not much new. Mr Turnbull has struggled to assert his authority and carry out his promises. 
One problem lies in the Senate, where eight senators representing tiny parties, including the Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party (mission: to safeguard people's right ""to modify and restore vehicles based upon their own freedom of expression""), hold the balance of power. Another is that the Liberal Party's rifts remained unhealed, with Mr Abbott and allies continuing to snipe from the backbenches. 
Mr Turnbull, a former investment banker and businessman, has made a few policy strokes. For instance, he wants legislation to curb anti-competitive business conduct, calling it a ""long overdue reform"", a pointed swipe at Mr Abbott, who avoided the issue. But his promised plans to reform taxes remain confused. At first, his government signalled raising the goods and services (consumption) tax from its present rate of 10%, and lowering income taxes. It then seemed to drop both ideas. Mr Turnbull now says his tax plans will be revealed in the government's forthcoming budget. 
Meanwhile, despite being a social liberal, he has pulled his punches on issues he had hitherto promoted, including gay marriage, which two-thirds of Australians support. Mr Turnbull favoured a simple parliamentary vote on same-sex unions. But now he has stuck to Mr Abbott's proposal of a plebiscite to gauge public opinion, and to hold it after the next election. One estimate puts the cost at A$525m ($399m). 
He is paying the price for apparent drift. An opinion poll on March 21st gave the government just a two-point lead over the opposition Labor Party. As for Mr Turnbull's own approval as prime minister, it has sunk to 39%, from 60% in November. His lead as preferred prime minister over the leader of the Labor Party, Bill Shorten, has also narrowed. 
Yet in the past few days Mr Turnbull has embarked on a series of canny steps designed to break the Senate logjam, set his stamp on his own party and keep the opposition off balance. On March 18th he won approval from Parliament to simplify the convoluted system of proportional representation under which Australians elect the Senate. The power of independents and so-called micro-parties has grown. They have learnt to use vote-swapping deals at elections to increase their numbers in the Senate. There they have blocked government legislation they dislike. But now the prime minister has won support from the Australian Greens, with ten senators, to push through changes that a parliamentary committee recommended two years ago. Rather than being bound in Senate elections by second-preference votes that parties allocate, voters will now be free to specify their own order of voting. 
Mr Turnbull called that and related changes a ""great day for democracy"", by which he really meant for the bigger parties, since smaller ones will struggle in future to muster enough votes to qualify for a Senate seat. Two micro-party senators have launched a High Court appeal against the changes, but Mr Turnbull sounds confident that it will fail. 
Now to the polls 
Soon after Parliament voted on the Senate changes, it adjourned. It was due to return for the government to present its budget on May 10th, ahead of an election that was widely expected for September. Yet Mr Turnbull's next move, on March 21st, suggested that the campaign has begun already. The prime minister called a press conference to declare that he would recall Parliament three weeks early, in order, he said, to consider legislation to police the building industry and the unions that play a powerful part in it. (The industry harbours two-thirds of Australia's industrial disputes.) He wants to re-establish the Australian Building and Construction Commission that the previous Labor government abolished. Last year in the Senate, Labor, the Australian Greens and independents defeated a move by the Abbott government to bring the commission back. A second Senate defeat would give Mr Turnbull a constitutional trigger for a rare ""double dissolution"" of both houses of Parliament and an election, on July 2nd. 
The timing of Mr Turnbull's move took nearly everyone by surprise, as did his September coup against Mr Abbott. In the House of Representatives, Mr Shorten declared that it was a mark of a government in ""full panic mode"". But the prime minister will claim the high ground by accusing Labor of being beholden to unions. As for the Senate, the new voting rules give him a better chance than before of winning control of the chamber. 
Still, it all remains a gamble for Mr Turnbull. The unresolved divisions in his party are just one symptom of what Stephen Loosley, a former Labor senator, decries as the ""indulgent politics"" of both sides. And should the Senate reforms work his way, then, for the second time, Mr Turnbull will need to convince Australians that he is the one to change the political culture.","The prime minister threatens an early election in a bid to stamp his authority

On March 18th he won approval from Parliament to simplify the convoluted system of proportional representation under which Australians elect the Senate . The power of independents and so - called micro - parties has grown . They have learnt to use vote - swapping deals at elections to increase their numbers in the Senate . There they have blocked government legislation they dislike . But now the prime minister has won support from the Australian Greens , with ten senators , to push through changes that a parliamentary committee recommended two years ago . Rather than being bound in Senate elections by second - preference votes that parties allocate , voters will now be free to specify their own order of voting . 
 Mr Turnbull called that and related changes a "" great day for democracy "" , by which he really meant for the bigger parties , since smaller ones will struggle in future to muster enough votes to qualify for a Senate seat . Two micro - party senators have launched a High Court appeal against the changes , but Mr Turnbull sounds confident that it will fail . 
 Now to the polls 
 Soon after Parliament voted on the Senate changes , it adjourned . It was due to return for the government to present its budget on May 10th , ahead of an election that was widely expected for September . Yet Mr Turnbull 's next move , on March 21st , suggested that the campaign has begun already . The prime minister called a press conference to declare that he would recall Parliament three weeks early , in order , he said , to consider legislation to police the building industry and the unions that play a powerful part in it . ( The industry harbours two - thirds of Australia 's industrial disputes . ) He wants to re - establish the Australian Building and Construction Commission that the previous Labor government abolished . Last year in the Senate , Labor , the Australian Greens and independents defeated a move by the Tony Abbott government to bring the commission back . A second Senate defeat would give Mr Turnbull a constitutional trigger for a rare "" double dissolution "" of both houses of Parliament and an election , on July 2nd . 
 The timing of Mr Turnbull 's move took nearly everyone by surprise , as did his September coup against Tony Abbott . In the House of Representatives , Mr Shorten declared that it was a mark of a government in "" full panic mode "" . But the prime minister will claim the high ground by accusing Labor of being beholden to unions . As for the Senate , the new voting rules give him a better chance than before of winning control of the chamber . 
 Still , it all remains a gamble for Mr Turnbull . The unresolved divisions in his party are just one symptom of what Stephen Loosley , a former Labor senator , decries as the "" indulgent politics "" of both sides . And should the Senate reforms work his way , then , for the second time , Mr Turnbull will need to convince Australians that he is the one to change the political culture .",900,Australia,cb-900-2,POST TERM,True,"Tony Abbott , his ousted predecessor",8,True

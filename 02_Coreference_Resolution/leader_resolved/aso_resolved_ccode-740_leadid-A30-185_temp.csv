AFTER months of rumour and machination, Yasuo Fukuda, Japan's prime minister, finally reshuffled his cabinet on August 1st, replacing 13 of the 17 ministers. The new government brings in some heavyweights. But it faces irreconcilable goals. One is to push through reforms that require big political battles. The other is to polish the image of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) for a general election which must be called by September 2009. 
The new government is split over these goals. The linchpin of the team is Taro Aso, a charismatic former foreign minister who becomes secretary-general of the LDP. He wants to splash money about. The economy may well be in recession: production, exports, wages and profits are all down. But Japan has the biggest debt-to-GDP ratio of any rich country (180% in 2007) and has promised that the budget will be in surplus by 2011, a test of probity. Mr Aso wonders aloud whether to push back that date.
But Mr Fukuda's new economic and finance ministers, Kaoru Yosano and Bunmei Ibuki, are fiscal hawks who want to stick to the target. Instead of spending more overall, they want to reallocate money that is now being wasted. Their target: the transport and construction ministry, home of pork-barrel spending. Its new minister, Sadakazu Tanigaki, is a former finance minister with the clout to prune the extravagance.
As Mr Fukuda tries to settle tensions within his team over spending plans, he must also prepare for a new session of the Diet (parliament). The going will not be easy. He has promised to set up a consumer-protection agency, improve health care and put receipts from the petroleum tax into the general account (where they can be used for anything) rather than keep them earmarked for road construction (ie, pork). He even wants to make permanent Japan's naval contribution to the international effort in Afghanistan--a controversial issue. 
Mr Fukuda's plans seem politically shrewd. He hopes an economic-stimulus package will stave off criticism that he is insensitive to the plight of ordinary Japanese. Through his assorted policy proposals, he aims to steal the mantle of reform from the DPJ, which has its own leadership election in September. But it will all require deft handling. If he stumbles, Mr Aso is waiting in the wings.","A new cabinet is torn between governing and preparing for the polls

AS YASUO FUKUDA walked from the stage this week, his colleagues angrily recalled why they had propelled him into the country's top job in the first place. It was to avoid a repeat of their humiliation last autumn at the hands of his younger predecessor, Shinzo Abe, who had shuffled his cabinet in the face of low popularity ratings, opened a special session of the Diet (parliament), and then abruptly resigned after a year in office. In an echo of that disaster, Mr Fukuda, with abysmal ratings of his own, also shuffled his cabinet, in early August. He had laid out his legislative agenda for an autumn special session. And then, on September 1st, he announced his resignation. If, as expected, he steps down on September 24th, he will have served almost exactly as long as Mr Abe.
For a man who agonised over choices, it was the most abrupt decision of the 72-year-old's political career (he did not even tell his wife). Mr Fukuda said he did not want to create a ""political vacuum"", and at least he moved before the special session had begun. Still, his shocked colleagues are bitter. The public's disdain for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is presumably now deeper. Meanwhile, the opposition camp is electrified, sensing a chance to end the half-century-long LDP shogunate. 
History may be kinder than his colleagues are to Mr Fukuda, who had a nearly impossible job as prime minister in a hung parliament--the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) has controlled the upper house since July 2007. Even more thankless, he led a party whose disagreements had broken out into the open after a charismatic reformer, Junichiro Koizumi, was succeeded by the disastrous Mr Abe. 
In his pronouncements, Mr Fukuda showed a keen sense of how Japan needed to tackle the burdens of an ageing population and mountainous national debt. He challenged his party's own pork-barrel interests, particularly the road-construction lobby, which not even Mr Koizumi defeated. In foreign matters he kept relations with America from fraying, by using the ruling coalition's supermajority to ram through legislation allowing Japan's navy to refuel ships in the Indian Ocean in support of efforts in Afghanistan. And he deepened Mr Abe's initiatives to warm Japan's ties with neighbouring China and South Korea. But there was no denying it: Mr Fukuda's leadership lacked even a smidgen of colour; the one thing he was not, as he admitted this week, was popular.
Had the cabinet shuffle offered a lasting bounce in the polls, Mr Fukuda might have struggled on for longer. Yet Koizumi-style reformists such as Hidenao Nakagawa were excluded from the new cabinet. Meanwhile Kaoru Yosano, the new economy minister, who has a clear sense of what needs to be done to overhaul the country's finances, was ordered to cobble together a fiscal-stimulus package in response to panicky and somewhat overblown fears that the economy, after six years of growth, was heading for a deep recession again (see page
).
Much of the pressure for the stimulus came from the LDP's coalition partner, New Komeito, a Buddhist-linked party. It has had little influence in government affairs, but with the LDP in disarray it is making its presence felt. Many New Komeito members are pacifists, and it pressed the government to shorten the coming Diet session, meaning it would not have time to use its supermajority to renew the Indian Ocean mission. More than anything, this may have tipped Mr Fukuda into resigning. 
The man who negotiated with New Komeito over the truncation of the Diet session and, unwittingly or not, thus helped undermine Mr Fukuda, was Taro Aso, the LDP's secretary-general. After a strong showing behind Mr Fukuda in the last leadership election, he is now the clear favourite to take over as party president and prime minister after the LDP votes on September 22nd. Mr Aso, a 67-year-old Catholic, is from a prosperous right-wing family. He was foreign minister under both Mr Koizumi and Mr Abe. A hawk who wants Japan to play a much more robust role abroad, Mr Aso is also an original compared with more ideological conservatives. For instance, he advocates taking the sting out of the militarist Yasukuni shrine, which bedevils Japan's relations with its neighbours, by moving worship of Japan's war dead to somewhere less contentious. Asonomics
On domestic matters, he favours a stimulus package, but opposes a return to the LDP's big-spending ways. Other than that, he seems rather unsure of his own core economic convictions. That is a potential weakness. Another is a reckless tendency for loose talk. For now, that may matter less than that Mr Aso is congenial, popular with the LDP's grassroots and the public. An unabashed fan of manga comics, the shares of whose publishers soared this week, he loves to press the flesh. Above all, he lacks the morose frown and sagging chops of both Mr Fukuda and Mr Abe. 
Mr Aso will face a challenge from Yuriko Koike, a former defence minister, who will try to rally disaffected Koizumi followers behind her. But winning the party's nomination will be the easy part. Yukio Hatoyama, the DPJ's secretary-general, promises ""all-out war"", expecting to bring down the government by year-end. He says the DPJ will oppose the stimulus package, which he describes as ""half-baked"", favouring the LDP's traditional interests over the elderly and the weak. By opposing the Indian Ocean operation, Mr Hatoyama says the DPJ can help split the ruling coalition. He mentions coyly that New Komeito has recently been eager to talk to the DPJ.
The new prime minister need not call a general election until next September, and some LDP elders will advise Mr Aso to hang on for as long as possible. But New Komeito favours an early general election, while the LDP's prospects might never look better than with an immediate Aso bounce in the polls. Nobuteru Ishihara, an ambitious youngster who is considering a quixotic tilt at the LDP presidency, thinks that Mr Aso will introduce a fresh cabinet to the country and call a snap election.
With an election, the uncertainties only multiply. The ruling coalition has no chance of keeping its supermajority, but might with luck win a simple majority, or plurality. But the headache of a hung Diet would remain. Victory also brings problems for the DPJ, since it counts on the support of small left-wing parties for its control of the upper house. These parties would certainly cause trouble if the DPJ decides to ditch unrealistic electoral promises in favour of sensible government. Therefore, says Isamu Ueda of New Komeito, all the scenarios point to a wholesale political realignment after the next election. Japan's politics has just set out on its biggest adventure in over 50 years.","For the country , the start of an awfully big adventure

BRUISED, bothered and bewildered, a Japanese prime minister for the second time in a year has thrown in the towel after a few ineffectual months in the ring. Yasuo Fukuda, like his predecessor, Shinzo Abe, had seen his popularity ratings slump, as his party rivals sharpened their knives and his policies fizzled. Meanwhile, Japan's longest period of continuous economic expansion since the war had stuttered to a halt (see page
). Whoever succeeds Mr Fukuda (Taro Aso, who thought a year ago he should precede him, is the favourite) will face the same seemingly insuperable obstacles. Japanese politics seems a hopeless and depressing mess. However, for those, like this newspaper, hoping for change in Japan, this is a moment not for hand-wringing gloom, but for hand-rubbing glee: Japanese politics may have entered its most exciting period in more than 50 years (see page
).
The excitement lies in the probable collapse of the old political order and the realignment it will herald. Of course, such a transformation has been predicted--and avoided--for years. And the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) still has two powerful weapons: its well-oiled machinery of patronage and the incoherence of the main opposition, the Democratic Party of Japan (Dpj). Politics still looks deceptively like business as usual. Indeed, in the end, it was a belated attempt to pursue reform and take on some of the LDP's vested interests that did for Mr Fukuda. He exhausted himself struggling against them. The succession will be decided in the traditional manner: among the LDP's barons, without asking the electorate. Japan will have its third leader in a row not to have led his party to a victory at the polls. Japan's top-down politics stands in stark contrast to America's thrilling primary season.
Yet LDP rule in its present form is in terminal decline. This had been disguised until recently by the premiership from 2001 of Junichiro Koizumi, who combined two qualities rarely seen in Japan's politicians: popularity and reforming drive. When Mr Koizumi retired in 2006, Mr Abe, youthful and assertive, seemed well-placed to maintain this momentum. But he proved disastrously inept. And it turned out that Mr Koizumi's policies were liked much less than the man himself. Despite his recent efforts to revive reform, Mr Fukuda, a stopgap, marked a return to the old, grey, back-room style. This week the party has had to admit that this did not work either. Time for a shake-up
If Mr Aso becomes the LDP's leader, he may call an election at once, hoping to profit from the bounce in popularity a fresh face might give the party. He certainly should do so, since it is time voters had their say. But even if he does not, an election is due by September next year. For all but 11 months of the past half-century, Japan has been ruled by the LDP. There is now a real chance the party might lose power, or at least the lower-house ""supermajority"" which allows it to force through legislation despite its loss in 2007 of a majority in the powerful upper house of the parliament. It will be years before the LDP has a real chance to win back that majority. Without upheaval, deadlock would be entrenched.
Which is why change might come at last. Mr Koizumi still has followers. One will challenge Mr Aso for the prime minister's job. But many have already realised that the LDP as currently constituted cannot represent their policy ambitions. Similarly, young Turks in the ranks of the DPJ vest few hopes in their party leader, Ichiro Ozawa, a political bruiser. The prospects have rarely been brighter for these two groups to join forces and drag Japan towards true policy-based competition between parties.

IF YOUR notion of Japan's ruling party is that after half a century in near-continuous power it is unrepresentative, out-of-touch and incompetent, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) would like you to think again. In the days since Yasuo Fukuda abruptly announced his resignation on September 1st--the second occasion in a year for the ruling coalition to lose a prime minister--television has been filled with a razzle-dazzle race to lead the LDP. The winner of that contest (the party votes on September 22nd) will automatically become prime minister at a special session of the Diet (parliament) on September 24th.
When Mr Fukuda said he was resigning, it seemed as if Taro Aso, the LDP secretary-general and a former foreign minister (on the right, above) would be pushed smoothly into the post, just as Mr Fukuda and Shinzo Abe before him were as good as picked by the party grandees behind closed doors. However, four other Diet members have put themselves forward, including the first woman to run for prime minister in Japan, Yuriko Koike (also pictured). It's invigorating stuff, the LDP hopes, stealing the opposition's thunder and showing up its hidebound style. For on September 8th the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) re-elected its own leader, Ichiro Ozawa, an old bruiser, unopposed. The LDP is even brazen enough to declare that the DPJ's inexperience at governing must necessarily reflect ill upon its presumed competence--as if the opposite held true for its own shambles of a government.
Moreover the race appears to be not just about personalities but policies--surely a first for the LDP. Boosters say it is really about the choices the country faces. On what Japan needs to do, Mr Aso is among the least articulate of the contenders, though he makes up for it with a cheerful air, earthy humour and (untypically for Japan) an evident hunger for the top job. This week the Japanese establishment watched with mounting alarm as famous American financial firms imploded. Mr Aso's recipe for dealing with the consequences for Japan, and for reviving the sluggish economy, is to push for a fiscal-stimulus package. He argues that budget commitments to tame Japan's enormous national debt should be put off. Mr Aso served under Junichiro Koizumi, swashbuckling prime minister from 2001-06, but is no fan of Koizumi-style structural reform. If he believes in anything, it is in a rather hawkish conduct of foreign affairs. 
By contrast, Mr Koizumi has come out of the shadows to anoint Miss Koike, a former environment and defence minister. She says the race ""is a real struggle about whether reform takes place or not"", and accuses Mr Aso of wanting to turn back to the LDP's old pork-barrel ways. Miss Koike vows to confront a powerful bureaucracy resistant to change. Meanwhile, her candidacy is causing a stir within the party, and not only because of her sex; it risks splitting the LDP's biggest faction, whose head backs Mr Aso. (Mr Koizumi, ever the iconoclast, no doubt approves of that too.)
The other candidates also have something to offer. Kaoru Yosano, the 70-year-old economy minister, is also for Koizumi-style reform, he says. However, his passion is to balance the books. Even with a slowing economy, Mr Yosano says, Mr Aso is reckless to propose abandoning the target of balancing the budget (before interest payments) by 2011. Shigeru Ishiba, a competent past defence minister, says he is running to stiffen Japan's resolve to take part in international peacekeeping and other operations. Nobuteru Ishihara, son of an outspoken Tokyo governor, mixes liberal reform with an unstuffy style.
For all this, Mr Aso is a firm favourite. So the contest risks, as one LDP member puts it, appearing to be merely a skit. After all, the candidates have a good chance of plum posts in an Aso government--even Miss Koike, who describes the LDP old guard voting for Mr Aso as ""Pavlovian dogs"" reacting to the stimulus of pork.
The new prime minister will swiftly form his cabinet, and then deliver his policy address to the Diet on September 29th. Mr Aso will urgently want to pass a stimulus package, and renew the Japanese navy's refuelling mission in the Indian Ocean, part of the international effort in Afghanistan. But the DPJ, which controls the upper house, vows to oppose both measures. So, says the LDP's Diet-affairs chief, Tadamori Oshima, a quicker way to get them passed may be to call a snap election--October 26th is the likeliest date.
For the LDP, much would be at stake in such a vote. Koichi Kato, a former party secretary-general, says that four-fifths of its Diet members are in the LDP not because of its policies, which are few, but because it is the party in power. It may well remain so after an election, but party veterans are fearful. ""The winds of fortune"", says Mr Oshima, covering his head with his hands, ""are blowing away from us.""","As Taro Aso steps forward , the LDP 's fate hangs in the balance

Taro Aso's recipe for dealing with the consequences for Japan , and for reviving the sluggish economy , is to push for a fiscal - stimulus package . Taro Aso argues that budget commitments to tame Japan 's enormous national debt should be put off . Taro Aso served under Junichiro Koizumi , swashbuckling prime minister from 2001 - 06 , but is no fan of Koizumi - style structural reform . If Taro Aso believes in anything , it is in a rather hawkish conduct of foreign affairs . 
 By contrast , Mr Koizumi has come out of the shadows to anoint Miss Koike , a former environment and defence minister . She says the race "" is a real struggle about whether reform takes place or not "" , and accuses Taro Aso of wanting to turn back to the LDP 's old pork - barrel ways . Miss Koike vows to confront a powerful bureaucracy resistant to change . Meanwhile , her candidacy is causing a stir within the party , and not only because of her sex ; it risks splitting the LDP 's biggest faction , whose head backs Taro Aso . ( Mr Koizumi , ever the iconoclast , no doubt approves of that too . ) 
 The other candidates also have something to offer . Kaoru Yosano , the 70 - year - old economy minister , is also for Koizumi - style reform , he says . However , his passion is to balance the books . Even with a slowing economy , Mr Yosano says , Taro Aso is reckless to propose abandoning the target of balancing the budget ( before interest payments ) by 2011 . Shigeru Ishiba , a competent past defence minister , says he is running to stiffen Japan 's resolve to take part in international peacekeeping and other operations . Nobuteru Ishihara , son of an outspoken Tokyo governor , mixes liberal reform with an unstuffy style . 
 For all this , Taro Aso is a firm favourite . So the contest risks , as one LDP member puts it , appearing to be merely a skit . After all , the candidates have a good chance of plum posts in an Taro Aso government -- even Miss Koike , who describes the LDP old guard voting for Taro Aso as "" Pavlovian dogs "" reacting to the stimulus of pork . 
 Taro Aso will swiftly form Taro Aso's cabinet , and then deliver Taro Aso's policy address to the Diet on September 29th . Taro Aso will urgently want to pass a stimulus package , and renew the Japanese navy 's refuelling mission in the Indian Ocean , part of the international effort in Afghanistan . But the DPJ , which controls the upper house , vows to oppose both measures . So , says the LDP 's Diet - affairs chief , Tadamori Oshima , a quicker way to get them passed may be to call a snap election -- October 26th is the likeliest date . 
 For the LDP , much would be at stake in such a vote . Koichi Kato , a former party secretary - general , says that four - fifths of its Diet members are in the LDP not because of its policies , which are few , but because it is the party in power . It may well remain so after an election , but party veterans are fearful . "" The winds of fortune "" , says Mr Oshima , covering his head with his hands , "" are blowing away from us .

AFTER trouncing his opponents to lead the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), Taro Aso, a 68-year-old former foreign minister, was sworn in on September 24th as Japan's third (unelected) new prime minister in two years. Mr Aso, a Catholic, is the grandson of Shigeru Yoshida, a former prime minister (seated above; the young Mr Aso is standing in the centre) and as blue-blooded as they come. But he has a populist appeal, and in this leadership bid, his fourth, managed to reassure colleagues that his sometimes brashly expressed hawkish views would not jeopardise Japan's improved ties with China and South Korea. His straight-talking, upbeat style contrasts with his morose, short-tenured predecessors, Shinzo Abe and Yasuo Fukuda. Unlike both, Mr Aso says he will put pocketbook issues to the fore. 
Mr Aso has two main aims in a special session of the Diet (parliament). The ruling coalition says that the global financial crisis makes it more pressing than ever to pass a stimulus package worth {Yen}11.5 trillion ($106 billion, though only one-fifth is new spending). Second is the renewal of the navy's refuelling operation in the Indian Ocean, part of the international effort in Afghanistan and a main symbol of Japan's readiness to play a bigger part in the world. 
On September 29th Mr Aso will present his agenda to the Diet. The make-up of his cabinet appears to dispel any doubts that he will call a snap general election. With the chief exception of Kaoru Yosano, a fiscal conservative reinstated as economy minister, the cabinet talent is astonishingly thin. Mr Aso cannot be serious.
Shigeru Ishiba is a defence expert, but he has been put in charge of farms. Hirofumi Nakasone, the new foreign minister, is notable chiefly for being the son of a former prime minister. The new internal-affairs minister is Kunio Hatoyama, another grandson of a prime minister, seen even by his friends as the most incompetent justice minister in memory. And Mr Aso has chosen Shoichi Nakagawa, a potential budget-buster like himself, as finance minister. When this correspondent recently called after lunch on the man now responsible for coping with the global financial crisis, he found him in erratic form, with his shirt unbuttoned to the waist. Japan needs more women in the workforce, but Mr Nakagawa has said that they have their ""proper place"" and their ""own abilities"" in, for example, ""flower arranging, sewing, or cooking"". Countering this view has been left to Yuko Obuchi, 34-year-old daughter of another prime minister, who is in charge of reversing Japan's declining birth rate.
The opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), led by Ichiro Ozawa, controls the Diet's upper house and vows to oppose the LDP's measures, raising the odds of a poll in early November. Much is at stake for the LDP, which for half a century has been in near-continuous power. It and its allies in the bureaucracy are seen as incompetent and out of touch. On top of the welfare ministry's gross mismanagement of the country's pensions system comes a growing scandal over tainted rice. 
Mr Ozawa is now urging his forces to bring about an upheaval in Japanese politics. There is little noble in his approach, rallying the disaffected from every quarter. Supposedly a party of reform, the DPJ has tried to forge an alliance with a reactionary group, the People's New Party, whose members broke with the LDP because they opposed the privatisation of the postal system. Socialists and Communists also form part of the DPJ's ragbag rebellion.
Mr Ozawa promises to restore the pension system, help the working poor and the old, and revitalise the countryside. The DPJ's proposals for paying for this are not credible. But in his own policy address on September 21st Mr Ozawa aimed squarely at a rotten target: the murky national budget. Mr Ozawa will try to convince voters that the LDP and its allies in the bureaucracy are congenitally incapable of revamping the way taxpayers' money is taken in and spent in unaccountable ways. Many voters will sit up and listen. Others will think that to return the LDP to the lower house would be to continue the mess of a hung Diet. Mr Ozawa's hopes for an upheaval look entirely plausible.","Aso steps up to the plate ; but perhaps not to stay very long

WHEN Congress first voted down a bail-out of America's banking system, any residual hope swiftly vanished among Japan's ruling clique that the country could float over the top of the credit turmoil troubling the rest of the developed world. Certainly the banks are sound, having recovered from Japan's own harrowing financial crisis in the 1990s. They and other firms are even seizing the moment to snap up cheap businesses overseas (see page
). So the chief concern--for now, at least--is Japan's export-driven economy, which appears fast to be running out of puff. This concern has shot to the top of the agenda for Taro Aso, the prime minister of all of a week. It will probably dictate when he will call a general election, in which the long dominance of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is at stake.
After six years of economic expansion Japan may now be in full-blown recession. The expansion was driven by exports, which are now falling to America and to Europe; Japan's carmakers' shipments to America have fallen by nearly a third. Only in Asia are exports holding up, though eyes are on China, where some industries, such as construction, a big buyer of Japanese steel, are looking shaky.
The export slowdown is hitting company profits. So are recent rises in the price of imported materials, hurting Japan's terms of trade. Now that the price of oil has fallen from its peak, the terms of trade should improve. But Japanese companies are gloomy. On October 1st the Bank of Japan's quarterly Tankan survey of business sentiment reported a bleaker mood among manufacturers and non-manufacturers, large and small. In particular, plans for investment have been cut back. Small and medium-sized companies report difficulties raising funds. So a turnaround in real wages, which have been falling this year, is hard to imagine. Household spending will remain depressed.
Against this backdrop, Mr Aso wants to pass a stimulus package worth {Yen}12 trillion ($115 billion, though little of it is new spending), putting off till later the business of bringing down Japan's staggering levels of national debt. More economists now agree with him. The package will pass the lower house of the Diet (parliament) around October 7th and go to the upper house, controlled by the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ). Since coming to office, Mr Aso has adopted a more adversarial tone towards its bruising leader, Ichiro Ozawa, than did his two predecessors.
It had been assumed that Mr Aso this week would call a snap election for early November, something both Mr Ozawa and the LDP's junior coalition partner, New Komeito, want. But the stalled bail-out in America increased the urgency of the stimulus package, making Mr Aso pause. As Yasuhiro Nakasone, a former prime minister, puts it: it would hardly do for the world's second-biggest economy to be without a government at this crucial moment, along with the world's biggest. 
The DPJ has long opposed the stimulus, arguing that it serves the LDP's vested interests. It planned to sit on the bill in the upper house and use the current Diet session to grandstand on other issues. Only after 30 days, according to the constitution, would the bill then become law, but Mr Aso would not be able to dissolve the Diet in the meantime. Perhaps the DPJ will be prodded by a sense of duty to vote sooner. In that case the bill would become law however the upper house votes, while freeing Mr Aso to call an election. Mr Aso is now thinking of waiting until he can prepare a set of budget proposals to take to the country later this year, as well as create a promised consumer-affairs agency. 
That might make tactical sense to Mr Aso. His new cabinet has not enjoyed the hoped-for bounce in opinion polls. Careless talk quickly claimed one minister. Nor was the prime minister, who introduced his cabinet to the emperor on September 24th, helped by Junichiro Koizumi. The next day the long-maned former prime minister, who dominated the scene from 2001 to 2006, announced his retirement from politics. Mr Nakasone notes dryly that Mr Koizumi always excelled at performances that stole the limelight, and his resignation was no exception. Mr Aso pointedly excluded Koizumi reformists from his cabinet, but the Lionheart's going sets his followers in the LDP free to commit no end of trouble, even treachery, in the days after the election Mr Aso will eventually call.","Global turmoil roils Japan 's politics

After the Asia-Europe meeting, or ASEM, Mr Wen headed to Russia and Kazakhstan, venue for a pow-wow of Central Asian leaders, for more talks with global finance at the forefront.
But for all its avowed confidence in its own future (""the impact is limited and controllable,"" said Mr Wen), and its hinted aspirations for a world financial order less dominated by America and its dollar, China does not want to throw its weight around. At ASEM, the seventh such biennial gathering since 1996, China echoed Mr Barroso's calls for concerted international action. But it had few ideas to offer on what this should involve. More regulation of the international financial system, Mr Wen unadventurously proposed.
The most concrete idea discussed by the Asian countries at ASEM was to set up an $80 billion fund by the middle of 2009 to help countries in the region deal with liquidity problems--a plan already agreed in May. The bulk of the money would come from China, Japan and South Korea, but details of how much each would contribute and how the fund would be managed have yet to be announced. 
For China, with $1.9 trillion in reserves, and Japan, with nearly $1 trillion, the proposed amount is hardly massive. But the countries giving most are likely to wield most clout. The participating countries, which also include the ten members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations, are a fractious lot and have differing views, not least over the roles of China and Japan in Asia. Most of them are still far too touchy about sovereignty to agree on any meaningful pooling of it. 
Chinese leaders told ASEM that their priority was to keep their own economy running smoothly. This, said Mr Wen, was China's ""greatest contribution to the world"". China's economic growth has recently slowed, unusually, to a single-digit rate (9% in the third quarter) and many economists expect it to remain that way next year. But its buoyancy is a solace to Asian countries, several of which enjoy trade surpluses with China, and to the European Union, for which China is the fastest-growing market--albeit, as the Europeans like to point out when they complain about Chinese trade barriers, still no bigger than Switzerland. At least European moans about successive years of the yuan's depreciation against the euro, making European exports costlier, have now been silenced by a reversal of the trend. 
China seemed reluctant at first to let the financial crisis dominate ASEM's agenda. But it lost nothing by doing so. It deflected attention from climate change, another big issue of concern. The Europeans want China to make stronger commitments to cut its carbon emissions. But if there were concerns at ASEM about backsliding by China as it focuses more on boosting growth and employment, participants were too well-mannered to raise them publicly (just as they were all far too tactful to complain that Taiwan, Asia's fifth-biggest economy, is not even represented at ASEM because of China's objections). 
A shared sense of crisis also gave China a face-saving way of engaging in some fence-mending. Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, who had riled the Chinese by meeting the Dalai Lama in September last year, was told by President Hu Jintao during a meeting on the sidelines that China's relations with Germany were ""good"". 
That is as far as a Chinese leader will ever go towards saying that all is forgiven. Japan's new prime minister, Taro Aso, was also cordially received despite his China-sceptical views, and despite his just having signed a security pact with India, which some at least in China will see as directed against their country. Japan and China agreed to set up a hotline. China and Vietnam agreed to finish marking their contentious land border by the end of the year. 
But while China relishes the attention it commands at such gatherings, it is resisting the temptation to swagger in its dealings with America. There are concessions China would like. One would be an end to America's de facto power of veto in the IMF. Recently it has been showing its pique at this by blocking publication of an IMF report examining whether China has been manipulating its exchange rate for the sake of trade advantage. A Chinese newspaper said America must give up its control over the IMF in return for China's helping out in the crisis. But the government has not gone that far in public. 
In Russia, with whose leaders China shares strong misgivings about America, Mr Wen did allow himself to say that developing countries should have a stronger say in a new financial system. He also said there was a need to ""diversify"" the global currency system, a tactful way of saying the dollar's sway should diminish. But ASEM's closing statement said the IMF should play a critical role in helping badly-hit countries. Its only caution was that this should be ""upon their request"". 
Albert Keidel of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington think-tank, says China does not want ""to be seen as a problem for existing powers"" at this stage of its economic development. But he also argued in a recent paper that there could be trouble ahead as recession in the West, which he believes China could ride out, stokes protectionist demands. The crisis could also result in China's economy surpassing America's earlier than expected--well before 2030, Mr Keidel suggests. Hard as Chinese diplomats try to wear a friendly face, this would be a psychological jolt for Americans.","In a whirl of financial summitry , China ponders how to wield its new - found clout

NOTCH this up for Taro Aso, Japan's third unelected prime minister from the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in little more than two years: he is now unlikely to beat Japan's record of 54 days for its shortest-lived leader. Give the wily Mr Aso credit, too, for leading the opposition by the nose since he came to office on September 24th. The Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) had thought it had Mr Aso's assurance that he would soon dissolve the Diet (parliament) and call a snap election, one which the DPJ's leader, Ichiro Ozawa, claims will shatter the post-war structure of LDP-led politics. An election date of November 30th was probable. To bring on the moment, the DPJ, which controls the Diet's upper house, hastened the passage of LDP bills rather than obstructing them. It fine-tuned its list of candidates, and ran up campaign posters. A palpable excitement ran through the opposition camp.
But then on October 30th, with a poker face, Mr Aso suggested that now was no time for a frivolous election. The global financial crisis called for firm leadership. A wave of selling has sent the stockmarket down to levels not seen in almost 30 years. Hedge funds have unwound with a vengeance a once-profitable ""carry trade"" for which they had borrowed the Japanese currency: this has sent the yen surging, while households have also rushed to bring yen home. Japan's financial institutions, it turns out, have created their own toxic derivatives, thanks to complex foreign-currency products sold to retail investors that are now blowing up. Meanwhile, banks count shareholdings as a crucial part of their capital. So after the stockmarket falls, the banks' capital suddenly looks weak. The government has drawn up a raft of emergency measures to restore confidence, many of which Mr Aso also unveiled on October 30th (see page
). He has a duty, he says, to see them through.
Mr Aso has also discovered international obligations. After attending the Asia-Europe summit in Beijing, he says Japan needs a fully functioning prime minister for the Group of 20 countries' emergency meeting on the financial crisis, to be held in Washington on November 15th. And a week after that there is the summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation, APEC, A Perfect Excuse to Chat. 
All responsible stuff. But an unspoken reason for delay is a slide in his ratings. Mr Aso has long been a fairly popular politician for getting out and shaking hands. An upbeat style makes a refreshing change from his two predecessors. Most importantly, he has outpolled the bruiser Mr Ozawa, even though voters have consistently said that they prefer the DPJ to the LDP-led coalition. From the start, Mr Aso's strategy was to capitalise on this paradox. His aim was to paint the election, when it came, as a contest between himself and Mr Ozawa, whose robustness has been undermined by poor health. A contest based on personalities would be an exception.
Yet Mr Aso's standing in opinion polls has slid since he took office, narrowing the gap with Mr Ozawa: his honeymoon was brief indeed. The economic storm has given him reason to hang on, but not helped his popularity. Mr Aso is wealthy and likes the high life. For all but five nights of his first month, he and his retinue went out to expensive bars and restaurants. He no doubt deserves his cigar and brandy. But as Japan tightens its belt, his irritable defence of how he likes to unwind has grated.
As for the eventual date for an election, Mr Aso appears content to extemporise. Most LDP leaders agree that the economic turmoil makes early polls inadvisable, and one is not due until next September. However, the government's junior coalition partner, New Komeito, is upset at Mr Aso's change of mind. Next summer it faces municipal elections in Tokyo, its power-base. It worries that it lacks the resources to fight two elections back-to-back, and will continue to push for an early poll. 
The opposition, outfoxed by Mr Aso, is temporarily flummoxed. Susumu Yanase, the DPJ's election-affairs chief in the upper house, says the party is rapidly having to rethink its strategy. Having supported Mr Aso's first supplementary budget, it might look irresponsible if it opposed Mr Aso's new emergency measures. As for the other legislation crucial to the LDP--reauthorising the bill that keeps Japanese navy tankers on a refuelling mission in the Indian Ocean, for the war in Afghanistan-- Mr Yanase says the DPJ lacks the leverage it had last year, when its blocking tactics succeeded in bringing the vessels home for a period. Now, Mr Aso has enough time to pass the bill by using the government's supermajority in the lower house before the current mission expires in mid-January.
Apart from seeming to enjoy himself as prime minister, Mr Aso may have a final reason for not wishing to call a general election soon: that he might win it. No one expects the LDP coalition to keep its supermajority, but it has a chance of retaining a slim majority. For some LDP modernisers, that would be the worst outcome: an unprincipled ruling party without a scrap of reforming zeal under Mr Aso, combined with a hung Diet promising gridlock. 
For as long as November 30th was the mooted date for an election, conspiracies within the LDP mounted. Hidenao Nakagawa, a former chief cabinet secretary and enemy of the bureaucracy, and Yuriko Koike, a former defence minister, wondered about leading followers of Junichiro Koizumi, the reformist prime minister who dominated politics from 2001-06, out of the party. Mr Aso's economy minister, Kaoru Yosano, a fiscal conservative, and Hiroyuki Sonoda, the LDP's deputy policy chief, have been urged to form a new political party following an Aso win, teaming up with pragmatic reformists in the DPJ (who are unhappy with their own leader). Such a move after an LDP victory could instantly bring Mr Aso down, and usher in DPJ-led rule. But now, all hands are at the pump to deal with the financial tempest; conspiracies have been put on hold.","Aso , having a pretty good crisis , plays for time

MANY Japanese were surprised that a hotel chain, under a cloud for shoddy earthquake-proofing standards, should sponsor a competition for the best essay to deny Japan's wartime role as an aggressor and sponsor of atrocities. But then the chain's boss, Toshio Motoya, is a vigorous historical revisionist (and big supporter of Shinzo Abe, prime minister in 2006-07). More astounding, then: the competition winner, Toshio Tamogami, was none other than the head of Japan's air force.
Mr Tamogami's offering is a warmed-through hash of thrice-cooked revisionism. Japan, he writes, fought a war of self-defence, protecting its legal territories of Manchukuo (North-East China) and Korea against communists. Pearl Harbour was an American-laid trap. Japanese occupations were both benevolent and a liberation of Asia from the yoke of Western imperialism --indeed, neighbours (20m of whose deaths were caused by the Japanese) now look fondly on wartime Japan. Japan must ""reclaim its glorious history"", Mr Tamogami ended with a barrel-rolling flourish and a want of irony, ""for a country that denies its own history is destined to fall."" 
The prime minister of six weeks, Taro Aso, from the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), moved swiftly. Within hours of the essay's publication on October 31st, Mr Tamogami, a general, was out of a job. China and South Korea expressed shock at his views, but accepted that they did not reflect the government's. Mr Tamogami did not help his case by complaining that Japan's freedom of expression was on a par with North Korea's. As well as the {Yen}3m ($30,000) essay prize, he gets a {Yen}60m retirement bonus from the defence ministry.
End of story? Not quite. For a start, Mr Tamogami, it transpires, took Mr Motoya for a joy-ride in a fighter jet. And since his sacking, it turns out that of the 230-odd aspiring writers of historical fiction, 78 were officers in Japan's air force, most of them close to their general. Of course, it is understandable that some professional warriors might chafe at Japan's American-dictated pacifist constitution; and at a victor's interpretation of history that discredited Japan's proud armed forces. But for so many to write revisionist claptrap in a hotel-sponsored competition is rum indeed. The unfortunate impression is of those radicalised officers' messes of the 1930s, out of which the Japanese army mugged civilian rule: the rest was, well, history.
So the prime minister has some explaining to do, and the opposition Democratic Party of Japan will make all the hay it can. It wants Mr Tamogami to testify before the Diet. It may press the prime minister about his own views. His government, like its predecessors, endorses apologies, first formulated in the mid-1990s, expressing guilt and remorse for wartime suffering. In office (and as foreign minister before that) Mr Aso has also eschewed visiting Yasukuni, where war criminals as well as Japan's 2.5m war dead are enshrined. 
Yet in the past Mr Aso, in a shoot-from-the-hip way, has echoed many of Mr Tamogami's right-wing views. He has, for instance, praised Japan's occupation of Korea from 1910-45, even though his family fortune derives from a mining company that used Korean slave labour during the second world war. As prime minister Mr Aso has been on good behaviour. Yet the day after Mr Tamogami's sacking, he casually picked up a volume of views similar to the general's from a Tokyo bookstore.
Mr Aso is certainly doing his bit to improve tricky relations with neighbours, China and South Korea in particular. Unlike many revisionists, he embraces the post-war order, wants an internationalist role for Japan, and does not see bogeymen behind every tree. Yet now he has the challenge of reassuring Japan's neighbours over the Tamogami affair without undermining his own conservative base. 
The public reaction to the affair reinforces how beleaguered these days are Japan's history-deniers, says Jeffrey Kingston, a historian of Asia at Temple University in Tokyo. Even Yasukuni has toned down the exhibits in its notorious museum, where until recently militarism was celebrated and all atrocities denied. The most notable denial was of the Nanjing massacre of tens (or possibly hundreds) of thousands of Chinese in December 1937. Now the museum admits that killings took place, but suggests they were of enemy soldiers disguised as civilians. This is the problem with the historical fantasists. Even as they moderate their public message, they leave you waiting for the ""but"".","The history wars erupt afresh , with consequences for the country 's prime minister

The crisis is not only failing to convince the country that he is the steady hand it needs. It is laying bare the ungovernability of the whole political system over which he presides.
Japan is now officially in recession after its longest post-war expansion, and is unlikely to climb out of it until perhaps the middle of next year. Rarely for a developed country, the financial system is without big toxic-debt problems. Rather, the shock has come through a sharp slowdown in exports. Big exporters such as Toyota and Sony and their suppliers are laying off contract and even regular workers. Consumer sentiment has taken a dive. As for business, company profits were a fifth lower in the first half of the financial year from April compared with a year earlier, and the second half will surely be worse.
The credit crunch that Japan had hoped to avoid has arrived. With bond markets all but closed, firms have turned to commercial banks for loans. But a falling stockmarket--the Nikkei 225-share average recently hit a 26-year low--has hurt the banks, which count equity holdings as capital. They are lending little to all but the biggest companies. On December 2nd the Bank of Japan announced that, until April, it would accept pretty much any old corporate debt as collateral from commercial banks for fresh loans. It says it will make {Yen}3 trillion ($32 billion) of extra funding available, yet questions remain about how much banks will lend on to companies. On December 3rd the finance minister, Shoichi Nakagawa, called in the heads of the biggest banks. But such efforts at moral suasion are unlikely to work.
It is possible to exaggerate the economic woes. Japan's biggest companies are not greatly indebted. No systemic crisis dogs the banking system, though Japan's regional banks are weak. The falling stockmarket has affected few Japanese directly, since for years they have hoarded savings in safe bank accounts (and indeed the freezer). Recently, a rush of younger Japanese have even been opening brokerage accounts. Meanwhile, some politicians in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) are lobbying hard for the government to start buying equities. One proposal by a senator, Kotaro Tamura, is for the government to borrow perhaps {Yen}30 trillion from the biggest banks and hand it to professional money-managers. Such a scheme may turn sentiment around.
The political mess, on the other hand, is hard to exaggerate. Mr Aso's ratings have dropped sharply. The press has made much of off-the-cuff remarks by the prime minster in which he has managed to offend doctors and the elderly, both future targets for government cuts. And it has relished his mispronunciation of certain kanji (Chinese characters used in Japanese script) for which schoolchildren would be chided. But at heart Mr Aso, the third LDP man in a row to be elected prime minister by his party rather than the country, has failed to explain quite why he bothered.
His predecessor, Yasuo Fukuda, resigned in order to make way for a sparkier leader to take the country to the polls. But at least three times Mr Aso has postponed what was expected to be a snap election. The delay, he explained, was to deal with the economic crisis, notably by introducing a fresh stimulus package. Yet now Mr Aso says the package will not be introduced until the main session of the Diet (parliament) opens in early January.
Given the obstruction of the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), which controls the upper house of the Diet, that makes political sense. But all the public sees is a spat between the ruling coalition's junior partner, New Komeito, which wants a tax rebate as the main part of the stimulus, and fiscal reformists in the LDP who think households are likelier to save the rebate than spend it, and who want to stop sky-high levels of national debt from rising further. Other LDP pork barons appear to have prevailed in scrapping the commitment to cut spending on public works by 3% a year.
Strains within the LDP are now breaking out into the open, particularly thanks to market liberals, followers of a former prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, who have recently been sidelined. ""Policy groups"" have been formed that throw down a challenge to Mr Aso; they might serve as springboards to form a new political party. Yoshimi Watanabe, a former minister of administrative reform and a critic of Mr Aso's weak political leadership (and of its corollary, strong bureaucratic power), is one of the rebels. Cryptically, he cites his late father, Michio Watanabe, as giving warning against putting party ahead of country. Watanabe senior, a popular LDP figure, once threatened to leave the party as a route to becoming prime minister. The son also refuses to rule out leaving. In the meantime, he calls for a grand coalition government--minus Mr Aso--as a first step towards breaking the political deadlock of two strong chambers controlled by opposing parties.
The DPJ's bruiser of a leader, Ichiro Ozawa, as unloved as Mr Aso, wants to sow further discord within the LDP. He too has revived the idea of a coalition government, but probably as a means of coaxing more disaffected LDP types into poking their heads above the parapet. For now most LDP politicians appear to think that would be foolhardy. Yet none thinks Mr Aso has total control over the election timetable--April now seems the likeliest month--let alone his fate as leader.

By the end of the month the remaining big Wall Street houses had either been absorbed by others or become bank holding companies. 
America and Europe reacted to the unfolding crisis by unveiling broad bail-out packages for the financial system. After a battle in Congress America extended $700 billion in funding. With credit markets frozen, central banks took emergency steps to boost liquidity. America's Federal Reserve made unprecedented market interventions, such as buying large amounts of short-term debt issued to companies to enable day-to-day financing.

Events in the markets helped propel Barack Obama to a big win in America's presidential election. John McCain, Mr Obama's Republican rival, was widely judged to have fumbled his response to the crisis. 
Earlier, Mr Obama fought an epic battle with Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primaries. Mrs Clinton was given the job of secretary of state in the Obama administration, which starts work on January 20th. One of the new president's top priorities will be to implement a stimulus package, the passage of which should be made easier by increased Democratic majorities in Congress. 
Britain's Gordon Brown won plaudits for his handling of the financial crisis. It had looked as though 2008 would be a dismal year for the prime minister. His Labour Party trailed David Cameron's Conservatives by some 30 points in the polls, but rebounded when the Tories failed to explain how they would have handled the crisis differently. 
Yasuo Fukuda resigned as Japan's prime minister in frustration at his inability to implement policy. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party put Taro Aso into the job, but his future is in doubt as the country's economy contracts. 
Kenya was ravaged by violence following a disputed presidential election, leading to the formation of a fragile government of national unity in April. Two judges oversaw separate reports on the trouble that criticised politicians, police and the electoral commission. 
Pakistan's general election was a humiliation for the embattled presidency of Pervez Musharraf. His allies won just 16% of the seats, well behind the Pakistan People's Party led by Asif Zardari, the widower of Benazir Bhutto, a former prime minister assassinated last year. Mr Musharraf eventually resigned when parliament threatened to impeach him; Mr Zardari won an indirect ballot to replace him. The comandante's last move
Fidel Castro stepped down as Cuba's president, handing over the job to his younger brother, Raul, whose plans to reform the island's communist economy were slowed by two devastating hurricanes.
A resurgent Russia invaded Georgia in August after Georgian forces entered the breakaway region of South Ossetia. It was Russia's first big military incursion beyond its borders since it invaded Afghanistan in 1979. Moscow pulled its troops back, eventually, but recognised the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. 
Dmitry Medvedev won Russia's presidential election in March, though real power remained with Vladimir Putin, who became Mr Medvedev's prime minister. 
Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb wartime leader, was arrested in Belgrade, 13 years after being indicted for crimes against humanity. He was sent to the war-crimes tribunal in The Hague to stand trial. 
India endured another year of frequent terrorist incidents, including a spate of bombings in one day in Jaipur. But even the experts were taken by surprise at the audacity of a co-ordinated attack by gunmen on Mumbai. Security forces fought the assailants over several days and at least 190 people were killed. 
The violence was less severe in Iraq than in previous years; American forces handed responsibility back to Iraqi troops for Anbar province, the bloodiest zone in the first years of the insurgency. Iraq's parliament endorsed an agreement that requires American troops to withdraw from Iraq altogether by the end of 2011.
Conversely, it was the deadliest year for coalition forces in Afghanistan since the 2001 invasion. In a chilling development, a 13-year-old boy was deployed as a suicide-bomber by the Taliban, killing three British marines. 
After being dogged by corruption allegations, Ehud Olmert decided to step down as Israel's prime minister. He remains in office until February's general election, which Binyamin Netanyahu is currently favoured to win. When no means wait and see
The European Union was thrown into a tizzy when Irish voters rejected the Lisbon treaty, which Eurosceptics see as an effort to impose the old draft constitution by the back door. EU leaders pressed Ireland to hold another vote. 
The ideological divide in Latin America widened. Venezuela nationalised the cement and steel industries, Argentina's government took over its private pension system and Ecuador defaulted on its foreign debt. But most governments in the region maintained their trust in free markets and inflation targeting. Rest ye merry gentlemen
Merger activity dwindled compared with 2007. Several large takeover bids failed, such as Microsoft's offer for Yahoo! and BHPBilliton's pursuit of Rio Tinto.Hewlett-Packard did buy EDS, and Anheuser-Busch, which makes Budweiser beer, was taken over by Belgium's InBev.At $52 billion, it was one of the biggest ever foreign acquisitions of an American company. 
China's big year as host of the summer Olympics didn't go quite according to plan. The games were a spectacular success, but China's suppression of the worst outbreak of violence in Tibet in decades led to protests in cities around the world that took part in a relay of the Olympic torch en route to Beijing. 
Three months before the Olympics China suffered its worst natural disaster in 30 years when a massive earthquake rocked the province of Sichuan, killing some 70,000 people and leaving 5m homeless. China launched an all-out rescue effort that was widely praised. 
In contrast, Myanmar's ruling junta was roundly condemned for its response to a cyclone that left large swathes of the Irrawaddy delta submerged, causing at least 145,000 deaths. The furtive regime was eventually persuaded to allow a trickle of foreign aid into the deluged region. 
Most carmakers had a rotten year, no more so than in America. Detroit's Big Three went caps-in-hand to Congress for public assistance. 
The price of oil breached $100 a barrel for the first time in January. Oil prices spiked at more than $147 in July, but fell by more than two-thirds as the world economy drooped. 
The end of the commodity boom was especially welcomed in countries that had witnessed riots over high food prices earlier in the year. Thaksin times
Thailand saw prime ministers come and go with alarming frequency amid a political crisis caused by a stand-off between allies of Thaksin Shinawatra, a former prime minister toppled in 2006, and pro-monarchy supporters. The latter staged a sit-in at Bangkok's international airport for a week that left thousands of passengers stranded. 
Canada's Stephen Harper failed to win a parliamentary majority for his Conservative government; two months after the election the prime minister had to suspend Parliament to avoid being ousted by the opposition.
Robert Mugabe won a presidential run-off election in Zimbabwe after his opponent, Morgan Tsvangirai, who won the first round, pulled out because of intimidation. A power-sharing deal gave the prime minister's job to Mr Tsvangirai. Conditions remained miserable for most Zimbabweans; inflation (officially) ran at hundreds of millions per cent and cholera swept the country. 
Thabo Mbeki was ejected by the African National Congress from his post as South Africa's president. Jacob Zuma, the ANC's party leader, seems likely to win the job in 2009, provided that continuing court cases do not ensnare him. A breakaway party, the Congress of the People, may dent the ANC's authority in a general election in mid-2009, though probably without ousting the ruling party.
Bernard Madoff, a Wall Street veteran, was arrested in possibly the biggest fraud in history; his Ponzi scheme may have lost investors $50 billion. 
It was a bad year for Colombia's FARC guerrillas. Two of their leaders were killed, one of them in a bombing raid by Colombia's army on a camp just across the border in Ecuador, which prompted a break in diplomatic relations. The army also rescued Ingrid Betancourt, the FARC's most famous hostage. A ""farewell kiss""
Pundits began writing George Bush's political obituary as his approval ratings sank to new lows. At a press conference in Baghdad a disgruntled Iraqi journalist threw his shoes (size ten) at the American president, an Arab insult.

 Britain 's Gordon Brown won plaudits for his handling of the financial crisis . It had looked as though 2008 would be a dismal year for the prime minister . His Labour Party trailed David Cameron 's Conservatives by some 30 points in the polls , but rebounded when the Tories failed to explain how they would have handled the crisis differently . 
 Yasuo Fukuda resigned as Japan 's prime minister in frustration at his inability to implement policy . The ruling Liberal Democratic Party put Taro Aso into the job , but Taro Aso's future is in doubt as the country 's economy contracts . 
 Kenya was ravaged by violence following a disputed presidential election , leading to the formation of a fragile government of national unity in April . Two judges oversaw separate reports on the trouble that criticised politicians , police and the electoral commission . 
 Pakistan 's general election was a humiliation for the embattled presidency of Pervez Musharraf . His allies won just 16 % of the seats , well behind the Pakistan People 's Party led by Asif Zardari , the widower of Benazir Bhutto , a former prime minister assassinated last year . Mr Musharraf eventually resigned when parliament threatened to impeach him ; Mr Zardari won an indirect ballot to replace him . The comandante 's last move 
 Fidel Castro stepped down as Cuba 's president , handing over the job to his younger brother , Raul , whose plans to reform the island 's communist economy were slowed by two devastating hurricanes . 
 A resurgent Russia invaded Georgia in August after Georgian forces entered the breakaway region of South Ossetia . It was Russia 's first big military incursion beyond its borders since it invaded Afghanistan in 1979 . Moscow pulled its troops back , eventually , but recognised the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia . 
 Dmitry Medvedev won Russia 's presidential election in March , though real power remained with Vladimir Putin , who became Mr Medvedev 's prime minister . 
 Radovan Karadzic , the Bosnian Serb wartime leader , was arrested in Belgrade , 13 years after being indicted for crimes against humanity . He was sent to the war - crimes tribunal in The Hague to stand trial . 
 India endured another year of frequent terrorist incidents , including a spate of bombings in one day in Jaipur . But even the experts were taken by surprise at the audacity of a co - ordinated attack by gunmen on Mumbai . Security forces fought the assailants over several days and at least 190 people were killed . 
 The violence was less severe in Iraq than in previous years ; American forces handed responsibility back to Iraqi troops for Anbar province , the bloodiest zone in the first years of the insurgency . Iraq 's parliament endorsed an agreement that requires American troops to withdraw from Iraq altogether by the end of 2011 . 
 Conversely , it was the deadliest year for coalition forces in Afghanistan since the 2001 invasion . In a chilling development , a 13 - year - old boy was deployed as a suicide - bomber by the Taliban , killing three British marines . 
 After being dogged by corruption allegations , Ehud Olmert decided to step down as Israel 's prime minister . He remains in office until February 's general election , which Binyamin Netanyahu is currently favoured to win . When no means wait and see 
 The European Union was thrown into a tizzy when Irish voters rejected the Lisbon treaty , which Eurosceptics see as an effort to impose the old draft constitution by the back door . EU leaders pressed Ireland to hold another vote . 
 The ideological divide in Latin America widened . Venezuela nationalised the cement and steel industries , Argentina 's government took over its private pension system and Ecuador defaulted on its foreign debt . But most governments in the region maintained their trust in free markets and inflation targeting . Rest ye merry gentlemen 
 Merger activity dwindled compared with 2007 . Several large takeover bids failed , such as Microsoft 's offer for Yahoo ! and BHPBilliton 's pursuit of Rio Tinto . Hewlett - Packard did buy EDS , and Anheuser - Busch , which makes Budweiser beer , was taken over by Belgium 's InBev . At $ 52 billion , it was one of the biggest ever foreign acquisitions of an American company . 
 China 's big year as host of the summer Olympics did n't go quite according to plan . The games were a spectacular success , but China 's suppression of the worst outbreak of violence in Tibet in decades led to protests in cities around the world that took part in a relay of the Olympic torch en route to Beijing . 
 Three months before the Olympics China suffered its worst natural disaster in 30 years when a massive earthquake rocked the province of Sichuan , killing some 70,000 people and leaving 5 m homeless . China launched an all - out rescue effort that was widely praised . 
 In contrast , Myanmar 's ruling junta was roundly condemned for its response to a cyclone that left large swathes of the Irrawaddy delta submerged , causing at least 145,000 deaths . The furtive regime was eventually persuaded to allow a trickle of foreign aid into the deluged region . 
 Most carmakers had a rotten year , no more so than in America . Detroit 's Big Three went caps - in - hand to Congress for public assistance . 
 The price of oil breached $ 100 a barrel for the first time in January . Oil prices spiked at more than $ 147 in July , but fell by more than two - thirds as the world economy drooped . 
 The end of the commodity boom was especially welcomed in countries that had witnessed riots over high food prices earlier in the year . Thaksin times 
 Thailand saw prime ministers come and go with alarming frequency amid a political crisis caused by a stand - off between allies of Thaksin Shinawatra , a former prime minister toppled in 2006 , and pro - monarchy supporters . The latter staged a sit - in at Bangkok 's international airport for a week that left thousands of passengers stranded . 
 Canada 's Stephen Harper failed to win a parliamentary majority for his Conservative government ; two months after the election the prime minister had to suspend Parliament to avoid being ousted by the opposition . 
 Robert Mugabe won a presidential run - off election in Zimbabwe after his opponent , Morgan Tsvangirai , who won the first round , pulled out because of intimidation . A power - sharing deal gave the prime minister 's job to Mr Tsvangirai . Conditions remained miserable for most Zimbabweans ; inflation ( officially ) ran at hundreds of millions per cent and cholera swept the country . 
 Thabo Mbeki was ejected by the African National Congress from his post as South Africa 's president . Jacob Zuma , the ANC 's party leader , seems likely to win the job in 2009 , provided that continuing court cases do not ensnare him . A breakaway party , the Congress of the People , may dent the ANC 's authority in a general election in mid-2009 , though probably without ousting the ruling party . 
 Bernard Madoff , a Wall Street veteran , was arrested in possibly the biggest fraud in history ; his Ponzi scheme may have lost investors $ 50 billion . 
 It was a bad year for Colombia 's FARC guerrillas . Two of their leaders were killed , one of them in a bombing raid by Colombia 's army on a camp just across the border in Ecuador , which prompted a break in diplomatic relations . The army also rescued Ingrid Betancourt , the FARC 's most famous hostage . A "" farewell kiss "" 
 Pundits began writing George Bush 's political obituary as his approval ratings sank to new lows . At a press conference in Baghdad a disgruntled Iraqi journalist threw his shoes ( size ten ) at the American president , an Arab insult .

INFLAMMATORY remarks by Japan's speak-from-the-hip conservative politicians--among them the prime minister for now, Taro Aso--embroil them in endless controversy with neighbours over Japan's wartime past. In their defence, conservatives often say that what really concerns them is the future, in which they want Japan to punch its weight in the world. The question is, what weight? Japan's population, currently 127m and falling, is set to shrink by a third over the next 50 years. The working-age population is falling at a faster rate; the huge baby-boom generation born between 1947 and 1949, the shock troops of Japan's economic miracle, are now retiring, leaving fewer workers to support a growing proportion of elderly.
Conservatives have few answers. They call for incentives to keep women at home to breed (though poor career prospects for mothers are a big factor behind a precipitous fall in the fertility rate). Robot workers offer more hope to some: two-fifths of all the world's industrial robots are in Japan. They have the advantage of being neither foreign nor delinquent, words which in Japan trip together off the tongue. Yet robots can do only so much. 
The answer is self-evident, but conservatives rarely debate it. Their notion of a strong Japan--ie, a populous, vibrant country--is feasible only with many more immigrants than the current 2.2m, or just 1.7% of the population. (This includes 400,000 second- or third-generation Koreans who have chosen to keep Korean nationality but who are Japanese in nearly every respect.) The number of immigrants has grown by half in the past decade, but the proportion is still well below any other big rich country. Further, immigrants enter only as short-term residents; permanent residency is normally granted only after ten years of best behaviour.
Politicians and the media invoke the certainty of social instability should the number of foreigners rise. The justice ministry attributes high rates of serious crime to foreigners--though, when pressed, admits these are committed by illegal immigrants rather than legal ones. Newspaper editorials often give warning of the difficulties of assimilation.
For the first time, however, an 80-strong group of economically liberal politicians in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), led by Hidenao Nakagawa, a former LDP secretary-general, is promoting a bold immigration policy. It calls for the number of foreigners to rise to 10m over the next half century, and for many of these immigrants to become naturalised Japanese. It wants the number of foreign students in Japan, currently 132,000, to rise to 1m. And it calls for whole families to be admitted, not just foreign workers as often at present. 
The plan's author, Hidenori Sakanaka, a former Tokyo immigration chief and now head of the Japan Immigration Policy Institute, envisages a multicultural Japan in which, he says, reverence for the imperial family is an option rather than a defining trait of Japaneseness. It's a fine proposal, but not very likely to fly in the current political climate, especially at a time when the opposition Democratic Party of Japan is fretting about the impact of immigration on pay for Japanese workers.
Still, a declining workforce is changing once-fixed views. Small- and medium-sized companies were the first, during the late 1980s, to call for more immigrant workers as a way to remain competitive. The country recruited Brazilians and Peruvians of Japanese descent to work in the industrial clusters around Tokyo and Nagoya in Aichi prefecture that serve the country's giant carmakers and electronics firms. 
Now the Keidanren, the association of big, dyed-in-the-wool manufacturers, is shifting its position. This autumn it called for a more active immigration policy to bring in highly skilled foreign workers, whose present number the Keidanren puts at a mere 180,000. 
It also called for a revamp of Japan's three-year training programmes, a big source of foreign workers. These are supposed to involve a year's training and then two years' on-the-job experience. In practice, they provide cheap labour (mainly from Asia) for the garment industry, farming and fish-processing. Workers, says Tsuyoshi Hirabayashi of the justice ministry, are often abused by employers demanding long hours and paying much less than the legal minimum wage. Meanwhile, foreigners coming to the end of the scheme often leave the country to return illegally. Mr Sakanaka calls for the training programme to be abolished.
Japanese conservatives, and many others, point to the South Americans of Japanese descent as a failed experiment. Even with Japanese names, they say, the incomers still stand out. Yet in Nishi-Koizumi in Gunma prefecture, just north of Tokyo, a town dominated by a Sanyo electronics plant, the picture is different. In the family-owned factory of Kazuya Sakamoto, which for decades has supplied parts to Sanyo, three-fifths of the 300 workers are foreigners, mainly Japanese-Brazilians. 
The town is certainly down at heel by comparison with the nearby capital, though it has a mildly exotic flavour in other respects, including five tattoo parlours on the main street. Yet without foreigners, says Mr Sakamoto, it is very hard to imagine there would be a town--or his family company--at all. His father was the first to recruit foreigners, and the town changed the hospitals and the local schools to suit: there are special classes in Portuguese to bring overseas children up to speed in some subjects. The result, says Mr Sakamoto, is that foreign workers send word home about the opportunities, and other good workers follow. In future, he thinks, the country should be much more welcoming to young people from around Asia.
What this new impetus for change will achieve in the near term is another matter. Not only is policymaking absent and reformism on the defensive but the global slump is hitting Japanese industry particularly hard, and foreign workers foremost. In November industrial output fell by a record 8.1% compared to the previous month, and unemployment rose to 3.9%. A rotten time for rethinking
Mr Sakamoto says he has stopped recruiting for now, but plans no redundancies. Yet sackings of Brazilians have begun at the Toyota and Sony plants in Aichi prefecture. Some workers, says a Brazilian pastor there, have been thrown out of their flats too, with no money to return home. In Hamamatsu city, south of Tokyo, demand for foreign workers is shrinking so fast that a Brazilian school which had 180 students in 2002 closed down at the end of December; its numbers had fallen to 30. Much is made of Japan's lifetime-employment system, but that hardly applies to foreigners.","Yet some people are beginning to imagine a more multicultural Japan

THE wave which first broke in earnest over Japan's economy towards the end of last year now looks set to sweep away a political system dominated for half a century of almost unbroken power by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). That, at least, is now the view of parliamentarians of all stripes. This week, a poll by the Nikkei newspaper saw the government's approval rating fall to 19%, abjectly low. Morbid LDP members admit that a party that has seen four prime ministers in as many years is not just bereft of ideas but has lost the stomach for a fight. The government, they say, will plop into the lap of the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) in an election that the prime minister, Taro Aso (pictured above), has to call by September.
Mr Aso deserves a scintilla of credit for trying. Though he assembled a cabinet of exceptional mediocrity last September, he expected to call a snap election while his approval ratings were still fairly high. Mr Aso was then faster than most to grasp the severity of the global slowdown, and that Japan, its economy driven by exports, would be disproportionately hit. More than once he has put off calling an election in order to confront the slowdown. He saw through stimulus measures and loan guarantees inherited from his predecessor. He announced a second stimulus, including a {Yen}2 trillion ($22 billion) cash handout to households. And he declared that nothing so frivolous as an election would disrupt preparations for the full budget for the fiscal year that begins in April, in which the economy would get another boost. This was to be Mr Aso's three-stage rocket.
It has turned out to be a damp squib. The new spending is not large, yet promoting the proposals has consumed his political capital. For a start, instead of pushing the second stimulus through the Diet (parliament) at once, Mr Aso put it off until the session that began in January, so as not to divert energies from the annual budgeting ritual. Yet that has given more time for the public to turn against the handout as a gimmick, and for the opposition to make hay. Citing the handout, one prominent LDP member, Yoshimi Watanabe, a former financial-services minister who has long been unhappy about the lack of administrative and supply-side reforms, stomped out of the party on January 13th.
Mr Watanabe's departure set off speculation about whether civil war within the LDP was about to break out into the open, with defections to a new political force. If only in this respect, the scale of Japan's slump benefits Mr Aso for now, since it has stilled such a rebellion. The most powerful critic of the LDP's lack of reform zeal, Hidenao Nakagawa, a former party secretary-general, now says that political realignment must happen only when voters demand a clearer direction. He will not, he says, be the one to fire the assassin's shot at Sarajevo. And Yasuhisa Shiozaki, a former chief cabinet secretary, has not accepted Mr Watanabe's entreaties to join him. Rather, Mr Shiozaki says, he and a few colleagues will push for a new stimulus package worth {Yen}10 trillion--this time tied to changes in highly regulated areas such as health care, education and agriculture. 
Potential rebels share two other calculations. Mr Aso might yet bow out, allowing one more boundlessly self-regarding buggins to contest the next election for the LDP. The second is that as the chances rise of an outright victory by the DPJ in the next election, so the leverage of any third political force diminishes. A wholesale political realignment in Japan may have to wait until the DPJ attains office and stumbles. 
In the meantime, says Tadamori Oshima, the LDP's Diet-affairs chief in the lower house, the odds of Mr Aso's passing his various packages have shortened. On January 27th the second stimulus package was bulldozed through. Until recently, a move led by Mr Nakagawa and Mr Shiozaki looked as if it might derail passage of the next fiscal year's budget. To pass enabling legislation, the ruling coalition must use its ""supermajority"" in the lower house to override the opposition-controlled upper house. But the rebels had objected to language about the need to raise the consumption (sales) tax in 2011 in order to finance social welfare. The rebels backed down after it was made more explicit that the rise hinged not just on economic recovery, but on reducing the power of the bureaucracy. Mr Oshima now says he is certain that the supermajority, without which Mr Aso would have to resign, will hold.
This brings only a brief respite for the prime minister. The economy is worsening fast: in December year-on-year exports fell by 35%; surveys of consumer confidence are at all-time lows; while the central bank talks of an economic ""emergency"". This week, the government announced convoluted plans for public funds to be used to buy shares in cash-strapped smaller companies. Though it has not been announced, it also wants to force big city banks to take public-capital injections, with no strings attached, rather than risk sending the stockmarket down further by issuing fresh shares. If Mr Aso plans further stimulus packages, publicising them now might only heighten the tooth-pulling pain of passing the current measures.
In his policy speech to the Diet on January 28th, the prime minister promised to bring Japan out of recession before the rest of the world, yet he gave few clues as to how. Admittedly, he expounded on the need for sweeping changes to the tax system, including raising the consumption tax. By mentioning the tax, Mr Aso meant to signal his commitment to responsible politics. Yet nothing he said hinted at tough structural changes to promote growth. Drained of influence and written off by his own party, a single weapon remains with Mr Aso: when to dissolve the Diet and call the election. As to when he will do that, says Mr Oshima, probably the prime minister's closest and most important ally, only Mr Aso and God know.","Even its own members reckon Japan 's ruling LDP faces annihilation 
 THE wave which first broke in earnest over Japan 's economy towards the end of last year now looks set to sweep away a political system dominated for half a century of almost unbroken power by the Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) . That , at least , is now the view of parliamentarians of all stripes . This week , a poll by the Nikkei newspaper saw the government 's approval rating fall to 19 % , abjectly low . Morbid LDP members admit that a party that has seen four prime ministers in as many years is not just bereft of ideas but has lost the stomach for a fight . The government , they say , will plop into the lap of the opposition Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) in an election that Taro Aso , has to call by September . 
 Taro Aso deserves a scintilla of credit for trying . Though Taro Aso assembled a cabinet of exceptional mediocrity last September , Taro Aso expected to call a snap election while Taro Aso's approval ratings were still fairly high . Taro Aso was then faster than most to grasp the severity of the global slowdown , and that Japan , its economy driven by exports , would be disproportionately hit . More than once Taro Aso has put off calling an election in order to confront the slowdown . Taro Aso saw through stimulus measures and loan guarantees inherited from Taro Aso's predecessor . Taro Aso announced a second stimulus , including a { Yen}2 trillion ( $ 22 billion ) cash handout to households . And Taro Aso declared that nothing so frivolous as an election would disrupt preparations for the full budget for the fiscal year that begins in April , in which the economy would get another boost . This was to be Taro Aso's three - stage rocket .

UNTIL this week only one American secretary of state had made his first foreign trip to Asia: Dean Rusk, in 1961. So Hillary Clinton's decision to start her travels with a tour to Tokyo, Jakarta, Beijing and Seoul surprised even her hosts. The message seems to be that war elsewhere and economic turmoil may be the current preoccupations, but America's future environment will be shaped in Asia.
Besides, it is always good to go where you are welcome. It is not simply that President Barack Obama's four childhood years in Indonesia make him a hero there; nor that learners of English have cleaned out the Tokyo bookshops of volumes of his speeches. Rather, despite the damage George Bush did to America's prestige, in East Asia it remains high.
According to a recent survey of Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, China and Vietnam by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, America's ""soft"" power--ie, its ability to influence others through attraction rather than coercion--has actually grown. Everywhere, America ranked ahead of China in terms of soft power, measured as a mix of political, economic and cultural appeal. It ranked first in Japan, South Korea and China. In Indonesia and Vietnam it took second place, to Japan. That China limped in third overall clearly came as a surprise to the Chicago Council, which had roped in a noted China hand, David Shambaugh, to write up the findings. 
Yet East Asia was somewhat neglected under Mr Bush, especially in the second term. The cause was partly bureaucratic. After it was launched in 2006, the ""strategic economic dialogue"" with China came to dominate the bilateral relationship at the expense of broader issues such as security and human rights. At times, it seemed relations were the sole preserve of the former treasury secretary, Hank Paulson.
As for the State Department, its East Asia agenda was consumed by North Korea, which exploded a nuclear device in October 2006. Mr Bush's assistant secretary of state for the region, Christopher Hill (who accompanied Mrs Clinton), focused on little else. This irked Japan. Not only did the United States appear to be neglecting its biggest Asian ally. Japanese and South Korean warnings against over-hasty deals with North Korea were also ignored. 
America took the North off its blacklist of state sponsors of terror last autumn, in return for an oral promise about verification procedures for disabling facilities at its nuclear reactor. The North has since all but disowned the promise at the six-party talks aimed at getting it to disarm. Meanwhile, progress on tackling suspected uranium enrichment, nuclear proliferation and the North's existing handful of plutonium weapons remains as elusive as ever.
Now North Korea has grown shrill towards South Korea, which under President Lee Myung-bak does not want to give unconditional aid. The North may try to provoke a naval skirmish. Preparations for a long-range missile test appear under way, and another nuclear test cannot be ruled out. North Korea may yet dominate America's East Asia policy and attempt to drive wedges between America and its friends, as it did under Mr Bush.
In Japan Mrs Clinton had to mend a fence she broke herself. Laying out her stall in Foreign Affairs, a wonkish journal, in late 2007, she almost forgot Japan in her stress on China. There is no surer way to feed Japanese insecurities. Yet in Tokyo she hailed the security alliance with Japan as a cornerstone of American foreign policy. And she invited the prime minister, Taro Aso, to be the first foreign leader to meet Mr Obama, on February 24th (assuming he clings to office that long). Any new bonhomie, however, will be tested when America asks a foot-dragging Japan for more help abroad--for instance, by flying supplies into Afghanistan, now that overland routes from Pakistan are repeatedly subject to Taliban attacks.
Mrs Clinton is visiting Indonesia partly as a proxy for re-engaging with South-East Asia as a whole: the region badly wants continued American engagement as a counterbalance to China's growing military might. But Indonesia also matters as a huge Muslim nation, where, as the foreign minister, Hassan Wirajuda, put it, ""Islam and modernity can go hand-in-hand."" 
China, for its part, wants reassurance that not much will change, at a time of rising protectionist pressure in America. It was relieved not to have been demonised during the presidential campaign, and Mrs Clinton's talk of wishing it to be committed to international norms echoes the language of the Bush administration. China Daily, an official newspaper, has even expressed the hope that military exchanges, suspended last year over American arms sales to Taiwan, might be resumed. But Mrs Clinton's suggestion that dialogue has been too centred on the economic at the expense of the strategic gives Chinese policymakers the jitters. 
In general, Mrs Clinton has appeared to be listening more than speaking. Still, it is possible that the biggest change in America's Asian diplomacy will be to put global warming near the heart of it. On the trip Mrs Clinton brought her special envoy on climate change, Todd Stern. China, the United States and Indonesia (because of deforestation) are the world's biggest emitters of greenhouse gases. Japan has perhaps the best clean technology. China has yet to show any readiness to make specific commitments to cut carbon emissions. But if offered technological and other bribes, it might prefer not to be seen as an obstacle to the global agreement on carbon reductions hoped for late 2009. That would be a coup for Mrs Clinton's Asian diplomacy, though a distant goal for now.","A well - received first trip abroad as secretary of state , listening not lecturing

INCOHERENT, floundering, sleepy and confused. The demeanour of Japan's finance minister, Shoichi Nakagawa, at a G7 press conference in Rome on February 14th typified the country's economy and politics. Mr Nakagawa, forced to resign a few days later, blamed his apparent drunkenness on ""cold medicine"". But there is no ready remedy for what ails Japan. 
The Japanese economy contracted 3.3% in the final quarter of 2008, the third consecutive fall, mostly due to a collapse in overseas demand compounded by a strong yen. Economists forecast a drop of around 4% in 2009--a contraction twice as severe as in America and Europe. 
""We are facing the biggest economic crisis since the second world war,"" said Kaoru Yosano, the economics minister, who added the finance ministry to his business card after Mr Nakagawa's departure. Corporate profits have collapsed--down 89% on last year. Big manufacturers' output is down by 20-40%. Toyota has halved its output. Bellwether companies from NEC to Nissan have slashed jobs and investment. Industrial output is expected to fall to levels not seen since the 1980s (see chart). 
The government's handling of the economy has resembled Mr Nakagawa's slurred performance. Of the {Yen}12.6 trillion (around $150 billion) in stimulus packages the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has put forward, only a quarter has been implemented. The delay arises from political deadlock. Part of the hold-up is caused by a plan for {Yen}2 trillion in cash handouts to individuals, which has little public support and is rejected by the main opposition, the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ). 
The prime minister, Taro Aso, Mr Yosano and the LDP's leadership have in private agreed on an even bigger package, of as much as {Yen}30 trillion, which they plan to unveil after the 2009 budget passes the Diet (parliament). It looks more hopeful than previous efforts. Some investment, such as building a new runway and terminal at Haneda, the airport closest to Tokyo, to make it a proper international one, will raise productive growth. But after the tortuous budget deliberations and the difficulty of passing earlier, smaller stimulus proposals, the chances that one planned on the quiet might pass are remote. 
The biggest threat to the economy is neither business nor finance. It is politics. Mr Aso's reputation has been shredded by a series of gaffes and policy flip-flops. The latest occurred this month when he declared that as a minister he opposed the privatisation of Japan Post, the hallmark policy of Junichiro Koizumi's premiership in 2001-06. Mr. Koizumi, who plans to leave politics but remains highly popular, derided Mr Aso's view as ""laughable"", weakening Mr Aso's support in his party. 
Mr Aso also, blind to the public outcry, at first gave Mr Nakagawa his full support. For all his alleged tippling, Mr Nakagawa was one of the bright sparks in the cabinet and someone Mr Aso came to rely on. The LDP has been in power for all but 11 months since 1955, but Mr Aso governs with approval ratings that some polls place at less than 10%. The DPJ is expected to trounce the LDP at the general election Mr Aso must call by September. But the DPJ has even less of a clue about how to tackle the economic mess. It will toast victory with cold medicine, but inherit a hangover.","Both politics and the economy flounder 
 INCOHERENT , floundering , sleepy and confused . The demeanour of Japan 's finance minister , Shoichi Nakagawa , at a G7 press conference in Rome on February 14th typified the country 's economy and politics . Mr Nakagawa , forced to resign a few days later , blamed his apparent drunkenness on "" cold medicine "" . But there is no ready remedy for what ails Japan . 
 The Japanese economy contracted 3.3 % in the final quarter of 2008 , the third consecutive fall , mostly due to a collapse in overseas demand compounded by a strong yen . Economists forecast a drop of around 4 % in 2009 - -a contraction twice as severe as in America and Europe . 
 "" We are facing the biggest economic crisis since the second world war , "" said Kaoru Yosano , the economics minister , who added the finance ministry to his business card after Mr Nakagawa 's departure .

TO BREAK the lock of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on power, the main opposition, the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), made a pact with the devil. It promises a modern, transparent politics. Yet in 2006 it chose as its leader a master of the dark arts, Ichiro Ozawa, a political heavy, whose politics were honed in the back rooms of the LDP itself. 
This pact seemed to be paying off. Mr Ozawa engineered a brilliant victory in elections for the upper house of the Diet (parliament) in 2007. And recently it looked as if the government would plop into the DPJ's lap after a general election that must take place by September. The ratings of the prime minister, Taro Aso, only plummet. Yet on March 3rd Mr Ozawa's political secretary was arrested and charged with taking illegal donations from Nishimatsu, a second-tier construction company, two of whose former executives were also arrested.
Mr Ozawa's supporters have rallied round him, calling the arrests a politically inspired conspiracy. Certainly, the Tokyo prosecutor's office has a thing against anti-establishment gadflies. Mr Ozawa says his aide is innocent and vows to stay on as leader. Yet even before the arrests, many DPJ members feared Mr Ozawa would be a liability as prime minister. Not only is his health poor, but he prefers life backstage to the limelight. The party executive backs him, but Mr Ozawa is fighting for his political life. Katsuya Okada, with a more co-operative streak, is ready to take over. He will first need to be forgiven for having led the DPJ into a resounding election drubbing in 2005.
Mr Aso is unlikely to use the DPJ's disarray to call a snap election. Voters might punish such opportunism. And unlike the opposition, Mr Aso at least has a response to an economic crisis which has seen exports fall by more than two-fifths. Soon he will announce his third and possibly biggest fiscal stimulus. This time, a collaborative approach will be tried, with a weekend retreat of economists, prefectural governors and other groups to agree on broad points. The plan is that this stimulus will pass in June, allowing the Diet to be dissolved and Mr Aso to attend the July G8 summit in Italy. If tensions within the DPJ break out into the open, the prime minister may feel that time is on his side. On the other hand, who is to say that the Tokyo prosecutors are not after corporate donations to the LDP too?

THOUGH his political secretary had just been indicted for allegedly handling illegal company donations, a tearful Ichiro Ozawa vowed to stay on this week as the head of Japan's opposition. The 66-year-old would, he promised, carry out his ""lifetime dream and last task"" of toppling the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) from a half-century of almost unbroken power. Until the indictment of Takanori Okubo, at least, Mr Ozawa and his Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) looked certain to sweep the LDP-led coalition away in the election that must be held by September.
Mr Okubo may be about to confess to taking {Yen}35m ($355,000) in slush money from Nishimatsu, a building company, between 2003 and 2006. If so, he could bring Mr Ozawa under suspicion, too. In Japan, politicians and bureaucrats, not governing parties, have the power to dispense favours such as public-works contracts. Mr Ozawa, though he is not in government, is the most powerful baron in Iwate prefecture, in the north-east of Japan's main island of Honshu.
He declares that he is shocked that anyone should think of suspecting him. The Tokyo prosecutors have not dared question him and Mr Ozawa may well not be prosecuted. Yet, says Yoshihiko Noda, a DPJ colleague, that is not the point. For a party trying to present voters with a clear alternative to the benighted government of Taro Aso, the prime minister, Mr Ozawa must be above suspicion. 
And so the pact with the devil that many in the DPJ knew they were making when choosing Mr Ozawa as their leader in 2006 comes back to haunt them at an excruciating moment. The party wants to offer voters, especially urban ones, a vision of modern, clean government driven by sound policies. But, as a party of neophytes, they turned to Mr Ozawa, a heavyweight who first made his name as a brilliant operator within the LDP. By the end of the 1980s Mr Ozawa had shot to the top of that party as a young secretary-general. When he had made enough enemies there, he stormed out in 1993. In a succession of parties, he has ever since vowed to bring the LDP down, arguing for a reformed politics that his autocratic style suggests he is unlikely to provide. The Nishimatsu scandal is a reminder that Mr Ozawa has always been at the nexus of money and power that holds sway in Japan, especially in its rural regions. He was taken under the wing of that paragon of post-war corruption, Kakuei Takanaka, a prime minister eventually brought down for taking bribes from Lockheed.
Despite scandal, the autocrat still dominates the DPJ. The party's executive committee did not even grill him about the Nishimatsu story, politely waiting to hear whether he deigned to continue as party leader or not. Yet many DPJ politicians want him to go, though they do not say so openly. Opinion polls suggest that two thirds of voters agree. If public disapproval hardens, critics will be emboldened to speak out. Katsuya Okada, a moderniser, would be Mr Ozawa's likeliest replacement, though he led the party to defeat at the last general election.
A change of leadership might not be the end of Mr Ozawa, though. Whatever happens, his knowledge of the LDP and its tactics might prove invaluable to the DPJ were it to win office. From a lesser position in the government or the party, Mr Ozawa might conceivably wield greater clout than the gentle Mr Okada. That is how he operated with weak prime ministers in the LDP. For now, in a piece of pure cynicism, he has called for a ban on all company donations and put Mr Okada, who really does care about money politics, in charge of drawing up proposals. For some in the DPJ, this is one act of cynicism too far. Ordinary Japanese, increasingly disillusioned with their country's politics, may think so too.

""NOT trusted"" is how Japan's Prime Minister Taro Aso described stockbrokers this month, before calling them kabuya, or ""wide boys"".

New trading accounts are being opened at an unusually quick pace. Monex, the biggest online broker, doubled the number of new accounts in the last three months of 2008 to 210,000, as the market hit a two-decade trough. Nomura, the biggest broker, had a sudden 20% surge in new accounts. For the first time in 18 years, Japanese retail investors ended the year having bought more shares than they sold. They have been net buyers so far this year as well. 
The trend is not nearly powerful enough to call a market bottom. Although the number of retail accounts has increased, their trading activity has not, suggesting many are still being cautious. Those who have taken the plunge have suffered; even after the recent rally, the Nikkei 225 Stock Average has fallen by 7% this year. The difference between sellers and buyers is small--5-10% since November--and trading activity among individuals was low to start with, so only a small shift in trading volumes can tip the trend from net seller to net buyer.
A lot rests on Mrs Watanabe, the fabled retail punter who plays the markets while running her household's finances. Since the stockmarket bubble burst in 1990, its value remains at a quarter of its peak.

Moreover, share prices may gain if the government becomes a buyer (as it did during recessions in the 1950s and 1960s). It wants to. Banks and insurance firms own 15% of the market by value; giving the market a lift would be a big fillip for them.

AFTER months on the back foot, the government led by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has regained the tactical advantage before a general election that Taro Aso, Japan's prime minister, has to call by September. The government is betraying a measure of competence in the face of the county's abrupt economic slowdown. In particular, the extra budget which the finance minister, Kaoru Yosano, unveiled in April could provide a useful stimulus of 2-3% of GDP in ways not very beholden to the party's usual interests. Mr Aso's approval ratings have risen from abysmal lows, helped by his robust stance in the face of a rocket that North Korea fired over Japan on April 5th.
Yet Mr Aso has benefited most from the main opposition leader, Ichiro Ozawa, wreaking damage on his own Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ). In March Tokyo prosecutors indicted his political secretary, Takanori Okubo, for accepting illegal funds from a construction company with a history of lining politicians' pockets. Mr Ozawa has since neither resigned nor backed up his claim to be as pure as driven snow. Until the scandal, the general election looked likely to be a walkover for the DPJ, sweeping away a political system that has kept the LDP in near continuous power for more than half a century. Now voters are turning against Mr Ozawa. Two-thirds of those asked say he should resign.
For some in the DPJ, this is the realisation of a long-feared nightmare. For years, even when he used to be in the LDP, Mr Ozawa saw Japan's need for competitive two-party politics. He has long vowed to bring such a system about. Yet the scandal is a reminder that his politics remain an old-fashioned mix of money and power to bring home the bacon to his base in north-eastern Honshu, Japan's main island. Few DPJ modernisers openly decry his style because his efforts have also transformed a party of the urban middle class into a national force with broad rural support.
With the opposition in disarray, Mr Aso has the luxury of choice. Either he can push the stimulus through the lower house of the Diet (parliament) in May and then call a snap election--colleagues favour June 7th. Or he can bide his time in the hope of seeing DPJ anguish worsen. Prosecutors may present more details of Mr Okubo's case in June, after which the options for Mr Ozawa may narrow. Mr Aso also appears to crave the prestige of attending the G8 summit in Italy in July. Tokyo metropolitan elections that month will command all the energies of the LDP's junior coalition partner, New Komeito. So Mr Aso may favour an August election. For now, he is keeping his own counsel.
Diminishing prospects of a clear victory for the opposition DPJ, which controls the Diet's upper house, have led to a return of talk of a post-election ""grand coalition"" to break the deadlock. This is the favoured solution of the establishment's dinosaurs--octogenarian newspaper publishers and former prime ministers--who think that they should be arranging the affairs of state and who constantly meddle in politics as kingmakers. It is a solution proposed briefly by Mr Ozawa in late 2007, much to the horror of his party. But it does little to further the hope that politics might become more accountable.
The DPJ's agony over Mr Ozawa has yet to show itself in public. If he goes, he may intend to hand over to the party's secretary-general, Yukio Hatoyama, and then wield power from behind the throne. Yet many will call for someone outside the Ozawa orbit to lead the party, in which case Katsuya Okada, a 55-year-old former leader, is the favourite. The upright Mr Okada says that the DPJ should take two issues to the enemy's camp in the election campaign: ending the baneful practice, so common in the LDP, of political seats becoming inherited family sinecures, and banning all corporate donations. 
The second of these issues might look awfully like an attack on Mr Ozawa. Yet Mr Okada shies from launching an open challenge. He says that half of his constituents berate him for being hard on Mr Ozawa, while the other half urge him to contest the leadership. Yet, typical of Mr Okada's ambivalence, he insists Mr Ozawa himself is all for banning corporate donations. An open split, says Mr Okada, who led the DPJ to abject defeat in the previous election, ""would ruin our chances of taking over the government."" So might the DPJ's dithering over the future of Mr Ozawa, not for nothing called ""the Destroyer"".

If he goes , he may intend to hand over to the party 's secretary - general , Yukio Hatoyama , and then wield power from behind the throne . Yet many will call for someone outside the Ozawa orbit to lead the party , in which case Katsuya Okada , a 55 - year - old former leader , is the favourite . The upright Mr Okada says that the DPJ should take two issues to the enemy 's camp in the election campaign : ending the baneful practice , so common in the LDP , of political seats becoming inherited family sinecures , and banning all corporate donations . 
 The second of these issues might look awfully like an attack on Mr Ozawa . Yet Mr Okada shies from launching an open challenge . He says that half of his constituents berate him for being hard on Mr Ozawa , while the other half urge him to contest the leadership . Yet , typical of Mr Okada 's ambivalence , he insists Mr Ozawa himself is all for banning corporate donations . An open split , says Mr Okada , who led the DPJ to abject defeat in the previous election , "" would ruin our chances of taking over the government . "" So might the DPJ 's dithering over the future of Mr Ozawa , not for nothing called "" the Destroyer "" .

HOSTILITY toward Japan runs high in China. The history of the harsh occupation during the 1930s and 1940s is neither forgotten nor forgiven. So it should come as little surprise that ""City of Life and Death"", a new film about one of the most gruesome chapters of that history, the 1937 Japanese assault on the city of Nanjing, has done well in China, earning $10m in the first week since its release. But it must have irked Japan's prime minister, Taro Aso, that the film was released on the eve of his first visit to China since taking office last September. 
The range of issues confronting the two countries is daunting. Territorial disputes, North Korea's continued dalliances with long-range missiles and nuclear bombs, and bilateral trade tensions demand attention, along with the global economic crisis and swine flu. But their shared past is always near the surface. 
Mr Aso himself has helped keep it there. A week before the visit he donated a potted plant to Tokyo's Yasukuni shrine, where Japan's war dead are honoured, including 14 convicted war criminals from the second world war. Unlike some of Mr Aso's predecessors, he did not visit the shrine himself. But the move was not well received in China. Nor, however, was it met with the sort of scathing rebuke that was once obligatory.
In years past Chinese leaders and the state-controlled press were quick to use such incidents to whip up popular resentment against Japan. Spurred on by the press (and by Japan's own refusal fully to confront its wartime past), angry Chinese were unobstructed as they organised boycotts of Japanese goods and demonstrated, sometimes violently, against Japanese institutions. 
Official anti-Japan rhetoric was noticeably toned down in the two years before last year's Beijing Olympics, perhaps out of a desire to ensure a sportsmanlike reception for Japanese athletes and spectators. The games are now past, but the pressing need for a modicum of harmony in which to navigate the financial crisis together may be enough to keep the lid on all that unhappy history.
For Chinese who have seen ""City of Life and Death"", what stands out most is its sympathetic portrayal of a Japanese soldier. This is a novel twist for Chinese treatments of the subject, and the film's official sanction suggests a desire to promote more nuanced views. But the time may not be ripe. Lu Chuan, the film's director, has received death threats and accusations of being a traitor and a stooge for Japanese revisionists.","Trying to escape history

IT HAD been purring along nicely, handling the twists and turns of the world economy, powering past rivals, inspiring envy. But in recession Germany's export-led model is sputtering more than most. The European Commission now expects German output to shrink by 5.4% this year, compared with a 4% drop in the European Union overall; the German government predicts a 6% plunge. Most of the contraction will be in exports. 
Countries with similar models are thinking of trading them in. It is ""no longer realistic to hope that Japan's growth can come back just by exporting the same products,"" the Japanese prime minister, Taro Aso, told Handelsblatt newspaper. Philipp Hildebrand, president of Switzerland's central bank, expressed similar doubts. Germany's economic press is peppered with articles asserting that the country ""needs a new business model"". 
Most German leaders disagree. The two main parties in the grand coalition, Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Social Democratic Party (SPD), are sniping before the federal election in September, but they are united in believing that exports must remain the foundation of German prosperity. Germany, unlike other rich countries, has avoided deindustrialisation, they point out. With a rapidly ageing population, it is also right to accumulate savings by running a current-account surplus. Its scant natural resources and tradition of openness point the economy towards trade. Besides, Germany just isn't that into services, which have displaced industry in other countries. 
This model could now change in one of three ways. The government could pursue an industrial policy that favoured production for the home market. To most Germans that would seem bizarre, though there is scope for creating service jobs in education or care for the elderly. Or the government could promote consumption by keeping fiscal policy relatively loose. But given German allergy to debt that is unlikely. Or change could come through a slowdown in world trade and a correction of international imbalances. This seems by far the most likely course. Germany will not deliberately surrender its position as the world's top exporter of goods, says Bert Rurup, a former head of the government's committee of economic ""wise men"" now at AWD Holding, a financial-advice firm. But its current-account surplus may fall as profligates like the United States and Britain consume less and export more. 
Germany is export champion largely because it has done many things right. After losing competitiveness for years, industry clawed it back by holding down wage rises and shifting some production abroad. Germany now has ""the lowest increase in unit labour costs of all its main trading partners,"" says Mr Rurup. The previous SPD-Green coalition sought to reduce joblessness by trimming unemployment benefits and deregulating the labour market. Its successor has slashed the budget deficit, partly by increasing value-added tax by three points. German consumers stayed thrifty as consumers from San Sebastian to San Francisco binged on debt. 
The result of this self-restraint was that exports soared in real terms, whereas consumer spending barely budged (see chart). Between 2004 and 2007 net exports accounted for 60% of growth. Germany's current-account surplus reached a hefty 6% of GDP last year, irritating its trading partners within the euro area, which have been unwilling to hold down wages but can no longer resort to devaluation. Rather like China and Japan, virtuous Germany has made its living out of the overindulgence of others. 
That was not a worry when times were good, but it is now. Exports will fall by nearly 19% this year, according to government forecasters. Germany's debt-free households, by contrast, will cut spending by just 0.1%. The export-led recession has hurt its most prosperous regions and better-paid workers, which may be one reason why the public outcry has been muted. But recovery will not be quick. Some international trade ""will disappear forever,"" says Marek Belka, director of the IMF's European department. Vehicles, machinery and chemicals account for nearly two-thirds of exports, a narrow base for the prosperity of the world's fourth-largest economy. Vehicle manufacturing is highly vulnerable. Too many factories and workers are making too many cars globally; Germany will surely be forced to close down some production. 
When recovery comes, consumption is likely to play a bigger part than exports. By 2013, net exports will account for 3.25% of GDP, down from 6.3% in 2008, says a forecast by eight economic institutes. Consumer spending, meanwhile, will rise from 56.3% of GDP to 57.75%. This shift will occur amid sluggish growth and lower employment: the trend rate of growth between 2008 and 2013 will be 0.9%, compared with average growth of 1.5% in 1995-2008, say the institutes. 
Do not expect the government to encourage the change, however. Even as they battle to save carmakers like Opel, the German arm of General Motors, politicians dream of the world champions that may replace them. The SPD's campaign programme rhapsodises about ""climate and environmental technology"" in which Germany supposedly has a competitive edge. IW Consult, part of the business-friendly Cologne Institute of the German Economy, thinks the growth industries will be pharmaceuticals, measurement technology and business services. 
A government worried that growth is skewed towards exports could redress the balance by cutting taxes or raising spending. Dirk Schumacher, an economist at Goldman Sachs, says that the rise in VAT was a ""big policy mistake"" that squeezed consumption and also helped to undermine support for further economic reforms. He thinks the government should give low- and middle-income earners extra tax relief, even after the economy starts to recover. Ms Merkel may yield to pressure from the CDU's liberal wing to make this the centrepiece of her election platform. 
In the end, fiscal prudence will win out. The contraction of GDP plus the government's two fiscal-stimulus packages will push the budget from balance in 2008 to a deficit of nearly 6% of GDP in 2010. The next government is likely to want to pare that back. Both governing parties back an amendment to the constitution to bar the federal government from running big deficits in most circumstances (and state governments from incurring any at all) after 2016. Tax will not be cut as a share of GDP, predicts Mr Rurup. The title of export champion may have lost its glitter, but Germany will not give it up lightly.","The German habit of relying on export-led growth comes under fire

THERE is no revolution at the barricades, and on an early-summer Sunday the homeless in Tokyo's Yoyogi park form a polite long queue for the bento (packed lunch) boxes being handed out by a schoolgirl from a local church: the deepest bows come from those at the back who go away empty-handed. Yet as far as the problems of a rich country go, it is hard to exaggerate Japan's.
The global slump has hit the economy far harder than the famous bursting of its bubble did two decades ago. Government debt stands at twice the economy's annual output, dwarfing even Italy's. The export-led growth which drove a six-year recovery after 2002 has proved a chimera. Now, as Japan's 127m-strong population is set to fall, some predict, by more than a third over the next few decades, the working-age population will fall fastest, before a way has been found to pay for all the grey heads. Yet, under a nutty-sounding new policy the government is quietly bribing South American immigrants of Japanese extraction to return home for good. Other solutions to the crisis proposed by members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) include creating a brand-new currency, with which to flood the economy. Much else about the LDP is either crackpot or forlorn, suggesting that Japan's problems are political at root. And now, for the first time in Japan's post-war history, an opposition offers a feasible alternative to the LDP, which has run Japan for all but ten months since 1955. 
Until this week, however, which brought the resignation of Ichiro Ozawa, imperious leader of the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), that feasibility had once again been in doubt. Victory in the general election, which the prime minister, Taro Aso, is bound to call by September, was the DPJ's to lose. Mr Ozawa seemed determined to lose it. Not for nothing is he known as ""the Destroyer"". This spring he was implicated in a fund-raising scandal, in which an aide was indicted for receiving illegal donations from a construction company. That went down poorly with voters, underscoring how much Mr Ozawa's politics were still rooted in the murk of back rooms. 
The 66-year-old Mr Ozawa had started out in the LDP, where his rise was as astounding as the quantities of enemies he made. Earlier than any politician, he had articulated the need for political reform and for Japan to come out from under its pacifist constitution to chart a more ""normal"" course in foreign affairs, shouldering more of the burden of its own defence. He defected from the LDP in 1993 and, as the DPJ's head, has turned the party into a national force not just among the urban middle classes but in rural regions too. The strategy paid off in 2007, when the party won control of the upper house of the Diet (parliament), throwing the LDP into disarray. It is on its third prime minister since.
The latest scandal, however, had turned Mr Ozawa into an electoral liability for the DPJ. Stepping down may prove to be a rare constructive act in the Destroyer's career. His successor will present a fresh start in promoting a reformist agenda of fixing the pension and health systems, providing jobs and making government and bureaucracy more accountable. 
""Fresh"", however, is hardly the apt term for the two contenders for the leadership, to be decided on May 16th. One, Yukio Hatoyama, the secretary-general, is closely associated with the former leader and will be backed by Mr Ozawa's henchmen. Mr Ozawa himself may expect to wield more power from behind the throne than on it. The other, Katsuya Okada, led the DPJ to a crushing defeat in 2005 by the LDP under its former prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi. Fatally, he opposed Mr Koizumi's popular plans to privatise the postal-savings system. Both DPJ contenders are charisma-light insiders. But at least Mr Okada, who has admitted his 2005 electoral blunder, has hit a nerve in promising to campaign against the practice, common among LDP political families, of treating Diet seats as heritable sinecures. Over half Mr Aso's cabinet are the offspring of former politicians. Searching for the new
Even so, the DPJ hardly offers a clean break with the sordid past. Like its predecessor as pretender to the LDP's crown, the Socialist Party, it has tended to be a rather tame opposition. Many of its members, indeed, are ex-Socialists. Others, Mr Hatoyama and Mr Okada included, are from the LDP. Mr Hatoyama has a brother in the cabinet. His grandfather, Ichiro Hatoyama, was an LDP founding father and arch-rival to Japan's most notable prime minister after the war, Shigeru Yoshida. Mr Yoshida, as it happens, was Mr Aso's grandfather, so this summer's election may play out as family rivalry. Further, the political careers of both Mr Hatoyama and Mr Okada have been bankrolled by immense family fortunes, just like those of many in the LDP. Plus ca change.
With Mr Ozawa gone, establishment meddlers, such as retired prime ministers and media magnates, will redouble efforts to get the LDP to propose a post-election ""grand coalition"" with the DPJ. After all, many have long viewed it as merely an errant LDP faction. Elsewhere, modernisers within the LDP are pondering defecting to the DPJ. Given the DPJ's inexperience--one reason why it depended so on Mr Ozawa--they might be welcome.
So the big test facing the DPJ is to dispel the suspicion that politics in Japan, more than any other rich democracy, is a top-down business arranged by a self-selecting elite, which rarely informs the public of its actions, much less consults them. Voters, of course, have in part themselves to blame for this. To date, they have too readily accepted what they are given, even when the political bento boxes prove empty. When they line up at the ballot boxes this summer, a resounding vote for the DPJ would show Japanese politicians they are accountable after all, and offer a chance to see if the DPJ can keep its promises. It might even elicit an explanation as to how the party is to pay for them. author
Caption: Economist.com/blogs/banyan","The need for change in Japan is pressing , but the callow opposition hardly seems up to the job 
 THERE is no revolution at the barricades , and on an early - summer Sunday the homeless in Tokyo 's Yoyogi park form a polite long queue for the bento ( packed lunch ) boxes being handed out by a schoolgirl from a local church : the deepest bows come from those at the back who go away empty - handed . Yet as far as the problems of a rich country go , it is hard to exaggerate Japan 's . 
 The global slump has hit the economy far harder than the famous bursting of its bubble did two decades ago . Government debt stands at twice the economy 's annual output , dwarfing even Italy 's . The export - led growth which drove a six - year recovery after 2002 has proved a chimera . Now , as Japan 's 127m - strong population is set to fall , some predict , by more than a third over the next few decades , the working - age population will fall fastest , before a way has been found to pay for all the grey heads . Yet , under a nutty - sounding new policy the government is quietly bribing South American immigrants of Japanese extraction to return home for good . Other solutions to the crisis proposed by members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) include creating a brand - new currency , with which to flood the economy . Much else about the LDP is either crackpot or forlorn , suggesting that Japan 's problems are political at root . And now , for the first time in Japan 's post - war history , an opposition offers a feasible alternative to the LDP , which has run Japan for all but ten months since 1955 . 
 Until this week , however , which brought the resignation of Ichiro Ozawa , imperious leader of the opposition Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) , that feasibility had once again been in doubt . Victory in the general election , which Taro Aso is bound to call by September , was the DPJ 's to lose . Mr Ozawa seemed determined to lose it . Not for nothing is he known as "" the Destroyer "" . This spring he was implicated in a fund - raising scandal , in which an aide was indicted for receiving illegal donations from a construction company . That went down poorly with voters , underscoring how much Mr Ozawa 's politics were still rooted in the murk of back rooms . 
 The 66 - year - old Mr Ozawa had started out in the LDP , where his rise was as astounding as the quantities of enemies he made . Earlier than any politician , he had articulated the need for political reform and for Japan to come out from under its pacifist constitution to chart a more "" normal "" course in foreign affairs , shouldering more of the burden of its own defence . He defected from the LDP in 1993 and , as the DPJ 's head , has turned the party into a national force not just among the urban middle classes but in rural regions too . The strategy paid off in 2007 , when the party won control of the upper house of the Diet ( parliament ) , throwing the LDP into disarray . It is on its third prime minister since . 
 The latest scandal , however , had turned Mr Ozawa into an electoral liability for the DPJ . Stepping down may prove to be a rare constructive act in the Destroyer 's career .

THE Japanese public received a rare glimpse of parliamentary debate on May 27th, when Yukio Hatoyama, the new head of Japan's main opposition, the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), squared off against Taro Aso, the prime minister and head of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). With an election to be called by September, at which the LDP is expected to lose power after 54 years of almost uninterrupted rule, this duel had been awaited eagerly. Many considered it an appetiser for an unusually engrossing Japanese election campaign. Moreover, the battle had history: Messrs Hatoyama and Aso are grandsons of two former Japanese prime ministers who were themselves bitter rivals.
Yet the leaders personified their parties' shortcomings, with Mr Aso as the haughty old pro against Mr Hatoyama, a naive idealist. ""A politics of friendship and love,"" is how the 62-year-old Mr Hatoyama described his political ideal. Mr Aso flashed a characteristic sneer at this, but volunteered no alternative vision. 
In a negative way, the two leaders also represent the country's disaffection with politics. More than half of Japanese want neither for their next prime minister, according to an opinion poll commissioned by Nikkei, a newspaper. But Mr Hatoyama, whom 29% of respondents opted for, came off better than Mr Aso, whom only 16% wanted as their leader. That was a big improvement for the DPJ on the ratings of their previous leader, Ichiro Ozawa, who resigned on May 11th after a fund-raising scandal involving his main political aide. A survey conducted in April found that only 9% wished to be led by Mr Ozawa. 
But the memory of his leadership still haunts the DPJ and may damage its electoral prospects. Mr Ozawa arranged for Mr Hatoyama, a loyal lieutenant, to be his successor. Upon taking the reins he returned the favour by asking Mr Ozawa to oversee the party's election strategy. So Mr Ozawa--who is said to have kept control over the DPJ's budget, personnel appointments and policy decisions--has retained a good deal of his former power even as he has sought to escape the glare of public scrutiny. For example, he has stopped calling the weekly press conferences that top party officials routinely hold. 
Whether Mr Hatoyama will emerge as his own man or a puppet of Mr Ozawa is unclear. He may feel that since he does not represent the clean break that voters hoped for, he should promulgate a more reformist agenda than his predecessor did. Meanwhile he may spend much energy holding his party together; a jumble of former leftist politicians, bankers and bureaucrats, it is sorely divided.
If neither party wins a decent majority in the election, there may be more of this complexity, with both looking to bolster themselves with support from smaller parties--or breakaway factions of each other. The man Mr Hatoyama beat to lead the DPJ (but who is preferred by voters), Katsuya Okada, is already scouring Japan's smaller parties for potential allies. 
The LDP is also readying for battle. It recently issued its parliamentarians with a three-volume manual on such matters as ""using manners to win people's hearts"", which urges members to practise smiling in front of a mirror each day. If its advice can help Mr Aso refrain from sniggering during future debates, it would be welcome, with leaders of both parties hoping to see these take place twice a month. Regular debates would represent a refreshing change in Japanese politics. If they were to involve discussion of serious issues, so much the better; but on past form that is sadly a lot to hope for.

2009-06-27,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/223985272/fulltext/C268B60B8CD94426PQ/19?accountid=14657,"No other German politician comes close to matching her popularity. How does she do it? And what does her ascendancy say about her country?
WHAT oratory is to Barack Obama, the photo-opportunity is to Angela Merkel. In a red parka before a receding iceberg in Greenland; among dark-suited world leaders, one of them yet distinctive in her signature trouser-suit; sombre in black alongside Mr Obama at the Buchenwald memorial site. Through such images, the chancellor has defined herself in the eyes of her fellow Germans as a leader who holds her own in the highest councils and masters the knottiest problems. On June 25th and 26th, as The Economist went to press, Ms Merkel was scheduled to visit Mr Obama in Washington, which will no doubt produce another flattering harvest. 
This will matter in the federal election three months later. On September 27th Ms Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) will face off against the Social Democratic Party (SPD), currently its reluctant partner in Germany's ""grand coalition"" government. Each hopes to jettison the other and form a coalition with a like-minded smaller partner. Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the SPD foreign minister, aspires to lead a coalition with the Greens (and, if necessary, the liberal Free Democratic Party, or FDP). The conservative CDU prefers to govern with the liberals alone. Along with its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), it will publish its campaign platform on June 29th. But the CDU's trump card is Ms Merkel herself. Supporters wear orange T-shirts with the legend ""teAM Deutschland"", exploiting her initials. She is the clear front-runner, and may yet succeed in forming a ""bourgeois"" coalition with the FDP. 
On several counts, that result would be surprising. Germany's export-dependent economy, the world's fourth-largest, will contract by 6.1% this year compared with a 4.8% drop in the Eurozone overall, according to the OECD. Abroad, Ms Merkel has been blasted for doing too little about that. Germany does not comprehend the ""importance of fiscal mobilisation"" (ie, it is not spending enough), complained Japan's prime minister, Taro Aso, before a crisis summit in April. Perhaps that is because Ms Merkel herself ""does not seem to understand the basics of economic policy"", speculated Adam Posen of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. Mr Obama will no doubt be more polite, but he is likely to press Ms Merkel to do more in Afghanistan and to accept prisoners from Guantanamo Bay. 
What foreigners denounce as cluelessness Germans see as cool-headedness. Nearly 60% are satisfied with the grand coalition, according to a recent poll by Forschungsgruppe Wahlen; 78% think Ms Merkel has done well as chancellor and 58% want her to remain in the job. Change, if it happens, is unlikely to be the sort one expects during a crisis of capitalism. The most probable alternative to the status quo is a coalition with the business-friendly FDP, which favours lower taxes, freer markets and more limited government. 
Events could upset this placid scenario. Exporters and their suppliers will eventually be forced to sack workers on a large scale. By the end of 2010, predicts the OECD, the number of unemployed will rise to 5.1m from last year's average of 3.3m. On election day voters could already be in a vengeful mood. But time is running out for the chancellor's foes. Ms Merkel, who took up politics at the advanced age of 35, is likely to govern Germany for the next four years. A woman of mystery
Though she has been in office nearly that long, she remains a puzzle. Germans find it easier to say what she is not than what she is. She is certainly not a towering chancellor in the mould of Konrad Adenauer or Helmut Kohl. ""Iron lady"" does not fit. Nor is she a great communicator. Pundits plead for a blood-sweat-and-tears speech on the economic crisis, but she has yet to deliver it. She does not exude maternal warmth. Ideology is not her strong point.
Her offbeat biography adds to the difficulty of pinning her down. Her election in 2005 as Germany's first female chancellor and the first from the ex-communist east had Obama-esque novelty. The daughter of a Protestant pastor who migrated east, she leads a party whose core is Catholic and whose roots are in western Germany. The fall of the Berlin Wall drew her into politics and Mr Kohl propelled her towards the top, naming her minister for women and youth in his third cabinet. Physics preceded politics in her career; its analytical habits still shape her style of governing. And yet Ms Merkel, who has been spotted doing her own shopping, connects with voters. People think of her as ""the matriarch who takes care of them,"" says Manfred Gullner of Forsa, a polling firm. Without charisma, she contrives to shine.
She starts the electoral season with a hoard of political capital. The football World Cup, hosted by Germany in the summer of 2006, seven months after she took office, bathed the country and the chancellor in laid-back patriotism. In 2007 Germany assumed the rotating presidency of the European Union (for six months) and presided over the G8 summit of the world's biggest economies, allowing Ms Merkel to display a flair for statesmanship. For nearly three years the economy was benign. Buoyed by world trade, economic growth averaged 2.3% from 2006 to 2008, the highest rate this decade. Unemployment fell from nearly 5m in 2005 to around 3m. Before the crisis the federal government was within sight of its cherished goal of balancing its budget by 2011. 
The gravest charge against Ms Merkel is that she amassed too much political capital and spent too little. She campaigned for the chancellorship (and nearly lost) as a determined reformer who would unshackle enterprise, unburden taxpayers and "" govern through"" all obstacles. The tax code should be simple enough to fit on a beer mat, her party declared. But she quickly adapted to the constraints of the grand coalition, forced upon her by the CDU's narrow victory. She stands accused of governing less as a leader than as a moderator, brokering compromises among the coalition's warring factions and then claiming credit for whatever emerges. 
To many, the results have been disappointing. The SPD entered the grand coalition with an acute case of reformers' remorse. Under Ms Merkel's predecessor, Gerhard Schroder, the SPD and its Green allies enacted necessary but unpopular changes to welfare and labour markets collectively known as Agenda 2010, which nearly tore the SPD apart. Demoted to junior status in Ms Merkel's government, it had no desire to repeat the experience. Despite majorities (at first) in both houses of the legislature, the grand coalition passed just one big-ticket reform in the spirit of Agenda 2010, a gradual rise in the retirement age to 67. 
More often, with Ms Merkel's help, it rolled back reform. It lengthened the time for paying unemployment benefits to older workers, offered pensioners relief from rising prices and introduced minimum wages in half a dozen industries, including postal and security services. Sitting out trouble
Despite the incessant deal-making, much of Berlin's political class is feeling sour. The SPD resents Ms Merkel for stealing its clothes. The CDU's ""economic wing"" thinks she has pandered too much to the SPD. The CSU, struggling to stay on top in Bavaria, defies the chancellor on taxes, health policy and anything else it thinks will pacify touchy constituents. Tensions over policy have grown with the sinking of the world economy. Liberals who saw an ally in her feel let down. Ms Merkel ""has not said a dumb sentence in three-and-a-half years,"" says Michael Eilfort of the Market Economy Foundation in Berlin. ""But there seems to be no theme for which she has an enduring passion."" 
A reputation for wishy-washiness could cause problems. Mr Steinmeier has begun to hammer away at her leadership style, which he describes as ""wait, watch, then jump on the bandwagon"". Germany's consensus system of governance makes it difficult for any chancellor to impose his or her will, but Ms Merkel seems particularly disinclined. She learnt from Mr Kohl to ""sit problems out"", says Gerd Langguth, a political scientist who has written her biography. Unlike her mentor, though, she has ""no sense of historical mission"" and ""no vision of society"". Rather, she is a thoroughgoing pragmatist who ""wants to solve today's problems in such a way that she remains in power."" 
Yet Ms Merkel has two traits that partly absolve her of the charge of being a soulless pragmatist. The first is what Mr Langguth calls her ""fixed points"", most of which are connected to Germany's relations with the rest of the world. Like many central Europeans liberated from communism, she is instinctively pro-American and warier of Russia than many mainstream German politicians (though American banks and Russian gas have tempered both instincts). She has rebuked the main powers for abusing human rights, receiving the Dalai Lama at the chancellery and calling on the United States to close Guantanamo. She can be counted on to resist attempts by fellow leaders, such as France's Nicolas Sarkozy, to split the 27-member European Union into separate clubs. 
Though an easterner, Ms Merkel has embraced the western German sense of responsibility for the Holocaust and is a staunch backer of Israel. Recently she upbraided the pope for re-admitting to the Catholic fold a Holocaust-denying bishop. This offended the CDU's base of conservative Catholics, who have trouble enough relating to a divorced-and-remarried, childless, Protestant career woman from the east. Where Mr Kohl was ""married"" to the party Ms Merkel is merely ""allied"" to it, says Mr Langguth. But she is indispensable: with the backing of 35% of the electorate, the CDU is far less popular than she is. Eyes on the future
Nor is Ms Merkel without vision. It is trained on the distant future, in particular on two issues whose consequences will be felt after her political career is over: climate change and demographic decline. As environment minister in the mid-1990s she helped negotiate the Kyoto protocol to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. At her prompting, the EU committed itself to cutting emissions by 20% by 2020 (more if other developed countries agree to do so) and to supplying 20% of its energy from renewable sources by the same year. Germany is to be a model. Its own climate package mandates, among other things, a 30% improvement in buildings' energy efficiency. The national goal is to cut emissions 40% by the 2020 deadline. 
The second worry that underlies Ms Merkel's policies is population decline. Within 30 years the proportion of Germans older than 65 will rise from a fifth to a third, and the population will shrink by a tenth. The younger generation will look different. In big cities today nearly half the children under 15 are immigrants or their children and grandchildren. In general, they are poorer, worse educated and more likely to be unemployed than non-immigrants. Germany needs more workers and better brains. 
Ms Merkel has made a start. She appointed as family minister a glamorous mother of seven, Ursula von der Leyen, who introduced ""parents' pay"", a 14-month stipend for parents of newborn children linked to their salaries, encouraging middle-class women especially to combine family and career. To bolster the woefully underdeveloped day-care system, a new law promises to provide enough places for 35% of children aged three or less by 2013.
Ms Merkel's campaign to turn Germany into an ""education republic"" has made less progress, partly because primary and secondary education is the province of the states. But her government recently approved EUR 18 billion ($25 billion) of extra funding for research and universities, a noteworthy promise at a time of spiralling debt (
). It produced a EUR 750m ""national integration plan"" to promote jobs and education for minorities, for example by expanding compulsory German-language and culture courses. 
Mrs von der Leyen says her boss has modernised her traditionalist party as well as the country. Thanks to her, ""We've gone from saying 'We're not an immigration country' to accepting that we are one."" In the CDU day care is ""no longer a taboo. Without Ms Merkel that would have been unthinkable,"" she says. The chancellor sees herself, one suspects, as a latter-day philosophe, who seeks cures for society's ills in reason and science. Balancing the bail-outs
Her achievements in such areas lag behind her ambitions. Universities remain under-funded. Integration has progressed slowly. The government offended Turks by changing the immigration law to require migrants from poor countries to pass a language test before joining their spouses in Germany. Last year the number of immigrants obtaining German citizenship fell to its lowest level since unification. When far-sightedness crumples into ordinary opportunism, Ms Merkel disappoints. Saying climate protection cannot come at the expense of German jobs, she pushed for looser emissions standards for carmakers, putting the EU's overall emissions targets in jeopardy, says Jeroen Verhoeven of Friends of the Earth in Brussels. To Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, head of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, who advises her on climate issues, these are merely tactical compromises. Though willing to take detours, Ms Merkel ""never loses sight of where she wants to go."" 
If she wins re-election, she will have a chance to prove him right. But first she must ensure that voters do not punish her for a recession that is striking Germany with particular force. It helps that most see the downturn as a shoddy American import and have yet to feel its full impact. Credit and blame must also be shared with the SPD. Yet Ms Merkel knows that crisis management is ultimately her responsibility; if it is seen to fail she is likely to as well.
In some ways, her task is more difficult than Mr Obama's or Mr Sarkozy's. The economic slump is frightening, but to Germans the threats of inflation and ballooning government debt seem hardly less so. For Ms Merkel this means that over-reacting to the crisis is as much a danger as under-reacting. She thinks her government has struck a balance with three sorts of bail-out: of banks, of non-bank enterprises and of the economy as a whole. But in each case she risks getting the balance wrong.
That is especially true for banks. Ms Merkel and the finance minister, Peer Steinbruck, niftily headed off a banking panic last October by guaranteeing depositors' savings and rushing a EUR 500 billion banking rescue through the Bundestag. But their proposals to shift banks' bad assets into ""bad banks"" would oblige them to pay off the losses over 20 years. That will make it hard for them to become good banks capable of attracting fresh capital.
A pair of stimulus packages worth EUR 64 billion this year and next includes tax cuts, subsidies to keep workers in their jobs and a wildly popular EUR 2,500 ""bonus"" paid to drivers who scrap old cars and buy new ones. Germans insist this is plenty. Tax cuts and extra spending add up to 1.6% of GDP this year and 2% in 2010, reckons the IMF, not counting automatic stabilisers such as unemplyment insurance. But some trading partners still think Germany could do more, given its huge current-account surplus and its (pre-crisis) balanced budget. 
Within Germany the big wedge issue has been rescues of non-financial enterprises. A EUR 115 billion ""Germany fund"" provides guarantees and credits to companies that are in trouble through no fault of their own. Mr Steinmeier has vowed to ""fight for every job"", backed by CDU premiers when the jobs in question are in their states. Other conservatives fret that the government is throwing taxpayers' money away. Ms Merkel opted for a typical middle course, saying yes to a bail-out of Opel, the European arm of America's bankrupt General Motors, but no to Arcandor, a department-store group. 
Messy, hesitant and opportunistic though the triple bail-out may be, it has not yet harmed Ms Merkel's standing with the voters. They continue to see her caution as wisdom, her penchant for splitting the difference as discernment. In resisting foreign demands to do more she is seen as standing up for German interests. If she did that stridently, Germans would be uneasy; perhaps because she is a woman, the perception is she does not. The moderating style that Mr Steinmeier sneers at is read by voters as a sensible reluctance to polarise. 
In the early days of the recession, there were fears that Germans would react by rejecting their leaders and, indeed, the economic system that produced it. But it turns out that they are not keen to experiment in troubled times. Ms Merkel has encouraged that response by doing enough so far to contain the crisis while reaffirming bedrock German principles, such as the social-market economy. Germans trust the canny physicist from the east. Now she means to press that advantage home.

Through such images, the chancellor has defined herself in the eyes of her fellow Germans as a leader who holds her own in the highest councils and masters the knottiest problems. On June 25th and 26th, as The Economist went to press, Ms Merkel was scheduled to visit Mr Obama in Washington, which will no doubt produce another flattering harvest. 
This will matter in the federal election three months later. On September 27th Ms Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) will face off against the Social Democratic Party (SPD), currently its reluctant partner in Germany's ""grand coalition"" government. Each hopes to jettison the other and form a coalition with a like-minded smaller partner. Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the SPD foreign minister, aspires to lead a coalition with the Greens (and, if necessary, the liberal Free Democratic Party, or FDP). The conservative CDU prefers to govern with the liberals alone. Along with its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), it will publish its campaign platform on June 29th. But the CDU's trump card is Ms Merkel herself. Supporters wear orange T-shirts with the legend ""teAM Deutschland"", exploiting her initials. She is the clear front-runner, and may yet succeed in forming a ""bourgeois"" coalition with the FDP. 
On several counts, that result would be surprising. Germany's export-dependent economy, the world's fourth-largest, will contract by 6.1% this year compared with a 4.8% drop in the Eurozone overall, according to the OECD. Abroad, Ms Merkel has been blasted for doing too little about that. Germany does not comprehend the ""importance of fiscal mobilisation"" (ie, it is not spending enough), complained Japan's prime minister, Taro Aso, before a crisis summit in April. Perhaps that is because Ms Merkel herself ""does not seem to understand the basics of economic policy"", speculated Adam Posen of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. Mr Obama will no doubt be more polite, but he is likely to press Ms Merkel to do more in Afghanistan and to accept prisoners from Guantanamo Bay. 
What foreigners denounce as cluelessness Germans see as cool-headedness. Nearly 60% are satisfied with the grand coalition, according to a recent poll by Forschungsgruppe Wahlen; 78% think Ms Merkel has done well as chancellor and 58% want her to remain in the job. Change, if it happens, is unlikely to be the sort one expects during a crisis of capitalism. The most probable alternative to the status quo is a coalition with the business-friendly FDP, which favours lower taxes, freer markets and more limited government. 
Events could upset this placid scenario. Exporters and their suppliers will eventually be forced to sack workers on a large scale. By the end of 2010, predicts the OECD, the number of unemployed will rise to 5.1m from last year's average of 3.3m. On election day voters could already be in a vengeful mood. But time is running out for the chancellor's foes. Ms Merkel, who took up politics at the advanced age of 35, is likely to govern Germany for the next four years. A woman of mystery
Though she has been in office nearly that long, she remains a puzzle. Germans find it easier to say what she is not than what she is. She is certainly not a towering chancellor in the mould of Konrad Adenauer or Helmut Kohl. ""Iron lady"" does not fit. Nor is she a great communicator. Pundits plead for a blood-sweat-and-tears speech on the economic crisis, but she has yet to deliver it. She does not exude maternal warmth. Ideology is not her strong point.
Her offbeat biography adds to the difficulty of pinning her down. Her election in 2005 as Germany's first female chancellor and the first from the ex-communist east had Obama-esque novelty. The daughter of a Protestant pastor who migrated east, she leads a party whose core is Catholic and whose roots are in western Germany. The fall of the Berlin Wall drew her into politics and Mr Kohl propelled her towards the top, naming her minister for women and youth in his third cabinet. Physics preceded politics in her career; its analytical habits still shape her style of governing. And yet Ms Merkel, who has been spotted doing her own shopping, connects with voters. People think of her as ""the matriarch who takes care of them,"" says Manfred Gullner of Forsa, a polling firm. Without charisma, she contrives to shine.
She starts the electoral season with a hoard of political capital. The football World Cup, hosted by Germany in the summer of 2006, seven months after she took office, bathed the country and the chancellor in laid-back patriotism. In 2007 Germany assumed the rotating presidency of the European Union (for six months) and presided over the G8 summit of the world's biggest economies, allowing Ms Merkel to display a flair for statesmanship. For nearly three years the economy was benign. Buoyed by world trade, economic growth averaged 2.3% from 2006 to 2008, the highest rate this decade. Unemployment fell from nearly 5m in 2005 to around 3m. Before the crisis the federal government was within sight of its cherished goal of balancing its budget by 2011. 
The gravest charge against Ms Merkel is that she amassed too much political capital and spent too little. She campaigned for the chancellorship (and nearly lost) as a determined reformer who would unshackle enterprise, unburden taxpayers and "" govern through"" all obstacles. The tax code should be simple enough to fit on a beer mat, her party declared. But she quickly adapted to the constraints of the grand coalition, forced upon her by the CDU's narrow victory. She stands accused of governing less as a leader than as a moderator, brokering compromises among the coalition's warring factions and then claiming credit for whatever emerges. 
To many, the results have been disappointing. The SPD entered the grand coalition with an acute case of reformers' remorse. Under Ms Merkel's predecessor, Gerhard Schroder, the SPD and its Green allies enacted necessary but unpopular changes to welfare and labour markets collectively known as Agenda 2010, which nearly tore the SPD apart. Demoted to junior status in Ms Merkel's government, it had no desire to repeat the experience. Despite majorities (at first) in both houses of the legislature, the grand coalition passed just one big-ticket reform in the spirit of Agenda 2010, a gradual rise in the retirement age to 67. 
More often, with Ms Merkel's help, it rolled back reform. It lengthened the time for paying unemployment benefits to older workers, offered pensioners relief from rising prices and introduced minimum wages in half a dozen industries, including postal and security services. Sitting out trouble
Despite the incessant deal-making, much of Berlin's political class is feeling sour. The SPD resents Ms Merkel for stealing its clothes. The CDU's ""economic wing"" thinks she has pandered too much to the SPD. The CSU, struggling to stay on top in Bavaria, defies the chancellor on taxes, health policy and anything else it thinks will pacify touchy constituents. Tensions over policy have grown with the sinking of the world economy. Liberals who saw an ally in her feel let down. Ms Merkel ""has not said a dumb sentence in three-and-a-half years,"" says Michael Eilfort of the Market Economy Foundation in Berlin. ""But there seems to be no theme for which she has an enduring passion."" 
A reputation for wishy-washiness could cause problems. Mr Steinmeier has begun to hammer away at her leadership style, which he describes as ""wait, watch, then jump on the bandwagon"". Germany's consensus system of governance makes it difficult for any chancellor to impose his or her will, but Ms Merkel seems particularly disinclined. She learnt from Mr Kohl to ""sit problems out"", says Gerd Langguth, a political scientist who has written her biography. Unlike her mentor, though, she has ""no sense of historical mission"" and ""no vision of society"". Rather, she is a thoroughgoing pragmatist who ""wants to solve today's problems in such a way that she remains in power."" 
Yet Ms Merkel has two traits that partly absolve her of the charge of being a soulless pragmatist. The first is what Mr Langguth calls her ""fixed points"", most of which are connected to Germany's relations with the rest of the world. Like many central Europeans liberated from communism, she is instinctively pro-American and warier of Russia than many mainstream German politicians (though American banks and Russian gas have tempered both instincts). She has rebuked the main powers for abusing human rights, receiving the Dalai Lama at the chancellery and calling on the United States to close Guantanamo. She can be counted on to resist attempts by fellow leaders, such as France's Nicolas Sarkozy, to split the 27-member European Union into separate clubs. 
Though an easterner, Ms Merkel has embraced the western German sense of responsibility for the Holocaust and is a staunch backer of Israel. Recently she upbraided the pope for re-admitting to the Catholic fold a Holocaust-denying bishop. This offended the CDU's base of conservative Catholics, who have trouble enough relating to a divorced-and-remarried, childless, Protestant career woman from the east. Where Mr Kohl was ""married"" to the party Ms Merkel is merely ""allied"" to it, says Mr Langguth. But she is indispensable: with the backing of 35% of the electorate, the CDU is far less popular than she is. Eyes on the future
Nor is Ms Merkel without vision. It is trained on the distant future, in particular on two issues whose consequences will be felt after her political career is over: climate change and demographic decline. As environment minister in the mid-1990s she helped negotiate the Kyoto protocol to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. At her prompting, the EU committed itself to cutting emissions by 20% by 2020 (more if other developed countries agree to do so) and to supplying 20% of its energy from renewable sources by the same year. Germany is to be a model. Its own climate package mandates, among other things, a 30% improvement in buildings' energy efficiency. The national goal is to cut emissions 40% by the 2020 deadline. 
The second worry that underlies Ms Merkel's policies is population decline. Within 30 years the proportion of Germans older than 65 will rise from a fifth to a third, and the population will shrink by a tenth. The younger generation will look different. In big cities today nearly half the children under 15 are immigrants or their children and grandchildren. In general, they are poorer, worse educated and more likely to be unemployed than non-immigrants. Germany needs more workers and better brains. 
Ms Merkel has made a start. She appointed as family minister a glamorous mother of seven, Ursula von der Leyen, who introduced ""parents' pay"", a 14-month stipend for parents of newborn children linked to their salaries, encouraging middle-class women especially to combine family and career. To bolster the woefully underdeveloped day-care system, a new law promises to provide enough places for 35% of children aged three or less by 2013.
Ms Merkel's campaign to turn Germany into an ""education republic"" has made less progress, partly because primary and secondary education is the province of the states. But her government recently approved EUR 18 billion ($25 billion) of extra funding for research and universities, a noteworthy promise at a time of spiralling debt (
). It produced a EUR 750m ""national integration plan"" to promote jobs and education for minorities, for example by expanding compulsory German-language and culture courses. 
Mrs von der Leyen says her boss has modernised her traditionalist party as well as the country. Thanks to her, ""We've gone from saying 'We're not an immigration country' to accepting that we are one."" In the CDU day care is ""no longer a taboo. Without Ms Merkel that would have been unthinkable,"" she says. The chancellor sees herself, one suspects, as a latter-day philosophe, who seeks cures for society's ills in reason and science. Balancing the bail-outs
Her achievements in such areas lag behind her ambitions. Universities remain under-funded. Integration has progressed slowly. The government offended Turks by changing the immigration law to require migrants from poor countries to pass a language test before joining their spouses in Germany. Last year the number of immigrants obtaining German citizenship fell to its lowest level since unification. When far-sightedness crumples into ordinary opportunism, Ms Merkel disappoints. Saying climate protection cannot come at the expense of German jobs, she pushed for looser emissions standards for carmakers, putting the EU's overall emissions targets in jeopardy, says Jeroen Verhoeven of Friends of the Earth in Brussels. To Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, head of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, who advises her on climate issues, these are merely tactical compromises. Though willing to take detours, Ms Merkel ""never loses sight of where she wants to go."" 
If she wins re-election, she will have a chance to prove him right. But first she must ensure that voters do not punish her for a recession that is striking Germany with particular force. It helps that most see the downturn as a shoddy American import and have yet to feel its full impact. Credit and blame must also be shared with the SPD. Yet Ms Merkel knows that crisis management is ultimately her responsibility; if it is seen to fail she is likely to as well.
In some ways, her task is more difficult than Mr Obama's or Mr Sarkozy's. The economic slump is frightening, but to Germans the threats of inflation and ballooning government debt seem hardly less so. For Ms Merkel this means that over-reacting to the crisis is as much a danger as under-reacting. She thinks her government has struck a balance with three sorts of bail-out: of banks, of non-bank enterprises and of the economy as a whole. But in each case she risks getting the balance wrong.
That is especially true for banks. Ms Merkel and the finance minister, Peer Steinbruck, niftily headed off a banking panic last October by guaranteeing depositors' savings and rushing a EUR 500 billion banking rescue through the Bundestag. But their proposals to shift banks' bad assets into ""bad banks"" would oblige them to pay off the losses over 20 years. That will make it hard for them to become good banks capable of attracting fresh capital.
A pair of stimulus packages worth EUR 64 billion this year and next includes tax cuts, subsidies to keep workers in their jobs and a wildly popular EUR 2,500 ""bonus"" paid to drivers who scrap old cars and buy new ones. Germans insist this is plenty. Tax cuts and extra spending add up to 1.6% of GDP this year and 2% in 2010, reckons the IMF, not counting automatic stabilisers such as unemplyment insurance. But some trading partners still think Germany could do more, given its huge current-account surplus and its (pre-crisis) balanced budget. 
Within Germany the big wedge issue has been rescues of non-financial enterprises. A EUR 115 billion ""Germany fund"" provides guarantees and credits to companies that are in trouble through no fault of their own. Mr Steinmeier has vowed to ""fight for every job"", backed by CDU premiers when the jobs in question are in their states. Other conservatives fret that the government is throwing taxpayers' money away. Ms Merkel opted for a typical middle course, saying yes to a bail-out of Opel, the European arm of America's bankrupt General Motors, but no to Arcandor, a department-store group. 
Messy, hesitant and opportunistic though the triple bail-out may be, it has not yet harmed Ms Merkel's standing with the voters. They continue to see her caution as wisdom, her penchant for splitting the difference as discernment. In resisting foreign demands to do more she is seen as standing up for German interests. If she did that stridently, Germans would be uneasy; perhaps because she is a woman, the perception is she does not. The moderating style that Mr Steinmeier sneers at is read by voters as a sensible reluctance to polarise. 
In the early days of the recession, there were fears that Germans would react by rejecting their leaders and, indeed, the economic system that produced it. But it turns out that they are not keen to experiment in troubled times. Ms Merkel has encouraged that response by doing enough so far to contain the crisis while reaffirming bedrock German principles, such as the social-market economy. Germans trust the canny physicist from the east. Now she means to press that advantage home.

PANIC is palpable among legislators of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Japan is on the verge of an historic change of government. A general election for the Diet (parliament) must be called by mid-September, after which power is expected to pass to the decade-old opposition, the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), after more than 50 years of almost uninterrupted LDP rule.
But the ruling party is not going gracefully. A gaggle of younger LDP parliamentarians is agitating to bring forward the selection of party president set for September in a clumsy attempt to replace the prime minister, Taro Aso, before the election. In recent days a few party elders have also called for him to step aside. Talk of ousting Mr Aso makes the LDP look desperate: he would be the fourth prime minister to quit in as many years.
To quell the rebellious rabble and offer fresher faces to voters, Mr Aso considered a big cabinet reshuffle (shades of Britain's Gordon Brown). On July 1st, however, he chose a much more modest course, filling two posts that had previously been handled by ministers who had taken on multiple roles following the resignations of other cabinet members.
The cosmetic nature of the change reinforces the perception that the LDP is flailing. Dissatisfaction has been brewing for a decade and a half, though a plethora of hapless opposition parties has failed to do more than briefly interrupt LDP rule (for an 11-month stint in 1993-94). One former prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, even won his mandate in 2001-06 after vowing to ""destroy"" his own party.
In the end, it will probably be Mr Aso's mediocre performance that administers the coup de grace. In opinion polls in mid June, the prime minister's popularity sank below 20% after enjoying a brief lift following a fund-raising scandal that forced the DPJ's leader to resign. Now, new fund-raising scandals threaten both parties. Two members of Mr Aso's cabinet have been accused of accepting illegal donations. And the DPJ's new leader, Yukio Hatoyama, has had to apologise after it was revealed that his political organisation listed deceased and fictitious people as donors. In polls, voters prefer the DPJ to the LDP by almost two to one. But around half the public prefers neither party.
One bellwether for the national election are municipal contests, in particular the Tokyo assembly election to be held on July 12th. This is especially important because the assembly is the power base of the LDP's coalition partner, New Komeito, which gives the party its majority. The dps has won a string of local contests in recent weeks, with significantly increased turnouts. Where national politicians are reviled, a new breed of local ones has captivated voters.
It is hardly surprising that the electorate is turning against the governing party. Quite apart from public displeasure at the entire political class, Japan is expected to be the hardest hit of rich economies this year: its GDP is forecast to contract by 6%, around twice the level of America or Britain. True, the Bank of Japan's Tankan survey of sentiment among large manufacturers showed the biggest improvement in two and a half years on July 1st--to minus 48 from a record minus 58 in March. Yet the negative figures suggest economic recovery will be slow and difficult. The LDP's electoral prospects are not much rosier.","The ruling LDP plays a sloppy endgame

AT HIS back Taro Aso had some disastrous results from Tokyo's metropolitan elections on July 12th, in which control of the capital passed from the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) after 40 years. In front was a growing rebellion within the LDP against his leadership. So the prime minister pressed the nuclear button. This week he declared that he would dissolve the Diet, Japan's parliament, and lead the ruling coalition into a general election on August 30th.
Bitter colleagues accuse the prime minister of putting pride above the LDP's interests. They want a fresh face to contest the election; but even if they get one the party is almost certain to lose its post-war near-monopoly on power. Many Japanese people regard that prospect with either scepticism or anxiety, but it is the best thing that could happen to the country. 
Mr Aso's standing is at rock-bottom. His tough talk comes across as arrogance, and it cannot hide his own lack of authority within the party's ranks. A bungled cabinet reshuffle is only the latest example of his impotence. He has failed to reassure voters about the economy, which is running fully 10% below its potential. Fears are growing over the state's ability to meet the welfare needs of an ageing, shrinking population. 
For all his mistakes, Mr Aso is only a symptom of the party's steep decline. He is the fourth prime minister in as many years. The LDP has come to the end of the line. It has no ideas, no cohesion and is covered in sleaze. Fathers hand down seats like family heirlooms. Policy is secondary to plotting. 
Japan's voters, who are guilty of having put up with this for far too long, at last seem to have had enough. Opinion polls suggest a landslide defeat for the LDP at the hands of the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ). Even if economic recovery now gathers pace, the LDP is unlikely to be spared. Having rotted from within, it does not deserve to be.
But many voters are sceptical that change is really coming. That is understandable. The 54-year-old LDP's obituary has been written many times, and the corpse has always revived. In 1993 it actually lost power, but within 11 months it was back. Again, before the 2005 election, it seemed to be in trouble, but the then prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, somehow convinced voters that to vote for him was to vote against everything scuzzy in his own party. The showman's sleight of hand won the LDP coalition a stunning victory. However, today, given the government's dismal performance over the past four years, voters will surely not be dazzled by the same trick again. Besides, no one of anything like Mr Koizumi's calibre is in sight.
Those who believe change is coming are anxious--with good reason. Although the DPJ looks more like a real opposition than seemed possible a decade ago, it is an unlikely mix of socialists and former LDP hands without an identity or a coherent agenda. It has declared war on a discredited bureaucracy without acknowledging the need to harness bureaucratic energies to new policies. It slams Mr Aso's stimulus packages for adding to Japan's debt, yet its own proposals would probably add more. Bring on confusion
And yet Japan needs the DPJ, for all its imperfections. That is because, even though the opposition cannot yet offer a convincing vision, it can at least offer the country two things that are long overdue. 
The first is a fresh framework for government. The legacy of the LDP's one-party state is that policy and legislation pass in parallel through both government and party. Good policies (even the LDP had some) were often stymied by party barons with vested interests. Prime ministers since Mr Koizumi have tried to centralise authority within the cabinet office and pretty much failed. With its tighter party discipline, the DPJ can establish a mechanism that gives good policy a chance of becoming law. 
The second thing Japan needs is for parties to alternate in power. That has never happened in Japanese post-war politics. The very fact of the DPJ's victory will create an incentive for parties to produce some attractive policies, in order to persuade the electorate to vote for them. That way, Japan might actually get some decent government.
If the DPJ, with its weak programme, comes to power, it may well not stay there for very long. And, as reformists leave the LDP in droves, Japanese politics will enter a difficult time. Uncertainty will spread to the country's foreign policy, including its alliance with the United States. But uncertainty beats the LDP's palsied monopoly. 
The election campaign due to be launched next week is the first step on the path to renewal. And if it obliges voters to confront the shortcomings in their politics, that's just as well.","The next election marks the beginnings of a fundamental change in Japanese politics

HIS distraught colleagues cannot forgive Taro Aso for calling a general election on August 30th, following a dismal stint as prime minister. They accuse him of setting up the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) for a landslide victory, so bringing the long rule of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to an abrupt and ignominious end. 
Yet the question is not why the LDP's rule looks about to end soon. Rather it is how on earth the party managed to cling on to power for so long. A once-invincible party failed to adapt to wholesale changes in the social and economic model that it was set up to manage. If its 54-year rule really does come to a halt, that fact alone will confront both party and country with wrenching change and unprecedented uncertainty.
Few things more powerfully demonstrate the inbred character of LDP-dominated politics than its family background. Mr Aso's grandfather, Shigeru Yoshida, was the great statesman of shattered Japan's post-war reconstruction. Yoshida's rule came to an end in 1954 when he was unseated as prime minister by his nemesis, Ichiro Hatoyama. The next year the two men joined forces and the Liberal Party merged with the Japan Democratic Party to form the Liberal Democratic Party, which has dominated Japan's politics ever since. The man who will bring the LDP's rule to an end this summer is Hatoyama's grandson, Yukio Hatoyama, leader of the DPJ. Family honour is demanding its due: for Shigeru Yoshida's grandson, it is nobler to fall to Ichiro Hatoyama's descendant than to succumb to mere LDP hoplites. In any case, Mr Aso knows no one can save his party now.
That is because its history runs so deep. Old Hatoyama and Yoshida formed the LDP as a bulwark against resurgent socialist parties and the political system they devised seems expressly designed to resist change. The American occupiers had anyway pushed Japan in a conservative direction as early as 1948, when the risk of communist revolution in Japan and China--to say nothing of the Soviet threat--had come to be seen as a greater peril than militarism. The Korean war reinforced these priorities, while adding an economic dimension: the United States needed Japan's economy to be humming again to help the war effort.
Thus developed Japan's characteristic mix of anti-communist--even anti-civic--politics with state-directed development and policy set by bureaucrats. Yoshida founded the Ministry for International Trade and Industry, MITI, whose bureaucrats were famously powerful. Trust-busting efforts were quickly wound down after the second world war. Oligopolies--in the form of the former zaibatsu conglomerates--were supported, even if they had been implicated in Japanese aggression. A man accused of war crimes became a notable post-war prime minister and Yakuza gang bosses consorted with top politicians and helped put down left-wing protests. The political and bureaucratic system was solidly made and has lasted, like so many things in Japan. But its origins, and its effects on Japan, were ultimately rotten.
In some countries--Italy, say--incestuous politics is resented, mocked or circumvented by the rest of the country. During Japan's boom years, it seemed to be delivering the goods. Outside the radical left, most Japanese were bought off by a social contract in which politicians, bureaucrats and big business arranged the country's economic affairs. Businesses won preferential finance and in return offered ""salarymen"" job guarantees and the dream of a middle-class life. But the contract could be honoured only with high rates of growth, and the oil shocks of the early 1970s put paid to these.
Perhaps this might have been the end of the LDP, but political competition had been so stifled that there was nothing to take the party's place. Instead, the crisis of the 1970s led to a steep rise in corruption. Factional competition within the party increased. Fund-raising skills came to the fore (in Japan, like America, politicians mostly finance their own campaigns). So did the ability to fund public works in rural areas that were still the LDP's base. Corruption cemented local baronies and for a good while won votes. Even today the late Kakuei Tanaka, an astonishingly corrupt prime minister, is more often praised than cursed.
The beginning of the end
A 19th-century Russian said that Europe's democracies were moderated by corruption. Japan had corruption moderated by democracy. During the 1980s, the LDP managed to adapt itself somewhat to new political concerns, such as pollution and the success of issue-driven opposition figures in cities and prefectures. The party even lost power briefly in 1993 and, in 2001-06, a razzle-dazzle prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, seemed to be giving it a new lease on life. 
But by the time Mr Koizumi came along, the tension had become intolerable between the change-resisting features of politics on the one hand, and the reality of profound economic and social upheaval on the other. Companies could no longer keep lifetime promises to workers yet the government failed to take over social-welfare obligations. Women wanted better work prospects yet ministers would refer to them as ""breeding machines"". The demands of civic groups for more consumer protection were met grudgingly and late.
Now, the LDP has abandoned nearly all pretence at reform. Though the party has plenty of modernisers, many--notably the so-called Koizumi's children--will be the first to be swept out on August 30th while the old guard may survive better because they have their own sources of funding and support. That the LDP is still so mired in the past shows both why its fall would be such an historic moment and why it would also be only the start of real change. The party was the keystone of a political system that has long been crumbling. To effect change means not just replacing the keystone but painstakingly rebuilding the arch.","Japan has long been changing faster than its Liberal Democratic Party , which is now in terminal decline

SASHED candidates standing on car roofs, their voices crackling through loudspeakers. Worrying signs of heatstroke affecting one of the ruling-party's septuagenarians. Women applauding politely, wearing hats and long gloves to shield their pale skin from the glinting sun.
It was August 18th, the official start of campaigning for Japan's general election on August 30th. But it might just as easily have been 1960, when Yukio Mishima, one of Japan's greatest novelists, published ""Utage No Ato"" (""After The Banquet""), an evocation of a fictional August election with loudhailers, perspiring candidates and odd goings-on in ""the bog of politics"".
As the 12-day general-election campaign got under way (the first to be held in August in 107 years), there was something quaintly old-fashioned in the absence of television hoopla. In a country otherwise mad on mass-media, a musty-smelling ban on internet campaigning also recalled a bygone era.
Even the two main candidates for prime minister, Taro Aso of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and Yukio Hatoyama (pictured above), of the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), have hardly torn into each other. In debates, they have sounded more like two bickering old men than the scions of political dynasties (their grandfathers fought over the founding of the LDP in 1955) waging what could be one of the most important battles in any election in Japan's history.
Mr Hatoyama has tried to cast himself in the Barack Obama mould, using the English word ""change"" to sum up the DPJ's meaning to voters. After half a century of almost wall-to-wall rule by his rival's party, that should be an intoxicating message. The DPJ says evicting the ruling party will break the stranglehold on the budget held by mandarins, giving it freedom to cope with Japan's ageing population, the low birth-rate and a dangerously lopsided, export-oriented economy. But Mr Hatoyama's face hardly moves as he delivers the good tidings in a soporific murmur.
Mr Aso, meanwhile, has questioned the DPJ's ability to pay for expensive campaign promises, such as a {Yen}26,000 ($280) a month child allowance to push up the birth rate, income support to farmers and heavily subsidised schooling. The opposition party's sums are indeed fuzzy. 
But opinion polls give the DPJ a two-to-one margin over the LDP. Even old ruling-party stalwarts such as doctors and construction workers are shifting allegiances, according to a survey by Kyodo, a news agency. Behind the scenes, analysts say DPJ strategists are working tirelessly to field fresh-faced, likeable candidates to stand against LDP dinosaurs. That has meant a high number of candidates are campaigning: 330 from the DPJ and 326 from the LDP. When parliament was dissolved last month, the LDP held 300 of the 480 seats and the DPJ just 115 (there is a host of smaller parties). In the most hopeful forecasts for the DPJ, some analysts think those numbers could be reversed.
The low-key nature of the race contrasts with the previous contest in 2005, which was swept by the LDP under Junichiro Koizumi, a former prime minister. In what was known as ""Koizumi theatre"", the telegenic reformer obtained extensive television coverage by replacing LDP candidates who opposed his plans to privatise the postal system. The DPJ hardly got a look in.
Mr Koizumi is playing a big role in this election too. He is not on the ballot, after shamelessly betraying his own anti-dynastic principles by bequeathing the right to run for his seat to his son. But he still looms large--these days, as a target for both Mr Hatoyama and Mr Aso. Both men appear more intent on laying into his legacy of free-market reforms, though some predated his rule from 2001-06, than on attacking each other. They blame his removal of a ban on temporary workers in manufacturing for soaring inequality and high rates of poverty in a country that used to pride itself on being almost universally middle-class. But neither has come up with a very convincing alternative.
In an article this month, Mr Hatoyama railed against American-led ""market fundamentalism"" that, he said, the LDP had embraced since Mr Koizumi's leadership. But his alternative is a mushy-sounding concept, yuai, that mixes up the Chinese characters for friendship and love. He calls it fraternity, and says it means that activities such as agriculture--already under Fort Knox-like protection in Japan--will not be left ""at the mercy of the tides of globalism"". Mr Aso has likewise pledged to break with ""excessive market fundamentalism"".
Such views have helped shape both parties' manifestos. The DPJ's policy platform, for instance, proposes undoing one of the main Koizumi reforms by banning the use of temporary labour in manufacturing. It also wants to raise minimum-wage levels. Exporters fighting for business in China deplore both policies. Yet analysts say Mr Hatoyama, who at a recent press conference asked an aide to field questions on economics, will have little influence on--or even interest in--economic policy. Also, an upper-house election is due in 2010. This may limit the DPJ's ambitions; its priority is likely to be restructuring the civil service, where it can most easily score political points.
Not everyone thinks Mr Koizumi's reforms are widely unpopular. The image of temporary workers losing their jobs, and sometimes their home, as the economy slumped last winter was a poignant one. But the stodgy LDP old guard, which had presided over two decades of economic stagnation, bore as much of the blame as the reformist Mr Koizumi.
Jiro Yamaguchi, of Hokkaido University in northern Japan, argues that Mr Koizumi, while trying to trim the budget deficit, failed to do enough to strengthen the social-security system to shield people from the effects of deregulated wages and job losses. He thinks the DPJ, which he advises, should concentrate on developing such ""Third Way"" reforms. But the party has not yet taken up this cause. 
In one way, the DPJ has reason to be grateful to Mr Koizumi. By selling off the postal system, cutting pork-barrel spending to the construction industry and shrinking an already small state further, he may have at long last cut the financial lifeline linking the LDP to its core supporters. If so, then at least the DPJ will not have to endure a full replay of ""Utage No Ato"". In Mishima's novel, the party in front as the election campaign starts does not find it ends altogether happily.","As an historic campaign starts , Taro Aso take aim at free - market capitalism as well as each other

Yet analysts say Mr Hatoyama , who at a recent press conference asked an aide to field questions on economics , will have little influence on -- or even interest in -- economic policy . Also , an upper - house election is due in 2010 . This may limit the DPJ 's ambitions ; its priority is likely to be restructuring the civil service , where it can most easily score political points . 
 Not everyone thinks Mr Koizumi 's reforms are widely unpopular . The image of temporary workers losing their jobs , and sometimes their home , as the economy slumped last winter was a poignant one . But the stodgy LDP old guard , which had presided over two decades of economic stagnation , bore as much of the blame as the reformist Mr Koizumi . 
 Jiro Yamaguchi , of Hokkaido University in northern Japan , argues that Mr Koizumi , while trying to trim the budget deficit , failed to do enough to strengthen the social - security system to shield people from the effects of deregulated wages and job losses . He thinks the DPJ , which he advises , should concentrate on developing such "" Third Way "" reforms . But the party has not yet taken up this cause . 
 In one way , the DPJ has reason to be grateful to Mr Koizumi . By selling off the postal system , cutting pork - barrel spending to the construction industry and shrinking an already small state further , he may have at long last cut the financial lifeline linking the LDP to its core supporters . If so , then at least the DPJ will not have to endure a full replay of "" Utage No Ato "" . In Mishima 's novel , the party in front as the election campaign starts does not find it ends altogether happily .",740,Japan,A30-185,IN TERM,True,both Mr Hatoyama and Mr Aso,9,True

The famous four European neutrals--Sweden, Switzerland, Finland and Austria--are all to some extent moving away from it. (By virtue of its cosy geography, far from the European maelstrom, the dilemma facing fiercely neutral Ireland, an EU member since 1973, has never been so sharp.) But the cautious quartet were, in any case, never at all uniform. Nor have the delicate steps they have been taking to join the world of blocks been in unison.
For a start, the neutrality of Finland and Austria, unlike that of Sweden and Switzerland, was involuntary. The Finns fought heroically, from 1939 to 1944, to prevent Stalin conquering them. The price of peace, framed in 1947 in a treaty of ""friendship and co-operation"", was a promise to keep out of the cold war--and never to say boo to a Soviet goose.
Austria had no choice, either. The final post-war treaty of 1955, whereby the great powers of the second world war vacated the zones into which Austria had been divided, linked the country's sovereignty to an understanding that it, too, would keep out of western power blocks.
Since the collapse of communism, both countries have unilaterally abrogated their agreements with the Russian heir to the Soviet Union. But it is not yet clear whether, provided that their citizens agree to join the EU, the two countries will join the WEU, the Union's embryonic military structure, let alone NATO. Finland says it will keep its options open, pending the outcome of the EU's inter-governmental conference in 1996, but, if the Finns agree in a referendum this October to join the EU, they will ask to join the WEU as 'observers', but will continue to eschew NATO's ""Partnerships for Peace"".
Austria's present government, which is urging Austrians to vote to join the EU in a referendum on June 12th, likewise rules out the possibility of joining NATO, but its chancellor, Franz Vranitzky, contemplates joining the WEU--in due course. ""A common security policy does not affect neutrality,"" says Mr Vranitzky. ""We aren't throwing neutrality overboard overnight."" The question of neutrality has loomed large in the referendum campaign. Some of those opposed to joining the EU do not believe the chancellor. Besides, many say that Austria's identity will be swallowed up in a Greater Germany, echoing the Anschluss of 1938.
The Swedes and Swiss have been quite different. For Sweden, neutrality was bolstered by a tradition of high-minded, sometimes pacifist, often anti-American, humanism. Even if Swedes say Yes to joining the EU in their referendum in November, the idea of joining the WEU, let alone NATO, would remain controversial. But the national mood may have changed. Sweden's centre-right prime minister, Carl Bildt, has been unusually outspoken in backing the newly restored sovereignty of the Baltic states, which, in cheeky mimicry of Russia's foreign-policy vocabulary, he has described as Sweden's own ""near abroad"". If Russia were to attack the Baltic states, says Mr Bildt, Sweden would not consider itself neutral. Neutrality has been equally dear to the Swiss, for whom, over centuries, it has been almost a raison d'etre for statehood. Only eight years ago they rejected, by referendum, membership of the United Nations, even though they profitably offer a home to so many of its agencies. A fresh referendum on June 12th may, just perceptibly, modify Switzerland's traditional posture in the world. The question is whether the government should maintain a small volunteer force of soldiers allowed, under strict conditions, to put on the UN's blue berets.
Switzerland's foreign minister, Flavio Cotti, and his colleague at defence, Kaspar Villiger, argue strongly that enlisting Swiss peacekeepers would by no means endanger neutrality. The only political party to oppose the force is the Swiss People's Party, and even that is split. The opponents' case, backed by televised images of death and danger, is that formal UN service would be a step towards internationalisation, including membership of the EU and the UN itself.
A few Swiss soldiers and policemen, in half-dozens round the world, from Korea to Palestine, and from Mozambique to Bosnia, have already done some peacekeeping. The new proposal would write such activities formally into the constitution, and turn the odd handful of Swiss here and there into a standing force of at most 800 men.
Long before they discovered skiing and high finance, Swiss halbardiers and archers had an honoured tradition of fighting other people's wars, often on both sides. That was outlawed after the Napoleonic wars, and now only the Vatican still has its Swiss mercenary guards, their toughness disguised by pretty striped uniforms.
Unlike the pope's defenders, the men of the proposed force would not need to be approved by their local (and exclusively Catholic) bishops. They would be deployed on behalf of the UN only as their government decides. The Swiss Officers' Society, a powerful voice in a country where universal military service extends into middle age, strongly favours the idea. There are plenty of keen volunteers. Yet the latest opinion polls give a slight edge to the force's enemies. Of the four neutrals, Switzerland remains the most reluctant to tangle with the world.","Neutrality may be going out of fashion .

Austrians' longstanding belief that their country is best served by a ""grand coalition"" of reds and blacks, as the Social Democrats and centre-right People's Party are known, is being undermined, and another big blow may come in the general election on December l7th. One reason is the rise of a third force whose nationalist rhetoric occasionally carries echoes of Austria's Nazi past. But since no party can expect outright victory in the election, voters must expect another coalition of some kind.
 Many Austrians who take pride in their post-war pragmatism and prosperity are peering into the future with a sense of angst. Actually, the worry is overdone. The country needs shaking up. Whatever else he is accused of, at least Jorg Haider of the far-right Freedom Movement can be thanked for doing that.
Since 1955, when the occupying wartime allies left Austria, the country has stuck to rigorous neutrality in foreign affairs and ""social partnership"" at home. Businessmen, trade unions, the central bank and so on have settled things in smoke-filled rooms while, for much of the time, the reds and blacks have shared the spoils of government. Under a system known as Proporz, almost all senior jobs (even in schools and hospitals, let alone embassies, town halls and banks), as well as many contracts and even public housing have been doled out by formula to the two big parties' supporters. Bad luck if you eschewed the party game-a point relentlessly made by Mr Haider.
The bowtie or the gadfly
For most of the post-1955 period, the Social Democrats have been the senior partner. The current chancellor, Franz Vranitzky, a former bank official, oozes decent stolidity, consensus-minded complacency and fear of radical reform, though he has reluctantly embarked on a series of privatisations. He looks tired. Since the cold war's end, Austria's neutrality has lost its point. Worse, the social partnership, in particular Austria's ultra-generous welfare system, is unaffordable. The budget deficit and national debt are ballooning. Above all, many Austrians have become fed up with the nation's jobsfor-the-boys carve-up.
Step forward, as the People's Party's new leader and former economy minister, a chirpy lawyer with a smirk, an over-sized bow-tie and big glasses called Wolfgang Schiissel. In October he and Mr Vranitzky failed to agree on next year's budget. Mr Schussel wanted bigger cuts than the reds would tolerate. He also noticed that the opinion polls were moving his way. A quick election, he gambled, might give the People's Party a narrow win. The grand coalition duly collapsed.
At the last election, only a year ago, the reds won 35% to the blacks' 28%, with Mr Hailer's Freedom blues zooming up from 5% in 1983 to 23%. Now the pollsters put the mainstream pair at around 30% each, with Mr Haider edging into the 25-27% zone. Many Austrians say they are undecided, and quite a few are probably too shy to say openly that they might plump for a man who once praised ""Hitler's labour policy"".
President Thomas Klestil, an old People's Party man, will first ask the leader of the biggest party to shape a government, but a dizzying array of combinations have already been mooted as post-election possibilities. All groups except Mr Schussel's have ruled out a deal with Mr Haider. At a pinch, it might accept Mr Haider's support on certain issues without forming a coalition with him.
How tough and radical is Mr Schussel? And how bad is Mr Haider? These are the two big questions in Austrian politics. Mr Schussel is hard to read. He wants to be both a radical and a consensus man. He certainly wants to liberalise Austria's economy, privatise more, and tackle the bloated welfare system. He is also keen to help Austria to lose its neurosis about neutrality. But his toughness is unmeasured.
Mr Haider is even harder to assess. He is a clever, telegenic, entertaining gadfly who makes telling points against patronage and corruption but whose policies derive mostly from expediency. A demagogue, a chameleon and above all an opportunist he certainly is. He has changed his mind on several issues, at one time, for instance, favouring Austria's membership of the European Union, then turning against it.
Mr Haider certainly wins the old Nazi vote. His anti-immigrant rhetoric has a sulphurous whiff, which has contaminated the main parties, making them tighten their immigration policies. Indeed, on several issues, Mr Haider has made the running-not least in his attack on the Proporz system.
Is Mr Haider a neo-Nazi? Even his opponents say no (most of them anyway). He wants a presidential system and plenty of plebiscites, and has consistently opposed the corporatism of fascist ideology. In that respect, he carries less baggage than Gianfranco Fini, his post-fascist counterpart in Italy. His language about immigrants is nasty, though he has been careful never to be anti-Semitic; occasionally, indeed, he sacks followers who publicly deny the Holocaust. ""National Socialism was a bad system, sure,"" he says. ""It abolished freedom.""
 Perhaps the most worrying feature of Mr Haider is his apparent willingness to use practically any means to justify the end, which, in his openly stated view, is to be chancellor by 1998. His strategy is to play the outsider, the rebel, and never mind policy. That may not work for ever. But the more the establishment sticks abusive labels on him, the faster he seems to rise.","HALF a century of cosily corrupt , albeit stable , politics in Austria may be drawing to a close .

COALITION-cobbling will be the name of the 1996 game in Austria, Turkey, Italy and even, perhaps, Spain. At least three parties hope to lead the government after Turkey's general election on December 24th. The Islamic-minded Welfare Party, which worries the West, and two centre-right parties, the Motherland and the True Path (led by the current prime minister, Tansu Ciller), all have a chance of becoming the biggest single party in parliament-but none has a hope of winning outright. If the Islamists forge ahead, they will have first shot at forming a coalition-a hard task, given the gap between their policies (leaving NATO, for instance) and those of their potential allies.
The result of Austria's election on December 17th is likely to prove just as muddling. The Social Democrats, led by Franz Vranitzky, the current chancellor, did better than expected. With 38% of the votes, his party pulled further ahead of its long-time junior partner in coalition, the People's Party, led since the summer by Wolfgang Schussel, who broke up Austria's cosy ""grand coalition"" in the hope of making his the biggest party. His vote went down to 28%, while the far-right Freedom Party, led by Jorg Haider, which had been rising inexorably, stalled in third place with 22%.
Coalition-building could go on for weeks. Mr Vranitzky will try to persuade Mr Schssel to keep the old coalition going, but Mr Schussel may demand bigger cuts than the chancellor wants. If so, Mr Vranitzky may contemplate a minority ""traffic-light"" government, with the Green and Liberal parties. If that will not work, Mr Haider might conceivably get his chance of government by forming a partnership with Mr Schussel. But many say they would rather stay out of government than ally with Mr Haider.
Italy's politics look no less wobbly. In a bid to keep the future of the budget distinct from that of his government, Italy's prime minister, Lamberto Dini, has decided not to call for a confidence motion on the budget, thus keeping his government afloat for a while longer. Reassured by his promise to step down as soon as the budget is approved, the parties that had been clamouring for early elections voted to pass an amended budget (though whether the amendments can be made before the year-end deadline is still in question). That left Mr Dini hoping to postpone what had seemed inevitable-a snap election in the spring-and thus hang on until after June, when Italy's term in the European Union's six-month presidency ends.
That was an argument used in Spain to keep Felipe Gonzalez's government going. Now, Mr Gonzalez, who has been prime minister since 1982 and has been sounding keen to bow out, says he will lead his Socialists into yet another election. His party lags in the polls but could still deny the main opposition People's Party an outright win. That would once again give Catalans a chance to make deals with a new government, but probably without joining a ruling coalition.
If you add in Greece, where the prime minister has been on a lifesupport machine, and Swedenwhere the man due to take over as prime minister next March skipped part of the European Union summit to return home to do his Christmas shopping--then it seems as if European politics has rarely been so odd.","As well as Russia , a string of smaller European countries will be looking for stable new governments in the new year . Some may not find them 
 COALITION - cobbling will be the name of the 1996 game in Austria , Turkey , Italy and even , perhaps , Spain . At least three parties hope to lead the government after Turkey 's general election on December 24th . The Islamic - minded Welfare Party , which worries the West , and two centre - right parties , the Motherland and the True Path ( led by the current prime minister , Tansu Ciller ) , all have a chance of becoming the biggest single party in parliament - but none has a hope of winning outright . If the Islamists forge ahead , they will have first shot at forming a coalition - a hard task , given the gap between their policies ( leaving NATO , for instance ) and those of their potential allies . 
 The result of Austria 's election on December 17th is likely to prove just as muddling . The Social Democrats , led by Franz Vranitzky did better than expected . With 38 % of the votes , Franz Vranitzky's party pulled further ahead of its long - time junior partner in coalition , the People 's Party , led since the summer by Wolfgang Schussel , who broke up Austria 's cosy "" grand coalition "" in the hope of making his the biggest party . His vote went down to 28 % , while the far - right Freedom Party , led by Jorg Haider , which had been rising inexorably , stalled in third place with 22 % . 
 Coalition - building could go on for weeks . Franz Vranitzky will try to persuade Mr Schssel to keep the old coalition going , but Mr Schussel may demand bigger cuts than Franz Vranitzky wants . If so , Franz Vranitzky may contemplate a minority "" traffic - light "" government , with the Green and Liberal parties . If that will not work , Mr Haider might conceivably get his chance of government by forming a partnership with Mr Schussel . But many say they would rather stay out of government than ally with Mr Haider . 
 Italy 's politics look no less wobbly . In a bid to keep the future of the budget distinct from that of his government , Italy 's prime minister , Lamberto Dini , has decided not to call for a confidence motion on the budget , thus keeping his government afloat for a while longer . Reassured by his promise to step down as soon as the budget is approved , the parties that had been clamouring for early elections voted to pass an amended budget ( though whether the amendments can be made before the year - end deadline is still in question ) . That left Mr Dini hoping to postpone what had seemed inevitable - a snap election in the spring - and thus hang on until after June , when Italy 's term in the European Union 's six - month presidency ends . 
 That was an argument used in Spain to keep Felipe Gonzalez 's government going . Now , Mr Gonzalez , who has been prime minister since 1982 and has been sounding keen to bow out , says he will lead his Socialists into yet another election . His party lags in the polls but could still deny the main opposition People 's Party an outright win . That would once again give Catalans a chance to make deals with a new government , but probably without joining a ruling coalition .

The vote for Franz Vranitzky's Social Democrats went up.
Now, after two-and-a-half months of bargaining, Austria is once again saddled with the same soggy old coalition of the centre-led, again, by Mr Vranitzky, with the People's Party leader, Wolfgang Schissel, becoming foreign minister. The surprise, though, is that the new government may itself start hacking away at Austria's bloated welfare state.
The government says that, with a mixture of cuts and new taxes, it intends to trim the budget deficit by half, to ASch6o billion ($5.8 billions By 1998, unless unemployment rockets from its present 7.3% or the next-door German economy slumps really badly, Austria should meet the Maastricht treaty's criteria for joining economic and monetary union (EMU).
But the reforms will hurt, even though the aim is to spread the pain. Civil servants' pay is to freeze for two years, pensions for one. Austrians retiring early will no longer get full benefits. University students will have to pay tram fares; and their parents will no longer get family allowances for those of their children who linger over their studies: a lot of Austrians take seven years over courses supposed to last four.
New parents can still have a generous two years of maternity leave, but each parent must now take at least six months of it-and since Austrian fathers do not usually take up the offer, maternity leave will in effect shrink to 18 months. Nor will new parents get a one-off handout when their child is born. Handicapped people will forgo their home allowance when they are in hospital. Benefits to the long-term unemployed are being cut. On the revenue side, taxes on capital gains are going up, deductions for private health and pensions down; this should raise about ASch35 billion. By Austrian standards, this catalogue of pruning is tough stuff. It is probably the first time that any government has seriously tried to trim the country's welfare.
All the same, though the measures should stem the growth of the welfare bill, spending in real terms will probably continue to creep up. Welfare will still gobble up about 28%-perhaps even more-of GDP. Compared with the freespending 1980s and early i99os, the package is austere. But Austria still needs an even heavier dose of radicalism to bring social security under control. By some projections, spending on welfare could still reach a huge 40% of Austria's GDP by 2020.","DURING a general - election campaign in December , Franz Vranitzky put the fear of the unknown into the pampered voters of Austria .

The new chancellor, at 49, is ten years younger than his predecessor. But will he really make a difference? 
Perhaps. Though Mr Vranitzky, slightly against the odds, won a general election at the end of 1995, he has been looking jaded. In October, his Social Democrats did badly in Austria's first elections to the European Parliament: the mainstream conservative People's Party, with which the Social Democrats have been running Austria in a ""redblack"" coalition, beat them by a whisker. Even more shockingly for Austria's consensus-minded majority, Jorg Haider's postfascist Freedom Movement, with 28%, had its best result ever, coming only a bare percentage point behind. And it beat the conservatives into second place in elections on the same day for Vienna's city council. 
Mr Klima's edge over Mr Vranitzky is that he promises to be tougher, more energetic and more decisive. He may also be more charming and more clever. At a time when the government's policy is largely aimed at getting Austria into Europe's monetary union in the first wave in 1999, he is better versed in economics. He has recently presided over a ruthless budget. Moreover, his stock among Social Democrats has gone up because, after months of wrangling, he has overseen the purchase by Bank Austria, which has tight links with the Social Democrats, of the ailing Creditanstalt, the second-biggest bank and an old conservative stronghold. Though the eventual deal smacked-as usual in Austria-of compromise and carve-up, Mr Klima may be generally keener than Mr Vranitzky was to be open, to deregulate, to privatise. 
Mr Klima may also be better at countering the populist challenge of Mr Haider, whose party made big inroads among bluecollar workers who had previously voted for the Social Democrats. Mr Vranitzky has studiously ignored Mr Haider. Mr Klima may more straightforwardly take him on. It is conceivable, too, that the new man will leave open the possibility of making deals with Mr Haider rather than seeking always to cold-shoulder him. 
But the biggest long-term question facing Austria-and Mr Klima-is whether to perpetuate the old system of Proporz, whereby the nation's business and politics, down to the humblest level, are stitched up between the two main parties. Mr Haider has won votes through his opposition to immigration and the European Union (which Austria joined in 1995). But his attacks on the old political establishment for its love of the corrupting and suffocating Proporz may have won him even more support. If Mr Klima can start breaking down the old ways and inject a dose of rawer competition into politics and business, he would indeed be a sharp improvement on dull, worthy Mr Vranitzky.

Moreover , his stock among Social Democrats has gone up because , after months of wrangling , he has overseen the purchase by Bank Austria , which has tight links with the Social Democrats , of the ailing Creditanstalt , the second - biggest bank and an old conservative stronghold . Though the eventual deal smacked - as usual in Austria - of compromise and carve - up , Mr Klima may be generally keener than Franz Vranitzky was to be open , to deregulate , to privatise . 
 Mr Klima may also be better at countering the populist challenge of Mr Haider , whose party made big inroads among bluecollar workers who had previously voted for the Social Democrats . Franz Vranitzky has studiously ignored Mr Haider . Mr Klima may more straightforwardly take Franz Vranitzky on . It is conceivable , too , that the new man will leave open the possibility of making deals with Mr Haider rather than seeking always to cold - shoulder him . 
 But the biggest long - term question facing Austria - and Mr Klima - is whether to perpetuate the old system of Proporz , whereby the nation 's business and politics , down to the humblest level , are stitched up between the two main parties . Mr Haider has won votes through his opposition to immigration and the European Union ( which Austria joined in 1995 ) . But his attacks on the old political establishment for its love of the corrupting and suffocating Proporz may have won him even more support . If Mr Klima can start breaking down the old ways and inject a dose of rawer competition into politics and business , he would indeed be a sharp improvement on Franz Vranitzky .",305,Austria,A29-4507,IN TERM,True,"the man who had run their government for over ten years , Franz Vranitzky",10,True

The southern third of the country is out of control. The president, Sali Berisha, has declared a state of emergency that allows police and army to shoot demonstrators virtually on sight. No more than four people may gather in public without permission. A nationwide curfew runs from dusk to dawn. The death toll is steadily rising. Half the population are baying for the government's blood after losing money in bogus investment schemes. Thugs hired by the government are becoming more belligerent. Mr Berisha has closed down democracy and the press. Foreign governments have pleaded, so far in vain, for a compromise to prevent even worse bloodshed and turmoil. No end to the mayhem is in sight. 
The latest twist of the spiral began on March 2nd when Mr Berisha, as a sop to the malcontents, sacked his prime minister and called for a new government-which is still to materialise. By then at least three southern towns, including Vlora and a small naval base, had become ""free zones"" held by armed rebels. Next day, in an act of defiance, Mr Berisha had himself effortlessly re-elected president for another five years by a parliament that has for months been boycotted by the opposition. 
After his prime minister had been chopped, Mr Berisha then chucked out the head of the army and put his secret police chief in overall charge of enforcing the emergency. Except for a government newspaper and the state-controlled television and radio, the press has been shut down. The office of the main independent newspaper has been burned out, foreign journalists-including our own correspondent-harassed and beaten up by thugs and prevented from visiting the south. The BBC and Voice of America have had their short-wave signals jammed. In the past few weeks several dozen people have been killed and hundreds arrested. 
The tragedy is that since Albanian communism was peacefully overthrown five years ago, the country has experienced more good than bad. Since Mr Berisha and his right-wing Democratic Party won power by election in 1992, after half a century of the most dreadful dictatorship in Eastern Europe, progress has been fast if inevitably patchy. Albania's cocoon of isolation was shed. Land was made private, state dinosaurs sold off or killed, small businesses allowed to sprout, and politics and religion freed. From the rockiest bottom, growth, albeit alongside much crookery, was the most rapid of all the ex-communist countries. On the foreign front, Mr Berisha sensibly made sure that, despite large and restless Albanian ethnic minorities in Serbia and Macedonia, Albania proper kept out of the Balkan cockpit. The Americans, especially, backed Albania-and Mr Berisha-as a beacon of stability. 
Then, last year, Mr Berisha made two big mistakes. First, he used devious tactics to ensure that his Democratic Party won a summer general election that it would probably have won anyway; in the autumn, it won local elections by fairer means. Second, he failed to stop-and his party actually seemed to encourage, in order to raise campaign funds-a proliferation of bogus investment schemes that were bound to collapse. When, this winter, they duly did, nearly half the people lost their shirts. Riots and unrest, badly handled, threw the entire country into disarray. 
Mr Berisha has promised that the government will at least partially compensate the investors, but he has few crumbs to dispense. Nor is it likely that the IMF, which was due to negotiate a new clutch of loans, would bail out aggrieved (and foolish) investors. The World Bank and the European Union are loth to be more generous, though about a third of last year's $960m budget was provided by various foreign helpers (including the IMF). So Albania is unlikely to get a cent more aid until Mr Berisha manages peacefully to restore calm and bring the opposition back into the political game, preferably in a ruling coalition. 
On March 7th, with ominous signs that tanks would be sent in to quell the rebels in the south, the foreign minister of the Netherlands, which holds the EU's presidency, was due in Tirana, Albania's capital, to persuade Mr Berisha to try compromise rather than repression. A former chancellor of Austria, Franz Vranitzky, is hoping to follow with a team from the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe. For some months the Americans have been urging Mr Berisha to bend. Practically every western country has been scolding him. 
It is hard to see how more bloodshed can be avoided without the president agreeing to a government of reconciliation and, perhaps after a pause of several months, new elections-under close international scrutiny to both parliament and (by direct suffrage, which requires a constitutional change) to the presidency. So far, Mr Berisha seems to be fiercely resisting such a course. But, unless he is prepared to see the country go bust and slide back towards the dismal standards ofthe era of Enver Hoxha, his Stalinist predecessor, Mr Berisha has no choice.

Albania's president is committed to holding a parliamentary election on June 29th. It is supposed to mark the country's recovery from the anarchy into which it descended after the collapse of the pyramid schemes that a good half of all Albanians had invested in. Late last week, Mr Berisha struck a deal with opposition parties on ground rules for the election. Then he tore it up. This week he appeared to reverse course again, heading back toward some agreement that would allow an internationally sanctioned poll to go ahead. Albania's erratic leader could do anything next. 
On his whim depends the country's stability. If he goes ahead with his threat to call an election on his own terms, every party but his own Democrats might boycott the vote. The nine-party interim government, a Socialist-led coalition that assumed power in March, could fall. The Italian-led force of 6,400 troops, which has gone to Albania to protect aid workers, may have to choose between keeping order and pulling out. 
That would not only be catastrophic for Albania; it might be ruinous for Mr Berisha. He may have enough armed clout to survive in his Tirana redoubt and to control parts of the centre and north-east of the country where people still support him. But he cannot hope to keep order in the south. The rebel committees, which nominally run the main southern towns, and the mafias, which actually run them, have made Mr Berisha's resignation a precondition for returning power to elected authorities. 
Nor can Mr Berisha survive comfortably without help from the West. Italy says it will pull its troops out unless the election proceeds as planned. And lenders like the IMF will probably withhold aid until Albania holds a decent poll. 
So, when Franz Vranitzky, envoy of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), rushed to Tirana on May 15th, it made sense for Mr Berisha to agree to an election that the West-and the eight parties ranged against him-could sanction. That means that Mr Berisha must swallow a dilution of his ""genocide law"", which bars prominent ex-communists like Fatos Nano, the Socialist leader, from standing for office. He must also accept a large dollop of proportional representation in the voting system. His Democratic Party won a huge majority in the 14P-seat parliament in May 1996 under a first-pastthe-post system. 
Yet it is still not clear what, apart from giving foreign troops an excuse to leave, even an internationally approved election might accomplish. No one expects any Albanian poll to meet western standards of electoral hygiene. But, with 1m or so guns in private hands and passions running high, candidates who show their faces in the wrong parts of the country risk more than heckling. The disenchanted soldiers and mafiosi who control some southern cities loathe Mr Berisha. They, and pro-Berisha thugs in parts of the north, may find ways of making their views known to voters. 
To stop the election becoming a mockery, the Italian-led force may have to protect candidates, voters and foreign monitors. The OSCE is trying to prise the media away from Mr Berisha's control. Even if the election is clean enough to pass muster, however, it-and the referendum on restoring the monarchy that could be held at the same time-may not solve Albania's problems. 
Surprisingly, none of the rebel groups in the south has yet launched a party to exploit the area's disaffection. The Socialists, heirs to the communist party, reckon the Democrats' losses will be their gains. But voters sick of both Mr Berisha and the excommunists may choose one of two main parties in the middle: the Social Democrats, who split from the.Socialists, and the Democratic Alliance, whose members abandoned Mr Berisha's Democratic Party. The Socialists and the two moderate parties may be able to attract the votes of enough Albanians for the country to get on with the job of recovering from its Stalinist past. 
But there are darker possibilities. Mr Berisha may simply ignore the result. He has stopped saying he will resign if the Democrats lose-and the constitution does not oblige him to. He has lately tightened his grip on government. Last month he sacked the central bank's governor. The 6,1000strong presidential guard and the secret police, the only state forces left with muscle, remain loyal to Mr Berisha. 
Another possibility is that voters could turn to nationalist parties, such as the Bali Kombetar and the monarchist Legalitate, both of which call for a Greater Albania that would extend into Serbia's Albanianpopulated Kosovo province and Macedonia. With Albanian guns already flowing into Kosovo, this nationalism looks all the more explosive. ","WHAT is Sali Berisha up to?

His Democratic Party won a huge majority in the 14P-seat parliament in May 1996 under a first-pastthe-post system. 
Yet it is still not clear what, apart from giving foreign troops an excuse to leave, even an internationally approved election might accomplish. No one expects any Albanian poll to meet western standards of electoral hygiene. But, with 1m or so guns in private hands and passions running high, candidates who show their faces in the wrong parts of the country risk more than heckling. The disenchanted soldiers and mafiosi who control some southern cities loathe Mr Berisha. They, and pro-Berisha thugs in parts of the north, may find ways of making their views known to voters. 
To stop the election becoming a mockery, the Italian-led force may have to protect candidates, voters and foreign monitors. The OSCE is trying to prise the media away from Mr Berisha's control. Even if the election is clean enough to pass muster, however, it-and the referendum on restoring the monarchy that could be held at the same time-may not solve Albania's problems. 
Surprisingly, none of the rebel groups in the south has yet launched a party to exploit the area's disaffection. The Socialists, heirs to the communist party, reckon the Democrats' losses will be their gains. But voters sick of both Mr Berisha and the excommunists may choose one of two main parties in the middle: the Social Democrats, who split from the.Socialists, and the Democratic Alliance, whose members abandoned Mr Berisha's Democratic Party. The Socialists and the two moderate parties may be able to attract the votes of enough Albanians for the country to get on with the job of recovering from its Stalinist past. 
But there are darker possibilities. Mr Berisha may simply ignore the result. He has stopped saying he will resign if the Democrats lose-and the constitution does not oblige him to. He has lately tightened his grip on government. Last month he sacked the central bank's governor. The 6,1000strong presidential guard and the secret police, the only state forces left with muscle, remain loyal to Mr Berisha. 
Another possibility is that voters could turn to nationalist parties, such as the Bali Kombetar and the monarchist Legalitate, both of which call for a Greater Albania that would extend into Serbia's Albanianpopulated Kosovo province and Macedonia. With Albanian guns already flowing into Kosovo, this nationalism looks all the more explosive. ",305,Austria,A29-4507,,False,,0,True

Has Albania just held something resembling a normal election? And can it now become a normal country? 
At least the vote on June 29th, when a first round of parliamentary elections was meant to pull Albania out of anarchy, was not the catastrophe many had feared. Though ballots are still being counted, it looks certain the Socialist Party, revamped successor to the Stalinist communist party, will, with its allies, have at least half the seats in the lss-seat parliament after a second round of voting on July 6th. Mr Berisha's right-wing Democratic Party, which presided over a collapse of pyramid investment schemes that plunged Albania into turmoil late last year, will be lucky to keep more than a toehold. The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), which monitored the election, backed by 7,000 foreign troops, called it ""adequate and acceptable"". 
The question now is whether power will shift as smoothly. The omens are mixed. On July 2nd, Mr Berisha said he would resign ""as soon as possible"". The key men who commanded his armed adherents, including the interior minister, Belul Celo, have left the country. So the Socialists may be able take power without serious armed opposition. Parliament will elect a new president, probably Fatos Nano, the Socialists' leader. 
Even so, it would be unwise to underestimate Mr Berisha's capacity for mucking up a transition. He has rapidly become embroiled in a dispute with the interim government, a Socialist-led multi-party coalition installed at the height of Albania's turmoil in March, over control of the armed forces. The coalition agreement, he said, allowed him to name a successor to Mr Celo as interior minister. Not so, said Bashkim Fino, the coalition's prime minister. On July 3rd, it seemed likely, but not certain, that Mr Berisha had given way. The Socialists said the interim government now controls all armed forces-the police, the secret service and various militias. The army, which has virtually disintegrated, seemed likely to back the new order. But, more dangerously, the many thousands of Albanians with guns of their own are continuing to settle scores. Criminal gangs are still making mayhem. 
In any case, the risk of violence will rise if Mr Berisha disputes the election's precise result. Some of his supporters were involved, on July 3rd, in a shooting outside the central electoral commission's building in Tirana, the capital. Tritan Shehu, his party's chairman, says that during the campaign the Socialists used ""violence and terror"" to intimidate the Democrats; he demanded a revote in more than 30 constituencies. Otherwise, he warned Franz Vranitzky, the OSCE'S envoy, the Democrats would boycott parliament. The OSCE is unlikely to be impressed. It, and the eight countries that have supplied troops to help bring aid and hold the ring, seem keen to give the election a cleanish bill of healththen clear out within a month or so. 
Albania's rulers-elect are talking an unBalkan language of conciliation and temperance. The Socialists and their closest allies, the Social Democrats, say they plan to govern with other parties. That will include the Democratic Alliance, a group that broke away from the Democrats, plus perhaps a small agrarian party and conceivably even the monarchist Legalitet party, which-amid claims of foul play at polling stations-failed to have the monarchy restored in a referendum. Democrats will be offered some influential posts on parliamentary commissions. So Mr Berisha, who is entitled to a seat in parliament, may yet be able to harass the new government. 
Mr Nano, briefly prime minister in the last Socialist government, is trying to sound uncommunist, too. Once a Marxist economist, he now calls himself a social democrat, adding that three years in jailcharged by Mr Berisha's lot with corruption-have tempered him ""so much so that some people in the party criticise me for being liberal."" With affable manner and wisecracking wit in English and Italian, he castigates the lost years under communism and soothes western leaders by praising constitutional checks and balances and a free judiciary. It is doubtful, however, whether those of his colleagues who were once pillars of an exceptionally nasty communist state share such enlightened views. 
So far, Mr Nano is also resisting the temptation to be populist. He has already denied he ever told the voters they would get all their money back from the failed pyramid schemes, and merely talks now of dishing out what is left. And he promises to submit to an IMF programme entailing sharp cuts to shrink a vast budget deficiteven if ordinary Albanians howl.

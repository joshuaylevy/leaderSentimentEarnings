The Zairean army and local militias are fighting ethnic Tutsis, but Zaire said it was being attacked by troops from Rwanda and Burundi. Both countries denied sending troops across the border or supplying local Tutsi militias. A former South African police commissioner, Johan van der Merwe, told the truth commission that the order to blow up the South African Council of Churches offices in 1988 had come from P.W. Botha, then president, via the minister of law and order, Adriaan Vlok. The commission said it would subpoena the former president if he did not respond to the allegation. 
France's President Jacques Chirac paid an effusive visit to Syria and a cross one to Israel, where he objected to security he considered overzealous. In Ramallah he addressed the Palestinian parliament, the first head of state to do so, urging Palestinians to shun violence as they sought a state of their own. 
After mediation by an American envoy, the rival Kurdish factions in northern Iraq agreed in principle, though not yet in fact, to a ceasefire. 
Qatar's ruling family ended its feud, after the government dropped legal action against the deposed emir. The ruler's third son was named heirapparent. 
After Lebed 
Boris Yeltsin, Russia's unwell president, appointed as security chief Ivan Rybkin, a former speaker of parliament, replacing Alexander Lebed. Mr Rybkin will also be in charge of peace negotiations with Chechen rebels. Mr Lebed strengthened his alliance with Alexander Korzhakov, the president's former bodyguard. 
Alexander Rutskoi, who tried to overthrow President Yeltsin in 1993, was elected governor of Kursk in western Russia. 
Russia and Ukraine said they were ready to sign a bilateral treaty, despite a vote by the Duma, the lower house of Russia's parliament, to halt a share-out of the former Soviet Black Sea Fleet between the two countries. Ukraine has also been smarting over claims from some Russian politicians for a reassertion of Russian sovereignty over Sebastopol, the fleet's home port in the Crimea. 
The conservative Homeland Union, a party led by Lithuania's ex-president Vytautas Landsbergis, won parliamentary elections, avenging Mr Landsbergis's 1992 defeat by former communists. 
Bosnia's local elections were again postponed be cause of worries of fraud, mainly by Bosnian Serbs. President Clinton promised to open NATO to East European members in 1999. Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are thought likeliest to be in the first wave. 
The Vatican at last admitted that evolution is ""more than just a hypothesis"". But, the pope added, it still does not apply to the soul. About 300,000 Belgians marched in Brussels to support the families of four girls murdered by members of a paedophile ring and to protest against the authorities' handling of the case. 
Gro Harlem Brundtland, Norway's prime minister for ten of the past 15 years, resigned to give her Labour Party time to prepare for a general election next year. Her successor is expected to be the party leader, Thorbjoern Jagland. 
Finland's opposition Centre Party won the country's first elections to the European Parliament. The vote was interpreted as a rebuff to the government's policy of bringing the Finnish currency swiftly into Europe's planned economic and monetary union. 
German workers took to the streets after talks between IG Metall, the engineering union, and employers broke down. The protests, against cuts in sick pay, may presage a long hot autumn. 
Japanese mist 
The Japanese election produced no clear victory. The Liberal Democratic Party led by Ryutaro Hashimoto, the prime minister, won 239 seats, 12 short of an overall majority. But its old coalition partners lost seats and the shape of a new government remained unclear. 
The Taliban Islamic militia held on to Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, amid reports that its harsh rule was alienating the city's people. AntiTaliban forces gained ground in battles outside the capital. Pakistan devalued its currency by 8% against the dollar and announced a budgetary package, aimed at closing the government's fiscal deficit, in an attempt to win the support of the International Monetary Fund. 
Starr gazing 
Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater special prosecutor, delayed the release of a report on the apparent suicide of Vince Foster, a White House aide. Mr Starr had promised not to make any statements or take any actions that might look politically motivated in the run-up to the presidential election. In Nicaragua's presidential election, the main right-wing candidate, Arnoldo Aleman, scored an unexpected firstround victory with about 49% of the vote, well over the 45% hurdle. The left-winger, Daniel Ortega, president in Sandinist days but now trying to look like a social democrat, took about 38% and claimed fraud.

Gro Harlem Brundtland is one reason why. With her departure from the prime ministership this week, Norway's government is losing its best known face. That does not necessarily mean, however, that she will disappear into the shadows. 
Many will suspect, indeed, that Norway has become too small for her, and that she has resigned in a bid to become the next secretary-general of the United Nations. If so, it is a long, albeit possible, shot. She is a woman, a qualified doctor, with a reputation for tough-mindedness (all pluses) and a proven commitment to greenery: she chaired the UN'S commission on the environment which reported, under her name, in 1987 (another plus). But she is a European (a probably disqualifying minus). 
Mrs Brundtland has been Norway's prime minister for ten of the past 15 years. Four years ago, after the suicide of her son, she handed the leadership of the Labour Party to Thorbjoern Jagland, who now succeeds her as prime minister. But her energy remained undiminished and her resignation this week came as a jolt. 
Though Labour rules Norway in coalition, Mrs Brundtland has long dominated the scene; the opposition is divided. In recent years her party has moved to the centre, and today she pleases industrialists every bit as much as trade unionists. She makes an annual trip to Asia, delicately reproving tyrants while promoting Norwegian exports. In Stavanger recently, she spoke on oil depletion, atmospheric pollution and energy in words that could have been written by the Federation of Processing and Manufacturing Industries, says its director, Arve Thorvig. 
The economy is purring along nicely, no recession is in sight and, even if one were, many voters would probably hold their noses and vote Labour in the belief that any other party would be worse. So Mr Jagland should have little trouble in holding on to his job in the general election due next September. 
As for Mrs Brundtland, she leaves office with plaudits, but also some criticism. Though she has stoutly defended Norway's interests-including its whaling policiesshe has been thought by some to be not interested enough in domestic affairs. Abroad, her efforts to claim that Norway should not be asked to reduce its emissions of greenhouse gases as much as other countries (because it is already so virtuous) often cut little ice. It can afford to be clean, critics say, because many of the products it uses are dirtily made elsewhere. 
Mrs Brundtland should not be directly credited with Norway's best known diplomatic achievement, the Middle East initiative that culminated in the Oslo accords. That was largely the work of Johan Joergen Holst, foreign minister at the time of his death in 1994. Nor were her political skills so great that she could persuade her countrymen to vote Yes to membership of the European Union two years ago. That remains her greatest political failure. But there is little doubting that she could be an effective, albeit humourless, head of the UN if, against the odds, she were to get the job.

The spotlight is shining most fiercely on Swiss banks struggling to explain what happened to money entrusted to them by Jews fleeing persecution. Yet it is now emerging that a score of other countries, on all sides of Europe, have yet to return billions of dollars worth of Jewish property. 
Pressure for restitution is about to rise another notch. Next week Norway's new prime minister, Thorbjoern Jagland, is expected tell a World Jewish Congress meeting in Oslo that his country stands ready to pay compensation for property stolen by the government of Vidkun Quisling during the war. The Jewish group, which leads the hunt for lost assets, hopes Norway's declaration will be a model for other Western European states. 
For it now appears that nearly every country defiled by Hitler's armies, and some that were not, have yet to restore property taken from Jews. One recent book alleges that the city of Paris owns 100 buildings that may have belonged to Jews deported to death camps with the help of France's Vichy collaborators; sales of city property have been suspended until the claim has been looked into. Last month Austria auctioned off 8,ooo unclaimed art objects that had been gathering dust in a monastery, and turned the money over to its Jewish community. Portugal recently owned up to receiving Nazi gold from Swiss banks, some of which may have been looted from Jewish accounts. Now the World Jewish Congress is widening its banking probe to Sweden, the second most popular destination for Jewish flight capital. 
Calculating the material scale of the pillage is almost impossible. The World Jewish Congress cites an end-of-war study that puts property losses at $8 billion (worth $72 billion todays But now, on both sides of the old iron curtain, freshly discovered documents are beginning to confirm the assessments. In 1992 the Jewish Congress set up a restitution outfit to recover Eastern Europe's hoard. The West did a better job than the communist East in restoring property to heirs and communities, but was less scrupulous about disposing of property for which no heirs came forward, say asset-hunters. They are at last getting documents that allow them to establish claims to much of this property. Governments and institutions are at last ready to admit that the business of finding rightful owners is unfinished. 
Even so, it is not easy. In Eastern Europe the restitution organisation has struck deals with Slovakia and Hungary to restore all communal property and to set up foundations to collect the proceeds from its sale. It helped that their governments felt obliged to atone for the behaviour of pro-Nazi regimes during the war. Hungary still has enough Jews, some 8o,ooo-loo,ooo of them, to make restitution look reasonable. 
Not so Poland, whose Jewish population shrunk from 3.3m before the war to a tragic 6,ooo in 1994. This tiny community is the potential beneficiary of vast communal holdings. Poland promptly restored property to the Catholic Church after its revolution but has dragged its feet over Jewish property. So, too, has the Czech Republic. In both countries, the governments might argue that the mismatch between a tiny Jewish population and a vast communal inheritance would make restitution an unmanageable windfall. Poland is drafting a restitution law but hesitates at the principle that all communal property should be restored. 
Yet Holocaust survivors in each country-however few-should, says the World Jewish Congress, be the first beneficiaries. What the local community cannot absorb would be spent helping 30o,ooo Holocaust survivors and other needy Jews worldwide. Wealth recovered from eastem Germany already supports 219 projects in i8 countries. 
Norway's example might shame the West into action. Half its 1,6oo Jews fled to neutral Sweden; of the 736 shipped to the death camps, all but 26 died. A Liquidation Board for Confiscated Jewish Property meticulously sequestered everything of value. Some went to Norwegian Nazis. Some went under the auctioneer's hammer. Much just vanished. Norway, with Jewish help, will now work out losses and compensation. 
Countries with larger pre-war Jewish populations may face a far bigger task. More than 100,000 Dutch Jews died: much of their property was never given back, say the asset-hunters. The wealth of some 75,ooo murdered French Jews is largely unclaimed. In any event, restoring property would still fall short of a final reckoning. The hunt for Jewish accounts in Swiss and Swedish banks will rumble on. So do campaigns by individual survivors: refugees from Eastern Europe stymied by citizenship requirements for making claims; former slaves of German companies that still refuse to compensate them. Many will not live to see justice done. But that is no reason for not making a start, half a century late.

What is not so usual is that the left-of-centre governments of Denmark, Norway and Sweden are all in trouble. Social-democratic parties are as unpopular as they have ever been, say opinion polls, even though the economies in two of the three countries-Denmark and Norway-are ticking over nicely. Oddly, though, discontent may not bring change. Except in Denmark, the chances are that the left will hang on to power in the next elections. 
In Norway and Denmark, bumbling leaders are misplaying strong economic hands. Thorbjoern Jagland, who succeeded Gro Harlem Brundtland as Norway's prime minister in October, is turning out to be Western Europe's last avowed economic nationalist. One of his first acts was to create the post of planning minister, whose job would include investing the country's enormous oil and gas surplus in Norwegian industry. Building up a nest-egg for the day when the oil runs out is half the point. The other half is keeping Norwegian industry out of foreign clutches. 
This populism might have gone down well, but Mr Jagland stumbled at the start. His first planning minister, Terje Roed Larsen, one of the architects of the Oslo accords between Israel and the Palestinians, was forced out after just three weeks on the job by allegations that he had fiddled his taxes ten years ago. His successor, Bendik Rugaas, the head of Norway's national library, is a political novice. Just before Christmas, Mr Jagland lost another minister, Grete Faremo, who ran energy. She bowed out because it was discovered that in her previous job as justice minister the intelligence service had tried to find dirt on a left-wing politician, Berge Furre, who had been on a commission looking into Norway's spooks. 
But at least Mr Jagland is lucky in his opponents. He faces a gaggle of centre and right-wing parties at war with each other over trade and the European Union. Their splits have helped keep the minority Labour government in power for all but a few months of the past ten years. They should give Mr Jagland a good shot at victory in the general election due next September. 
Denmark's prime minister, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, is as gaffe-prone as Mr Jagland but has tougher enemies. Though he presides intelligently over a growing economy and declining unemployment (currently 8.3% compared with the Eu's average of 10.9%), he has handled parliament clumsily. Denmark's right-wing opposition is fairly united. And his minority coalition has just lost one of its three bits now that the Centre Democrats have left what they think is a sinking ship. This makes a general election probable this year. Unless he comes up with sparkling news in the next few months, Mr Nyrup Rasmussen's term may well be nearing its end. 
On the face of it, Sweden's Social Democrats have a tougher task than their Danish and Norwegian cousins. They swept to power in 1994 after a slump and a financial crisis overwhelmed the conservativeled coalition under Carl Bildt (currently trying to sort out Bosnia). Cleaning up the mess has made them unpopular. The prime minister, Goeran Persson, has raised taxes and cut spending, winning praise from financial markets but annoying bluecollar and public-sector workers at the core of the Social Democrats' support. 
Glum trade unionists have taken to Stockholm's streets this winter, led by an unemployed mother of four, Therese Rajaniemi, whose cry is, in effect, that the Social Democrats have calculators where they once had hearts. Her attacks are bolstering not the centre-right opposition but leftwing parties, which want to loosen purse strings and close the nuclear power plants that supply half of Sweden's electricity. The opinion polls have Mr Bildt's Moderates (as the conservatives are called) level-pegging with Mr Persson's Social Democrats. Come 1998, Mr Persson's lot still have a good chance of emerging, once again, as Sweden's biggest party. But he may have to team up with the Greens and the Left Party (the reformed communists) if he is to keep his job. And that might mean abandoning the core of his present economic policy.

Her attacks are bolstering not the centre - right opposition but leftwing parties , which want to loosen purse strings and close the nuclear power plants that supply half of Sweden 's electricity . The opinion polls have Mr Bildt 's Moderates ( as the conservatives are called ) level - pegging with Mr Persson 's Social Democrats . Come 1998 , Mr Persson 's lot still have a good chance of emerging , once again , as Sweden 's biggest party . But he may have to team up with the Greens and the Left Party ( the reformed communists ) if he is to keep his job .

Hagen, whose Progress Party won 7% of the vote and ten of the parliament's 165 seats in 1993. But this time, if the opinion polls are right, he may grab zoo% of the vote and 30 seats, making his bunch the second biggest after the ruling Labour Party. 
The Progress Party started off in the 1970s as a libertarian, tax-cutting lot, but has since found a more alluring platform. Now it calls for lower taxes-but along with more government spending. On both counts it outbids everyone else. And another of its policy planks may also be earning it points: it wants to keep out immigrants, make those already in Norway pass a language test, and chuck out any who commit crimes. These proposals are less drastic than, for instance, those of Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front in France, which advocates blanket repatriation. All the same, they have turned the Progress Party into Norwegian pariahs. At present, no other party would consider teaming up with it in coalition. 
The opinion polls make particularly bad reading for the Labour Party and its minority government, led by Thorbjorn Jagland, who took over from Gro Harlem Brundtland as party leader and prime minister last October. You might think he would benefit from Norway's booming oil-driven economy. Yet Mr Jagland's reputation for poor judgment puts him well behind his predecessor in the approval ratings. 
If the opinion polls are accurate, Labour's share of the vote could fall from 37% in 1993 to below 3o% next month: its worst performance since the 192os. But that might still leave Mr Jagland, albeit humiliated, in office-with Mr Hagen buffeting him and his government from outside. The Progress leader says he does not seek office, but would prefer to wield clout in a hung parliament. 
If Mr Jagland cannot face that prospect, the most likely alternative is a coalition composed of the Conservatives, the traditional right-of-centre party, and two small middle-of-the-road groups-the Christian People's Party and the Liberal Party-probably under the leadership of Jan Petersen, the Conservatives' worthy but dull leader. But unless Mr Petersen got Mr Hagen's support, his coalition's chances of survival would be slim. 
Where would that leave Norway? In a fix. With Mr Hagen sniping from outside, most government combinations are likely to be weak-a peculiar outcome, given the country's economic buoyancy.

The ruling left-of-centre Labour Party lost just two seats and less than two percentage points of the vote. Nevertheless, it looks as if Labour will bow out of power. Thorbjorn Jagland, the luckless prime minister, tied his hands in August by promising to resign if Labour did not win at least the same share of the vote as in 1993. The gamble nearly paid off. As voters contemplated the alternatives, Labour recovered from a dismal 27% in the opinion polls to win 35% of the vote and 65 seats, more than twice as many as the next biggest party. Yet Mr Jagland plans to resign after putting a budget to parliament on October 13th. 
The first crack at forming a coalition will therefore go to an amiable nonentity, Kjell Magne Bondevik, leader of the middle-of-the-road Christian People's Party, which made big gains. But with whom might he govern? His alliance with the Centre (which lost ground) and the right-wing (in economics) Liberal parties (which gained) looks weak-and only gives a coalition led by Mr Bondevik a bare quarter of the votes in parliament, less than Labour on its own. He must therefore look elsewhere, at least for tacit support. 
That could come from the Conservative Party, which hints that it will back, at least at first, a minority government of the centre. But for how long? The pro-EU Conservatives say they will support a government only if it manages to keep Norway in a freetrade area with the EU and signs the EU'S open-border agreement. The Centre Party, which in 1994 led the campaign against joining the European club, is fiercely against both. 
The only other party strong enough to support a centre-right coalition-the populist Progress Party-is deemed beyond the pale and, in any event, is not interested. Its leader, Carl I. Hagen, is sometimes compared to Jean-Marie Le Pen, France's leading right-wing xenophobe, though the Norwegian is much milder. He nearly tripled his party's vote (to 15%) by calling for tighter asylum laws and playing on the disappointment of voters who could not understand why a country rolling in cash from oil and gas should have queues for medical treatment, pensioners on pittances and schools short of computers and textbooks. 
But Mr Hagen reckons, probably rightly, that his party can get more of what it wants by manipulating a hung parliament. He gives the impression he would rather deal with Labour's pretty competent ministers than with the neophytes the other parties are likely to put forward. If Mr Bondevik's shaky partnership collapses after a few weeks, Labour, which refuses to build coalitions, could be back. 
Any government may be hard pressed to resist the appeal of some of Mr Hagen's populist ideas. The oil and gas money pouring into a fund against the day when the wells run dry is a tempting target, but raiding it would be risky. With unemployment at below 4%, any extra stimulus could spark inflation and higher interest rates, jeopardising growth. Mr Bondevik and Mr Jagland, the two possible prime ministers, both see danger.

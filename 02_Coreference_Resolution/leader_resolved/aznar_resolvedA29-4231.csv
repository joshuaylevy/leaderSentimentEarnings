THE government of Felipe Gonzalez is dying on its feet. Every week seems to bring some new cry of pain. Mr Gonzalez's opponents, in politics and the press, say that he must go. The prime minister, battered and weary, has already been pushed into calling an election next spring, a year before he legally had to. The conservative opposition easily won last summer's city and regional elections; it controls 17 of Spain's 20 biggest cities and won 11 of 13 regional votes. The end of an era is at hand. What went wrong for Mr Gonzalez, and what can the other lot do to put it right?
On the face of it, the answer to the first question seems simple. Spain's establishment is drowning in a sea of corruption. Ever since Mr Gonzalez's long-serving number two, Alfonso Guerra, had to resign in 1991 after a scandal involving his businessman brother, the government has tottered from one embarrassment to the next.
There was the row about illegal financing of the ruling Socialist party. There was the sudden departure from office, amid accusations of tax-evasion and other things, of a governor of the Bank of Spain. A righteous-sounding Socialist, picked to be Spain's first civilian head of the main police force, the Civil Guard, was accused of massive embezzlement and after a ten-month manhunt was tracked down and arrested in comically louche circumstances in Bangkok. Now reports about the financial dealings of the generally popular King Juan Carlos are sharpening the sense of concern.
Most dangerously for Mr Gonzalez, a dozen senior policemen and top Socialists, including a former deputy minister of the interior, have been charged with running death squads that killed at least 27 suspected Basque terrorists in the mid-1980s. Can this have happened without Mr Gonzalez's knowledge? He says he knew nothing. The senate has set up a commission to look into the matter. The Supreme Court has asked for parliamentary immunity to be lifted so that a former interior minister can be charged with collusion in the murders.
Few people think that Mr Gonzalez himself, even if he knew of the death squads' existence, ordered the killing of those Basques (and it should be added that many Spaniards, even on the left, think the dead men got what they deserved). Nor do most people think he himself has been corrupt, though many of his friends clearly were. But Mr Gonzalez was too close to the scandals for his authority to remain undamaged. His subsequent wrigglings have done nothing to repair the damage. The steady piling up of embarrassment has taken its toll. His friends say he may stand down even before the coming election, which is due in March.
How well it all began
That would be a wry end to his 13 years in office, a period longer than any recent European leader can claim except Germany's Helmut Kohl. Whatever his government's recent shortcomings, Spain has experienced a marvellous transformation since Mr Gonzalez became prime minister in 1982.
That was only seven years after the death of General Franco, and one year after an attempted military coup. Yet Mr Gonzalez, a lad of 40 when he assumed that heritage, will leave behind him a solidly democratic Spain. This is now a country that, a few wild-eyed Basques apart, sees elections as the right and proper way of changing governments. Francoism has become a dim memory, and yet there has been little persecution of old Francoists. The army is safely back in barracks. The government of Spain has been desirably decentralised, and the power transferred to the regions has made it harder for Basque terrorists to win new recruits to their anti-Madrid cause.
Not least, Mr Gonzalez's Socialist government has changed the nature of Spanish socialism. Most of the people around him now call themselves Social Democrats rather than Socialists, and say they belong to the ""centre-left"". They have a middle-class feel to them, which is not unconnected to the fact that Mr Gonzalez has been able to win four elections in a row chiefly because much of Spain's burgeoning middle class has so far been happy to vote for him.
In economics, Mr Gonzalez has junked much of the ideological baggage his party carried into office 13 years ago. His has been a truly free-market government-rigorously monetarist, hospitable to foreign investors, firm with the trade unions, gradually willing to privatise, a dutiful slaughterer of quite a few useless industrial dinosaurs. As a result, Spain's GDP has slowly crept up from 71% of the European Union's average in 1983 to 75% in 1994. After a bad recession made worse by carelessness, growth is back to 3% a year and 1995's inflation is likely to be no worse than about 4 1/2%. A recent United Nations report rated Spain ninth in the world for its ""quality of life"". Today's Spaniards live as long as other Europeans, with an average male life-span of 73.
Mr Gonzalez's achievements abroad are no less striking. He swept Spain into the European Community (partly on the argument that membership would help to keep Spain democratic), fought off the opposition of old-guard Socialists to win a referendum that brought the country into NATO, and allowed America to keep its military bases in Spain. Mr Gonzalez has opened Spain to the world. He has made Spain look modern, and helped Spaniards to relax.
So what went wrong?
The fall from those heights is not just the result of a string of. Other things have gone wrong, just as seriously. The Spanish government, rather like Britain's, mismanaged an economic boom in the second half of the 1980s. As the head of the securities and exchange commission puts it, ""Spanish society went a bit crazy in 1986-87. Everybody thought they could become billionaires."" The government failed to keep inflation under control. A lot of flashy firms, having borrowed too much, went bust. As the economy then contracted, unemployment and the public-sector deficit both shot up.
Worse, the economy has a number of structural weaknesses that the government has addressed too timidly, too late or not at all. Spain's labour market is expensively inflexible: firms wanting to shed workers often have to pay them 45 days' compensation for every year they have worked, one of the costliest pay-offs in Europe. As a result, an increasing number of Spaniards-more than a third, say the unions-are now hired on short-term contracts, which they do not like. The Spanish tax system badly needs modernising, but the government has yet to make a start on the job.
The blackest economic cloud hanging over Spain, though, is joblessness. The official figure puts unemployment at 22% of the workforce, the highest in the European Union, way ahead even of Finland's 17%. Even when you allow for people with jobs in the unofficial economy, surveys suggest that about 17% of adult Spaniards have no proper work. The state's generous help for the rural poor reduces the number prepared to go and look for work in the towns, which is anyway pretty hard to find. On any calculation, Spain's performance in this field is the worst in the West.
Nor has this produced the industrial discipline the theorist might have expected. Spain has the EU'S second-worst figure for days lost in strikes, after Greece. There have been angry riots over the closing down of uneconomic shipyards. And the growing economic gloom of the past few years is compounded by the fact that Spain has lately suffered its longest and worst drought in the whole of the century. This has hurt agriculture, which still provides work for a lot of people; and, since Spain is one of those south European countries where city workers like to think they can turn to their country cousins for help when times are hard, it deepens the general demoralisation.
All in all, after a splendid beginning, the Socialists find themselves battered by a series of storms they have not been able to cope with. It is hard to say what Spanish socialism now consists of. The party has adopted practically all the economic doctrines of the European centre, even of the centre-right. Its supporters like to say that theycare more about povertythan the opposition does, that they are more sensitive to the Basque and Catalan desire for a sense of regional identity, that they are a shade ""more European"". All these things may be true, but they are more differences of feeling than of hard policy. It is also true that many Socialists, asked what makes them Socialists, put ""religion"" at the top oftheir list: antipathy to the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic church remains strong. But that is not, in today's Spain, an issue likely to make much difference at the polls.
The original driving-force of Spanish socialism was anti-Francoism. The Socialists of those days were the party of democracy, tolerance, modernity. Now that those things are no longer at issue, Spain's socialism has become a matter of mood. This is why the scandals have so damaged the Socialists. Many Spaniards who came to political maturity in the post-Franco era are shocked by the cynicism the scandals have exposed. ""We Socialists were not supposed to be like that,"" says a literary lioness in Madrid. That is true, and it stings. The shape of the alternative
The Spanish right is now embodied in the People's Party (PP), led by Jose Maria Aznar, himself a relative lad of 42. His party has three main components.
There is the centre-right, which loves to use words like ""pragmatic"" and ""moderate"" about itself, and believes earnestly in consensus, and is in general rather like the more solemn segments of Germany's Christian Democrats. Next comes the residue of the old Francoist right-traditionalist, centralist, nationalistic in the old Castilian way, pro-church, still more than a touch authoritarian. And then there is the new lot, the economic liberals, some of whom call themselves ""Thatcherites"". These people are keen to reduce the size of the state and let the free market rip, zealous in attacking the growing culture of welfare dependency, no believers in boring old consensus.
The consensus-seeking centre-right is the largest single element in this mixture. Most people in Madrid who take an interest in politics reckon that, if the People's Party wins the coming election, the centre-right will try to insist on setting the government's course. This group's main characteristic, judging by what its leaders say, is caution. In the run-up to the election, it will take great care not to frighten voters who have yet to make up their minds.
Last time, Mr Gonzalez scared many
Spaniards into believing that the right intended to turn back the clock, grind the faces of the poor, and so on. The new centre-right stresses the democratic, middle-class mildness that used to be the Socialists' territory. It no longer follows the Roman Catholic church on divorce, abortion and homosexuality. Nor does it champion the merits of a centralised government.
It wants to reassure people on the edges of Spain, not least the large middle class of Catalonia, politically the most important of Spain's regions. ""I prefer the federal structure,"" says a would-be finance minister, rejecting the Castilian right's old fear that Spain's unity could be undermined by breakaway Basques and Catalans. Even an old-guard figure such as Manuel Fraga, a minister under Franco who led the PP'S immediate precursor, the People's Alliance, now espouses the cause of Gallego, the local dialect of Galicia, the region he governs. Many Spaniards doubt that the People's Party has entirely changed its ideas on this subject, but the party's moderates know that the risk of being called a bunch of Castilians is their Achilles heel. They will try hard not to let it bring them to the ground.
These centre-rightists also say they will press on with the economic reforms begun by the modernisers in the Socialist Party; they believe in privatisation, deregulation, monetary rigour. But they are consolidators, not revolutionaries.
It is true that the party's economists say the tax structure should be simplified, and the top rate cut from 56% to 40%. They want contributions to the social welfare budget, currently 28.3% of the basic salary (and almost entirely paid for by employers), cut by 5%. Property, corporation and enterprise taxes should go down, too. Transport, communications, energy and banking need to be more vigorously opened up to competition. The state airline, Iberia, needs a thorough shaking up. Labour should be made more flexible (ie, easier to sack). The number of ministries and the size of their staffs must be cut.
But on each point the spokesmen of the party take care to counsel caution. Changes cannot occur in the first budget. Pensions cannot be reformed ""too soon"". Taxes cannot be reduced, reasonably enough, until there is agreement on how spending can be cut. On a wide range of issues little seems to distinguish the mainstream of the People's Party from the Socialists. Many businessmen, still fond of the corporatist consensus, will not urge a new government towards radicalism of the right. ""Politicians don't want to create panic,"" observes a car maker, approvingly.
On foreign policy, the gap between the parties, says Javier Solana, the foreign minister, is ""zero . . . You need a microscope to see the differences."" Mr Solana admits that the People's Party might be ""a bit more Gaullist"". Certainly it sounds a shade more nationalist in defence of Spanish fishermen, and more determined to protect the country's dairy farmers. It might beat the drum harder on Gibraltar. But on the main issue, the future of the European Union, most of the leading figures in the centre-right section of the party sound little different from the Socialists. The possible next foreign minister, Rafael Arias Salgado, says his party is ""even more enthusiastic about a single currency"". The mystery of Mr Aznar
The centre-right, however, is not in undisputed command of the party. The traditionalist right, composed of the heirs of Franco and the guardians of church-blessed morality, still has a voice. Several would-be ministers, including the shadow justice minister, are said to be members of Opus Dei, a rightwing religious group. Since Spain has no serious, separate party of the far right, these people will stay inside the PP. But they are no longer strong enough to dominate it. Their followers will vote for Mr Aznar, but they will not be able to control him.
A more formidable challenge may come from the Thatcherites. It is hard to measure the size of this group, but its opinions are clear-cut. The Thatcherites have no time for Francoist economics. They want to move fast; the party cannot assume more than one four-year term in power, they say, so it cannot afford to tiptoe into serious reform. On social issues, they are generally libertarian. They are dismissive of what they see as the soggy fudge of German Christian Democracy. They are also wary of the idea of a federal Europe. Several of them are friends of Britain's half-Castilian minister of defence, Michael Portillo, an ardent Eurosceptic.
Another sign of vitality in the People's Party is its new openness to women and the young. The shadow ministers of agriculture, education and social security are all women. So are the PP mayors of Seville, Valencia, Saragossa and Malaga. Mr Aznar's wife is a power in the party.
No less important is the relative youth of many of the party's leading figures. A dozen years ago it was Mr Gonzalez who epitomised young, modern Spain. Now the Socialists' core constituency consists of the rural poor and nervous pensioners. The impatient young have swung to the right. This has had its effect on policy. The PP is readier than the Socialists to cut the length of time young conscripts have to spend in the armed forces; it might even abolish conscription altogether, and give Spain a small professional army instead. It is at least as interested as Mr Gonzalez's party in the environment, another thing that youth cares about. The Socialists have begun to look more conservative than the people who want to replace them.
Which strand of the PP will prevail if the party wins power? The conventional wisdom in Madrid has it that the apparently dull and cautious Mr Aznar, solidly unspectacular when he was head of the province of Castile-Leon before taking over the party leadership, is a natural consensus man. After the glitter of Mr Gonzalez, say many, Spain needs this unphotogenic, seemingly boring tax lawyer.
Mr Aznar is still a bit of a mystery. He has gained in confidence lately. His calmness and dignity after Basque terrorists narrowly failed to blow him up in Madrid last April were widely applauded. But he still keeps his cards close to his chest, though he has written (apparently without much ghosting) a respectable outline of his beliefs which suggests that he has been doing a commendable amount of reading of Karl Popper, David Hume and others. The battle for his mind continues.
Two big questions remain. One is about Spain's ""nationalities"": how, essentially, Mr Aznar proposes to deal with the Catalans and the Basques. If he fails to win an outright majority of seats in the next parliament, as is entirely possible, he will have to decide whether he wishes to buy the support of those regions' parties with a further devolution of power from Madrid.
The even bigger question concerns the economy. Although the People's Party has lately sounded so studiously moderate, Mr Aznar may decide that the economy's structural problems-with its tax system, the labour market, welfare, pensions, the banksare so severe that only brave and radical action as soon as he gets into office will have a chance of solving them. The Thatcherites think he is more attracted to their ideas than he lets on, and that he might become more adventurous once in power. ""I am a liberal, not a Thatcherite,"" he has said. ""Wait and see,"" the Hispano-Thatcherites retort.
The more cautious people in his party say that, if he is converted to radicalism, Mr Aznar will be taking a risk with Spain's newborn democracy, still too frail to stand the shock of drastic economic reform. The irony is that, if Mr Aznar decides to ignore these nervous colleagues, it will be because of what he inherits from Mr Gonzalez. his 13 years, Mr Gonzalez has overseen Spain's transformation into a firmly-rooted democracy that might, in fact, accept the painful measures which Spain needs at least as much as does the rest of Western Europe.
Post-Franco Spain has been, on the whole, a remarkable success. But it has not removed all the weaknesses of the Franco times, and Mr Gonzalez's Socialists have been in power long enough to have produced new flaws of their own. Spain needs something livelier, post-Gonzalez, than just a dutiful preserver of things as they are.",230,Spain,"After 13 years in power , Spain 's Socialists are almost certainly heading for the exit .

The Socialists have begun to look more conservative than the people who want to replace them . 
 Which strand of the PP will prevail if the party wins power ? The conventional wisdom in Madrid has it that Jose Maria Aznar party leadership , is a natural consensus man . After the glitter of Jose Maria Aznar , say many , Spain needs Jose Maria Aznar . 
 Jose Maria Aznar is still a bit of a mystery . Jose Maria Aznar has gained in confidence lately . Jose Maria Aznar's calmness and dignity after Basque terrorists narrowly failed to blow Jose Maria Aznar up in Madrid last April were widely applauded . But Jose Maria Aznar still keeps Jose Maria Aznar's cards close to Jose Maria Aznar's chest , though Jose Maria Aznar has written ( apparently without much ghosting ) a respectable outline of Jose Maria Aznar's beliefs which suggests that Jose Maria Aznar has been doing a commendable amount of reading of Karl Popper , David Hume and others . The battle for Jose Maria Aznar's mind continues . 
 Two big questions remain . One is about Spain 's "" nationalities "" : how , essentially , Jose Maria Aznar proposes to deal with the Catalans and the Basques . If Jose Maria Aznar fails to win an outright majority of seats in the next parliament , as is entirely possible , Jose Maria Aznar will have to decide whether Jose Maria Aznar wishes to buy the support of those regions ' parties with a further devolution of power from Madrid . 
 The even bigger question concerns the economy . Although the People 's Party has lately sounded so studiously moderate , Jose Maria Aznar may decide that the economy 's structural problems - with its tax system , the labour market , welfare , pensions , the banksare so severe that only brave and radical action as soon as Jose Maria Aznar gets into office will have a chance of solving them . The Thatcherites think Jose Maria Aznar is more attracted to their ideas than Jose Maria Aznar lets on , and that Jose Maria Aznar might become more adventurous once in power . "" Jose Maria Aznar am a liberal , not a Thatcherite , "" Jose Maria Aznar has said . "" Wait and see , "" the Hispano - Thatcherites retort . 
 The more cautious people in Jose Maria Aznar's party say that , if Jose Maria Aznar is converted to radicalism , Jose Maria Aznar will be taking a risk with Spain 's newborn democracy , still too frail to stand the shock of drastic economic reform . The irony is that , if Jose Maria Aznar decides to ignore these nervous colleagues , it will be because of what Jose Maria Aznar inherits from Jose Maria Aznar . Jose Maria Aznar's 13 years , Jose Maria Aznar has overseen Spain 's transformation into a firmly - rooted democracy that might , in fact , accept the painful measures which Spain needs at least as much as does the rest of Western Europe . 
 Post - Franco Spain has been , on the whole , a remarkable success . But it has not removed all the weaknesses of the Franco times , and Jose Maria Aznar's Socialists have been in power long enough to have produced new flaws of their own . Spain needs something livelier , Jose Maria Aznar , than just a dutiful preserver of things as they are .",PRE TERM,True,True

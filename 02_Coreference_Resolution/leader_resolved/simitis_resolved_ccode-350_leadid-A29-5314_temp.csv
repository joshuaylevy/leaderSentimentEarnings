Andreas Papandreou, Greece's prime minister, is in hospital, stricken with pneumonia. His voluptuous young wife Dimitra is constantly at his bedside. His ex-wife Margaret and their grown-up children come and go, looking distraught. The paparazzi are poised outside the gleaming Onasseion Cardiac Centre, given to the nation by another Greek with an eye for the ladies, Aristotle Onassis. Papandreou loyalists shout insults at dissident members of the governing Socialist party arriving to pay what they probably hope will be their last respects.
 But is it the final episode? Like characters in ""Dallas"", a favourite with Greek television viewers, Mr Papandreou has bounced back to life before. He has survived open-heart surgery, three election defeats and a trial for corruption, of which he was acquitted by one vote. His tenacity was rewarded when voters nostalgic for the freespending policies of the 1980s swept his Socialists back to power two years ago.
But a full recovery looks less likely this time. Not only is Mr Papandreou's health much worse--he has stomach and liver problems as well as a weak heart--but his party is growing impatient for a change of leader. Even if he gets over the pneumonia, it could be several months before he is strong enough to chair a cabinet meeting, let alone attend a European Union summit.
He was rushed to hospital five days before a party meeting at which the ""gang of four"", as the party's main dissident faction is known, planned to force a showdown over the succession. The meeting has been cancelled. The show of sick-bed unity the party is now putting on is unlikely to last more than a couple of weeks.
The four--Costas Simitis, Vasso Papandreou (no relation), Theodoros Pangalos and Paraskevas Avgerinos--are all ex-cabinet ministers who believe that Greece must pull its economy into shape, build better ties with its Balkan neighbours and generally get closer to its EU partners. Miss Papandreou used to be the Union's social-affairs commissioner, Mr Pangalos Greece's energetic minister for Europe.
Until events overtook them, the four wanted Mr Papandreou to agree on how the party should choose a new prime minister, and on a time for his retirement. Right now, it is unclear whether a new person would be elected by a party congress, by the Socialists' 150-member central committee or by their 170 members of parliament. If Mr Papandreou hangs on long enough to convene a congress, the pro-European faction will be at a disadvantage. Neither Mr Simitis nor Miss Papandreou, the rebel quartet's candidates for prime minister, can be sure of backing from the grass-roots Socialists who would be delegates at the congress.
As the highest-ranking cabinet member, Akis Tsohatzopoulos, minister for public administration, is standing in as prime minister. He is also a leader of the party's populists, who care more about staying in power than meeting the Maastricht targets for Europe's monetary union. These Socialists would not hesitate to drop policies that have squeezed wages and pensions, increased unemployment among the young and made farmers, for the first time, pay tax.
But if Mr Papandreou resigns while in hospital, it is the Socialists in parliament who would be required under the constitution to vote for a new prime minister. The ""gang of four"" is liked by other backbenchers. It would be much easier for Mr Simitis to strike a deal with Mr Tsohatzopoulos and the populists in the corridors of parliament, than at a full-blooded party gathering.","IT HAS been a gripping week for devotees of a soap opera called Greek politics .

Even more remarkable for a Greek politician, he would like to improve relations with Turkey, Greece's traditional foe.

Mr Simitis won over, in the election, Costas Laliotis, the public-works minister and influential fixer in the party machine. The new prime minister has tried to mollify his defeated rivals by leaving them in their jobs and by sharing out junior cabinet posts fairly equally between populists and pro-Europeans.

Nor is the contest yet over for Mr Simitis. He will be up for election again in June, this time as leader of Pasok. Delegates to a special party congress must then pick a successor to Mr Papandreou. Though the prime minister does not have to be party leader, if Mr Simitis stood and were defeated, that would be seen as a vote of no confidence in him and would wreck his prime ministership.

THE appointment last month of Costas Simitis as prime minister of Greece was good news. In a three-way contest among the ruling party's top parliamentarians, he was plainly the best candidate. Though Greece is still awash with problems, the country had begun to perk up even before Mr Simitis took the top job. Will this latest, rare burst of hope come to anything, or will Greece relapse into bad old ways?
Most Greeks are keen to give Mr Simitis a chance. Even his opponents on the Greek right are inclined, for the time being, to be generous. ""He's decent and honest,"" says a rising right-wing member of parliament-a compliment rarely bestowed by Greek politicians even on their allies. ""Uncharismatic, of course, but reliable, moderateand a social democrat."" Not, be it noted, ""a Socialist"", though Mr Simitis's party calls itself the Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement, familiarly abbreviated to Pasok
The retirement of 77-year-old Andreas Papandreou, who has been on life-support machines since November, brought a sigh of relief Under his aegis, Greece had become the bad-joke member of the European club. Mr Papandreou, who won power in 1981 and had held it ever since, except for a break between 1989 and 1993, had caused constant headaches for most of his western counterparts and was a dreadful advertisement for Greece: a brilliant manipulative populist, but cynical, profligate, demagogic, a master of patronage, prejudice and intrigue.
Mr Simitis, at 59, brings a whiff of fresh air. He has swept most of Mr Papandreou's court out of the new cabinet. The third and current Mrs Papandreou and her friends will no longer have a say in public-works contracts. Cabinet meetings will, it is said, be regular and more ""transparent"". Mr Simitis carries no taint of corruption. Nor is he surrounded by a coterie of identifiable hangers-on or big-business pals, though he was undoubtedly the businessman's choice for prime minister.
A former law lecturer in Germany who was also educated in Britain, Mr Simitis is keen to undo Greece's reputation as the delinquent of the European Union. Mr Papandreou, who at first opposed Greek membership, gave the impression that the EU was simply Greece's milch cow; Mr Simitis stresses Greece's obligations. His closest backers, Theodoros Pangalos, the new foreign minister, and Vasso Papandreou (no relation), a former European commissioner who heads a new super-ministry, are seasoned Brussels operators who should help keep the EU money gushing.
Mr Simitis also has the good fortune to arrive in power just when Greece is showing signs of slowly clambering out of its deep economic pit. The core of an able economic team is already in place, with three youngish ""Papas"" in the key jobs: Loukas Papademos at the central bank, Yannos Papantoniou at economic planning, and Alekos Papadopoulos at finance. The trio are zealous converts to austerity, monetary rigour and, albeit of a gradual and partial kind, privatisation.
Under their lash, the figures have already begun to look less horrible. Inflation, at 10.8% in 1994, dropped to 8.1% at the end of last year. The deficit fell to 8.9% of GDP against 9.7% for the previous year(the target for the EU's economic and monetary union is 3%). Growth, at minus 0.5% in 1993 and 1.5% in 1994, was 2% last year and, they hope, will reach 2.8% this year.
Drastic measures have been taken to improve tax collection. The taxman is now entitled to levy an ""imputed income tax"" on the basis of people's trappings of wealth (fancy cars, new houses, and so on). In the past many Greeks, especially the self employed and professionals such as lawyers and doctors, as well as farmers (who paid no income tax at all), have managed to plead ridiculously low earnings.
Yet the underlying facts of the economy remain bleak. Greece's GDP growth rate over the past 15 years, at 1.6%, is half the EU average. It still has the highest inflation rate in the Union, the lowest productivity, the biggest national-debt ratio, the highest general-government budget deficit as a percentage of GDP, the worst trade imbalance. Only unemployment, at 9.6%, is roughly at the EU's average. And all this despite receiving the largest handouts from the Eu: $15.9 billion spread over the current five-year period (1994-99), plus at least another $5 billion in soft Euro-loans-in total, more than 6% of Greece's GDP. But Greece has failed dismally to make good use of this massive amount of money or, in the past, to give a good account for how it is spent.
Mr Simitis is determined to change Greece's reputation for being a wastrel. He is also keen to make Greece more loved in its ""near abroad"". His wary handling of a recent row with Turkey over a rocky outcrop in the Aegean was a good sign. He has been roundly castigated in Greece for backing down, but it was the right thing to do. Dealing calmly with Turkey, the old enemy, is his top foreign priority.
The end of the cold-war balance of fear in south-eastern Europe, and then the war in ex Yugoslavia, mayhem in the Caucasus and Turkish prickliness, revived many of Greece's ancient anxieties. Its support in exYugoslavia for its fellow Orthodox Serbs has been astonishingly crude. It has mishandled relations with next-door Albania, Macedonia and Bulgaria. But, once again, Mr Simitis has luck on his side. Relations with Greece's three Balkan neighbours are improving. If peace in Bosnia holds, Greece can prosper as a trading country at the foot of the Balkans.
The worst failing of Greek foreign policy, though, is still rooted in history. True, Greece's borders and territory have been disarmingly fluid for the past 150 years. Enemy armies have crossed Greece's northern borders three times this century. All the same, too many Greeks still see their country as a permanent underdog, endlessly ""betrayed"" by big-power or Muslim conspiracies. Mr Papandreou was expert at tapping into such Balkan paranoia. Mr Simitis may be less inclined to do so.
Yet the toughest job of all will be to change Greece's backward political culture. Most Greeks still view political parties as purveyors of perks and jobs, rather than principles. Until now parties have invariably revolved around ""big men"", often scions of political dynasties and masters of patronage. This old Ottoman system of rousfeti-you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours-infects the huge and bloated public sector, a far too political judiciary and a press that has forgotten-if it ever knew-how to be independent.
Mr Simitis is not strong enough to attack such glaring defects head-on. He has no punch inside Pasok's party machine. He was made prime minister by a small margin. He is not yet formal leader of the party, a job that still belongs to Mr Papandreou. Mr Simitis needs the extra clout the party leadership would give him if he is not to lose his early momentum.
He could lose it anyway. He can be indecisive. As a leader, he is untested. He has only a year and a bit before the next general election. The other would-be within Pasok-people like Messrs Papantoniou and Papadopoulos-are half a generation younger. Greece may have to wait a while for real modernity to arrive.","ATHENS

The taxman is now entitled to levy an "" imputed income tax "" on the basis of people 's trappings of wealth ( fancy cars , new houses , and so on ) . In the past many Greeks , especially the self employed and professionals such as lawyers and doctors , as well as farmers ( who paid no income tax at all ) , have managed to plead ridiculously low earnings . 
 Yet the underlying facts of the economy remain bleak . Greece 's GDP growth rate over the past 15 years , at 1.6 % , is half the EU average . It still has the highest inflation rate in the Union , the lowest productivity , the biggest national - debt ratio , the highest general - government budget deficit as a percentage of GDP , the worst trade imbalance . Only unemployment , at 9.6 % , is roughly at the EU 's average . And all this despite receiving the largest handouts from the Eu : $ 15.9 billion spread over the current five - year period ( 1994 - 99 ) , plus at least another $ 5 billion in soft Euro - loans - in total , more than 6 % of Greece 's GDP . But Greece has failed dismally to make good use of this massive amount of money or , in the past , to give a good account for how it is spent . 
 Costas Simitis is determined to change Greece 's reputation for being a wastrel . Costas Simitis is also keen to make Greece more loved in its "" near abroad "" . Costas Simitis's wary handling of a recent row with Turkey over a rocky outcrop in the Aegean was a good sign . Costas Simitis has been roundly castigated in Greece for backing down , but it was the right thing to do . Dealing calmly with Turkey , the old enemy , is Costas Simitis's top foreign priority . 
 The end of the cold - war balance of fear in south - eastern Europe , and then the war in ex Yugoslavia , mayhem in the Caucasus and Turkish prickliness , revived many of Greece 's ancient anxieties . Its support in exYugoslavia for its fellow Orthodox Serbs has been astonishingly crude . It has mishandled relations with next - door Albania , Macedonia and Bulgaria . But , once again , Costas Simitis has luck on Costas Simitis's side . Relations with Greece 's three Balkan neighbours are improving . If peace in Bosnia holds , Greece can prosper as a trading country at the foot of the Balkans . 
 The worst failing of Greek foreign policy , though , is still rooted in history . True , Greece 's borders and territory have been disarmingly fluid for the past 150 years . Enemy armies have crossed Greece 's northern borders three times this century . All the same , too many Greeks still see their country as a permanent underdog , endlessly "" betrayed "" by big - power or Muslim conspiracies . Mr Papandreou was expert at tapping into such Balkan paranoia . Costas Simitis may be less inclined to do so . 
 Yet the toughest job of all will be to change Greece 's backward political culture . Most Greeks still view political parties as purveyors of perks and jobs , rather than principles . Until now parties have invariably revolved around "" big men "" , often scions of political dynasties and masters of patronage . This old Ottoman system of rousfeti - you scratch my back and I 'll scratch yours - infects the huge and bloated public sector , a far too political judiciary and a press that has forgotten - if it ever knew - how to be independent . Costas Simitis is not strong enough to attack such glaring defects head - on . Costas Simitis has no punch inside Pasok 's party machine . Costas Simitis was made prime minister by a small margin . Costas Simitis is not yet formal leader of the party , a job that still belongs to Mr Papandreou . Costas Simitis needs the extra clout the party leadership would give Costas Simitis if Costas Simitis is not to lose Costas Simitis's early momentum . 
 Costas Simitis could lose it anyway . Costas Simitis can be indecisive . As a leader , Costas Simitis is untested . Costas Simitis has only a year and a bit before the next general election . The other would - be within Pasok - people like Messrs Papantoniou and Papadopoulos - are half a generation younger .

In his five months in office, he has had to contend with a confrontation with Turkey, bad news about the economy and rumbles of dissent within his own party from colleagues who were against his appointment in the first place In the next few weeks, however, he has a chance to assert his authority and, with luck, to get 
Greece moving in the right direction. Worries about Turkey and infighting within his Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) have meant that Mr Simitis has been unable to devote enough time to the economy. Reforms are creaking, inflation has risen again, to more than 9%. Greece's always dim hope of hitting the European Union's target for joining economic and monetary union has become still dimmer. 
Still, Mr Simitis and his more modernminded friends are likely to prevail at a party congress later this month. The younger barons, such as the public-works minister, Costas Laliotis, and an influential party official, Costas Skandalides, support him and are expected to help squash a disloyal minister, Akis Tsochatzopoulos. Mr Simitis has one other useful weapon: most Greeks still like his performance. 
His start, though, has been inauspicious. An argument with Turkey over the ownership of some rocks in the Aegean broke out within days of his appointment. Mr Simitis sensibly let the Americans prod him into compromise, which his enemies derided as a humiliating climbdown. 
But Mr Simitis has clawed his way back in the polls, partly because Greeks are still so relieved that Andreas Papandreou, his predecessor, is no longer in charge The frail Mr Papandreou now languishes with his young wife Dimitra in their embarrassingly glitzy ""pink villa' in northern Athens. 
He is occasionally glimpsed on television. He may appear briefly at the party congress. As Pasok's founder, he will stay on as chairman-for-life, but he is physically and politically too weak to stop Mr Simitis from strengthening his grip. 
Part of Mr Simitis's appeal is his very lack of the charisma that Mr Papandreou had in spades. Whereas the old guard used the spoils of office to build garish villas, Mr Simitis lives like most Greeks: in a trafficbegrimed block on a noisy street. He usually walks to work and sometimes chats with old pals from the Panteios School of 
Political Science in a local cafe. No whiff of corruption hangs over his earnest advisers. 
But that pleasant prime ministerial change of style will not be enough, on its own, to drag Greece out of its foreign-policy and economic troubles. This month Turkey raised the stakes in the Aegean by questioning Greek sovereignty over yet another tiny island, Gavdos. This latest flashpoint lies south of Crete, closer to Libya than to Turkey. Moving from verbal to lethal exchanges of fire cannot be ruled out. 
Tension with the Turks is bad for the economy. Mr Simitis seems likely to give in to the hard men in his cabinet, such as Gerasimos Arsenis, the defence minister and another of Mr Simitis's rivals, who now cites Gavdos-among other things-as a reason for boosting the defence budget. 
Mr Arsenis says Greece must buy new fighter aircraft and weapons systems. The defence budget this year is already 4.6% of GDP, the highest proportion in NATo. Another big jump could wipe out the gains of the past five painful years, which have seen the public-sector deficit slowly but steadily shrinking. Mr Simitis is keen not to raise taxes, and cannot want to borrow either: Greece's public debt is already over ill% of GDP, compared with the 60% limit prescribed by the European Union's Maastricht criteria. Yet, if he cannot convince the Greeks that he will eventually bring them into Europe's mainstream, his popularity will start to fall.

He was also one of the most controversial. His political skills were enormous, but so were his follies. Perhaps his most remarkable achievement was that, after he won power in 1981, a solid two-fifths (or more) of the Greek people continued to vote for him however much his policies zigzagged, however demagogic his rhetoric, however erratic his fiscal management, however corrupt his inner court of cronies, however exotic his private life. 
It is hard to say exactly what Mr Papandreou stood for. As a youth he was arrested as a Trotskyite. Emigrating to America in 1938, he made good as a liberal economist. He returned to his Greek roots after two decades, only to be exiled again in 1967 (after eight months in prison) following the colonels' putsch. When the colonels' junta collapsed, he returned in 1974, and founded his Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement, known as Pasok. If Pasok's charter had a Marxist ring about it, Mr Papandreou's rhetoric sounded fiercely nationalist and socialist. Over the years the rhetoric and Pasok veered wildly, according to the political suitability of the moment, but became more or less social democratic 
In foreign policy, as in economics, Mr Papandreou was a tangle of contradictions, none of which seemed to hamper him. At first fiercely opposed to the European Union, Mr Papandreou kept Greece in the club, becoming adept at milking it of money which now accounts for 6% of Greece's GDP. He threatened to veto Spain's and Portugal's membership of the EU unless poor countries got even more handouts from the rich. In NATO he stressed Greece's strategic place as an outpost of democracy in the Balkans, although here again he was an awkward partner, blocking NATO decisions. His most constant weapon was a brilliant populism, occasionally larded-after the colonels' erawith a virulent anti-Americanism and a fuzzy third-worldliness. 
Making mischief 
He triumphed in a ""short march to power"" from 1974, when his fledgling Pasok won 14% of votes cast, to 1981, when he won a crushing general election victory with 48%. In 1993, having only recently been acquitted by a single vote on a charge of corruption, Mr Papandreou led his party to victory with a no less remarkable 47% of the vote. 
Despite being on life-support machines since last autumn, he surrendered the prime-ministership only in January. He remained leader of Pasok until his death. Through his cronies and his latest (third) wife, a former air hostess 36 years his junior and regarded by some as ridiculously vulgar, he had begun to make mischief even for the current, more modern-minded, prime minister, Costas Simitis. 
His solid achievements in office were social reforms, boosting the health service and welfare system, and the healing of the wounds of Greece's civil war (1946-49) which enabled thousands of ex-communists to gain pensions (and jobs for their children in an ever-more-bloated public sector). 
His failings included the massive debt accumulated as a result of reckless spending in the 1980s and dismal growth: his socialist populism frightened off many Greek entrepreneurs, so that billions of dollars that might have been invested in Greece went abroad. 
His zeal for making a populist splash prompted him periodically to pander to the Soviet Union (backing the Russian version, for instance, of the downing of a South Korean aircraft in 1983) and to give solace to the likes of Libya's Colonel Qaddafi and assorted Palestinian terrorists. His sure-fire vote winner was a blazing anti-Turkish vehemence. He failed signally to take advantage of the overtures of the then Turkish leader, Turgut Ozal, in the late 198os. In the past few years, his support for Serbia in Bosnia and his refusal to recognise Macedonia because of its name squandered Greece's chance to help make the Balkans safer. Mr Papandreou was supremely skilled at exploiting Greeks' lingering sense that they are one of history's victims. 
He perpetuated the tradition that politics is essentially a game of patronage, to be controlled by a strongman and a cabal of corrupt insiders, often underpinned by a dynasty. Mr Papandreou's father had twice been prime minister (once running a party modestly called the George Papandreou Party) The name continues in Greek politics: Mr Papandreou put his own (rather decent) son in his cabinet. Rousfeti-a word of Turkish origin denoting the reciprocal dispensation of favours-has remained the norm. For Mr Papandreou, Greek voters were clients. 
With luck the consensus-seeking Mr Simitis will now secure the party leadership and, with some able young technocrats already running key ministries, will help Greece shed the worst of his predecessor's legacy. Mr Papandreou was charming, clever and a populist genius. But he held back Greece's economic and political growth.

Because the congress opened the day af ter the elaborate state funeral of Andreas Papandreou, Pasok's founder, emotions were running unusually high. Mr Simitis's criticism of Mr Papandreou's autocratic ways further raised the temperature. So did his threat to resign as prime minister if he failed to become Pasok's chairman. Most members of Pasok's ""politburo"" (a nickname reflecting the party's Marxist origins) favoured a power-sharing deal to split the jobs of prime minister and party leader and so curb Mr Simitis's zeal for economic reform. The politburo will be replaced by a new executive to Mr Simitis's liking. 
So Mr Simitis can now pursue his hopes of dragging Greece out of its Balkan backwardness and raising it to something like West European levels of efficiency. The day after his victory, foreign investors keen to take advantage of high interest rates on a new issue of government bonds pumped in more than $5oom. Greece is at last setting up an agency to shepherd foreign companies through the bureaucratic maze and help them get government grants to set up factories in the north-eastern province of Thrace, within easy reach of new markets opening up around the Black Sea. Cutting red tape should also speed the disbursement of another lo billion ecus ($iz.4 billion) of European Union grants for improving Greece's roads, ports and railways.

His victory should also break the budget log-jam. His scheme to cut 300 billion drachmas ($1.2 billion) a year from government spending-1.5% of GDP--should now, after languishing on his desk for months, win the party's approval. Controls on procurement for hospitals, clinics and so on would be tightened, and local-government spending capped. 
But the biggest battle will be over that curse of Mr Papandreou's Greece: patronage. Mr Simitis wants to cut the public-sector payroll by hiring only one new civil servant for every three who leave. But the 4o% of Pasok's members who are public-sector workers will fight ferociously to keep their jobs and win new ones for cousins and friends. Mr Tsochatzo poulos, the public-administration minister who has let public-sector employment grow by 2.7% in little over a year, is right behind them. 
For the moment, Mr Simitis is being gentle. Rather than sack Mr Tsochatzopoulos and his cabinet supporters forthwith, he will try to win them over. If he fails, he will have no choice but to call an early election, probably this autumn. Opinion polls suggest he would win.

Shortly after an Italian court had freed Erich Priebke, a former ss officer who participated in the massacre of 335 Italian civilians in the second world war, he was re-arrested because Germany had applied for his extradition. 
France's prime minister, Alain Juppe, said his cabinet had agreed to cut government spending by 2% in real terms in 1997. Earlier speculation that France would fail to qualify for monetary union in 1999 weakened the French franc and lowered bond prices.

A bloodbath loomed in Chechnya, then seemed to recede, as another shaky ceasefire collapsed and Russian forces prepared to take back parts of the republic's capital, Grozny, captured by rebels earlier this month. Boris Yeltsin's defence adviser, Alexander Lebed, made a lastditch attempt to stave off a resumption of full-scale war. 
Mr Yeltsin's health continued to cause worry. After being invisible since his inauguration on August 9th, the president appeared on television and was reported to be working in the Kremlin. But it was unclear whether he was making day-to-day decisions. Mr Lebed suggested that the president's signature on an important decree on Chechnya had been faked. 
The five Nordic nations said they supported the efforts of the three Baltic countries to join NATO, though two of the Nordics, Finland and Sweden, are not members themselves. The chancellor of hitherto neutral Austria, Franz Vranitzky, said his country was in no hurry to join.

Magistrates in northern Italy want to investigate Umberto Bossi, leader of the separatist Northern League, on the ground that some of his speeches could have incited his followers to assault opponents of his party. 
The United States appears reluctant to renegotiate the rent for its 18th-century official residence in Moscow, fixed in 1985 at 70,000 roubles. Then it was worth about $60,000; inflation has whittled that down to $13. 
The Taiwan thorn 
Taiwan's relations with China were again under a cloud after President Lee Teng-hui suggested slowing down investment in China, which has amounted to $30 billion over the past eight years. China offered to resume direct shipping links and start political talks. But the Chinese were riled when the Taiwanese deputy president, Lien Chan, turned up in Europe, possibly seeking business and diplomatic ties. 
In unprecedented scenes of violence before the government presented its budget, Australia's Parliament building in Canberra was attacked by several thousand people protesting against proposed trade-union reforms and cuts in government spending. But the stringent budget, which included a 10% cut in foreign aid, was welcomed by the markets. 
South Korean police stormed a Seoul university, arresting more than 5,000 students demanding unification with North Korea and the withdrawal of American troops.

When the prime minister, Costas Simitis, called a snap election for September 22nd, his advisers believed his Panhellenic Socialist Movement, better known as Pasok, would come back with a surge. But he may need a bit more electricity to be sure of winning his party another four years of power. As the campaign approaches its final week, Mr Simitis is still searching for the on switch. 
The prime minister is personally well liked, but he seems unable to excite crowds accustomed to the fiery populism of his predecessor, the late Andreas Papandreou. The professorial Mr Simitis is used to campaigning sombrely for his safe seat in Piraeus, Athens's port, where his father was a well-known lawyer. Now he has to try to wow the masses at rallies in the provinces. Pasok supporters have turned out as usual to cheer and wave party flags, but instead of being carried away on a sea of peppy nationalist slogans, they have found themselves drowning in a swamp of glum budget-deficit statistics. 
New Democracy, the main conservative opposition, led by Miltiades Evert, an old war-horse, is doing better than expected. Some opinion polls even give it the lead. Mr Evert has been making promises that win votes. He says he will restore tax-breaks and subsidies for farmers; junk the Socialists' unpopular new system of taxing the .presumed"" rather than ""declared"" income of the self-employed, who make up a third of the Greek workforce; boost Greece's tourism; and speed up the implementation of grants from the European Union. 
But Mr Simitis's surprise bugbear is not Mr Evert but Dimitris Tsovolas, a Socialist defector on the left whose Democratic Renewal Movement, known as Dikki, says Pasok has swung too far to the technocratic right. A finance minister in the Papandreou days of extravagant welfare hand-outs, he was later convicted of involvement in a bank embezzlement scandal. Mr Tsovolas's call for a return to good old third-world socialism appeals to those Pasokites who resent Mr Simitis's new economics and cosiness with the European Union and America. If Mr Tsovolas steals 5% of Pasok's vote and a dozen seats in the 3oo-member parliament, he might just dish Mr Simitis. 
Yet the prime minister should still, overall, have an edge. Greece's businessmen are mostly behind him. Younger voters like his moderate pro-European views. The economy is more or less under control. Inflation, still the highest in the EU at 8.5%, is nonetheless dipping. The economy is expected to grow this year by 2.6%, the highest rate for five years. After much delay, the government will, says Mr Simitis, cut public spending to squeeze the 1997 budget deficit to 4.2% of GDP. If all this happens, and inflation falls sharply, Greece could even have a chance of joining Europe's singlecurrency club in a second wave of countries after the turn of the century. 
The West likes Mr Simitis too. Despite tensions in the Aegean and over Cyprus, he seems determined to get on better with Turkey. He is friendlier than his predecessor was with his Balkan neighbours, especially Albania and Macedonia. In Brussels, he sounds co-operative rather than confrontational. He enjoys chatting to Helmut Kohlin German. 
It has been a tough start. It was hard for Mr Simitis to swing Pasok's Mps behind him to become prime minister in January. It was harder still to wrest the party leadership from Mr Papandreou's cronies in June. And if he can squeak through this next round of national politics, he might have a chance of keeping his country, at last, on a sensible course.

Costas Simitis and his Panhellenic Socialist Movement won 41.5% of the vote and 162 seats against 38.1% and io8 seats for Miltiades Evert and his conservative New Democracy. Under Greece's muscular proportional-representation system, which rewards the leading party with extra seats, Mr Simitis's 41.5% gives him a comfortable majority in the 30o-seat chamber. 
More important, perhaps, the Socialists now seem to be properly under his control. All but one of the chief adherents of his unpredictable predecessor, Andreas Papandreou, lost their seats in parliament. So did most of the supporters of Gerasimos Arsenis, a rival for the prime minister's job who has consistently tried to undermine Mr Simitis. The prime minister's pro-reform faction claims to have won about 120 of the party's 162 seats. 
Even so, Mr Simitis has been merciful; both Mr Arsenis and another of his former rivals, Akis Tsochatzopoulos, have jobs in the new cabinet. Mr Arsenis moves from defence to education, which is a demotion, and Mr Tsochatzopoulos, who takes over the defence ministry, will be under the surveillance of pro-Simitis staff officers. Both may be pushed aside later. But a facade of unity is preserved while the Socialists remain in mourning for Papandreou. 
The pro-Europeans who backed Mr Simitis on his way to the top-Vasso Papandreou (no relation of Andreas), the development ""super-minister"", Theodoros Pangalos, the foreign minister, and Yannos Papantoniou, the economy minister-have all stayed put. But they too will be watched. Mr Simitis has appointed some of his closest allies as their assistants. 
So far, this all looks rather neat. Mr Simitis may also make a better job of relations with Turkey than his mercurial and often tub-thumping predecessor did. Here, Mr Simitis's plodding cautiousness could be an asset. Better ties with the Turks are essential if he is to carry out his pledge to lead ""a strong Greece into the 21St century"". The new Islamist-led government in Ankara makes Greeks feel nervous, but Mr Simitis has stayed reassuringly cool. He (just) avoided a clash with the Turks over some rocks in the Aegean in January. He calmed down the Greek Cypriots in the summer after two demonstrators were killed by Turks in the United Nations buffer zone. 
Not all Greeks suffer from knee-jerk anti-Turkishness. Greek businessmen, who flocked to vote for Mr Simitis, want to make money out of trading with Turkey under the umbrella of its new customs union with the European Union. If Greece and Turkey were to agree on nothing more than open markets and staying calm, trade and tourism might start, very gradually, to heal their ancient animosity. 
Peace with the Turks needs help from the United States. So Mr Simitis has promoted George Papandreou, a more relaxed and open-minded man than his father, to be ""alternate"" foreign minister, a job that gives him almost as much clout as Mr Pangalos. The late prime minister's son can be a credible envoy for Mr Simitis. The Americans trust him, not least because he was willing to put their views to his father. And he is a Greek who can talk reasonably to Tansu Ciller, Turkey's foreign minister.

COSTAS SIMITIS, Greece's soft-spoken prime minister, has been doing well in his campaign to make his country modem. He has just faced down striking farmers and got parliament to pass a tight budget for 1997. But he is paying a high price for keeping his fractious Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) on the side of reform. He has pandered to hawks who enjoy needling Turkey. And he faces a new wave of resistance to his economic plans from outside the party. 
The resignation this month of Christos Rozakis, the deputy foreign minister, was significant. What made him bow out was opposition within the government to his moderation over Turkey. The two countries are quarrelling, as ever, over possible oil beneath the Aegean and over several worthless rocky outcrops. Mr Rozakis had wanted at least to talk to the Turks. And he disliked a recent defence pact with the Greek part of Cyprus, whereby Greece-though until recently it had been prevaricating-is to send jet fighters and warships to give succour to the Greek Cypriots. 
Mr Rozakis's pacific bent displeased Greece's outspoken foreign minister, Theodoros Pangalos, who fears that Greece could end up yielding to Turkey in negotiation; besides, voters-he reckons, perhaps mistakenly-want more bellicosity. Two sour rivals of Mr Simitis, whom he beat for the party leadership last year, Akis Tsochatzopoulos, the defence minister, and Gerasimos Arsenis, the education minister who previously ran defence, are itching to pounce on him should he go ""soft on Turkey"". Hence the decision to back the Greek Cypriots' risky plan to put Russian-made air defences on their bit of the island (see next article), which may in turn prompt the Greeks to send in their air force to help their island cousins under the defence pact. 
Mr Simitis apparently thinks that raising the stakes in the Aegean, at least temporarily, may be a risk worth taking if it indirectly helps drag Greece towards that blessed group that will share Europe's single currency, if not in 1999 when monetary union is set to begin, then two years later when a second batch may join. To stand a chance of being admitted then, Greece must get a grip on its public finances. Hence Mr Simitis's readiness to face down the farmers who had been blockading Greece's main roads for three weeks in December, cutting industrial output by a full percentage point. 
That was a break with Pasok's populist tradition of pandering to interest groups. And Greek farmers are a powerful lobby. They make up a fifth of the country's workers. Many have relations on the state payroll. But Mr Simitis was daringly frank about why he was standing firm. Despite 16 years in the EU, he said, Greece is in worse shape than some ex-communist countries such as Hungary and the Czech Republic. 
Parliament listened. The budget it has approved should reduce the deficit from 7.6% of GDP in 1996 to 4.2% this year, which would put Greece in reach of hitting the Maastricht target of 3% by 1998. Mr Simitis has been less brave about shaving publicsector jobs, with unemployment at to.2% and rising. But he wants a freeze on new state jobs and a new pay scale for civil servants. Tax breaks for some zoo interest groups, from judges to seamen, will go. More strikes are expected-and Mr Simitis will have to show still more teeth.

What the Turks really dislike about the spree is that it is another signal of Greek keenness-both in Cyprus and on the mainland-to reduce Turkey's longstanding military superiority.

Delegates to a New Democracy party congress seemed to think so. Allowed to vote for their leader for the first time (previous ones having been chosen by a parliamentary caucus), the party's rank and file plumped overwhelmingly for the backbencher from Salonika. In the first-round ballot he knocked out the incumbent, Miltiades Evert, a right-winger. Then, in a run-off, he crushed Giorgios Souflias, a former economy minister and candidate for the liberal faction. 
Mr Karamanlis is the youngest man to have led a big Greek party. Before he was pushed into the leadership race by rightwingers fed up with Mr Evert, he was more often spotted at rowdy bouzouki clubs than at political gatherings. Unlike the unsophisticated Mr Evert, an Athens police chief's son, Mr Karamanlis hails from one of the tzakia, or so-called ""hearths"", meaning that he is the scion of a dynasty. 
Mr Karamanlis's (childless) uncle and namesake founded New Democracy. For many conservatives, Constantine Karamanlis (now 90 and ailing) is still a hero. He was prime minister for 13 years and president for ten more. Among other things, he brought back democracy after the right-wing colonels' dictatorship, abolished the monarchy and gave Greece an economic lifeline by persuading European leaders, against their better judgment, to let it join what was then the European Community, in 1981. 
Having a name that evokes New Democracy's glory days will not be enough, however. Never has the party been in such a mess. It has won outright only one of the last seven elections. During Mr Evert's three-and-a-half years in charge, it swung disastrously to the populist right-but not towards the free market. In the hope of wooing Socialist voters, Mr Evert opposed loosening the public sector's grip on the economy and made jingoistic noises about the Turks. But he put off a lot of businessmen, many of whom switched to Costas Simitis and the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) at the general election last September, because Mr Simitis genuinely seemed to have sloughed off the profligate economics and cheap populism of his late predecessor, Andreas Papandreou. 
Mr Karamanlis is a lawyer. But many of his friends are young bankers and fund managers who want sweeping privatisation. He himself eschews nationalistic sabre-rattling and looks to the party's liberal wing for fresh ideas. He may be canny enough to reunite a bickering party. 
That will take time. Greek conservatives are past masters at undermining each other. Some of Mr Karamanlis's contemporaries-for example, Dora Bakoyanni, a former culture minister and daughter of the last conservative prime minister, Costas Mitsotakis-are jealous of his easy win. Mr Evert's faction on the right and Mr Mitsotakis's more liberal group still run the party machine between them. The next election is more than three years off. Even if Mr Karamanlis rallies New Democracy's various battalions behind him, he has a long way to go before defeating Mr Simitis's steadily self-modernising Socialists.

Unlike the unsophisticated Mr Evert , an Athens police chief 's son , Mr Karamanlis hails from one of the tzakia , or so - called "" hearths "" , meaning that he is the scion of a dynasty . 
 Mr Karamanlis 's ( childless ) uncle and namesake founded New Democracy . For many conservatives , Constantine Karamanlis ( now 90 and ailing ) is still a hero . He was prime minister for 13 years and president for ten more . Among other things , he brought back democracy after the right - wing colonels ' dictatorship , abolished the monarchy and gave Greece an economic lifeline by persuading European leaders , against their better judgment , to let it join what was then the European Community , in 1981 . 
 Having a name that evokes New Democracy 's glory days will not be enough , however . Never has the party been in such a mess . It has won outright only one of the last seven elections . During Mr Evert 's three - and - a - half years in charge , it swung disastrously to the populist right - but not towards the free market . In the hope of wooing Socialist voters , Mr Evert opposed loosening the public sector 's grip on the economy and made jingoistic noises about the Turks . But he put off a lot of businessmen , many of whom switched to Costas Simitis and the Panhellenic Socialist Movement ( Pasok ) at the general election last September , because Costas Simitis genuinely seemed to have sloughed off the profligate economics and cheap populism of Costas Simitis's late predecessor , Andreas Papandreou . 
 Mr Karamanlis is a lawyer . But many of his friends are young bankers and fund managers who want sweeping privatisation . He himself eschews nationalistic sabre - rattling and looks to the party 's liberal wing for fresh ideas . He may be canny enough to reunite a bickering party . 
 That will take time . Greek conservatives are past masters at undermining each other . Some of Mr Karamanlis 's contemporaries - for example , Dora Bakoyanni , a former culture minister and daughter of the last conservative prime minister , Costas Mitsotakis - are jealous of his easy win . Mr Evert 's faction on the right and Mr Mitsotakis 's more liberal group still run the party machine between them . The next election is more than three years off . Even if Mr Karamanlis rallies New Democracy 's various battalions behind him , he has a long way to go before defeating Costas Simitis's steadily self - modernising Socialists .",350,Greece,A29-5314,IN TERM,True,Costas Simitis,4,True

They cannot all be right 
ON THE whole, the continent of Europe is still moving to the right, espousing the privatisation of state assets, reform of welfare and pensions, low taxes, fiscal rigour, freer markets. By and large, the mainstream parties of the left have realised that electability, along with their countries' prosperity, requires movement at least to the centre ground. Some, though, are getting there a lot more slowly than others. 
A number of centre-left parties-most strikingly those of France, Germany and Sweden, all of which stood well to the right of Britain's Labour Party a decade agoseem to be getting stuck. There is anguished talk among frustrated left-of-centre modernisers in those countries that the Labour Party has ""leap-frogged"" them. 
But elsewhere the left keeps on moving right. In most of Europe, the collapse of communism between 1989 and 1991 killed off any lingering faith in central planning and public ownership, even among people of leftish hue. In the past few years, fiscal disciplines imposed by the Maastricht treaty on the dozen or so countries striving to join a single currency have made centreleft governments as fiscally rigorous as right-wing ones in bringing down inflation and public deficits. The continent-wide alacrity with which even ex-communists, such as those in Poland, are heeding the free-market gospel, replete with privatisation and promises of lower taxes, does indeed mark a massive shift to the right. When Mr Blair swept to victory last week after yanking his Labour Party energetically to the right, a chorus of voices across Europe declared the real winner to be none other than Margaret Thatcher. 
But the momentum is uneven. Over the past decade it has been strongest in the south and east. In Central Europe, ex-communists running Poland and Hungary, as well as anti-communist Estonians, Czechs and others, have been boldly trying to reinvent their states on a basis of free markets and respect for private property. 
The shift of gravity within left-wing parties in the south has been no less striking. In Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece the left has moved sharply to the right and is still, probably, heading in that direction. 
After the extravagant populism of the late Andreas Papandreou, Greece's newlook Socialists, under Costas Simitis, have adopted increasingly sensible economicsactually putting them, in some respects, to the right of the official right (whose new leader may, however, soon start redressing this odd imbalance). Spain's Socialists under Felipe Gonzalez, in power from 1982 until last year, moved steadily rightwards in both style and content. More recently, Portugal's new leader, Antonio Guterres, another prototype of the modern-minded man of the centre-left moving sharply towards the free market in office, is proving keener to sell off state assets and reduce taxes than was his centre-right predecessor. 
Though somewhat sui generis, continuing changes on the left have transformed the Italian landscape, too. The collapse of the old Socialists and the break-up of the old Christian Democrats have turned the modern-minded wing of the ex-communists, now the key part of a centre-left government, into a torch-bearer of reformthough its success in putting proposals into law has so far been mixed. The fact that the ex-communists support more privatisation as well as severe fiscal rigour shows how far things have moved. Walter Veltroni, one of the ex-communists' stars, has long been an admirer of Mr Blair. 
The Benelux countries, with their old traditions of coalition and consensus, are a bit different. Successful coalitions of centreleft and centre-right have, broadly speaking, continued to nudge their policies gradually to the free-market right. In Belgium, Christian Democratic prime ministers have often led coalitions dominated by the centre-left. But, however fuzzy, the trend has been towards right-wing economics. 
Now it's the Dutch model 
The Dutch prime minister, Wim Kok, is another leading prototype of a one-time trade unionist and socialist who, in coalition with his country's main party on the freemarket right, has successfully imposed right-wing macroeconomics without ditching the tenets of ""social cohesion""-just the sort of combination of hard and soft that Mr Blair personifies. Just as people on the soft left invoked the Swedish model in the 196os and 197os, nowadays the Dutch left is often lauded for its combination of kindness and efficiency. 
When you look these days at the Nordics, the picture becomes fuzzier still. Denmark's centre-left coalition government comes closest to the model of left-labelled governments moving rightward in power. The Finnish government, left-led but with right-wing components, has also moved right on a range of issues. 
But the Norwegians, happy with fish, oil and self-exclusion from the Eu, are doing quite well under fairly old-fashioned socialists. The Swedes, on the other hand, are doing rather badly, with their ruling left-wingers refusing to move to the right. The once acclaimed Swedish model of welfare-cushioned capitalism now looks horribly sick-but the current government, actually being tugged further left by its reliance on a greenish party, is proving ill-equipped to cure it. ""Where is our Tony Blair?"", some Swedish left-wingers have been asking. No hopeful name is uttered-except, occasionally, that of Mona Sahlin, whose nomination as party leader a year ago was cancelled after she was found to have been negligent over personal expenses. 
The most notable exceptions on the list of centre-leftists moving right are, however, the two most important: France's Socialist Party and Germany's Social Democrats (whose difficulties we describe in the following articles). This is partly a matter of timing. The German left made its biggest lurch to the right four decades ago when the Social Democrats shed their residual Marxism. That done, such dynamic chancellors as Willy Brandt and Helmut Schmidt continued to forge a powerful consensus between business and labour that did Germany's economy proud. France's Socialists moved sharply rightwards under Francois Mitterrand in 1983. 
But in the past half-decade or so it has become apparent-as it did in Britainthat the parties of the French and German centre-left are loth to accept that their countries need further free-market radicalismincluding pension, labour and welfare reform-to survive in today's more competitive world. Germany's Social Democrats under Oskar Lafontaine have not yet risen to the challenge. Nor have France's Socialists. The global economy is moving on but the French and German centre-left, so far, is not. Mr Blair should be more of a warning to them than a comfort.

The current Greek and Turkish governments seem determined to get on better. On July 8th, at NATO'S Madrid summit-zealously egged on by Madeleine Albright, America's secretary of state-Costas Simitis, the Greek prime minister, and Suleyman Demirel, the Turkish president, publicly agreed to commit their countries not to use force or the threat of force over quarrels in the Aegean Sea. Will such promises seriously diminish the chance of arguments escalating into war, as nearly happened in 1987 over oil rights and in 1996 over an uninhabited rock? Not much, perhaps-but at least they suggest good intentions. 
Mr Simitis, a modernising socialist, has an extra reason for seeking more harmony with Turkey: to help promote Cyprus's bid for EU membership. And Mesut Yilmaz, the new Turkish prime minister, judges that befriending Greece will enhance Turkey's chances of getting closer to the EU, perhaps eventually joining it. 
The cautious Mr Simitis avoids calling the Madrid agreement a breakthrough. He will not, he says, remove Greece's veto over 375m ecus of long-promised Eu aid to Turkey unless it agrees at least to international arbitration over Imia/Kardak, that disputed Aegean rockery. Still, there is a chance of direct talks over disputed airspace, territorial waters and oil reserves. 
Mr Simitis's problem is that his party's nationalists oppose closer ties between Turkey and either Greece or the Eu. His defence minister, Akis Tsochatzopoulos, was annoyed not to be told of the Madrid agreement in advance. But such hardliners have less influence these days. Most Greeks want better relations and talks with the Turks. And now that Turkey has a customs union with the Eu, Greek businessmen are keen to boost trade with the old enemy. 
How about the Turks? In theory, they want a rapprochement too. But the real sticking-point, as ever, is Cyprus. Earlier this month there was some encouraging news. Meeting in rural up-state New York, Glafkos Clerides, the Greek Cypriot president, and Rauf Denktash, the Turkish Cypriot leader, discussed UN proposals for peace. Cyprus, under this far-from-new plan, would be a federal state with Greek and Turkish zones, neither of them linked to their respective mother-countries. The talks settled little but the mood was good. The pair agreed to let their governments discuss ""humanitarian concerns"" of common interest and said they would meet again, in Geneva, on August 11th. 
One of the thorniest questions, as ever, will be territory: the Turkish Cypriots, who were a fifth of the population before 1974, have 37% of the land. Demilitarisation is also awkward: Greek Cypriots do not like the presence of 30,000-35,000 Turkish troops in northern Cyprus. The UN hopes that, if both sides can agree on a settlement's outline before (Greek) Cyprus's presidential election in February, bargaining over details could start next spring. 
That is just when the European Commission is due to start talks with Cyprus over its joining the Union. The EU's official position is that, if Greeks and Turks cannot agree to share the island, the Greek part could join on its own. Not all EU members are happy with that, but Mr Simitis hints that, if Cyprus is not allowed in, Greece will block the entry of East European countries. 
On July 16th, the commission announced that Cyprus would be in the first wave of new entrants and Turkey would not. No surprise there. But many Turks were furious. Bulent Ecevit, their deputy prime minister (who had ordered Turkish troops to invade the island after a shortlived Greek coup there in 1974), said on a recent visit to the Turkish Cypriot statelet that ""partial integration"" with Turkey was now ""inevitable"". It will ""live for ever as an independent state, but foreign and defence policy will soon be handled by Turkey."" 
If such hawkish views prevail in Ankara, the prospects for a Cyprus settlement are bleak. Mr Clerides has already said that, if the Cyprus talks fizzle out, he will deploy Russian surface-to-air missiles next year. Turkey, in turn, has already threatened preemptively to hit such missiles. Within Turkey's government, however, Mr Ecevit is balanced by the more pacific Mr Yilmaz and Ismail Cem, the foreign minister. 
The Greeks, the EU, the UN and the Americans all hope that talks on Cyprus's future can run parallel to those on its entry to the EU. So long as Turkey's moderates prevail, that should be possible. European diplomats are doing their utmost to convince Turkey that it has not been snubbed: the commission has just published a paper on how to enhance the Eu-Turkish customs union, and says Turkey should be part of the new standing conference-linking current and future EU members-that will seek to promote co-operation in foreign and home affairs. America, too, will use all its clout to persuade Turkey to help strike a Cyprus deal. Just as well that Richard Holbrooke, its special envoy for Cyprusand the man who bludgeoned the various Bosnian parties to sign the Dayton accords-will soon become actively (and no doubt militantly) engaged.

Greek newspapers, which had scant space for the Serb slaughter of Muslims at Srebrenica during Bosnia's recent war, are now playing down atrocities in Kosovo. And when an outraged world puts sanctions on Serbia, Greek businessmen are the first to bust them. 
Dozens of glitzy new villas around Athens and Salonika testify to the success of sanctions-busters during the Bosnian war. The Greek government looked the other way as lorries, carrying petrol or other goods supposedly meant for Bulgaria or Albania, switched documents the minute they crossed the border and headed instead for Belgrade or Serb-controlled parts of Bosnia. 
The war is over but an ""outer wall"" of sanctions still stops Serbia borrowing from the IMF and the World Bank and, in effect, from most foreign commercial banks. For Greece, this is a business opportunity. The Greek government has provided a renewable loan to Serbia worth $100m to help pay for imports. Egged on by the politicians, Greece's state telecoms operator, OTE, paid DM675m ($368m) for 20% of Telekom Serbia. The deal has propped up the regime of Slobodan Milosevic, Yugoslavia's president (and still in effect Serbia's leader).

And when an outraged world puts sanctions on Serbia , Greek businessmen are the first to bust them . 
 Dozens of glitzy new villas around Athens and Salonika testify to the success of sanctions - busters during the Bosnian war . The Greek government looked the other way as lorries , carrying petrol or other goods supposedly meant for Bulgaria or Albania , switched documents the minute they crossed the border and headed instead for Belgrade or Serb - controlled parts of Bosnia . 
 The war is over but an "" outer wall "" of sanctions still stops Serbia borrowing from the IMF and the World Bank and , in effect , from most foreign commercial banks . For Greece , this is a business opportunity . The Greek government has provided a renewable loan to Serbia worth $ 100 m to help pay for imports . Egged on by the politicians , Greece 's state telecoms operator , OTE , paid DM675 m ( $ 368 m ) for 20 % of Telekom Serbia .

You might think that Turkey's prime minister, Mesut Yilmaz, would be the man to answer that. Yet he himself typifies the ambiguities and hesitations of modern Turkey. 
On the face of things, Mr Yilmaz, who became prime minister for the third time last June, is a prototype Euro-Turk. Born in Istanbul 50 years ago, he was the second man, after the visionary, modernising Turgut Ozal, to head the Motherland Party, which combines a desire for economic freemarketry in a secular society with a respect for old-fashioned (and Muslim) values. Although Mr Yilmaz lets people know he fasts at Ramadan, and goes to the mosque, he is far from an Islamist. To most Europeans he would seem little different from your average accountant: neat suit, lugubrious expression, cigaretteholder or tumbler of whisky in hand. 
He also seems particularly well placed to argue Turkey's case in Brussels. Thanks to his years at a German secondary school in Istanbul and then at university in Cologne, where he took a master's degree in economics, he speaks near-perfect German. He admires German efficiency. He has a German sisterin-law, and friends in German business and academia. 
Not long ago, his hopes of bringing Turkey closer to Europe had seemed high. He had impressed Europeans by sounding sincere about improving Turkey's black human-rights record. He had a good meeting with Greece's modernising prime minister, Costas Simitis (who is another German-speaker). Above all, he won a sort of blessing from Helmut Kohl, Germany's chancellor, who in September stated that Turkey could ""eventually""join the European Union. ""This"", Mr Yilmaz enthused, ""is a turningpoint in our relations with the EU."" 
Then things went wrong. The Germans, mindful that nearly 5m of their own people were out of work, did not like the thought that millions more Turks (on top of the 2.tm already in Germany) might be able to pour into Europe's labour market. Luxembourg's prime minister, Jean-Claude Juncker, chastised Turkey for ""routine torture"" in its jails. Several Christian Democrats, in Germany and elsewhere, said bluntly that Europe should remain a Christian club. And the European Union's leaders foolishly-given the tension of geopolitics in the Eastern Mediterranean-decided that the Turks should not be in the same basket as other Europeans seeking EU membership. 
Mr Yilmaz was outraged. Mr Kohl, he thought bitterly, had betrayed him: already head of a weak and clumsy coalition government, Mr Yilmaz had now been made even weaker. Turkey's Islamists, who had preceded him in power and had always been more sceptical about Europe's keenness to accept Turkey, smirked. Suggestions by Turks that Turkey should turn its back on the West, even block NATO'S expansion to the east, became louder. Hopes dimmed that Mr Yilmaz might (to improve his European credentials, among other things) try attending to the grievances of Turkey's Kurds. Turkey seemed more reluctant than ever to prod its Cypriot cousins into seeking a compromise with Greek Cypriots. The Turks went into bloody-minded mode. Hence the spurning of the London conference. 
Mr Yilmaz's reactions help to illustrate some deeper truths. Many of his countrymen have mixed feelings about Europe. Most middle-class Turks feel no gap between themselves and the western world. But the world view of others, not least the peasants of Anatolia, is shaped as much by Turkey's easterly roots. Most Turks want to be ""in Europe"" for practical economic reasons; but they do not like the high-minded, bossy-sounding declarations of the European Union. And Turkey's generals, who still, sotto voce, supervise politics, and cling to the 1930s-flavoured ideology of Kemal Ataturk, have-to say the least-a rough-andready attitude to democracy and civil liberties. 
When Europe to the west of the Bosporus insults Turkey, this ambivalence swells. Most Turks-count Mr Yilmaz among them-think the West is cold-shouldering them because they are Muslims. Many think that western pleas for a more relaxed policy towards the Kurds mask a desire to dismember Turkey, the rump successor to the Ottoman empire. And many, looking towards the Balkans, suspect that westerners, seemingly indifferent to the deaths of Kosovars and Bosnians, think Muslims expendable. 
Turks are particularly sensitive about Germany, which they suspect of condescension and racial arrogance. It is not odd that Mr Yilmaz, a beneficiary of German scholarship, could yet accuse Germany of lingering imperial pretensions. Hence his recent outburst, enraging Mr Kohl, that Germany still sought Lebensraum-room to expand, Hitler-style-in the world to its east. 
In other words, the Eu has sharpened a Turkish inferiority complex. Yes, think Turks, Turkey should be part of Europe, if that is the path to wealth and security, and if the Turks' embrace of Europe is matched by Europe's embrace of them.

So far, however, he is proving a shrewd and persevering operator who seems to have a better chance than anyone else in Greek politics of yanking his country out of Balkan backwardness. Part of his plan for that is to drag Greece into the inner club of Europeans whose currency will be the euro. On March 14th, he boldly agreed with the Eu's monetary committee that the drachma should be devalued, by 12.1%, as the price for being let into the exchange-rate mechanism, the waiting-room for currencies intending to join the euro. 
Once in the ERM, the drachma shouldfor a while, at any rate-be safe from the marauding currency sharks that have attacked it on and off since financial turmoil began to sweep Asia last year. Greece now has a fair chance of closing the gap between itself and the other southern countries within the European club. It will have to wait a bit longer than Spain, Portugal and Ireland to join the euro, but it aims to be a member of the club by January ist 2001. 
Less than a year ago, such an idea would have been laughable. Greece's inflation rate was too high, its deficits too gaping, its commitment to shrinking its public sector unconvincing. Greece's place as the Union's economic and political laggard seemed assured. How did the unassuming Mr Simitis manage to turn things round? 
First, he and a few pro-European colleagues have been quietly but assiduously cultivating German politicians and bankers. Getting Hans Tietmeyer, head of Germany's central bank, and Theo Waigel, the finance minister, to support the drachma's entry into the ERM took weeks of persuasion. It may have helped that Mr Simitis was teaching at a German university in the 1970s, when Greece was run by colonels. 
Second, Mr Simitis preempted objections from the ideological old guard within his ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement by keeping on Akis Tsochatzopoulos, his chief rival on the populist left, as defence minister. Whereas the Socialists' long-serving leader, the late Andreas Papandreou, expelled anyone who spoke up against him, Mr Simitis allows a measure of dissent within the party. This seems to have taken the steam out of Mr Tsochatzopoulos and his friends. 
Third, Mr Simitis is helped by the disarray in Greece's opposition. Costas Karamanlis, the untested young leader of New Democracy, the main conservative party, has dumped old professionals such as Stefanos Manos for backing the Socialists' efforts to curb Greece's public-sector trade unions. Mr Manos's bid to privatise state assets in the early 199os was thwarted by hostility from the right as well as the left. 
However canny Mr Simitis has proved as a politician, though, Greece's march to EMU is bound to put the economy through the wringer. Yannos Papantoniou, the suave economy minister, will have to fulfil promises made to the Germans and to the EU's monetary committee. Squeezing the budget deficit and keeping it slim means speeding up reform. Battles against trade unions in crumbling state companies will get fiercer. Workers at Olympic Airways, for instance, will have to forgo days off on their birthdays and free flights for members of their extended families. Still, most Greeks seem to be moving in favour of privatisation. Some 60% apparently want to sell off Greece's lumbering utilities and transport firms. Workers at a group of the state's few profitable companies poised for flotation on the Athens stock exchange are looking forward to free shares and dividends. 
All the same, thousands of public-sector workers will have to accept either switching to other jobs or early retirement Inflation will jump, for a time, thanks to the drachma's fall. Wages this year and next will barely go up, says the government. The cheaper drachma should lure more tourists and encourage Greek firms to sell more olive oil and oranges within the EU.

REFORMING Greece's crumbling state enterprises will be a challenge, judging by the goings-on at Olympic Airways, the country's standard-bearer in the skies. Nicknamed ""Olympic Misery"" by long-suffering travellers, the airline is hovering close to bankruptcy. Far from helping Olympic to take off, its angry pilots are helping to steer it into the ground by defying the Socialist government's latest costcutting plan to hold down wages for three years and to make air crews work longer hours. On May 4th Olympic's future looked even bleaker when limp-wristed managers caved in to the pilots. If the airline does finally crash, it will be a big blow to Greece's reforming prime minister, Costas Simitis: it has become a test-case in his campaign to reform his country's slovenly public sector. 
Mr Simitis's highest hope, over the next three years or so, is to enable Greece to qualify for Europe's single currency. It will not happen if aggressive trade unions and hugely indebted state enterprises have their way. With their old ties to the ruling Socialists, the unions have been able to bully govemment-appointed managers into handing out bogus jobs and inflationary pay rises. Yet if he lets the old guard at Olympic beat him, Mr Simitis's chances of hauling Greece into the euro will dive. As it is, Greece is invariably humiliated at summit meetings. Last weekend in Brussels, for instance, other EU members made polite noises about Greece's progress in squeezing inflation and cutting its budget deficit. But they also made clear that, unless Greece slashed the state's role in the economy, it would not be taken seriously as a candidate for monetary union. 
So Mr Simitis needs to make a wrenching break with the past over Olympic. Founded by Aristotle Onassis, the shipping tycoon who sold it to the state in 1975 after it started to lose money, the airline has since been cosy with the Socialists. Indeed, Andreas Papandreou, the populist who led Greece-and the Socialists-for many years until his death in 1996, married an Olympic stewardess. It was partly thanks to votes from the airline's trade unions that Mr Simitis then took over the Socialists. 
Almost four years ago-while Mr Papandreou was still in charge-the party agreed on a rescue plan for Olympic with the European Commission. In return for being allowed to write off more than $2 billion in debt and to hand over a chunk of fresh capital, the government agreed to stop subsidising the airline. A proper business plan was to have been launched. Political interference in day-to-day management was to stop. But such good things never happened. Even under Mr Simitis, chief executives bent on reform were hired and then fired at six-monthly intervals. Last year the pilots won pay increases of 80%. Loans from state banks are all that stave off bankruptcy. 
Mr Simitis says that he will shut down Olympic for good if the cost-cutting measures approved by parliament last month are not enforced. Private Greek and foreign airlines would take over Olympic's routes. Slots at foreign airports would be sold off, along with Olympic's fleet of elderly planes. More than 6,000 workers would lose their jobs. So far the mild-mannered Mr Simitis has been reluctant to slash jobs, even in the hugely overstaffed civil service. Does he have the guts to wield the hatchet at Olympic? ","ATHENS

It is still around. The latest victim may be Yannos Papantoniou, the bouncy Socialist finance minister trying to drag Greece into Europe's single currency by 2000. Despite denials on high, the capital has been buzzing with reports that he may be dumped. 
Mr Papantoniou still sees eye to eye on economics with Costas Simitis, the reformminded prime minister, and is backed by the modernising faction in the ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok). But his success in making Greece a serious candidate to join the euro has annoyed Pasok's barons. If Greece were to succeed in that aim, Mr Papantoniou would become the front-runner to succeed Mr Simitis. 
Akis Tsochatzopoulos, the defence minister, who lost a long battle with Mr Simitis for Pasok's leadership, would still like to step into his shoes. Another contender is Vasso Papandreou, the development minister and former Eu social-affairs commissioner (and no relation of Pasok's late, longserving populist prime minister, Andreas Papandreou), who hopes to be Greece's first woman prime minister. But the toughest challenger may be Alexander Papadopoulos, the quiet interior minister who launched the tax reforms a few years ago that gave such a boost to revenues. He would like to grab Mr Papantoniou's job before the deal on Greece's entry to the euro is wrapped up-next summer at the earliest-and then take the credit. 
Greece now seems to have at least a fair chance of meeting its self-prescribed deadline for reaching eurodom. By December it should meet three of the four criteria laid out in the Maastricht treaty. Under Mr Papantoniou the budget deficit, long-term interest rates and the public debt have gradually been shrinking to acceptable levels. The drachma has made a strong recovery after a 12.1% devaluation against the ecu in March, which accompanied its entry into Europe's exchange-rate mechanism-the waiting-room for the euro club. 
Hitting the fourth target, inflation, is proving trickier. In August the annual rate was 5%, still well above the EU's average. But Mr Papantoniou is to try some new ways of squeezing it below 2.4% next year. He plans to freeze prices for electricity, telephone calls and public transport. Special taxes on new cars, whisky and other luxuries will come down. Mr Papantoniou is preparing to punish wholesalers who put big markups on television sets and washing machines after the drachma's devaluation. 
Mr Papadopoulos and the other Pasok barons are eagerly waiting for Mr Papantoniou to trip up. So far he has managed to keep squeezing inflation without freezing wages. But the public-sector unions, which are mostly Pasok-controlled, are gunning for him because they dislike his plan for a speedy sale of banks and utilities. A sixweek strike at Ionian Bank, the biggest one on the list, wrung concessions out of Mr Papantoniou: he agreed that the buyer would have to keep on all 3,500 people who worked there for at least three years. And the first attempt to sell Ionian Bank failed in August. 
Could Greece get into the single currency by 2001 without Mr Papantoniou? Perhaps. But it would probably be hard: finance ministers of the 1 countries due to merge their currencies in the new year have been impressed by Mr Papantoniou during his four years as Mr Drachma-and may be lenient if Greece is on the border-line to meet the criteria. The same might not go for Mr Papadopoulos. ","THE ancient Greeks called it fthonos , a sort of jealousy that makes people try to unseat their more successful rivals . It is still around . The latest victim may be Yannos Papantoniou , the bouncy Socialist finance minister trying to drag Greece into Europe 's single currency by 2000 . Despite denials on high , the capital has been buzzing with reports that he may be dumped . 
 Mr Papantoniou still sees eye to eye on economics with Costas Simitis , and is backed by the modernising faction in the ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement ( Pasok ) . But his success in making Greece a serious candidate to join the euro has annoyed Pasok 's barons . If Greece were to succeed in that aim , Mr Papantoniou would become the front - runner to succeed Costas Simitis . 
 Akis Tsochatzopoulos , the defence minister , who lost a long battle with Costas Simitis for Pasok 's leadership , would still like to step into his shoes . Another contender is Vasso Papandreou , the development minister and former Eu social - affairs commissioner ( and no relation of Pasok 's late , longserving populist prime minister , Andreas Papandreou ) , who hopes to be Greece 's first woman prime minister . But the toughest challenger may be Alexander Papadopoulos , the quiet interior minister who launched the tax reforms a few years ago that gave such a boost to revenues . He would like to grab Mr Papantoniou 's job before the deal on Greece 's entry to the euro is wrapped up - next summer at the earliest - and then take the credit . 
 Greece now seems to have at least a fair chance of meeting its self - prescribed deadline for reaching eurodom . By December it should meet three of the four criteria laid out in the Maastricht treaty . Under Mr Papantoniou the budget deficit , long - term interest rates and the public debt have gradually been shrinking to acceptable levels . The drachma has made a strong recovery after a 12.1 % devaluation against the ecu in March , which accompanied its entry into Europe 's exchange - rate mechanism - the waiting - room for the euro club .

Under his reign, political intrigue and financial wheelin-and-dealing seemed to take up more church energy than caring for Greek souls. 
The archbishop is no slouch. A law student before taking up theology, he has a smarter gift of the gab than any Greek politician.

He may well be the most popular figure in the land. 
But he is not to the taste of Costas Simitis, Greece's reformminded centre-left prime minister. Far from being modern or tolerant, the archiepiscopal message resounds with die-hard nationalism. The European Union, he says, is no panacea for Greeks-thus contradicting Mr Simitis's belief that only by getting closer to Brussels and joining euroland as soon as possible will Greece become prosperous and modern. Christodoulos also likes to expound the old conspiracy theory that the ""world's big powers are working against the interests of Hellenism"". Mr Simitis recalls that it was nationalist posturing that so irritated Greece's EU partners in the early 199os.

On a visit to Thrace, Greece's easternmost province that abuts Turkey and has a large Muslim minority that includes ethnic Turks, the archbishop urged Greeks to ""defend Orthodoxy""with weapons if need be. It was only after a sharp word from Athens that he changed his tone and paid respects to the local Muslim clergy. 
Such populism would matter less if Orthodoxy were not Greece's established religion. Mr Simitis briefly pondered the notion of amending the constitution to separate church and state.

Nor is there yet any sign that his gesture will lead Turkey, which had threatened to destroy the missiles if they were deployed, to make the counter-concession that might open the way to a peaceful settlement of the quarrel between Greek- and Turkish-Cypriots. 
A snap opinion poll suggests that 71% of Greek-Cypriots want the missiles to be in Cyprus rather than Crete, the Greek island where Greece's government has persuaded Mr Clerides to let them be tucked safely away. The leader of one part of the coalition government over which Mr Clerides presides, the socialist Edek party, called the decision ""a defeat without a fight"", even though the Greek prime minister who helped to persuade Mr Clerides to back down is also a socialist. Greek Cyprus's defence minister, Yiannakis Omirou, was one of the two Edek ministers who resigned in protest. An ex-president, Spyros Kyprianou, said that his party would now vote against any defence budget brought before parliament. Many Greek-Cypriots telephoned local radio stations to say they would refuse either to do their military service or to pay the 4% defence levy. 
When Mr Clerides signed a $45om contract with Russia for the missiles two years ago, he seemed to think that this would put new pressure on America and the EU to find a way of ending the quarter-centuryold division of Cyprus. It did not work. 
Throughout 1998, Richard Holbrooke, President Bill Clinton's emissary, tried and failed to revive talks between the two parts of the fractured island. The Turkish-Cypriot leader, Rauf Denktash, dug in his heels, demanding international recognition of his breakaway state before talks could begin. Turkey itself, angered by the Eu'S snubbing of its application for membership, refused to help. So delivery of the missiles, originally set for last summer, was put off first until the autumn and then until the end of 1998. Just before Christmas, Mr Clerides at last gave way to the chorus of appeals from the West, including those of Costas Simitis, Greece's prime minister. Greece wants the Greek part of Cyprus to be accepted as a member of the EU even if the Turkishspeaking part is left outside. A war between Turkey and the Greek Cypriots would give that hope a black eye. 
The risk of a war has now faded. But the chances of resuming negotiations over the future of Cyprus-and, if the negotiations succeed, of bringing the whole island into the Eu-remain shrouded in mist. In principle, both sides have seemed to agree that Cyprus could be a loose federation consisting of two semi-autonomous communities living under a modest central government. But there is still room for explosive dispute over the allocation of powers between the central government and the two component communities. Matters are not made any easier by Mr Denktash's demand that his regime should be internationally recognised as a sovereign state before negotiations begin. 
This part of the problem might be removed if Turkey, grateful for the GreekCypriots' climbdown over the missiles, would now persuade Mr Denktash to drop his demand for sovereign recognition and accept instead a general commitment (including by the Greek-Cypriots) that the Turkish part of the island would be treated as an ""equal partner"", or some such phrase, in the negotiations. If the talks began on that basis, it is conceivable that a compromise could be hammered out on the shape of a loose confederation of the whole island. This new Cyprus, Turkish-Cypriots and all, might then join the Eu. Who knows, the experience of having these Turks inside the EU might persuade reluctant Germans and others that Turkey itself should be allowed tojoin too. 
The trouble is that Turkey is in no position at the moment to produce any sort of clear-cut initiative. Its previous government having collapsed under a cloud of scandal, it is still unsuccessfully trying to put together a new coalition to run the country.

It is, says Mr Simitis, a ""certainty"" that Greece will join the euro. Protected from currency upheavals by monetary union, and still eligible for handouts from Brussels, Greece, its leader hopes, could become a rich outpost of civilisation in the Balkans-or, rather, south-eastern Europe, as inhabitants of more peaceful countries in the area prefer to call it. 
The figures look good, even though it is clear that Greek statisticians have learned from their Spanish and Italian colleagues how to fudge accounts to the satisfaction of people in Brussels. The budget deficit is already down to 2.2% of GDP (it would be bigger but for a loophole that lets subsidies be counted as capital injections). The publicsector debt, at 1O4% of GDP, is still much too high-but lower than in Italy and Belgium, those upstanding euro-members-and is shrinking in line with the Maastricht conditions for euro-entry. Year-onyear inflation fell to 3.9% in December, the lowest figure in more than 30 years. The cautious central bank says it will fall to 2% next year, which would meet another Maastricht criterion. 
So Mr Simitis hopes Greece will be formally accepted into the currency club by spring next year, with the drachma giving way to the euro at the start of 2001. Opinion polls suggest that 9o% of Greeks favour the idea. Bar a global recession or a crisis with Turkey, the timetable looks feasible. 
But, strangely, fewer Greeks seem disposed to thank Mr Simitis's government for its efforts. His Socialists' approval rating has plunged even among staunch left-ofcentre supporters. New Democracy, a rightof-centre party led by Constantine Karamanlis, an untested young leader (and nephew of the late president of the same name), is still struggling to get his party under control. But it is gaining ground with disgruntled Greeks. One recent opinion poll put it seven percentage points ahead of Mr Simitis's lot. 
Why is the prime minister struggling? For one thing, the fruits of modernisation take a long time to grow. The urge to boost revenues and squeeze the budget deficit has made Greece's taxmen-and the special tax-police-much more aggressive. Popular night-club singers and fashionable doctors who avoid paying taxes have been named and shamed. In 1997, the tax take may have jumped by as much as 15%, a record. 
But taxpayers say this has made things no better. The civil service is as inefficiently corrupt as ever. State hospitals offer pretty primitive care, though Greece has more doctors per head of population than any other EU country. Educational standards are slipping, but efforts to raise them have set off a wave of noisy protests by students. 
Part of the pain stems from Mr Simitis's determination to keep the promise he made, when he took office two years ago, to shake up Greece's administration. Some cabinet ministers are doing their best. The civil service, local government and the police are all being revamped. To the squawks of teachers, teaching qualifications are due to be hardened. 
Mr Simitis is not always tough, though. He caved in to the trade unions when they jibbed at his plans to reform pensions and overhaul utilities. And he still lets Socialist politicians interfere in running state companies. The Greek economy still sorely needs restructuring. Meeting the Maastricht criteria would be an impressive feat.

On February 18th, Greece's foreign minister, Theodoros Pangalos, resigned amid accusations that he had colluded in the rebel Kurd's capture. The interior minister and the public-order minister, both of whom oversee Greece's intelligence and security services, bowed out too. The prime minister, Costas Simitis, is facing a barrage of awkward questions from left and right. 
Why the furore? First, it seems that Mr Pangalos had been a lot less than frank about his part in Mr Ocalan's capture. Second, the old-guard, left-wing nationalists in Mr Simitis's ruling Socialist party are appalled that a Greek government should do anything to help Turkey. Mr Simitis has tried hard to get along better with the Turks. But, for many Greeks, the idea of helping them to catch the Turks' most reviled enemy-Mr Ocalan-was going just too far. 
Mr Simitis may hope that, by sacrificing Mr Pangalos and his fellow disgraced colleagues, the heat maycome off the rest of his government. But the uproar may not subside quickly. Leading lights on the left have accused Mr Simitis's government of ""betraying"" Mr Ocalan. A prominent newspaper editorhas declared on television he was ""ashamed to be Greek"". Public opinion is not on Mr Simitis's side. 
The prime minister's problem has its roots in the history of Greece's antagonistic relations with Turkey-and with the Kurds. Several leading Greek Socialists have long been chummywith Mr Ocalan, on the principle that your enemy's enemy is your friend. After Mr Ocalan went on the run earlier this year, they sought to have him given asylum in Greece. They also helped him on his odyssey around Europe, furnishing him with, among other things, a private plane. 
When he turned up in Athens on January 29th, he apparently stayed for the weekend in a ""safe house"" provided by Greeks who campaign for Kurds. Thereafter he is said to have flown to Minsk, in Belarus, to seek a new haven. When he came back, once again to Greece, on February 2nd, the government decided it had had enough. Out Mr Ocalan flew to the residence of the Greek ambassador in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, on the understanding that Greece would try to persuade an African countryperhaps South Africa-to take him in. 
The row in Athens grew as Mr Ocalan's lawyers and disaffected Greek intelligence officers started blabbing about Greece's part in the snatch. Mr Pangalos, they said, had telephoned the Kurdish leader when he was in Kenya to offer him a choice. Either he could hop on an aircraft and leave Kenya forthwith, perhaps for the Netherlands; or he could expect to be picked up by Kenyan commandos. The implication was that Mr Pangalos knew that various hostile security services were on to Mr Ocalan, yet he did little-to put it mildly-to help him. 
Mr Simitis no doubt hopes to fend off the fury of his party's passionately antiTurkish old guard. Such people, old disciples of the late Andreas Papandreou, Greece's long-serving populist leader, have portrayed Mr Ocalan and the rebel Kurds as noble guerrillas fighting for independence from Turkey,just as Greeks did in the last century. 
On paper, official Greek policy is still to support the Kurds' independence struggle but to condemn terrorism. Mr Simitis wants to keep the Kurdish question separate from Greece's own disputes with Turkey over the Aegean Sea and Cyprus. More than previous Greek leaders, he has been keen to get on better with Turkey.

 On paper , official Greek policy is still to support the Kurds ' independence struggle but to condemn terrorism .

His message, though low-key, was clear. The Greek government backs NATO'S war. 
While most Socialists nonetheless feel edgy about bombing Yugoslavia and talk anxiously about finding a political solution in Kosovo, they have condemned Serbia's ethnic cleansing of the Albanians there. Slobodan Milosevic, a friend of previous Greek prime ministers, can no longer count on a sympathetic hearing in Athens. 
Mr Simitis has performed a virtuoso balancing act to keep his party's nationalists, who are strongly pro-Serbian, at bay. As NATO'S sole Balkan country, Greece said it could not join in an attack against a neighbour. But Greek air-bases are providing logistical help for NATO surveillance flights over Yugoslavia. Supplies for the 12,000 NATO troops in Macedonia, originally meant to spearhead a peacekeeping force once a deal had been signed, come through Salonica, Greece's north-eastern port. 
Mr Simitis says Greece will take in 5,000 Kosovo Albanian refugees but will concentrate on helping refugees in Macedonia and Albania itself The Greek army is building a camp for 2,000 of them near Korce, in southern Albania. Its air force has been flying food, blankets and medical supplies to Skopje, the Macedonian capital. George Papandreou, the new foreign minister, helped smooth over an awkward row between the Albanian and Macedonian prime ministers when the Macedonians at first tried to keep out thousands of the refugees. 
But popular opinion in Greece is quite another matter. Most Greeks are fiercely pro-Serb. Until NATO started bombing military targets in Yugoslavia, Greeks assumed that in a regional flare-up they would be with the Serbs. Across a range of prickly issues, from relations with Turkey and Bulgaria to sanctions-busting in the early 1990s during the Bosnian war (when fuel and spares were shipped illegally from Greece to Serbia), political leaders in Athens and Belgrade have stuck together in times of crisis. So people are shaken by the change. 
One tie that has been particularly strong is religion. Greeks and Serbs are both Orthodox. Greek churchmen have few scruples about stirring up feeling against Muslims, whether they be Bosnians or Kosovars. Backing up such feelings, in a more secular mode, is Greece's still vigorous little Communist Party, which remains passionately anti-American and anti-British, helping to stage violent protests outside western embassies in Athens. Graffiti declaring ""Americans-Murderers"" and denouncing NATO have appeared on walls around the city. 
Greek newspapers and television stations are unabashedly pro-Serb. Several journalists who saw Serb atrocities in Kosovo say that editors in Athens changed or suppressed their reports. Serbian state television makes much of NATO bomb damage and defiant demonstrators in Belgrade. Lorries full of medicine, collected by the church and the Communists, have gone to Serbia alone. 
The 400,000 Albanian immigrants in Greece are nervous. Some say that young Greek nationalists have begun to harrass them. They are already widely blamed for Greece's rising crime rate. Greeks are particularly worried that, if NATO were to send ground troops into Kosovo or if Serbia attacked Albania proper, a huge wave of refugees from Macedonia and Albania would then pour into Greece. 
So far Mr Simitis and his government have managed to fend off the nationalists by stressing that Greece's wider interestsgetting closer to Western Europe, joining the euro and staying out of Balkan warsmean that Greece should co-operate, at least for the moment, with NATO.

Such were the labels that diplomats in Athens were putting on George Papandreou before he became Greece's foreign minister two months ago. Members ofthe ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement, better known as Pasok, often call him ""Georgaki"", a rather patronising diminutive. The eldest son of the late Andreas Papandreou, the populist firebrand who was prime minister of Greece for most of the period between 1981 and 1996, he has long had trouble persuading people to take him seriously. 
Until now, that is. With NATO's Balkan war in full swing, Mr Papandreou is shouldering real responsibility for the first time. Costas Simitis, the modernising prime minister battling to keep Greece firmly in the NATO camp over Kosovo, did not hesitate to promote Mr Papandreou after sacking Theodoros Pangalos. 
Mr Pangalos was forced out amid ructions over Greece's support for Kurdish rebels and his bungled attempt to protect Abdullah Ocalan, the rebels' leader, who was nabbed by Turkish agents in Kenya after hiding for nearly two weeks in the Greek ambassador's residence there. For a couple of days it even looked as if the Greek government might fall. 
Hitherto, Mr Pangalos had been seen as a shrewd politician who could both stand up to Turkey and work the system in Brussels to get cash and concessions for Greece. But he was high-handed with Greek colleagues and prone to undiplomatic outbursts-most notoriously for a jibe about Germany having ""a child's brain inside a giant's body"". Few of the EU'S foreign ministers were sorry to see him go. 
Can Mr Papandreou do better? At first he looked a bit dazed before the television cameras. Being the Greek foreign minister is always tricky. Disputes fester with the Turks over the Aegean and Cyprus. Relations with the EU, though warmer under Mr Simitis, are still awkward. The government has not tried to exploit Greek nationalism, but anything that involves Balkan neighbours tends to stir atavistic emotions. Kosovo is political dynamite. 
Mr Papandreou is less sharp and punchy than Mr Pangalos. He is also more modest and likeable. A team player who stays pretty cool under pressure, he has been familiar-as Mr Pangalos's stand-in since 1996-with most foreign issues. More important, and unlike Mr Pangalos, he gets on well with Madeleine AIbright, the American secretary of state. 
A big bonus for him is his international upbringing. He is less prickly with foreigners than are most Greek Socialists. He was born in America, where his father taught economics at Berkeley while his mother cultivated ties with Democrats. After the Papandreous were kicked out of Greece by the colonels in the 196os, he spent his teens in Canada and Sweden, where he nearly became an academic after taking degrees at Amherst, Harvard and the London School of Economics. He still reads sociological journals-and, incidentally, sticks to his belief that marijuana should be legal. It was his family, rather than burning ambition, that drove him into politics. After all, his grandfather, also George, had been prime minister, too. 
George Junior started slowly. Elected to parliament in 1981 to a safe seat in the north-west Peloponnese, grandpa's birthplace, he spent several years twiddling his thumbs before his father gave him a junior ministerial post, as official link with Greece's large, mostly American and Australian, diaspora. Later, as education minister, he faced down striking teachers but failed either to bring in much-needed reforms or prod his ministry into making efficient use of EU money. Today, with more and more bright students going abroad to university, many Greek parents reckon that the country's state education is worse than ever before. 
Among his colleagues, however, Mr Papandreou is a good consensusbuilder. This was evident after his father died in 1996, when he may have clinched the leadership for Mr Simitis and his eksnchronistes (modernisers). The younger Papandreou backed the new men against the populist old guard around his father, to whom he was never close. 
Might he one day become the third Papandreou to become prime minister of Greece? It is unlikely, for he lacks the rhetorical flair and the zest for intrigue of his father and grandfather. He is rarely mentioned as a possible successor to Mr Simitis. Nor, though he scores well in party elections, has he bothered to build a base of his own within Pasok. 
The fervent anti-westernism of Mr Papandreou's father made Greece thoroughly unpopular with NATO and the EU. During the Bosnian war, Greece stayed cosy with Serbia and bullied Albania and Macedonia. Yet, in his previous post, Mr Papandreou sought better Greek ties with both countries. More recently, on a tour of refugee camps in Macedonia, he won hearts with the way he picked up and hugged grimy Albanian children. 
Even so, with the best will in the Balkan world, Mr Papandreou will find Kosovo hard to handle. He is trying, with Eu help, to put together a package of aid to dissuade refugees from flooding into Greece. He has to contend with the strong if woolly proSerb feelings of most Greeks. This week he was in Moscow, trying to help build bridges between Russia, America and the UN. 
Fence-sitting will prove as hard as bridge-building. Indeed it will get harder. Greece condemns the Serbs' ethnic cleansing and lets AwAcs aircraft based in Greece watch over Serbia; but it wants NATO to stop the air strikes. Yet, as the NATO country closest to Kosovo, Greece may soon be asked to let at least one air base be used for bigger NATO attacks and, perhaps, to let NATO ground troops use Salonika, Greece's northern port, as a route to Kosovo. With elections to the European Parliament due in June, Mr Papandreou is likely to become a target for anti-western feeling. Grouchy Socialists already sneer at him for being ""America's yes-man"". For its part, NATO hopes he has more backbone than advertised-and will go on coolly flouting the family tradition. ","NICE guy . A bit ineffectual . Soft - edged .

ONLY eight months denouncing Greece to the world ago, when Turkey a sponsor was denouncing Greece terrorism, nobody but the world as a sponsor of terrorism, nobody but the imaginedhands of friendship being st of optimists could have imagined the Aegean Sea. But a huge chands of friendship being stretched in public the Aegean Sea. But after deadly earthquake change in public sentiment, after deadly earthquakes in both countries, has, at the very least, provided an undreamt-of opportunity for people who sincerely want rapprochement. Foremost among them is George Papandreou,Greece's foreign minister, who has probably taken the biggest risk of his political career by pioneering a drive for better ties with Turkey. 
In a sharp change of Greek rhetoric, Mr Papandreou has suggested that his country could ""pull the cart"" carrying Turkey towards membership of the European Union. In the aftermath of last month's earthquake, Greece has partially lifted its veto on Eu aid to Turkey. 
This does not, of course, mean that the path towards Turkish membership of the Union is now entirely obstacle-free. Mr Papandreou, and his supportive prime minister, Costas Simitis, still want the Turks to state more clearly that they do not covet any Greek islands, and to drop their objections to Cyprus joining the Union. But in contrast with years past, they are treading gently. 
Perhaps the terrifying power of natureand dark wamings from experts of further quakes in the region-have brought home to Greeks and Turks the complex ways in which their fate, as well as their history, is intertwined. Certainly, some deep emotions were stirred by the sight of rescue workers from both countries working together in the rubble left by two disasters: the monstrous quake on August 17th which claimed at least 14,000 Turkish lives, and the lesser, but still frightening, tremor that struck north of Athens on September 7th, flattening factories and killing over 120 people. 
Instead of trading insults, the popular press in Greece and Turkey is generally lauding the new spirit of co-operation. In the eastem Aegean islands, where Greek garrisons stand guard against a perceived Turkish threat, local mayors have been collecting medicine and blankets for homeless Turks. 
At a higher political level, the need to coordinate earthquake relief has added impetus to the burgeoning friendship between Mr Papandreou and Ismail Cem, the Turkish foreign minister, who is also a moderate. Even before the disasters, the two politicians got along well, partly thanks to Mr Papandreou's discreet watering-down of Greece's reluctance to parley directly with Turkey (as opposed to seeking arbitration in larger forums) about controversial matters. 
While continuing to skirt round the thorniest questions-like territorial rows in the Aegean, which nearly sparked a war in 1996, and Cyprus-the two sides have started discussions about ""soft issues"", as Mr Papandreou calls them. These include tourism, trade, immigration and (more controversially) terrorism. Foreign-ministry officials wrapped up a second round of technocratic talks last week. A group of businessmen from both countries are to resume a dialogue they broke off last February. 
With the Balkans still in disarray, reducing Greek-Turkish tensions in the Aegean would help make south eastern Europe safer and more prosperous. Mr Papandreou's reward, in due course, could be to succeed Mr Simitis as leader of the Socialist party founded by his tub-thumping father, Andreas Papandreou. 
But strange and sad twists of fate continue to affect Greek-Turkish relations in unpredictable ways. On September 14th, Mr Papandreou lost his deputy, Yannos Kranidiotis, in an air accident. Keeping up the pace of rapprochement will be that much harder after the death of this able diplomat-who might have helped untie the knots between the European Union, Greece, Turkey and his native Cyprus.

BRUSSELS 
IN BRITAIN, the question of whether or not to join Europe's monetary union promises a long struggle leading to a fiercely fought referendum (see page 57). The Labour government is for joining, provided that the economic conditions are favourable. Though the prime minister, Tony Blair, is keen to go in for political reasons, the economics of the issue is still being fiercely contested. Across the rest of Europe, by contrast, arguments about the euro have largely subsided, at least for the time being. 
It is there and it works-so far, at any rate. The single monetary policy now in force across 11 countries has stoked up booms in Ireland, Spain and Portugal, but cannot be blamed for sluggishness in the bigger countries, nor their stubbornly high unemployment. A long early slide in the new currency's exchange rate against the dollar did prove something of a political worry. But since August the euro has steadied against the dollar at what most countries seem to consider roughly the right level in economic terms. On October 12th, it bought $1.075, well down from $1.18 in January but well up from near-- parity with the dollar in June. 
Economic recovery is rolling reassuringly through France and-more tentatively-- Germany and Italy. In all three countries, exporters have profited from the currency's weakness. Official statistics show inflation well under control, with producer prices across the monetary union rising at an annual rate of 0.5% in August. And European capital markets have been booming, spurred on by low interest rates and by the elimination of exchange-rate risk within the monetary union: EU firms have been issuing debt this year at three times last year's rate. The European Central Bank still fumbles a bit in public, but by and large it has been doing a good job in difficult circumstances. 
If anything, the 11 governments already inside the monetary union wish they had pushed the whole thing through even more quickly than they did. The euro was introduced at the start of this year for, non-cash transactions only (such as electronic-funds transfers, and payments by cheque or credit card). Euro notes and coins are due to be issued in place of national notes and coins from the start of 2002. 
The European Commission, the EU'S executive body, reports a growing consensus among governments that this last phase (known in EMU jargon as the ""double circulation period"") should be cut from a planned six months to a mere six or eight weeks. To speed things along, banks and even shops will probably receive lots of euros in advance, so that cash machines and tills can spout the new currency exclusively from January ist 2002. Last week France announced that individuals would also be able to buy small quantities of euro coins in the two weeks before the starting date. 
Faced with this dominant new currency that is no longer a wild-eyed idea but a big fact of European economic life, the EU countries still outside the monetary union are edging towards it The Greek government, which always wanted to be a founder member of the monetary union but could not meet the criteria, aims now to join in January 2001. The centre-left government of Costas Simitis still needs to wrestle down Greece's inflation rate a shade further, but has cut the budget deficit from 1.9% of GDP last year to a projected 1.6% this year and is hacking away at the high level of outstanding public debt. It hopes to make a formal application in March 2000 and be cleared in June for entry. 
The two remaining outsiders, Sweden and Denmark, both stayed out of the monetary union by choice. Sweden invoked technical grounds, Denmark secured an explicit opt-out from its EU partners (as did Britain) when the Maastricht treaty underpinning the project was negotiated in 1991. But the current Danish prime minister, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, who took office in 1993, is a firm supporter of monetary union. He is backed by a respected central-bank governor, Bodil Nyboe Andersen, and by the Confederation of Danish Industry. 
Recent opinion polls have shown a clear margin of support for Danish entry (see chart). Even trade unions, traditionally a bastion of europhobia, have started speaking out in favour of the euro. Like Mr Blair in Britain, Mr Nyrup Rasmussen plans a referendum to decide. Again like Mr Blair, he hesitates to name the day. But the guess is that it will happen early in 2001-well before the next Danish general election, which is due by March 2002. 
In Sweden, the government is shillyshallying, with public opinion more finely balanced. The ruling Social Democrats are due to debate monetary union at a special conference in March. This could yet clear the way for a referendum in the autumn of 2000, and a final decision before Sweden takes over the rotating presidency of the Eu at the start of 2001. The public seems to be leaning towards the euro again after a sharp fall-off in support last spring and summer, when the currency's value was slumping. A couple of polls in October found a narrow balance of Swedish opinion in favour of joining-the first positive ratio since May. 
So when Britain does get round to making its own choice, late in 2001, perhaps, or in 2002, it may well find itself contemplating a different map of the monetary union. The divide will not lie between 11 ""ins"" and four ""outs"", but between 14 ""ins"" and one solitary outlier: Britain itself. Such a position would not be untenable: after all, Britain might well soon be joined by several of the applicant countries in the EU'S hoped-for enlargement. But it may well be uncomfortable.

 IN BRITAIN , the question of whether or not to join Europe 's monetary union promises a long struggle leading to a fiercely fought referendum ( see page 57 ) . The Labour government is for joining , provided that the economic conditions are favourable . Though the prime minister , Tony Blair , is keen to go in for political reasons , the economics of the issue is still being fiercely contested . Across the rest of Europe , by contrast , arguments about the euro have largely subsided , at least for the time being . 
 It is there and it works - so far , at any rate . The single monetary policy now in force across 11 countries has stoked up booms in Ireland , Spain and Portugal , but can not be blamed for sluggishness in the bigger countries , nor their stubbornly high unemployment . A long early slide in the new currency 's exchange rate against the dollar did prove something of a political worry . But since August the euro has steadied against the dollar at what most countries seem to consider roughly the right level in economic terms . On October 12th , it bought $ 1.075 , well down from $ 1.18 in January but well up from near-- parity with the dollar in June . 
 Economic recovery is rolling reassuringly through France and - more tentatively-- Germany and Italy . In all three countries , exporters have profited from the currency 's weakness . Official statistics show inflation well under control , with producer prices across the monetary union rising at an annual rate of 0.5 % in August . And European capital markets have been booming , spurred on by low interest rates and by the elimination of exchange - rate risk within the monetary union : EU firms have been issuing debt this year at three times last year 's rate . The European Central Bank still fumbles a bit in public , but by and large it has been doing a good job in difficult circumstances . 
 If anything , the 11 governments already inside the monetary union wish they had pushed the whole thing through even more quickly than they did . The euro was introduced at the start of this year for , non - cash transactions only ( such as electronic - funds transfers , and payments by cheque or credit card ) . Euro notes and coins are due to be issued in place of national notes and coins from the start of 2002 . 
 The European Commission , the EU 'S executive body , reports a growing consensus among governments that this last phase ( known in EMU jargon as the "" double circulation period "" ) should be cut from a planned six months to a mere six or eight weeks . To speed things along , banks and even shops will probably receive lots of euros in advance , so that cash machines and tills can spout the new currency exclusively from January ist 2002 . Last week France announced that individuals would also be able to buy small quantities of euro coins in the two weeks before the starting date . 
 Faced with this dominant new currency that is no longer a wild - eyed idea but a big fact of European economic life , the EU countries still outside the monetary union are edging towards it The Greek government , which always wanted to be a founder member of the monetary union but could not meet the criteria , aims now to join in January 2001 . Costas Simitis still needs to wrestle down Greece 's inflation rate a shade further , but has cut the budget deficit from 1.9 % of GDP last year to a projected 1.6 % this year and is hacking away at the high level of outstanding public debt . Costas Simitis hopes to make a formal application in March 2000 and be cleared in June for entry . 
 The two remaining outsiders , Sweden and Denmark , both stayed out of the monetary union by choice . Sweden invoked technical grounds , Denmark secured an explicit opt - out from its EU partners ( as did Britain ) when the Maastricht treaty underpinning the project was negotiated in 1991 . But the current Danish prime minister , Poul Nyrup Rasmussen , who took office in 1993 , is a firm supporter of monetary union . He is backed by a respected central - bank governor , Bodil Nyboe Andersen , and by the Confederation of Danish Industry . 
 Recent opinion polls have shown a clear margin of support for Danish entry ( see chart ) . Even trade unions , traditionally a bastion of europhobia , have started speaking out in favour of the euro . Like Mr Blair in Britain , Mr Nyrup Rasmussen plans a referendum to decide . Again like Mr Blair , he hesitates to name the day . But the guess is that it will happen early in 2001 - well before the next Danish general election , which is due by March 2002 . 
 In Sweden , the government is shillyshallying , with public opinion more finely balanced . The ruling Social Democrats are due to debate monetary union at a special conference in March . This could yet clear the way for a referendum in the autumn of 2000 , and a final decision before Sweden takes over the rotating presidency of the Eu at the start of 2001 . The public seems to be leaning towards the euro again after a sharp fall - off in support last spring and summer , when the currency 's value was slumping . A couple of polls in October found a narrow balance of Swedish opinion in favour of joining - the first positive ratio since May. 
 So when Britain does get round to making its own choice , late in 2001 , perhaps , or in 2002 , it may well find itself contemplating a different map of the monetary union . The divide will not lie between 11 "" ins "" and four "" outs "" , but between 14 "" ins "" and one solitary outlier : Britain itself . Such a position would not be untenable : after all , Britain might well soon be joined by several of the applicant countries in the EU 'S hoped - for enlargement . But it may well be uncomfortable .",350,Greece,A29-5314,IN TERM,True,The centre - left government of Costas Simitis,2,True

AS A British parliamentary committee begins, next week, to take oral evidence in an inquiry into trading in looted antiquities and the return of cultural objects to their country of origin, a poll of British MPS conducted by The Economist shows a surprising degree of support in the House of Commons for the Greek side of the most controversial of cultural-return cases-the Elgin marbles in the British Museum. 
Lord Elgin's collection of classical antiquities has long been a cause of dispute between Greece and Britain. The sculptures and architectural fragments that once decorated the Parthenon, the temple that looks down on Athens from the top of the Acropolis, were carved in the fifth century BC under the direction of Phidias, probably the greatest classical Greek sculptor.Today more than half the panels from the frieze, a third of the metope slabs from the outside of the Parthenon and 17 figures from the pediments-together representing most of the finest and least damaged pieces to have survived-are the pride of the British Museum's collection of Greek antiquities. The Elgin, or Parthenon marbles as they are called in Greece, were removed from the Acropolis on the orders of Lord Elgin, British ambassador to the Ottoman empire, in the years after 1801. Some pieces were found in excavations, but most were taken from the building by Elgin's agents and a large force of workmen. Housed in the British Museum since they were purchased under a British act of Parliament in 1816, their exile has been a source of hurt to the Greeks ever since Greek independence. 
The struggle intensified in 1983 when the then culture minister, Melina Mercouri, called for them to be reunited with the Parthenon sculptures that remained in Greece. Successive Greek governments have made the same demand, some more loudly than others, but all have been told no by Labour and Conservative prime ministers alike. Three days after Tony Blair took office in 1997, the new secretary of state for culture, media and sport, Chris Smith, told the BBC that returning the Elgin marbles was""nota feasible or sensible option. We won't do it."" 
Yet the first newspaper poll to be conducted on this issue since Labour swept to power in may 1997 shows that a large number of mps disagree with the government view. A weighted sample of 183 mps suggests that 66% of members would return the marbles if there were a free vote in the House of Commons today. Crucially, nearly 85% of the Labour and Liberal Democrat mps who replied favour returning the sculptures.only among Conservatives and Ulster Unionists, who together account for 174 of the 659 seats in the House of Commons, is there any feeling for keeping the marbles in Britain. 
The poll's findings will hearten the Greek prime minister, Costas Simitis, as much as it will dismay the British Museum and the British government. Mr Simitis faces a general election on April 9th, which he called early to seek a mandate for Greece's entry into the European single currency. if his Pasok party wins the election, Mr Simitis will be in office when Athens hosts the Olympic Games in 2004. Mr Simitis hopes that Greece's improved European credentials will help persuade the British to return the marbles in time for the Olympic Games as an act of European generosity. 
To make sure no one missed the point, Mr Simitis kicked off his campaign with a visit to the Acropolis and the site of the proposed new Acropolis museum where part of the exhibition space will remain empty until, as one official said, ""the British Museum returns its collection"". Construction has been fraught with problems, first because of difficulties in compulsorily purchasing properties around the site, and later when the discovery of important archaeological remains meant that plans had to be revised. Mr Simitis has let it be known that he will be personally involved in selecting a new architect for it. 
In Britain, meanwhile, the 11 members of the House of Commons select committee, under the chairmanship of Gerald Kaufman, have begun their inquiry into the return of cultural objects. The committee will investigate how Britain might help to restrain the illicit trade in looted antiquities and will also consider historic claims. It will travel to Italy to hear about the trade in stolen antiquities, and, at the end of this month, to Athens to hear the Greek claim at first hand. 
The British Museum is dismayed at the possibility that the select committee may be swayed by Greek arguments. A briefing document, believed to have been written by the museum and leaked by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, describes the committee's visit to Greece as ""unfortunate"". 
The museum takes heart from the fact that, publicly at least, British government policy has not changed. Some, however, believe that the government may be looking for an honourable way out of the impasse over the sculptures. Both Mr Blair and Mr Smith declined to take part in The Economist's poll. Yet in a letter dated February 17th, Mr Smith referred to the sculptures as ""the Parthenon marbles"", the term by which they are always known in Greece and among restitutionists, signalling perhaps that he has more sympathy with the Greek position than he can admit. 
If there is to be any change in the present status of the Elgin marbles, it will not be brought about by diplomacy or legal action, but as a result of political opinion and political change in Britain. That in turn will depend in large measure on how sophisticated and persuasive a campaign the two sides are able to mount. Are the Elgin marbles truly better off as part of the British Museum's permanent collection, or should they be reunited with their remaining fellow sculptures in Athens? 
Treasure house 
The Parthenon stands at the highest point of the Acropolis, and was from the earliest times both a citadel of Athens and a religious centre. It was erected originally to house the Athenian treasury and honour the goddess Athena, patron and protectress of the city. The colonnaded building remained in use as a temple for 900 years. 
What distinguishes the Parthenon is the dramatic narrative told by its sculptured frieze which is carved in low relief. The frieze along the top part of the outside wall of the main temple, within the outer colonnade, is generally believed to depict the Panathenaia, the great civic and religious festival of the city of Athens, held every four years. Among the figures shown are the 12 Olympian gods and goddesses, the elders of the city, a procession of troops of idealised horsemen, and men and women bearing offerings and leading sacrificial animals. 
By the time Lord Elgin, pictured below, was appointed ambassador to the Porte in 1799, part of the frieze, many of the sculptures in the pediments and a number of the metopes had been destroyed; some by Christians who took over the building in the sixth century and more by a Venetian shell fired into the building while it was being used as a gunpowder magazine in 1687. A series of drawings by a French artist named Jacques Carrey made u. years earlier are all that remain of ten of the slabs from the frieze and four of the metopes. 
The earliest firman or authority, that Lord Elgin obtained from the Turkish authorities (which is now lost) restricted Elgin's agent, Giovanni Battista Lusieri, to drawing the sculptures and making casts from them in situ. A second finnan, of which only an Italian translation now exists, goes further, allowing Lord Elgin to remove what is described as ""qualche pezzi di pietra"". Occasionally translated as ""some"", ""qualche"", in modem Italian, at least, is more usually taken to mean ""a few"", in part because it is followed by a singular noun. Whatever the legal niceties, Lord Elgin's agents were permitted, over many months, to use saws, crow bars and naval pulleys, to take off most of the best surviving pieces and later ship them from Piraeus, evidence of the Turkish authorities' willingness to accommodate their most important ally and of the bribes Elgin paid to get his way. 
William St Clair, a British historian and author of the classic, ""Lord Elgin and the Marbles: The Controversial History of the Parthenon Sculptures"" (oup; $16.95 and 12.50), has recently published extracts from the financial accounts of Lord Elgin's agent. These show that bribery amounted to a quarter of the costs of removing the antiquities. During the first 18 months, Lord Elgin paid the military governor of the Acropolis a sum amounting to 35 times his official annual salary in return for being allowed to stretch the terms of the firman. 
The most impassioned restitutionists claim that it was only Lord Elgin's bribes to an occupying force that led to the dismemberment of the monument. However, John Henry Merryman, an emeritus professor of international law at Stanford University in California, who has studied the case, has concluded that the firman gave Elgin good title. Although he believes Elgin's bribes muddy the waters of the case, Mr Merryman still feels Greece would be unlikely to win the marbles back in court. And indeed Greek governments have avoided making a narrow legal claim. 
The British legal position is in any event more complex than might appear. Lord Elgin was nearly bankrupt at the time the government bought the marbles for 05,000. Under the British Museum Act of July ist 1816, they were vested in the trustees of the British Museum in perpetuity, provided they were ""preserved and kept together"" in the museum. Early the following year, they were moved to a temporary exhibition space within the museum, and in 1961 to the Duveen Gallery where they are now to be seen. It is not within the power of the British museum, or indeed the cabinet alone, to return them; only an act of Parliament can reverse the government's acquisition. 
The Elgin marbles were controversial from the start. In 1816, the parliamentary vote to purchase the sculptures was carried by a narrow majority, 82 to 80. Since then, British sentiment about returning them to Greece has been influenced by wider political considerations. Among the early dissenters was a small group of mps who felt that the marbles had been improperly removed by Lord Elgin and should be held in trust only until their return was demanded by the city of Athens. These voices faded as Victorian expansionism made Britain feel it had become the centre of the civilised world. And in 1864, when Anglo-Greek relations blossomed after Britain transferred sovereignty of the Ionian islands to Greece, even the mildest call for the marbles' return was blocked. 
After the fall of France in 1940, however, when Britain needed Greece, the Foreign Office went as far as to draft a scheme for the marbles' return after the war. The military danger passed, and that plan was shelved. Fresh hints were again dropped during the Cyprus insurgency in the ig5os when Britain wanted Greece to stop supporting the terrorist campaign against the British colonial government on the island. When Labour was in opposition in the 1980s, Neil Kinnock promised he would return the marbles to Greece as soon as the party was returned to power. When Labour won the last election, it quickly told the Greeks the marbles were staying in Britain. 
The British Museum, like the Louvre though unlike a number of American museums, cannot deaccession anything it holds. Politically, the present defence of the status quo combines a claim that the marbles were legally acquired with the ""slippery slope"" argument that, if Britain were to agree to the Greek request, other nations would mount claims to have other cultural treasures returned. 
There are a number of other arguments that have been used in Britain to ensure that public opinion stayed firmly in the retentionists' camp. The most common are that, if the British hadn't removed them, someone else (probably Napoleon) certainly would have done; that had the marbles remained in Greece they would have been destroyed because of air pollution and poor stewardship; and that they have been particularly well cared for by the British Museum. 
Some of these arguments have been worn thin, if not through. The museum has not always protected the marbles well; in the late 1930s, for example, they were cleaned by unskilled workmen using carborundum and wire brushes on the orders of Lord Duveen, an art dealer and wealthy patron who was planning to finance a new gallery for the marbles and wanted to make them appear more white. Details of the botched cleaning, during which the surfaces of the marbles were badly damaged, and the subsequent cover-up by the museum were still emerging in November last year. This particular episode notwithstanding, the museum has been an excellent guardian. in recent years, however, developments in Greece have done much to invalidate the argument that the marbles would be endangered if they were to be sent back. 
Research into the chemistry of antiquities, conservation and restoration is probably more advanced in Greece than anywhere else. The work of an elderly chemistry professor, Theodore Skoulikides, on reversing the worst effects of pollution on marble surfaces, and by Manolis Korres on the technology of constructing ancient buildings, are considered the finest in the world. One curator at the British Museum insists that, ""Because of the Greeks' work we know more about the marbles than we have ever known."" A seven-year restoration project for the Acropolis is well under way, and has been boosted recently by a loan from the European Union. The budget has increased from 300m drachmas ($900,000) in 1997 to 800m this year. Plans are to stabilise the structure and reconstruct some of the fallen columns with newly cut marble. 
Second, Greek government efforts to ban the use of cheap heating oil and low-grade diesel have gone some way to improving the air quality in the city, though much still needs to be done. The whole building, including the sculptures that remained in place, began to suffer badly when atmospheric pollution increased in the 1960s, and some features were lost to sulphur dioxide. However, all the pedimental pieces and the west frieze have now been taken indoors to the museum, some being replaced with copies. By 1998, however, sulphur-dioxide levels had decreased, from 200 micrograms per cubic metre to less than 40. Smoke and nitrous-oxide levels are also falling. 
One point that no restorationist can deny is that, even if the marbles were returned to Greece, they would not be returned to the Parthenon. indeed, the Greeks have had to take down yet more sculptures in order to safeguard them from the polluted environment. Yet the metopes which remain in place, including the finest which is in the best surviving comer of the building, are deteriorating, and no one in Greece seems to want to be responsible for taking a decision that might mean dismantling part of the 2,500-yearold building. Furthermore, with little exhibition space available, many of the pieces that have been removed are not yet on display. 
The new Acropolis museum could change all that. Originally designed eight years ago by a firm of Italian architects, the museum was to have included large exhibition halls and a clear view of the Parthenon through an exhibition window in the roof. The museum will now be completely redesigned. A new architect will be chosen in May, with full drawings due by September. Even if construction were to start on schedule, a year from now, it is extremely unlikely the building will be finished in time for the Olympics. 
Despite that, the British Museum is growing nervous about the possibility of losing what it regards as the centrepiece of its permanent collection. It worries that the select committee inquiry may stoke up public support for return to a point where the Greek claim is hard to resist. Both the museum and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport regard the effort to keep the marbles in Britain as something of a strategic campaign. 
So much is obvious from a briefing paper sent out last month by a press officer in the department. The paper describes a number of tactics that have been used to delay or derail the Greek efforts. One in particular is the argument, used in the past at UNESCO meetings, that removing the marbles from the British Museum by law could be interpreted as confiscation and would be contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights. ""This argument is of limited value,"" the paper comments. ""It was raised as a delaying tactic and may have run its course."" ","As pressure increases on Britain to return the Elgin marbles , British excuses for refusing to do so are growing thinner 
 AS A British parliamentary committee begins , next week , to take oral evidence in an inquiry into trading in looted antiquities and the return of cultural objects to their country of origin , a poll of British MPS conducted by The Economist shows a surprising degree of support in the House of Commons for the Greek side of the most controversial of cultural - return cases - the Elgin marbles in the British Museum . 
 Lord Elgin 's collection of classical antiquities has long been a cause of dispute between Greece and Britain . The sculptures and architectural fragments that once decorated the Parthenon , the temple that looks down on Athens from the top of the Acropolis , were carved in the fifth century BC under the direction of Phidias , probably the greatest classical Greek sculptor . Today more than half the panels from the frieze , a third of the metope slabs from the outside of the Parthenon and 17 figures from the pediments - together representing most of the finest and least damaged pieces to have survived - are the pride of the British Museum 's collection of Greek antiquities . The Elgin , or Parthenon marbles as they are called in Greece , were removed from the Acropolis on the orders of Lord Elgin , British ambassador to the Ottoman empire , in the years after 1801 . Some pieces were found in excavations , but most were taken from the building by Elgin 's agents and a large force of workmen . Housed in the British Museum since they were purchased under a British act of Parliament in 1816 , their exile has been a source of hurt to the Greeks ever since Greek independence . 
 The struggle intensified in 1983 when the then culture minister , Melina Mercouri , called for them to be reunited with the Parthenon sculptures that remained in Greece . Successive Greek governments have made the same demand , some more loudly than others , but all have been told no by Labour and Conservative prime ministers alike . Three days after Tony Blair took office in 1997 , the new secretary of state for culture , media and sport , Chris Smith , told the BBC that returning the Elgin marbles was""nota feasible or sensible option . We wo n't do it . "" 
 Yet the first newspaper poll to be conducted on this issue since Labour swept to power in may 1997 shows that a large number of mps disagree with the government view . A weighted sample of 183 mps suggests that 66 % of members would return the marbles if there were a free vote in the House of Commons today . Crucially , nearly 85 % of the Labour and Liberal Democrat mps who replied favour returning the sculptures.only among Conservatives and Ulster Unionists , who together account for 174 of the 659 seats in the House of Commons , is there any feeling for keeping the marbles in Britain . 
 The poll 's findings will hearten Costas Simitis , as much as it will dismay the British Museum and the British government . Costas Simitis faces a general election on April 9th , which Costas Simitis called early to seek a mandate for Greece 's entry into the European single currency . if Costas Simitis's Pasok party wins the election , Costas Simitis will be in office when Athens hosts the Olympic Games in 2004 . Costas Simitis hopes that Greece 's improved European credentials will help persuade the British to return the marbles in time for the Olympic Games as an act of European generosity . 
 To make sure no one missed the point , Costas Simitis kicked off Costas Simitis's campaign with a visit to the Acropolis and the site of the proposed new Acropolis museum where part of the exhibition space will remain empty until , as one official said , "" the British Museum returns its collection "" . Construction has been fraught with problems , first because of difficulties in compulsorily purchasing properties around the site , and later when the discovery of important archaeological remains meant that plans had to be revised . Costas Simitis has let it be known that Costas Simitis will be personally involved in selecting a new architect for it . 
 In Britain , meanwhile , the 11 members of the House of Commons select committee , under the chairmanship of Gerald Kaufman , have begun their inquiry into the return of cultural objects . The committee will investigate how Britain might help to restrain the illicit trade in looted antiquities and will also consider historic claims . It will travel to Italy to hear about the trade in stolen antiquities , and , at the end of this month , to Athens to hear the Greek claim at first hand . 
 The British Museum is dismayed at the possibility that the select committee may be swayed by Greek arguments . A briefing document , believed to have been written by the museum and leaked by the Department for Culture , Media and Sport , describes the committee 's visit to Greece as "" unfortunate "" . 
 The museum takes heart from the fact that , publicly at least , British government policy has not changed . Some , however , believe that the government may be looking for an honourable way out of the impasse over the sculptures . Both Mr Blair and Mr Smith declined to take part in The Economist 's poll . Yet in a letter dated February 17th , Mr Smith referred to the sculptures as "" the Parthenon marbles "" , the term by which they are always known in Greece and among restitutionists , signalling perhaps that he has more sympathy with the Greek position than he can admit . 
 If there is to be any change in the present status of the Elgin marbles , it will not be brought about by diplomacy or legal action , but as a result of political opinion and political change in Britain . That in turn will depend in large measure on how sophisticated and persuasive a campaign the two sides are able to mount . Are the Elgin marbles truly better off as part of the British Museum 's permanent collection , or should they be reunited with their remaining fellow sculptures in Athens ? 
 Treasure house 
 The Parthenon stands at the highest point of the Acropolis , and was from the earliest times both a citadel of Athens and a religious centre . It was erected originally to house the Athenian treasury and honour the goddess Athena , patron and protectress of the city . The colonnaded building remained in use as a temple for 900 years . 
 What distinguishes the Parthenon is the dramatic narrative told by its sculptured frieze which is carved in low relief . The frieze along the top part of the outside wall of the main temple , within the outer colonnade , is generally believed to depict the Panathenaia , the great civic and religious festival of the city of Athens , held every four years . Among the figures shown are the 12 Olympian gods and goddesses , the elders of the city , a procession of troops of idealised horsemen , and men and women bearing offerings and leading sacrificial animals . 
 By the time Lord Elgin , pictured below , was appointed ambassador to the Porte in 1799 , part of the frieze , many of the sculptures in the pediments and a number of the metopes had been destroyed ; some by Christians who took over the building in the sixth century and more by a Venetian shell fired into the building while it was being used as a gunpowder magazine in 1687 . A series of drawings by a French artist named Jacques Carrey made u. years earlier are all that remain of ten of the slabs from the frieze and four of the metopes . 
 The earliest firman or authority , that Lord Elgin obtained from the Turkish authorities ( which is now lost ) restricted Elgin 's agent , Giovanni Battista Lusieri , to drawing the sculptures and making casts from them in situ . A second finnan , of which only an Italian translation now exists , goes further , allowing Lord Elgin to remove what is described as "" qualche pezzi di pietra "" . Occasionally translated as "" some "" , "" qualche "" , in modem Italian , at least , is more usually taken to mean "" a few "" , in part because it is followed by a singular noun . Whatever the legal niceties , Lord Elgin 's agents were permitted , over many months , to use saws , crow bars and naval pulleys , to take off most of the best surviving pieces and later ship them from Piraeus , evidence of the Turkish authorities ' willingness to accommodate their most important ally and of the bribes Elgin paid to get his way . 
 William St Clair , a British historian and author of the classic , "" Lord Elgin and the Marbles : The Controversial History of the Parthenon Sculptures "" ( oup ; $ 16.95 and 12.50 ) , has recently published extracts from the financial accounts of Lord Elgin 's agent . These show that bribery amounted to a quarter of the costs of removing the antiquities . During the first 18 months , Lord Elgin paid the military governor of the Acropolis a sum amounting to 35 times his official annual salary in return for being allowed to stretch the terms of the firman . 
 The most impassioned restitutionists claim that it was only Lord Elgin 's bribes to an occupying force that led to the dismemberment of the monument . However , John Henry Merryman , an emeritus professor of international law at Stanford University in California , who has studied the case , has concluded that the firman gave Elgin good title . Although he believes Elgin 's bribes muddy the waters of the case , Mr Merryman still feels Greece would be unlikely to win the marbles back in court . And indeed Greek governments have avoided making a narrow legal claim . 
 The British legal position is in any event more complex than might appear . Lord Elgin was nearly bankrupt at the time the government bought the marbles for 05,000 . Under the British Museum Act of July ist 1816 , they were vested in the trustees of the British Museum in perpetuity , provided they were "" preserved and kept together "" in the museum . Early the following year , they were moved to a temporary exhibition space within the museum , and in 1961 to the Duveen Gallery where they are now to be seen . It is not within the power of the British museum , or indeed the cabinet alone , to return them ; only an act of Parliament can reverse the government 's acquisition . 
 The Elgin marbles were controversial from the start . In 1816 , the parliamentary vote to purchase the sculptures was carried by a narrow majority , 82 to 80 . Since then , British sentiment about returning them to Greece has been influenced by wider political considerations . Among the early dissenters was a small group of mps who felt that the marbles had been improperly removed by Lord Elgin and should be held in trust only until their return was demanded by the city of Athens . These voices faded as Victorian expansionism made Britain feel it had become the centre of the civilised world . And in 1864 , when Anglo - Greek relations blossomed after Britain transferred sovereignty of the Ionian islands to Greece , even the mildest call for the marbles ' return was blocked . 
 After the fall of France in 1940 , however , when Britain needed Greece , the Foreign Office went as far as to draft a scheme for the marbles ' return after the war . The military danger passed , and that plan was shelved . Fresh hints were again dropped during the Cyprus insurgency in the ig5os when Britain wanted Greece to stop supporting the terrorist campaign against the British colonial government on the island . When Labour was in opposition in the 1980s , Neil Kinnock promised he would return the marbles to Greece as soon as the party was returned to power . When Labour won the last election , it quickly told the Greeks the marbles were staying in Britain . 
 The British Museum , like the Louvre though unlike a number of American museums , can not deaccession anything it holds . Politically , the present defence of the status quo combines a claim that the marbles were legally acquired with the "" slippery slope "" argument that , if Britain were to agree to the Greek request , other nations would mount claims to have other cultural treasures returned . 
 There are a number of other arguments that have been used in Britain to ensure that public opinion stayed firmly in the retentionists ' camp . The most common are that , if the British had n't removed them , someone else ( probably Napoleon ) certainly would have done ; that had the marbles remained in Greece they would have been destroyed because of air pollution and poor stewardship ; and that they have been particularly well cared for by the British Museum . 
 Some of these arguments have been worn thin , if not through . The museum has not always protected the marbles well ; in the late 1930s , for example , they were cleaned by unskilled workmen using carborundum and wire brushes on the orders of Lord Duveen , an art dealer and wealthy patron who was planning to finance a new gallery for the marbles and wanted to make them appear more white . Details of the botched cleaning , during which the surfaces of the marbles were badly damaged , and the subsequent cover - up by the museum were still emerging in November last year . This particular episode notwithstanding , the museum has been an excellent guardian . in recent years , however , developments in Greece have done much to invalidate the argument that the marbles would be endangered if they were to be sent back . 
 Research into the chemistry of antiquities , conservation and restoration is probably more advanced in Greece than anywhere else . The work of an elderly chemistry professor , Theodore Skoulikides , on reversing the worst effects of pollution on marble surfaces , and by Manolis Korres on the technology of constructing ancient buildings , are considered the finest in the world . One curator at the British Museum insists that , "" Because of the Greeks ' work we know more about the marbles than we have ever known . "" A seven - year restoration project for the Acropolis is well under way , and has been boosted recently by a loan from the European Union . The budget has increased from 300 m drachmas ( $ 900,000 ) in 1997 to 800 m this year . Plans are to stabilise the structure and reconstruct some of the fallen columns with newly cut marble . 
 Second , Greek government efforts to ban the use of cheap heating oil and low - grade diesel have gone some way to improving the air quality in the city , though much still needs to be done . The whole building , including the sculptures that remained in place , began to suffer badly when atmospheric pollution increased in the 1960s , and some features were lost to sulphur dioxide . However , all the pedimental pieces and the west frieze have now been taken indoors to the museum , some being replaced with copies . By 1998 , however , sulphur - dioxide levels had decreased , from 200 micrograms per cubic metre to less than 40 . Smoke and nitrous - oxide levels are also falling .

Yet the metopes which remain in place , including the finest which is in the best surviving comer of the building , are deteriorating , and no one in Greece seems to want to be responsible for taking a decision that might mean dismantling part of the 2,500 - yearold building .

Tax collection has become far more efficient, thanks partly to computerising the system. Bond trading has been modernised. Spending as a proportion Of GDP is steady. As a result, inflation has fallen sharply, and the public debt and budget deficit have dropped to EU-respectable levels. The figures, broadly speaking, are good. 
Still, a lot has to be done if Greece is to prosper within the euro zone. Telecoms, energy and shipping need liberalising. But such things have a fair chance of being done because joining the euro remains so popular. Nearly three-quarters of Greeks, according to pollsters, want it. And even if the Socialists were to lose the general election due on April 9th, which looks unlikely, the momentum for joining would probably be sustained. if its fellow EU countries, Europe's Central Bank and the European Parliament approve, Greece could be in the euro next year. 
Denmark is the next keenest of the outsiders,but the government must persuade its own people before applying to join. The country's Social Democratic prime minister, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, has marked down September 28th for a referendum. Most political parties, trade unions, businessmen and bankers are with him. Having the euro would protect jobs and win back Danish influence in Europe, he argues. 
But Danish europhiles will have a fight on their hands. Pollsters put opponents of the euro almost on a par with the pros; a large minority is wavering. The doubters fear that the euro would undermine Danish welfare and prevent the government from protecting jobs. The euro-sceptic Danish People's Party, with the slogan ""For the krone and the fatherland"", fears the loss of Denmark's sovereignty to a federal Europe. Women are said to be particularly worried that Denmark might be submerged. 
Swedes have similar fears. But the ruling Social Democrats are coming round, albeit more slowly than their Danish cousins, to the euro. This month, at a special congress, they voted for the proposition ""Yes but later"", put forward by Goran Persson, the prime minister. They too agreed to resolve the matter by referendum, probably after the next general election, due by 2002. 
Mr Persson says he has gradually been persuaded of the euro's merits, seeing it, perhaps oddly, as ""the best protection against growing market forces"". But his party is still split; several of his cabinet ministers oppose it. The Swedish public is also wobbly, with recent polls showing the pro-euro camp only a few points ahead of the sceptics, the don't knows still, as in Denmark, a large minority. 
Norway is different again. it stands defiantly outside the EU, let alone the euro zone. But this month the Labour Party, which wants Norway to join the Union, took office, ousting a coalition led by Kjell Magne Bondevik, a Christian Democrat, that was broadly against. Jens Stoltenberg, the new prime minister, and his foreign minister, Thorbjorn jagland, who is also pro-EU, will try to drum up support for joining.

Even so, especially if the Danes and Swedes look set to join the euro, Europe is sure to feature in Norway's next general election, due in 2001.

Now that polling day on April 9th is only a week away, his decision has begun to look more risky. Although the Socialists are still a nose ahead in the opinion polls, the opposition right-ofcentre New Democracy is closing the gap. 
On television, the normally calm Mr Simitis is occasionally letting irritability show. His opponent, Costas Karamanlis, fighting his first general election as New Democracy's leader, is visibly gaining in confidence. The polls suggest that most Greeks still prefer Mr Simitis, and find Mr Karamanlis's style-part brash lawyer, part bumbling newcomer-less than wholly appealing. But the prime minister's advantage has palpably narrowed, and it is not easy to say why. 
Under Mr Simitis, who took over his party from the less predictable Andreas Papandreou, Greece has become more like the other Mediterranean members of the European Union. Mr Simitis has managed, unlike his predecessor, to hold Serbia's Slobodan Milosevic at arm's length, while working hard to befriend other Balkan leaders. About i,ooo Greek troops are serving with NATO's peacekeeping force in Kosovo. Mr Simitis is a firm supporter of Turkey's aspiration tojoin the Eu, and relations with Greece's old enemy have improved so much that, if he is reelected, he can count on a truly warm welcome in the Turkish capital, Ankara. 
The Greek economy has grown steadily, at just over 3% a year during Mr Simitis's four years in office. inflation, 2.9% in the year to February, is at its lowest for 30 years. Greece is still the EUS poorest member, but income per person has increased from 62% to 70% Of the Union's average. Best of all, Mr Simitis has almost achieved his aim of steering Greece's drachma into the euro zone. Its application looks set for approval at the next EU summit, opening the way for the euro to replace the drachma on January ist. 
So why are the Greeks not unreservedly cheering Mr Simitis back into office? Perhaps because he has ignored some important social issues in his single-minded pursuit of euro membership. A lot of Greeks worry that crime rates are rising (the fault, some snarl, of too many illegal immigrants), that standards are falling in state hospitals, and that the country's schools are not as good as they ought to be. it is especially embarrassing fbr Mr Simitis, an academic before he went into politics, that many Greek students are moving abroad. They, and their parents, are increasingly worried that the country's oldfashioned state universities (private ones are banned under Greece's creaking constitution) cannot prepare them for jobs in the intemet age. New Democracy's television propaganda makes the most of all this. 
To be sure, the opposition's leader avoids talking figures. A back-bencher elected to the leadership by grassroot right-wingers, Mr Karamanlis, whose late uncle with the same name was president, has never held even a deputy minister's job. He has the makings of a competent economic team, thanks to an election alliance with the small Liberal party, led by Stefanos Manos, a former economy minister. He says he would quickly liberalise telecoms and energy, where Greece lags far behind its EU partners. He promises to open up the public administration, and thus to end the corruption he says has become endemic under the Socialists, in power for all but three of the past 20 years. 
Mr Simitis makes almost identical promises. He has shown, in office, that he is by and large a man who does what he says. But it is no longer as clear as it seemed to be a couple of months ago that he will be allowed to put those promises to the test of another term.

 The Greek economy has grown steadily , at just over 3 % a year during Costas Simitis's four years in office . inflation , 2.9 % in the year to February , is at its lowest for 30 years . Greece is still the EUS poorest member , but income per person has increased from 62 % to 70 % Of the Union 's average . Best of all , Costas Simitis has almost achieved Costas Simitis's aim of steering Greece 's drachma into the euro zone . Its application looks set for approval at the next EU summit , opening the way for the euro to replace the drachma on January ist . 
 So why are the Greeks not unreservedly cheering Costas Simitis back into office ? Perhaps because Costas Simitis has ignored some important social issues in Costas Simitis's single - minded pursuit of euro membership . A lot of Greeks worry that crime rates are rising ( the fault , some snarl , of too many illegal immigrants ) , that standards are falling in state hospitals , and that the country 's schools are not as good as they ought to be . it is especially embarrassing fbr Costas Simitis politics , that many Greek students are moving abroad . They , and their parents , are increasingly worried that the country 's oldfashioned state universities ( private ones are banned under Greece 's creaking constitution ) can not prepare them for jobs in the intemet age . New Democracy 's television propaganda makes the most of all this . 
 To be sure , the opposition 's leader avoids talking figures . A back - bencher elected to the leadership by grassroot right - wingers , Mr Karamanlis , whose late uncle with the same name was president , has never held even a deputy minister 's job . He has the makings of a competent economic team , thanks to an election alliance with the small Liberal party , led by Stefanos Manos , a former economy minister . He says he would quickly liberalise telecoms and energy , where Greece lags far behind its EU partners . He promises to open up the public administration , and thus to end the corruption he says has become endemic under the Socialists , in power for all but three of the past 20 years . 
 Costas Simitis makes almost identical promises . Costas Simitis has shown , in office , that Costas Simitis is by and large a man who does what Costas Simitis says . But it is no longer as clear as it seemed to be a couple of months ago that Costas Simitis will be allowed to put those promises to the test of another term .",350,Greece,A29-5314,IN TERM,True,"Costas Simitis , Greece 's usually cautious prime minister ,",27,True

But unlike many in his Panhellenic Socialist Movement, better known as Pasok, which has held power for all but three of the past 19 years, Mr Simitis eschews the showier perks of office. He owns neither a villa nor a kotero, one of those fancy little motor yachts. On quiet Sifnos, his favourite island, he pays rent. When he wants a trip at sea, he joins a local fishing family in an old-fashioned wooden boat. 
Mr Simitis's unassuming way of life is one of the things that makes him popular. At the general election on April 9th, Pasok won a third term in a row-a record in modern Greece-albeit by the slimmest of margins. It won 43.8% of the vote, against 42.y% for the right-of-centre New Democracy. Though Greeks seem to be tiring of Pasok, cutting the marlin of its victory over the right by nearly three percentage points compared with the 1996 election, they are reluctant to put their country's fortunes in the hands of the inexperienced Constantine Karamanlis, a 43year-old lawyer who became New Democracy's leader partly on the strength of his name: his uncle and namesake, who died in 1998, took Greece into what was then the European Community. The younger Karamanlis has never held even a junior cabinet post. 
At the very least, Mr Simitis is a safe pair of hands. His steady, sometimes plodding, style is very different from that of his populist, wayward precedessor, Andreas Papandreou. Mr Simitis is nicknamed ""the bookkeeper"" for his fondness for boring audiences with statistics. But he has a knack of getting things done. In his four years at the top, the economy has revived so perkily that Greece looks set to join Europe's single currency early next year. He has also put relations with Turkey, Greece's old enemy, on a sounder and friendlier footing-quite an achievement, given the humiliating setback for Greece last year when it bungled its effort to hide Abdullah Ocalan, the Kurdish rebel leader, in its ambassador's house in Kenya. This year, Mr Simitis is to make the first official visit by a Greek prime minister in half a century to Ankara, Turkey's capital. 
At home, Mr Simitis has also managed to help blur the historical division of politics that goes back to Greece's civil war in the t94os between communists and nationalists. He comes from the old left: his father joined the outlawed communist-led ""government of the mountain"". He himself won his spurs in a group that resisted the Greek colonels' junta (1967-74), escaping to Italy on a forged passport. But, unlike most of his comrades, he acquired a social democrat's outlook while studying, and later teaching, commercial law at a German university. His views may be a bit dated by the standards of Europe's ""third way"": he says he prefers the current French version of socialism to the trendier British one. All the same, when it comes to reforming Greece, it is notable that Mr Simitis's instincts are closer to New Labour than to the old kind. 
Another of his useful qualities is that, unusually for a Greek politician, Mr Simitis is good at delegating-and can resist meddling. Yannos Papantoniou, his finance minister, has been in the job six years and looks likely to stay on at least until January, when he hopes that the drachma will give way to the euro. George Papandreou, the soft-spoken eldest son of the late prime minister, who took over as foreign minister after the Ocalan debacle, expects to go on having a free hand to run policy towards Turkey. Another sign of Mr Simitis's confidence is that other, less loyal, cabinet members have kept their jobs, including Akis Tsochatzopoulos, the old-style populist defence minister who was once a rival to Mr Simitis for the top spot. It also helps that several hardline Pasok oldies on the backbenches, who were among the most vehement opponents of the rapprochement with Turkey, lost their seats last weekend, while qo-plus younger Pasok types, mostly from Mr Simitis's moderate wing, were elected for the first time. 
But with Pasok holding just y8 out of 300 seats in parliament, Mr Simitis, who has hinted that this could be his last term as prime minister, has a much smaller majority than before. So will he have the nerve to shove through the economic and social reforms needed to lock Greece into the euro-zone? He has had a habit of putting off awkward decisions, on such issues as the sale of state-owned utilities and reform of public pensions. His instinct is to compromise rather than bludgeon. He has dithered over the revamping of inefficient, debt-ridden state outfits such as Olympic Airways and the railways. He has argued that outright confrontation with public-sector trade unions would hamper efforts to join Europe's common currency. Critics often call Mr Simitis a wimp. 
As a result, Greece still lags behind other countries in the EU's ""Club Med"" in making its public sector competitive. Over 600,000 migrant workers, mostly from Albania, have lowpaid jobs in Greece, yet unemployment among young university graduates is more than Zo%. Foreign investment is still scant. The ""new economy"" has yet to arrive. Greeks own fewer computers, proportionately, than others in the Eu, though Mr Simitis says that, thanks partly to an su grant, every Greek child should have access to one at school by 2004. But even with the latest chunk of largesse earmarked in the Eu budget that runs until zoo6, it will probably take at least 15 years before cDr per person in Greece reaches the current Eu average. 
However slim his majority, Mr Simitis must now become much bolder, or else the Greeks may well become stuck, as Andreas Papandreou used to moan, as ""the waiters of Europe"" rather than as revellers at the top table. Mr Simitis will have to become a more radical reformer if his country is eventually to get top-class hospitals and schools-and a public service where you no longer have to bribe in order, for instance, to get a copy of a birth certificate. He says he wants, above all, to get rid of miseria, the Balkan underdog mentality that still taints Greek attitudes. 
He sounds optimistic. A decent macroeconomic foundation is there. Now Mr Simitis has a chance of making Greece really buzz.

THE murder on June 8th of Britain's military attache to Greece has badly shaken the government of Costas Simitis, a middleof the-road pro-European Socialist who is striving to modernise his country. Brigadier Stephen Saunders's assassination, by a postilion on the back of a motorbike who shot him in his car during the morning rush-hour, had all the hallmarks of a Marxist terrorist group called November 17th. This group, named after the day in 1973 when Greece's ruling colonels crushed a student revolt, has carried out more than a score of murders in the past 25 years. Yet under no Greek government, on right or left, have charges against any suspect ever stuck. 
It is worse, from Mr Simitis's point of view, that many people in and outside Greece doubt the sincerity of Greek politicians, especially on the left, who promise to catch the killers. Suspicions linger that in the mid-1990s Andreas Papandreou, the late arch-populist who preceded Mr Simitis as prime minister, may even have colluded with November 17th, pledging leniency to a gunman with suspected terrorist links in return for a moratorium on attacks. 
Mr Simitis's government is not suspected of collusion, but the Americans have continued to complain that the Greeks do not try hard enough to bring terrorists to book. In an interview published in a Greek weekly on the very day of Brigadier Saunders's murder, James Woolsey, who ran the CIA between 1993 and 1995, said that several Greek ministers at that time knew the identities of various November 17th members but did nothing to have them arrested. 
The Greek government is squirming with embarrassment, especially since Greece is expected to be formally accepted, on June 19th, at a meeting of Eu leaders in Portugal, as a new member of Europe's single currency. A main aim of Mr Simitis as prime minister is to convince the other 14 countries in the EU that Greece is, in just about every way, as well-run, law-abiding and modernminded as they are. 
Together with Yannos Papantoniou, his able finance minister, he has done quite well at reform. The economy is in fair shape and should grow faster after Greece adopts the euro next January. George Papandreou, the mild-mannered foreign minister-and much less populist son of the late prime minister-works hard to foster last year's rapprochement with the old antagonist, Turkey. In NATO exercises earlier this month in the Aegean, Turkish marines landed in Greece for the first time in more than 20 years. Under Mr Simitis, the ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement, better known as Pasok, has shed some ageing Marxists and anti-Turkish militants on the way to becoming pro-European and social democratic. 
But the murder of the British brigadier has revived memories of a Pasok that has not yet entirely disappeared. Some members still feel nostalgic for the anti-Americanism, mixed with virulent Greek nationalism, that the late Papandreou eagerly nurtured. After all, Pasok, which was founded by the late prime minister, sprang out of the Panhellenic Liberation Movement, known as Pak, an undercover guerrilla outfit set up to fight the colonels' junta that ran Greece between 1967 and 1974. Under Papandreou, Pak and then Pasok retained their virulent, anti-western streak. in the mid-1980s, for example, a Pasok government let Abu Nidal, a Palestinian terrorist, have an office in Athens. 
Despite his own moderation, Mr Simitis has not yet finished clearing out Pasok's wild men. Only two months ago, when his party won a general election, he let a pair of diehard Socialists have safe seats: Sifts Valirakis, a former public-order minister who was once accused of arms smuggling, and Yannis Tsekouras, once a prominent Pak man. 
Mr Simitis has also resisted American pressure to make it easier to prosecute suspected terrorists by enacting laws to help protect witnesses, to improve security for judges and to allow hearings in secret. An agreement on police cooperation with the Americans was held up for months. 
Since Brigadier Saunders's death, Mr Simitis has promised to raise Greece's sloppy standard of police work and to cooperate more closely with western agencies to tackle terrorism. Greece has even proposed that the eu should launch a counter-terrorism initiative. And the reward for Greeks with information leading to a conviction of a member of November 17th has been doubled to 1 billion drachmas ($2.9m). 
The International Olympic Committee has already warned Greece that the Olympic Games, due to be held in Athens in 2004, will be moved elsewhere if the delays already dogging preparations go on-and if Greece cannot do better against terrorism. There have already been murmurs about holding the games in South Korea. If that happened, it would be a brutal, perhaps even mortal, blow to Mr Simitis's government. ","ATHENS

Under Papandreou , Pak and then Pasok retained their virulent , anti - western streak . in the mid-1980s , for example , a Pasok government let Abu Nidal , a Palestinian terrorist , have an office in Athens . 
 Despite Costas Simitis's own moderation , Costas Simitis has not yet finished clearing out Pasok 's wild men . Only two months ago , when Costas Simitis's party won a general election , Costas Simitis let a pair of diehard Socialists have safe seats : Sifts Valirakis , a former public - order minister who was once accused of arms smuggling , and Yannis Tsekouras , once a prominent Pak man . 
 Costas Simitis has also resisted American pressure to make it easier to prosecute suspected terrorists by enacting laws to help protect witnesses , to improve security for judges and to allow hearings in secret . An agreement on police cooperation with the Americans was held up for months . 
 Since Brigadier Saunders 's death , Costas Simitis has promised to raise Greece 's sloppy standard of police work and to cooperate more closely with western agencies to tackle terrorism . Greece has even proposed that the eu should launch a counter - terrorism initiative . And the reward for Greeks with information leading to a conviction of a member of November 17th has been doubled to 1 billion drachmas ( $ 2.9 m ) . 
 The International Olympic Committee has already warned Greece that the Olympic Games , due to be held in Athens in 2004 , will be moved elsewhere if the delays already dogging preparations go on - and if Greece can not do better against terrorism . There have already been murmurs about holding the games in South Korea . If that happened , it would be a brutal , perhaps even mortal , blow to Costas Simitis's government .",350,Greece,A29-5314,IN TERM,True,"Costas Simitis , a middleof the - road pro - European Socialist who is striving to modernise his country",15,True

It was on December 23rd 1975 that Richard Welch, the CIA's station chief in Athens, was shot dead outside his suburban home; he and his wife had just returned from the American ambassador's Christmas party. Some left-wing terrorists calling themselves ""November 17th""-after the day in 1973 that the colonels' junta had crushed a student rebellion-said they were responsible. Since then, with apparent impunity, November 17th has admitted killing another 22 people, including American and Turkish diplomats and prominent Greek businessmen. The latest victim was Brigadier Stephen Saunders, military attache at the British embassy, shot in June while driving to work. 
The Greek police have never arrested anybody belonging to the group. Last week, in a statement published by Eleftherotypia, a left-wing newspaper, November 17th boasted of the killing of Brigadier Saunders, denied any links with Middle Eastern terrorists, and praised the Greeks ""because they are not and will not become a nation of informers."" Despite rewards of over $7m offered for information that results in a conviction, the group remains untouched. 
Now Costas Simitis, Greece's prime minister, is trying to do better. A moderate Socialist, he wants to make Greece a respectable country. Athens will be host to the Olympic Games in 2004, and Mr Simitis has personally shouldered the burden of making them a success. That means, among other things, that he must at last get November 17th under control. 
Can he do it? The police, it is said, are working harder. The public-order ministry has overhauled its counter-terrorism unit. British experts from Scotland Yard are cooperating both with the Greeks and with officials of America's FBi based in Athens. There is talk among Socialist politicians of offering an amnesty to members of the group willing to turn in their colleagues. Eleftherios Papadimitriou, a former member of parliament, who was wounded by November 17th in 1992, backs the idea. Western diplomats say they see a new will to get to grips with terrorism. 
Yet the wheels of Greek justice turn slowly. The Socialists had promised tough new legislation by Christmas to make it easier to bring suspected terrorists to trial. Based on measures used elsewhere in Europe, it would include witness-protection schemes, DNA testing of suspects and trials held in camera, without a jury. Alas, it turns out that the proposals will not reach parliament for several months vet. 
George Kassimeris, a Greek journalist who this month published a book in English about November 17th called ""Europe's Last Red Terrorists"", says the group stays unscathed partly because, unlike Italy's Red Brigades and Germany's Red Army Faction, it has remained small and secretively closeknit. But many people think that police ineptitude, nonchalant politicians and the anti-western feelings still strong in Greece are also to blame.

 JUST when reform fatigue seemed to be taking hold of Greece's governing Socialists, Costas Simitis, the doggedly persistent prime minister, has made a bold move. Some cabinet members were surprised to hear him announce last week that Greece would postpone a long- awaited $4.5 billion purchase of new air-force planes. The money, which would have bought about 60 of the new multinational Eurofighter aircraft, will now go to overhaul Greece's outdated pension and welfare system.
 The decision displeased hawkish members of Mr Simitis's Pan- Hellenic Socialist Movement (known as Pasok), who think Greece should have as many new fighter aircraft as it can afford to fend off any possible attack by Turkey. Akis Tsochatzopoulos, the long-serving defence minister, a former rival of Mr Simitis for the party leadership, called the decision ""crazy"".
 Mr Simitis has been careful not to cancel the Eurofighter order, for which a preliminary agreement has been signed. It is to be reviewed in two years' time. Meanwhile, other arms programmes will go ahead, including orders of American F-16 aircraft and new warships and submarines to be built or fitted out at a Greek shipyard. But with relations with Turkey on the mend, Mr Simitis reckons that Greece's air force can make do with fewer, less expensive new aircraft.
 Greece, which joined the euro-zone in January, already faces problems keeping up with its obligations as the poorest member of the new currency club. It has to produce a sizeable budget surplus every year to help reduce the public debt, which is about as large as the Greek GDP. Revenues surged after American experts reorganised Greece's old-fashioned tax offices, but the surpluses are starting to flatten out. As a slowdown looms, Mr Simitis is under pressure to speed up reforms that would help make Greek companies more competitive.
 The economy is expected to grow by about 5% this year, but unemployment will fall only marginally from just under 12%, mostly because comparatively few jobs are available for women and young unskilled workers. Pension reform is badly needed if the pay-as-you- go system is not to collapse in about five years' time. The Socialists are struggling to improve poorly staffed and equipped state hospitals and, at the same time, launch a family health service.
 But there will be less cash flowing from Brussels, as subsidies paid to Greek farmers shrink. Controls on EU grants for improving roads and airports are being tightened, to prevent money contributed by richer north European taxpayers from being misspent.
 Could Mr Simitis's decision backfire? Not if George Papandreou, the increasingly influential foreign minister, and Ismail Cem, his Turkish opposite number, keep working at improving Greek-Turkish relations. Mr Papandreou made an unprecedented overture during a visit to Ankara on April 4th: he sounded out Turkish leaders about making mutually agreed cuts in defence spending.
 Such an idea would have seemed wildly out of place on his last visit to Turkey 14 months ago, when the Greek-Turkish rapprochement was still in its infancy. Since then Greece has grown more confident. Safe inside the euro-zone, the Greeks are unaffected by Turkey's financial crisis, while the Turks are under pressure from the IMF to slash their defence budget, as part of a new loan agreement.
 For all his blustering over the Eurofighters, Mr Tsochatzopoulos accepts the idea that Greece and Turkey need not be enemies. He is already discussing drastic policy changes with Greece's generals, from reducing military service for conscripts to removing minefields along the border with Turkey in Thrace. If Mr Papandreou makes progress in Ankara, Mr Tsochatzopoulos should soon be back on side.","  Greece has postponed a big order for new fighter aircraft -- a sign of better relations with Turkey , and of more pressing welfare needs

 TWO summers ago, thousands of Greek holidaymakers were glued to their mobile telephones, checking prices and trading shares as they lounged on the beach. As the stockmarket soared, ministers in Greece's centre-left Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement, better known as Pasok, delightedly claimed credit for having launched popular capitalism.
 More recently, the Socialists have been changing their tune. After falling for months, the stockmarket on July 16th hit a three-year low. Small investors, the worst hit, feel wretched. Stockbrokers who let favoured customers buy shares on credit face bankruptcy. Last year the government used some cash from privatisation sales to prop up the market. But as a member since January of the euro club, Greece is obliged by European Union rules to spend its spare cash slimming the bloated public debt.
 No wonder Costas Simitis, the prime minister, is feeling the heat. One polling company says his approval rating has sunk below 30%, his lowest ever. Most voters seem to think that Costas Karamanlis, the untested leader of the conservative opposition, would do a better job. Dissatisfaction with Pasok, in power for all but three of the past 20 years, is running high.
 After five-and-a-half years as prime minister, Mr Simitis, an ex- academic fond of hard work and detail, is under fire from some former supporters. Businessmen, less cowed than in the past, want him to move faster with liberalising the economy. Lumbering state enterprises still dominate telecoms, transport and power production. Taxes are high and paying them is a complicated and time-consuming affair.
 Mr Simitis is clearly rattled. Though a dedicated reformer, he shelved plans to overhaul the decaying pay-as-you-go pension system, after public-sector unions, his power base in Pasok, held demonstrations in protest against even the modest reforms he had proposed. Despite pressure from Brussels, the timetable for preparing a new pension law is vaguer than ever.
 Mr Simitis fought back by insisting that Pasok's next congress should be in October, six months earlier than planned. He will stand for re-election as the party leader. But he may be opposed.
 George Papandreou, the foreign minister and son of Pasok's populist founder, the late Andreas Papandreou, would be the best- qualified alternative. He would have a better chance than most to unite the party's two main factions: its old-fashioned tax-and-spend populists and pro-euro modernisers. So far, though, he has proved a loyal member of the modernising faction. He is ready to wait, telling friends he has plenty of time to bid for the leadership in the future.
 Not so Akis Tsochatzopoulos, the ageing defence minister who leads Pasok's populists. Despite two defeats at the hands of Mr Simitis for the top job, he would still like to be prime minister. The October congress could be his last chance for revenge.
 The betting is still on Mr Simitis. But simply winning would not be enough. He has to win handsomely to shut the populists up while he forges ahead with reforms. If not, the achievements of the past few years--low inflation, faster growth than the EU average and an acceptably low budget deficit--could be reversed. Greece's hopes of emulating Portugal and Spain, both now looking forward to ever- greater prosperity through their membership of the EU, would then start to fade.","  Costas Simitis must fend off a challenge

 COSTAS SIMITIS, the unassuming Socialist prime minister who pulled Greece into the euro-zone, may be running out of steam. Barely half-way through the current parliamentary term, his Pan- Hellenic Socialist Movement, better known as Pasok, is trailing behind the right-of-centre opposition by almost ten percentage points. For the first time the prime minister's approval rating, hitherto always higher than his party's, has dipped below that of Costas Karamanlis, the untested leader of New Democracy, an old- fashioned rightish party that has been out of government for 18 of the past 21 years.
 That seems odd. By most measures, Mr Simitis has not been doing badly. He says Greece's economy should grow this year by nearly 4%; some foreign watchers think 3.2% more realistic. Either way, that is a lot faster than the euro-zone's widely predicted average of 1.3% or so. Greece's budget should show a modest surplus of between 0.4% and 0.8% of GDP. The European Union is still ladling out much of the euro25 billion ($23 billion) in aid allocated between 2000 and 2006 to help Greece, still the EU's poorest country, catch up a bit more before the cash starts being redirected to poorer new members from Central Europe. And preparations for the Olympic Games to be held in Athens in 2004 are at last picking up speed after an embarrassingly muddled start.
 Greeks are even starting to feel less twitchy about their old regional rival, Turkey. Some are even investing there. Last month Nikos Christodoulakis, a close confidant of Mr Simitis, became the first Greek finance minister to visit Ankara, Turkey's capital. He followed the example of George Papandreou, the foreign minister, who oversaw a rapprochement with Turkey in the emotional aftermath of earthquakes that hit both countries in 1999.
 True, Greece is still blocking the official launch of the EU's nascent rapid-reaction force because of lingering suspicions over an agreement among other NATO countries that Turkey, which is in NATO but not the EU, should be able to veto EU access to NATO firepower. As Mr Simitis feels the political heat at home, he is sounding more populist abroad.
 On the other hand, since March Greek and Turkish diplomats and lawyers have been quietly talking, for the first time in decades, about settling a clutch of disputes over the Aegean Sea, or, if that is not possible, how to package them so that the two countries can ask the International Court of Justice at The Hague to adjudicate.
 Yet Mr Simitis is under attack from all sides. A hard-left faction which re-elected him party leader at a Pasok congress last October wants to put off reforms needed to make Greece more competitive within the euro-zone. The trade unions, which overwhelmingly back Pasok, have forced Mr Simitis to water down proposed reforms of Greece's state pension system.
 Meanwhile, businessmen complain that the government is reneging on its promise to simplify and reduce taxes. Employers want looser labour rules. So do young Greeks, a good quarter of whom have no job; all told, 11% of Greeks are jobless. And people increasingly tell pollsters that they are fed up with having to bribe petty officials to get permits and licences.
 Worse still, Mr Simitis has to keep potential successors within Pasok at bay. He has run the show for six years but is still keen to win a general election due early in 2004 so that he can host the Olympic Games in August. Leading Pasok people hint that the election will be held six months early, after Mr Simitis has presided over the EU in the first half of next year.
 Costas Laliotis, a former public-works minister who is Pasok's secretary-general, thinks Mr Simitis is already an electoral liability and should go now. Mr Laliotis is an unlikely successor: he does not speak English and attended only one ministerial meeting in Brussels while in the cabinet. But he would like to pull the party's strings. At least four ministers would be in the running. The infighting is already undermining Mr Simitis's efforts to get decisions implemented.
 For the moment, Mr Papandreou is the firm favourite to take over. American-born and British-educated, he is the modernising Mr Simitis's natural successor and would appeal to a wide range of Greeks in a general election. Many go-ahead people would plump for him, while many old-fashioned nationalists would give him the nod as son of the much more populist Andreas Papandreou, who ran Greece off and on for 11 years until he died in 1996. The younger man, now 49, has tried to avoid getting embroiled in party intrigue but no longer bothers much to disguise his differences with Mr Simitis. Mr Papandreou would like to proceed faster to hug Turkey more warmly, while the prime minister remains more cautious.
 Mr Simitis may survive at least until local elections in October. Voters are then likely to kick Pasok in the teeth after its long stint in power. Dora Bakoyanni looks likely to be elected mayor of Athens under New Democracy's banner. If Pasok is humiliated across the country, Mr Simitis's achievements of sound economic management at home and improving Greece's credibility abroad will probably not be enough to save him from the chop at the hands of his party.
Caption: Simitis tires of fending them off","  The survival of Costas Simitis's can not be guaranteed 
  Costas Simitis may be running out of steam . Barely half - way through the current parliamentary term , Costas Simitis's Pan- Hellenic Socialist Movement , better known as Pasok , is trailing behind the right - of - centre opposition by almost ten percentage points . For the first time Costas Simitis's approval rating , hitherto always higher than Costas Simitis's party 's , has dipped below that of Costas Karamanlis , the untested leader of New Democracy , an old- fashioned rightish party that has been out of government for 18 of the past 21 years . 
  That seems odd . By most measures , Costas Simitis has not been doing badly . Costas Simitis says Greece 's economy should grow this year by nearly 4 % ; some foreign watchers think 3.2 % more realistic . Either way , that is a lot faster than the euro - zone 's widely predicted average of 1.3 % or so . Greece 's budget should show a modest surplus of between 0.4 % and 0.8 % of GDP . The European Union is still ladling out much of the euro25 billion ( $ 23 billion ) in aid allocated between 2000 and 2006 to help Greece , still the EU 's poorest country , catch up a bit more before the cash starts being redirected to poorer new members from Central Europe . And preparations for the Olympic Games to be held in Athens in 2004 are at last picking up speed after an embarrassingly muddled start . 
  Greeks are even starting to feel less twitchy about their old regional rival , Turkey . Some are even investing there . Last month Nikos Christodoulakis , a close confidant of Costas Simitis , became the first Greek finance minister to visit Ankara , Turkey 's capital . He followed the example of George Papandreou , the foreign minister , who oversaw a rapprochement with Turkey in the emotional aftermath of earthquakes that hit both countries in 1999 . 
  True , Greece is still blocking the official launch of the EU 's nascent rapid - reaction force because of lingering suspicions over an agreement among other NATO countries that Turkey , which is in NATO but not the EU , should be able to veto EU access to NATO firepower . As Costas Simitis feels the political heat at home , Costas Simitis is sounding more populist abroad . 
  On the other hand , since March Greek and Turkish diplomats and lawyers have been quietly talking , for the first time in decades , about settling a clutch of disputes over the Aegean Sea , or , if that is not possible , how to package them so that the two countries can ask the International Court of Justice at The Hague to adjudicate . 
  Yet Costas Simitis is under attack from all sides . A hard - left faction which re - elected Costas Simitis party leader at a Pasok congress last October wants to put off reforms needed to make Greece more competitive within the euro - zone . The trade unions , which overwhelmingly back Pasok , have forced Costas Simitis to water down proposed reforms of Greece 's state pension system . 
  Meanwhile , businessmen complain that the government is reneging on its promise to simplify and reduce taxes . Employers want looser labour rules . So do young Greeks , a good quarter of whom have no job ; all told , 11 % of Greeks are jobless . And people increasingly tell pollsters that they are fed up with having to bribe petty officials to get permits and licences . 
  Worse still , Costas Simitis has to keep potential successors within Pasok at bay . Costas Simitis has run the show for six years but is still keen to win a general election due early in 2004 so that Costas Simitis can host the Olympic Games in August . Leading Pasok people hint that the election will be held six months early , after Costas Simitis has presided over the EU in the first half of next year .

IT WAS the mistake that Mihalis Chrysohoidis, Greece's public-order minister, and teams of police from the United States and Britain had been waiting for. After 27 years and more than 20 assassinations of foreign diplomats, American servicemen and Greek businessmen, the N17 terrorist organisation (named after November 17th 1973 when a repressive military regime crushed a student revolt at Athens polytechnic university) slipped up. A bomb carried by Savas Xiros, a 40-year-old painter of religious icons, exploded prematurely on June 29th close to the offices of a Greek shipping company in Athens's port of Piraeus. 
Mr Xiros was seriously injured but survived. Six days after the explosion, a magistrate was questioning him in hospital. Forensic tests linked him to at least two crimes by N17: the killing of Costas Peratikos, a Greek shipowner in 1997; and a rocket attack against the home of Germany's ambassador to Greece in 1999, during the Kosovo war. 
The capture of Mr Xiros led to the discovery of two caches of weapons and documents fingering N17 in flats in residential districts of Athens. Greek investigators say they contained, among other incriminating evidence, some of the more than 300 anti-tank rockets stolen by N17 from an army base in northern Greece in 1989, a typewriter used to produce the group's early proclamations, and a red flag emblazoned with N17's logo, a five-pointed star. 
The breakthrough could not have come at a better time for Costas Simitis, Greece's pro-western Socialist prime minister. With anxieties mounting about security for the Olympic Games due to be held in Athens in 2004, Greece's failure to bring N17 to justice had been causing increasing embarrassment. Retired American diplomats had claimed that members of previous Socialist governments had obstructed anti-terrorist investigations.
N17 first struck in 1975, when it killed Richard Welch, the CIA station chief in Athens. For years the group's idiosyncratic mix of Marxism and nationalism struck a chord with a strongly anti-western segment of Greek public opinion. Few witnesses of N17 attacks ever spoke up. 
Recently, though, attitudes have changed. Since the group's last assassination--the drive-by shooting in June 2000 of Britain's defence attache--a team from Scotland Yard has been based in Athens. It has brought a methodical style of investigation that is new to Greece, from collection of material for DNA-testing to knocking on the doors of old-fashioned left-wingers. Privately the team gave itself two years to crack N17, a deadline that it seems to be meeting.
Public opinion has swung behind the investigators, thanks in part to Heather Saunders, the British attache's widow, and Nikos Peratikos, the late shipowner's brother, who launched a campaign to promote awareness of N17's victims. A new anti-terrorism law providing for trials in camera and witness-protection schemes was approved last year. As a result, more Greeks have been calling the anti-terrorist hotlines with information. For the first time, opinion polls show that most Greeks want the police to nail the terrorists. 
So far, so good. Mr Xiros, according to the police, is a senior member of N17, perhaps its head of operations. More than 150 people have been questioned since he blew himself up. A round of arrests is predicted over the next few weeks. But the group's ideological leaders, believed to be in their 60s, are still at large and probably living abroad. Until they are brought to book, Mr Simitis cannot claim to have crushed N17.

FEW Greeks feel the need for a thriller on the beach this summer. Pick up a newspaper or turn on the radio for the next instalment of real-time drama: the arrest--after 27 years when not one was caught-- of members of November 17, a terrorist gang blamed for 23 murders and dozens of bomb and rocket attacks in that time.
Since the first arrest on June 29th, the police have pulled in 15 alleged N17 members, including French-educated Alexandros Yotopoulos, its suspected leader, nabbed at his villa on an Aegean island. Raids on hide-outs have turned up arms and explosives, and diskettes detailing N17 bank accounts and plans for future targets--among them NATO convoys to Kosovo from Salonika, and facilities being built in Athens for the 2004 Olympics.
Costas Simitis, the Socialist prime minister, is relieved: concern had mounted over security for the Olympics. He even had a pat on the back from George Bush, who called the arrests an ""important contribution"" to the war on terror. And Mr Simitis's Pasok party, lagging the centre-right New Democracy party as local elections approach, has seen its ratings rise. 
Both parties are pushing the line that N17's members are more common criminals than terrorists. This ignores the nature of N17's victims (the first, in 1975, was the local CIA station chief), the long-winded ideological declarations it used to send to a leading newspaper after its attacks and the alleged role of Mr Yotopoulos. But with a general election expected late next year, the pretence suits both. Trials of N17 members are likely to start early next year and will last for months. Pasok, which used to have a Marxist charter, wants to distance itself from any reminder of its old beliefs; New Democracy wants no noisy left-right confrontation that might upset its chances of winning the election on the good old ideology of ""throw the rascals out"". 
Awkward questions remain. For the chattering classes, who rubbed shoulders with Mr Yotopoulos--under an alias--at fashionable cafes and gallery openings in Athens, the puzzle is how he avoided detection for over 20 years.

STAND on the penthouse roof of a warehouse in downtown Athens, recently transformed into a contemporary art gallery, and your senses will be assaulted by the feverish energy and wild contradictions of modern Greece at the start of its third century of existence. Among the nearby buildings on Sophocleous Street are some handsome neo-classical mansions which now house Greece's new class of investment bankers, stock analysts and bond traders. Also within view are edifices of similar style and vintage that are quietly decaying, their wooden shutters flapping in the breeze. Such buildings are often owned by quarrelsome extended families who find it cheaper to let their properties deteriorate than to comply with a government preservation order.
The horizon is still dominated by the Parthenon, newly endowed with splendid night lights and soon to be linked with the other antiquities of Athens in a four-kilometre-long archaeological park, as part of the city's preparations to display its old and new charms during the 2004 Olympics. But in the foreground there is a maze of narrow streets where exquisite Byzantine churches jostle for space with hundreds of tiny family businesses: spice merchants, icon-painting workshops and purveyors of mournful music brought by Greek refugees from Turkey. The pungent scent of the meat market, a favourite spot with nocturnal revellers, wafts upwards.
Despite the appearance of chaos, the quality of life in Athens has improved with the completion of a new metro line and the opening of a shiny new airport whose capacity vastly exceeds that of Hellinikon, the old airport that strained pilots' nerves on windy days. Within a few years a new highway around greater Athens will make it easier to travel north from the airport towards Salonika, or west towards Patras, without getting entangled in the capital. Further afield, the Peloponnese will be linked to central Greece by a bridge, and a new road from the Adriatic to the Turkish border will speed up east-west travel.
Which of the many trends at work in Greece, at once the most conservative and the most adaptable of European nations, will prove the strongest? The breezy exuberance of the new yuppie class, which despite the recent setback inflicted by sagging stockmarkets looks forward to the good times in the euro zone? Or the still baleful influence of a self-serving bureaucracy, whose clumsy regulations often force Greek citizens to behave deviously and irrationally? Will nationalist passions once again bedevil Greek relations with its neighbours, or will Greece fulfil its potential as the economic engine of south-eastern Europe?
For a country that stagnated throughout the 1980s and spent the 1990s fretting about the effects of war on its northern borders, Greece is enjoying much greater economic success than seemed likely even five years ago. This is both a cause and a reflection of its enhanced status in the European Union. Having shaken off its reputation as a laggard in the EU, it is now settling into a new role as a locomotive for the Balkans: the only country in south-eastern Europe that belongs to most of the world's smarter clubs, and an advocate for the region in the wider world.
All Greece's internal strains--between left and right, town and country, native and immigrant--have been eased by rapid economic growth, recently running at about 4% a year. In the words of Yannis Stournaras, chairman of the Commercial Bank of Greece and an architect of the country's euro-zone entry, ""There is no comparison between Greece today and 15 years ago,"" when profit was a dirty word, interest rates were regulated, industrialists felt beleaguered and labour was militant.
This survey will argue that Greece has made impressive progress towards putting its economy on the right track and improving its international image. But these achievements are fragile, and they owe something to good luck, as well as to factors that no politician ever planned, such as an influx of migrant labour over the past decade which has pushed Greece's population up by about 7% to 10.9m. Now that relative calm has descended on the former war zones of the Balkans, and relations with Turkey have eased, it is important for the moderate socialist government of Costas Simitis to consolidate Greece's achievements.
The country's internal stability has been helped by the apparent break-up of November 17, a group of ultra-radical terrorists who could claim, until this summer, to be Europe's most successful urban guerrillas. Over a period of 27 years, they had killed 23 people; among their targets were soldiers, intelligence officers and diplomats from America, Britain and Turkey, as well as prominent Greeks.
No more bazookas
But in early September, a militant leftist called Dimitris Koufodinas, often described as Greece's most wanted man, mysteriously appeared at an Athens police station and announced that November 17 was ""finished"". Over the previous ten weeks the authorities had hauled in 15 other suspects. A spate of revelations about pistols and bazookas stashed away in Athens apartments had turned the nightly television news into a keenly followed melodrama. 
For Mr Simitis, whose socialist party, Pasok, is trailing its conservative rival, New Democracy, in the opinion polls and will almost certainly lose ground in the municipal elections due on October 13th, the arrests were a boost to his credibility at home and abroad. And for Greece's western partners, the smashing of the terrorist group was not only welcome in itself, but also a good sign of a changing political culture. After the 1967-74 dictatorship of pro-American military officers, sections of Greece's political left retained a sneaking sympathy for political violence; but now the great majority of the population see November 17 as a group of common criminals. ""Democracy has crushed terrorism and instilled a sense of security into Greek society,"" Mr Simitis declared in his annual address on the state of the nation in Salonika last month. 
When voters go to the polls this Sunday to elect mayors and local councillors, they will pass their verdict on the financial and political stability for which Mr Simitis, with some justice, has claimed credit, and balance this against the rise in prices, the shortage of decent jobs and the losses many people suffered after risking their savings on the stock exchange. They will consider the fact that Mr Simitis himself is regarded--even by his opponents--as a paragon of honesty; and they will balance this against the persistence of corruption in high and low places all over Greece. 
Local elections aside, the next general election may be as far away as 2004. Whoever forms the next government will be leading a country better placed than ever before to cope with the challenges of an integrated Europe and a potentially turbulent region.

ALL of a sudden, the naughtiest pupil in the class is getting top marks. It wasn't that long ago, in 1990, when Jacques Delors, the then president of the European Commission, scolded Greece for mismanaging its economy and questioned its future in Europe. But now that economy is growing by more than twice the EU average, at a forecast 3.8% in 2002. 
This partly reflects a virtuous circle created by Greece qualifying to join the euro zone; interest rates have tumbled, and there is no longer any risk of devaluation or a sudden change in economic policy, which used to make business planning next to impossible. Cheaper credit has tempted more people to take out loans for houses or simply for buying things. Consumer spending this year is running at nearly 10% above last year's levels. Personal debt is still low by European standards, so no one is worrying--yet.
Less encouragingly, inflation is also well above the European average, at 3.5% in the year to end-August, though far below the double-digit figures of a decade ago. There is plenty of anecdotal evidence that the cost of small items has risen even faster since the beginning of this year because of rounding up of euro prices. In September, Greece's main consumer organisation proclaimed a shopping boycott to shame retailers who had used the euro to introduce sneaky price rises.
Unemployment has also remained stubbornly high, at 9.6% for the population as a whole and over 20% for those under 24. On the face of it, the combination of rapid immigration and a high jobless rate should lead to social tensions. But many newcomers to Greece do the kind of work at which locals turn up their noses, such as farm labouring or domestic service, so there is little competition for jobs between natives and migrants. A household in the provinces may have an unemployed 25-year-old son at home who is looking for a nice job in the public sector, and at the same time employ an Albanian or Bulgarian who does the hard physical labour on the family farm. 
One reason for the high jobless rate may be the collapse of public-sector patronage as a means of gaining favour with voters. With the utilities under pressure to balance their books, and ministries subjected to more fiscal discipline, politicians have less chance to dole out jobs to their friends. The earlier experience of Spain suggests that after a time of high growth and high unemployment, as some sectors modernise and others decline, the jobless rate will eventually fall; but until that happens, job-seekers with the wrong qualifications may have a tough time.
Twin pillars
The trouble is that the main engines of Greece's rapid growth are temporary. One is the EU structural aid that continues to cascade into the country, enriching the politically influential construction industry. This source of cash will tail off significantly after 2006, when the current funding programme runs out and the Union will have new members to worry about. The other, related, one is the vast amount of private and public money that is being spent on preparing Greece for the Olympic Games in just under two years' time.
Under the so-called Third Community Support Framework, a piece of Euro-jargon that trips easily off the tongue of many a Greek taverna-owner or village mayor these days, no less than euro27 billion, from a mixture of EU, Greek government and private sources, will be spent between now and 2006 on projects ranging from air-traffic control to motorways.
Although the management of these European funds has become more efficient since Greece's early days as a member of the European Community, there have been a number of embarrassing spats between the government in Athens and the European Commission. In one incident, funding that was supposed to assist the creation of a land registry had to be paid back because it was not properly used. The registry--a difficult project in a country where every stony field is the subject of a family argument or a tussle with the state--is at last being established, albeit more slowly than the bureaucrats in Brussels would like.
Until recently, Greek governments had a poor record for carrying out public works, which were often discussed for decades on end until the money mysteriously vanished. But in part because the Olympic Games are concentrating minds, it seems likely that the current building programme will have concrete results.
The old behemoths of the Greek public sector, long bedevilled by overmanning, political interference and poor administration, are getting a bit leaner and meaner, often through an injection of private capital. The state telecoms operator, OTE, used to be plagued by strikes and provided notoriously poor services. But at least until recently, OTE and its mobile-telephony offshoot, CosmOTE, have been among the best-performing telecom stocks on European bourses. The group has expanded its empire across the ex-communist states of the region, although with mixed financial results, and created opportunities for Intracom, the Greek electronics and digital-equipment group which is OTE's main supplier. Only a third of OTE remains in state hands, and some of its bolshiest union leaders have turned into sleek corporate executives.
But labour relations in Greece are still far from perfect. Last summer, strains in the socialist cabinet began to show as the interior ministry offered the civil servants' union a wage deal that was promptly over-ruled by the economy ministry. A strike by seamen, which could have disrupted the tourist season, was averted by a civil mobilisation order. Trade unionists were furious, but did not stage any big protests.
The best parts of Greek industry are of world class; the trouble is that they account for only a smallish sliver of national income. There are now Greek companies that control cement factories in Florida, bakeries in Russia and mines in China. The opening of passenger shipping to European competition will put some Greek owners on the spot, but the best of them have already looked ahead and are now ferrying travellers across the North Sea.
At the other extreme, the back streets of Athens and Salonika are home to thousands of small businesses that will be hard pressed to survive the full brunt of European competition. Some of them, indeed, live on the corruption and chaos of Greece's bureaucracy, and their disappearance would be a positive gain. The financial police say there are hundreds of businesses whose sole activity is to practise or abet some form of tax fraud. Some do nothing but issue and sell false invoices for imaginary services, which companies can use to keep down their paper profits; others make fraudulent demands for the reimbursement of value added tax.
Despite the continuing problems of bureaucracy and a dysfunctional legal system, ""This is, comparatively speaking, a great time for Greece,"" says Dimitri Papalexopoulos, managing director of the Titan cement company. Firms like Titan, whose manufacturing empire stretches from the eastern United States to Egypt, still face huge hurdles as they struggle to satisfy inspectors and obtain quarrying permits, but at least they can count on a more business-friendly political climate and stable interest and exchange rates.
Selling dreams
That stability also benefits tourism, which accounts for 15% of GDP. Unhelpfully, the industry is concentrated in certain regions, such as the islands of Rhodes, Corfu, Mykonos and Crete and the northern Halkidiki region. The economy in large parts of the Peloponnese, Epirus and Western Macedonia is still stagnating, even though these regions have huge potential to attract visitors who prefer scenery and wildlife to pools and discotheques.
Greek hoteliers can point to a long-term rise in the number and spending power of foreign visitors which might continue for a few more years. However, the management of the country's priceless tourist assets has been haphazard. There is a small number of luxury hotels, of which only a few have real character; at the other end of the scale, every connoisseur of Greece knows remote hideaways where visitors can live simply and blissfully. In-between there are thousands of dullish establishments whose owners seem to care more about catering to the mass market than about aesthetics or cuisine. Now that the euro has made comparisons easier, north Europeans will become more picky as they assess the value for money offered by Greece's traditional resorts. But if Greek hoteliers can diversify away from the standard beach offering into eco-tourism, bird-watching, hill-walking and so on, there is plenty of room for expansion.
Tourism is one of many sectors of the Greek economy where foreign investment has always been low, partly because of economic instability and partly because of bureaucratic obstacles. ""By entering the euro, we have dealt decisively with the first factor and now we are working to get rid of the second,"" says Nikos Christodoulakis, the economy minister, a British-trained academic and a pragmatic number-cruncher.
Among the problems Greece has yet to tackle are an urgent need to update company law; an excessively burdensome and complex tax code; and an arcane and badly functioning pension system, combined with a rapidly ageing population, which could bankrupt the state in the decades to come unless something is done. 
In September Mr Simitis announced tax breaks for individuals and families worth euro1.4 billion, and simpler company taxes and book-keeping obligations. A move in the right direction, said Ulysses Kyriacopoulos, head of the industrialists' association; the opposition, predictably, called for bolder measures, including a cut in the corporate tax rate. 
As for the pension problem, the government earlier this year made some tentative moves to reorganise the system, but had to retreat from radical reform under heavy pressure from unions and other lobbies. It will take huge political courage--or the threat of more wrath from Brussels--for a Greek government to grasp this nettle.

HOPE is a word not usually associated with talks about reunifying Cyprus. Since the Greek- and Turkish-Cypriot communities split up so violently when the Turkish army invaded the northern part of the island in 1974 to prevent enosis (union) with Greece after a coup plotted in Athens, dozens of UN envoys and western diplomats have tried--and failed miserably--to nail down a peace settlement acceptable to both Greeks and Turks. Until now, that is. This time, hope of a breakthrough is higher than ever. 
On November 11th, Kofi Annan, the UN's secretary-general, put forward a 136-page document with detailed proposals for reuniting Cyprus in a Swiss-style confederation of two ""component states"" loosely joined together as a ""common state"" under a presidency that would rotate every ten months. Politicians in Turkey, Greece and both parts of Cyprus have given it a cautious welcome. 
Now the UN is squeezing both Glafcos Clerides and Rauf Denktash, the aged Greek- and Turkish-Cypriot leaders, to sign at least a framework agreement before December 12th, when European Union leaders are expected to approve the entry of ten new countries, including Cyprus, into the EU club. Mr Annan wants a definite go-ahead from both the top Cypriots as early as November 18th in order to start negotiations immediately. All being well, details would be hammered out by February; both lots of Cypriots would hold separate referendums to approve the settlement in March; and the EU would admit a reunited Cyprus, not just the Greek-Cypriot south, at the beginning of 2004. 
This timetable may be too ambitious. Mr Clerides thinks it will take his lawyers more than a week to trawl through the plan; Mr Denktash is in New York, recovering from a heart operation and unable to work more than a few hours a day. In the coffee-shop tradition of Cypriot politics, building a consensus, even if the climate is more or less favourable, always requires more meetings and argument galore. 
The Greek Cypriots, who made up four-fifths of the island's population in 1974, have made concessions over the constitution for the sake of getting back a good chunk of territory. The Turks' share of the island would go down from its present 36% to 28.5%; the Greeks would get back part of the citrus-growing district of Morphou, the coastal town of Varosha and its derelict high-rise beach hotels built in the early 1970s, and part of the unspoiled Karpas peninsula, much coveted by Greek-Cypriot tourist developers. About 85,000 out of some 200,000 Greek Cypriots forced from their homes in the north in 1974 would be able to return to areas that would again come under a Greek-Cypriot administration, probably a big enough number for Mr Clerides to win backing in a referendum. 
The UN's legal draftsmen have been creative. They seem to have got round old sticking points such as Mr Denktash's demand that his northern fief be recognised as a sovereign state and the Greek Cypriots' insistence on a federation rather than a looser confederation. Even after a settlement, according to the UN plan, the two communities would still live apart and run their own affairs in their component states, with separate police and courts. 
Moreover, Cyprus would be demilitarised and banned from buying weapons. The UN peacekeeping force which was sent to the island in 1963 after an early bout of intercommunal violence and which, since 1974, has overseen a buffer zone known as ""the green line"" that separates Greek and Turkish Cypriots, would stay on indefinitely. But it would be bolstered by Greek and Turkish soldiers. Three of the nine judges on the common state's supreme court would be foreign. 
But new sticking points may well pop up. Some Turkish Cypriots will be loth to hand back property they have occupied for almost a generation. Greek Cypriots dislike the idea of any Turkish forces remaining on the island and particularly resent the presence, which may apparently continue, of some 100,000 mainland Turks who have settled since 1974, as indigenous Turkish Cypriots emigrated in droves from Mr Denktash's self-declared republic, mainly to Istanbul, Turkey's commercial capital, and to London. 
Would the new common state be viable? It would have many trappings of nationhood, with a two-chamber parliament, an independent central bank, a ministry to handle foreign affairs and a separate one to deal with the EU (each with a minister from a different community). Both Cypriot leaders will be urged by the leaders of their parent states to accept the deal. The Americans are also pressing Greece and Turkey to seize what looks like an unprecedented chance. Turkey's government-in-waiting appears eager to make a fresh effort over Cyprus. There has even been talk in Ankara of letting another negotiator replace Mr Denktash if his convalescence is slow. In Athens, Costas Simitis, the moderate Socialist prime minister, wants to speed up a rapprochement with Turkey during Greece's six-month EU presidency which starts in January. 
If they accept the UN plan, Messrs Denktash and Clerides would have an option to stay on as the common state's co-presidents for three years. They might be candidates for a joint Nobel peace prize. Enough to persuade them to cut a deal? 
In the past, the answer has plainly been no. But the change of guard in Ankara, Mr Denktash's illness, renewed goodwill and tighter-than-ever deadlines all suggest that there is at least a fair possibility.","Rarely have there been higher hopes for a settlement in Cyprus

AFTER Denmark's successful six-month stint in the European Union's chair, Greece's prime minister, Costas Simitis, is keen to do as well. Under his aegis, Greece has overcome its reputation as the EU's unruly teenager. At last month's Copenhagen summit he dropped his caution about Turkey, energetically backing Turkish efforts to secure a firm date for accession talks.
His big opportunity will be the ceremony in Athens on April 16th, when the EU's ten prospective new members are due to sign their accession treaties. Greece will try hard to ensure that the ten include a soon-to-be reunified Cyprus, not just, de facto, the Greek-Cypriot half. The United Nations is squeezing the rival Cypriots to reach at least a framework agreement on a form of unity by February 28th. 
Mr Simitis cannot put domestic politics on hold. He has taken personal responsibility for the success of the Athens Olympic games in August 2004, a time-consuming chore thanks to infighting among organisers and delays in building new sports and media facilities. He also has to fend off George Papandreou, the foreign minister and front-runner to succeed him as Socialist party leader, who sees the EU presidency as a chance to promote his own prime-ministerial ambitions. 
Mr Papandreou is already pushing for a shift in the EU's approach to immigration that would enable young people from poor Balkan countries like Albania to get seasonal work permits rather than simply slide into the EU illegally. EU diplomats fear that the Greeks, already short of top-class civil servants able to cope with the demands of EU work, will be side-tracked from getting on with duller, nuts-and-bolts issues. And Mr Simitis's installation of one of his own men, Tassos Yannitsis, as European-affairs minister, to contain the foreign ministry, may lead to confusion.
Mr Simitis may also face real problems if the Americans attack Iraq. The EU has no true foreign policy, and a two-headed foreign-policy machine. At home, fears that tens of thousands of Iraqi refugees could turn up on Greece's shores may strengthen an expected wave of anti-American feeling. Mr Simitis had trouble controlling the hard left of his party during NATO's bombardment of Yugoslavia in 1999, when daily demonstrations were held outside the American embassy in Athens. A similar sustained outcry over Iraq could ruin his dream of a smooth EU presidency.","Costas Simitis's has high hopes for its EU presidency but faces big problems

 Mr Papandreou is already pushing for a shift in the EU 's approach to immigration that would enable young people from poor Balkan countries like Albania to get seasonal work permits rather than simply slide into the EU illegally . EU diplomats fear that the Greeks , already short of top - class civil servants able to cope with the demands of EU work , will be side - tracked from getting on with duller , nuts - and - bolts issues . And Costas Simitis's installation of one of Costas Simitis's own men , Tassos Yannitsis , as European - affairs minister , to contain the foreign ministry , may lead to confusion . 
 Costas Simitis may also face real problems if the Americans attack Iraq . The EU has no true foreign policy , and a two - headed foreign - policy machine . At home , fears that tens of thousands of Iraqi refugees could turn up on Greece 's shores may strengthen an expected wave of anti - American feeling . Costas Simitis had trouble controlling the hard left of Costas Simitis's party during NATO 's bombardment of Yugoslavia in 1999 , when daily demonstrations were held outside the American embassy in Athens . A similar sustained outcry over Iraq could ruin Costas Simitis's dream of a smooth EU presidency .",350,Greece,A29-5314,IN TERM,True,"Greece 's prime minister , Costas Simitis ,",16,True

Jubilant Iraqis thronged the war-torn streets of Baghdad to celebrate the demise of the regime of Saddam Hussein. American troops surrounding the Iraqi capital swiftly followed tentative pushes into the city with a large-scale assault that met with sporadic resistance from Iraqi forces. British troops also moved into Basra, Iraq's second city. Iraqis greeted the crumbling of Saddam's rule with widespread looting. 
Saddam's whereabouts remained a mystery. An American bomber destroyed a restaurant in a middle-class suburb of Baghdad after intelligence reports suggested that Iraq's leader and other senior figures were meeting there. Later reports suggested that he might have escaped with moments to spare. On Thursday he was rumoured to be surrounded in a Baghdad mosque.
British forces claimed to have killed ""Chemical Ali"" Hassan al-Majid, a senior member of the regime responsible for the defence of southern Iraq. In the 1980s he led the ""Anfal"" campaign against the Kurds of Iraq, razing hundreds of villages and killing at least 100,000.
America suffered light casualties in the assault on Baghdad but the toll of dead and injured among Iraqi civilians and fighters was said to number in the thousands. Baghdad's hospitals struggled to treat the injured. Three journalists were killed and others injured after coming under fire from American tanks.
American special forces and Kurdish fighters closed in on Iraqi forces in the north, and entered the city of Kirkuk. 
Tony Blair and George Bush, meeting in Northern Ireland to discuss post-war Iraq, pledged a ""vital"" role for the United Nations in transforming the country into a democracy. The leaders of Russia, France and Germany, the main opponents of the war, were due to meet in St Petersburg to discuss Jacques Chirac's view that the UN alone should take charge in Iraq.
A tape supposedly recorded by Osama bin Laden was released in which the leader of al-Qaeda urged Muslims to attack governments supporting the war in Iraq. 
Checking the deadly spread
Malaysia banned tourists from mainland China, in an effort to stop the spread of SARS, a pneumonia-type disease. The Philippines said it would discourage travel to Hong Kong. The virus has killed more than 100 people. Although the number is relatively small, doctors are worried because the virus is new and has a death rate of nearly 4%.
Eleven Afghan civilians were killed when an American bomb went astray and landed on a house in the outskirts of Shkin, in eastern Afghanistan. The bomb was intended for rebel forces who were attacking an Afghan government checkpoint.
The United States said it planned to move its garrison in central Seoul to a less conspicuous site outside the capital. Fifty years after the end of the Korean war, some South Koreans object to the presence of 37,000 American troops in their country.
Scientists in America cloned a banteng, a wild cow becoming rare in Java and elsewhere in South-East Asia. They aim to show that cloning can help to save an endangered species. 
Burning issue
America's Supreme Court upheld a Virginia law which bans the burning of crosses. Because of cross-burning's history as a ""particularly virulent form of intimidation"" against blacks, the ban does not violate the First Amendment's protection of free speech, the court ruled.
The number of Americans in prison exceeded 2m last year, according to a new Justice Department report. This means that one person in every 142 is in the slammer at any one time. America's jail population--the world's largest--has nearly doubled since 1990.
Carnage in Congo
Congo adopted a new constitution, after peace talks in South Africa. But the UN reported a new massacre, of nearly 1,000 people, in the gold-rich Ituri district. And a new estimate put the death toll from the country's five-year civil war at between 3m and 4.7m.
Foreign direct investment yielded higher returns in sub-Saharan Africa last year than in any other region, the World Bank said. This was perhaps because ""given perceived higher risks in the region, investors chose only high-return projects.""

HAS the war in Iraq turned Costas Simitis, Greece's usually cool-headed prime minister, who is also the European Union's president for the first half of this year, into a noisy populist? In a televised speech to his Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok), he said that by waging war America and Britain were trying to undermine the EU. ""Those fighting the war don't want to see progress in unifying Europe. They want it to weaken,"" he said.
Once a professor at a German university, Mr Simitis used to scorn the anti-American conspiracy theories many Greeks like to invent. Colin Powell, the American secretary of state, has praised Greece's efforts to forge a common EU position on Iraq. Mr Simitis gave permission for American military aircraft to fly over Greece on their way to bomb Baghdad. The Americans also have access to a NATO military base on the Greek island of Crete. 
But about 90% of Greeks, according to opinion polls, are against the war, including the unruly barons in Mr Simitis's party. Pasok consistently trails behind the conservative New Democracy party by around eight percentage points, and a general election is less than a year away. Costas Laliotis, Pasok's tough-talking secretary-general, has told public-sector trade unionists that they are free to take to the streets in protest against America. Teachers at state schools have cancelled classes and joined demonstrations, encouraging their seven-year-old pupils to chant ""American murderers"". A statue of President Harry Truman, erected in gratitude for the American Marshall Plan funds that helped to rebuild Greece after the second world war, has been covered in packaging marked ""Return to sender"".
The demonstrations also help divert attention from Pasok's own problems. Inflation is on the rise, exceeding an annual rate of 4% last month, and the flow of EU funds that puts money into the pockets of Greek contractors and computer companies has slowed as the European Commission imposes tighter accounting controls. Embarrassingly, several sections of EU-financed highway in southern Greece collapsed during a wintry spell in February because of poor workmanship; questions are being asked about the way the contracts were awarded. Now a cold snap has damaged this summer's fruit crop: farmers are demanding compensation.
Greece will be in the spotlight on April 16th, when the EU's leaders and those of the prospective new members are to gather in Athens for a treaty-signing ceremony. It should be a glittering event, staged, to show off Greece as democracy's cradle, in a classical-era building, the Stoa of Attalos, which has been restored to its former glory by American archaeologists and philanthropists. Mr Simitis has declared a public holiday to mark the occasion, partly because security measures will block access to the city centre. Will he stop Mr Laliotis from drafting civil servants, teachers and schoolchildren for the mother of all anti-American protests?

EVERY year now the United States and the European Union hold a summit. It used to be every six months, but George Bush seems to have stopped that. Why get together just to produce a lot of happy-clappy bromides about how the United States and Europe are ""working together to solve the problems of the world""? 
One beauty of this week's summit in Washington, DC, was that these bromides should have been impossible to utter. In the wake of the rift over Iraq, transatlantic relations are arguably at their lowest point since the second world war. Americans are still refusing to buy French wine. European newspapers are still portraying the United States as a rogue nation. And at least one senior French minister is still telling his fellow diplomats that the only thing that Americans know how to do is shoot. 
So there was something rather magnificent in the way that Costas Simitis, the Greek prime minister and current president of the European Union, and Romano Prodi, the president of the European Commission, held the line at their press conference. Mr Prodi declared ingeniously that it was ""a very good meeting because it was a very good meeting atmosphere"" before meditating on the virtues of old age. CNN terminated its coverage as soon as it decently could, leaving Americans to ponder another eternal mystery: how could the EU send such extraordinarily boring leaders to the home of the remote control?
Yet behind the scenes both American and European officials were billing the summit as an important piece of repair work. The western alliance is beginning to see eye to eye on what some Americans call ""the new security environment"" of rogue states, terrorist networks and weapons of mass destruction.
Better than it looks
The most obvious signs of this progress are various new agreements to speed up the extradition of terrorists and improve the investigation of suspect bank accounts. The Americans, who have long whinged about the EU's failure to tackle weapons of mass destruction, were pleasantly surprised by Europe's tougher approach to Iran. The Europeans are willing to scrap a proposed trade deal with Iran if it does not accept inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Of course, the Europeans continue to be much keener on fighting the war against terrorism through diplomacy and multilateral institutions than the Americans. And they are also balking at Mr Bush's insistence that they declare Hamas a terrorist organisation. But Mr Bush's people think some recent soul-searching in the EU is leading to a tougher approach.
Last week EU foreign ministers agreed that the use of force to deal with weapons of mass destruction could be envisaged when diplomacy fails. A tough new EU paper on security does not read as if it was written by complacent inhabitants of a ""post-historical paradise""--to use the term for Europe coined by one neo-conservative, Robert Kagan. In Washington, Javier Solana, the EU's foreign policy co-ordinator and a former head of NATO, is increasingly seen as hawkish--or as tough as a bearded Spanish socialist can be.
On the economic side of the relationship, there was also good news to report. The summiteers unveiled an ""open-skies"" agreement to free up flying between the two continents. There was talk of progress on trade. Pascal Lamy and Robert Zoellick, the top European and American trade negotiators, get on much better than Charlene Barshefsky and Leon Brittan did in the Clinton era, and their good relationship has survived serious blows, such as America's decision to impose steel tariffs. Philip Gordon of the Brookings Institution points out that one encouraging message of the summit is that business does go on.
But clouds are gathering. It remains to be seen how Europe's new deal on the common agricultural policy will affect the Doha trade round. Meanwhile, Europe continues to stand by its 1998 moratorium on the import of genetically modified food--a moratorium that supposedly costs American farmers $300m a year in lost corn exports alone. 
Mr Bush is off to Africa next month where he will probably argue that Europe's hostility to GM food is helping to worsen famine. And there are no signs that the administration will withdraw the suit against the Europeans' GM-food ban at the WTO. The next set of rows--and of bromides at summits--could be about economics, not politics.

FLUSHED with self-confidence after Greece's competent six-month stint in the EU presidency, Costas Simitis, the prime minister, has decided it is time to clean up the governing Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement (known as Pasok) and make it more ""European"". With a bright new social-democratic image, the party just might win next April's election, so ensuring that Mr Simitis is the one to welcome the world's sporting elite to next summer's Olympic games in Athens. 
His first move was to sack Costas Laliotis, Pasok's secretary-general and a symbol of its outdated populist ways. Mr Laliotis was unpopular with many Greeks because of his cosiness with a group of local building contractors (he served a long stretch as public-works minister) and his diehard anti-Americanism. During the war in Iraq he encouraged the teachers' union to stay off work and take primary-school pupils to shout ""American murderers"" at demonstrations.
Michalis Chrysohoidis, one of the prime minister's modernising faction, has taken Mr Laliotis's job. As public order minister, he took credit, together with Scotland Yard and the FBI, for the arrest last year of some 20 members of a left-wing terrorist group called November 17, whose victims included one British and several American and Turkish diplomats.
Mr Chrysohoidis will still have his work cut out to persuade voters that Pasok is abandoning its knee-jerk nationalism and its deeply entrenched system of patronage. Party strongmen control most public-sector appointments, from university professors and hospital directors to local government officials and even football referees. Businessmen who deal with state enterprises say corruption is still rife. 
In opinion polls Pasok trails New Democracy, the centre-right opposition, by some nine percentage points. But Mr Simitis is still the party's biggest asset. His popularity, though well below its peak three years ago when he steered Greece into the eurozone, is not far behind that of Costas Karamanlis, New Democracy's leader.
To win back the middle-of-the-road voters who decide Greek elections, Mr Simitis is to launch a ""social convergence charter"" underlining, among other things, his intention to reduce unemployment and make the civil service more honest and efficient--two top priorities for voters.
This week Mr Simitis announced that Pasok's MPs could no longer hold shares in offshore companies, a favourite tax dodge for the politically connected. The Athens stock-exchange watchdog will also scrutinise MPs' brokerage accounts, a measure meant to remove a popular perception that influential Pasok people manipulated the bourse in the boom that preceded Greece's entry into the eurozone. 
Has Mr Simitis done enough to reassure Greeks that Pasok is truly changing its ways? Only if he can deliver results. One minister, Stefanos Manikas, was sacked last month over the stock-market scandal. But more resignations (and prosecutions too) will be needed to persuade voters that a clean-up is really under way.

MOST Greek politicians still believe a burst of pre-election spending is the best way to win over wavering voters. In spite of his modernising European leanings, Costas Simitis, the prime minister, is no exception. What is new is his timing.
A general election is not due until April next year, but Mr Simitis's Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement, better known as Pasok, is already campaigning as if it were imminent. First Mr Simitis announced a welfare package costing euro2.3 billion ($2.6 billion) to appeal to grumpy pensioners, farmers and women who have difficulty finding jobs. Then, on September 10th, he launched a ""convergence charter"". Making a rare appearance live on television, he brandished a glossy handbook packed with details of Pasok's plans to raise Greek incomes from their present 70% of the European Union's average to 80% by 2008. 
The charter has something for everyone: lower taxes for businesses and high earners, less spending on defence (now that Greece is on friendlier terms with its old enemy, Turkey) and more on education, pensions, training and job creation. Such plans would probably cost some euro7.7 billion to carry out. Cutting unemployment from 8.9% to 6% is a priority, says Mr Simitis. His government will even subsidise rents for families willing to move to places where there are more jobs. 
The plan optimistically banks on the economy's continuing to grow by around 4% a year, even when next August's Olympic games are over and the current stream of hand-outs from Brussels slows to a trickle, as funds are diverted to poorer new EU members from central Europe. Moreover, inward investment remains small (Libya got more last year), largely because of red tape and officials wanting bribes.
Pollsters say about 20% of Greek voters are floaters who make up their minds only a few weeks before polling day. Still, Mr Simitis's early start may pay off. The first poll published after the unveiling of his convergence charter suggested it had gone down well. Pasok was trailing New Democracy, the right-of-centre opposition, by just under seven percentage points, against almost ten early this year. 
Pasok has other ways to win people back. Michalis Chrysohoides, its new secretary-general, is trying to give the party a fresh look. Its die-hard Marxists and its nationalist faction are being shunted aside in favour of younger candidates with a softer, social-democratic image. Mr Simitis will appear more often on television, cutting ribbons around Athens as sports venues for the Olympics and more sections of a motorway are opened. 
Will it work? After holding power for 19 of the past 22 years, Pasok may be due for a spell in opposition. Many of its old guard are unpopular, but Mr Simitis is still considered a safe pair of hands. Voters may be wary of switching just before the Olympics, which are seen as a test of Greece's credentials as a serious player in Europe. 
Costas Karamanlis, the New Democracy leader, and his team are better than they used to be at picking holes in Pasok's grandiose schemes. But the latest announcements have thrown them into disarray. Six months ago they were expecting Pasok to fall, as one adviser put it, like a ripe fruit from the tree. Now Mr Simitis has offered a few plums of his own.","Can Costas Simitis's hold on to power ?

The American administration said it would not lift economic sanctions against Libya yet, though it recently praised Muammar Qaddafi after he admitted that his government had secretly been trying to make weapons of mass destruction and promised to stop doing so. In response, the Libyans said they might delay paying compensation to victims of the Pan Am flight which was blown up over Lockerbie in 1988 by Libyan agents, killing 270 people. 
The American-led government in Iraq said it would set free 506 Iraqis, about 100 of them immediately. Most have been in captivity since the end of the conventional war in May last year.
Hosni Mubarak, Egypt's president, tried to squash speculation by explicitly denying that he wants his son, Gamal, to succeed him.
An Egyptian charter flight crashed into the Red Sea, killing all 148 on board, mostly French tourists. Foul play was not suspected. 
Syria's president, Bashar Assad, said that he wanted to co-operate with the United States and reopen dicussions with Israel, but he refused to condemn Palestinian suicide bombers. 
By agreeing on a formula for sharing the country's oil wealth, Sudan's government and its main rebel opposition, the Sudan People's Liberation Army, took a big step towards a formal peace pact and the establishment of a government of national unity. But a separate civil war continues in the region of Darfur, in the west.
Shops stopped accepting cheques from six of Zimbabwe's commercial banks, fuelling fears that hyperinflation and political interference have pushed the country's financial system close to collapse. 
Rebels in Cote d'Ivoire rejoined the country's power-sharing cabinet, which they had stomped out of last year, accusing the government of violating the terms of a ceasefire pact.
Border patrol
President George Bush announced plans to reform America's immigration laws. These include giving legal status to up to 12m undocumented workers, around half of whom are Mexican. Meanwhile, a new visa-entry system was introduced at airports and seaports, using biometric technology to ""fingerprint"" most foreign visitors.
A federal panel of judges upheld Texas's controversial congressional-redistricting plan, said to favour Republicans unduly. Meanwhile, Ralph Hall, a Democratic congressman for 23 years, switched sides and joined the Republicans. 
Howard Dean, the Democrats' presidential front-runner, lost much of his lead to Wesley Clark. One poll showed him just four points ahead, down from a peak of 21 points. But Mr Dean was endorsed by Bill Bradley, a former New Jersey senator who unsuccessfully challenged Al Gore in the Democratic primaries in 2000. 
A memorial was chosen for the World Trade Centre. The ""Reflecting Absence"" will place two pools on the site of the twin towers surrounded by a wall and bear the names of the 2,752 people who died there on September 11th.
Rule of law
As expected, Mikhail Saakashvili won Georgia's presidential election by a landslide. Mr Saakashvili, a young American-educated lawyer, had led the wave of protests that forced his predecessor, Edward Shevardnadze, to resign last November.
European Commission lawyers advised that European finance ministers had broken the law last November when they suspended proceedings under the stability and growth pact against France and Germany for running excessive budget deficits. The commission will now consider whether to haul member governments before the European Court of Justice, though it has recently lost several high-profile cases there.
Greece's prime minister, Costas Simitis, confirmed that he would resign as leader of the Socialist Party ahead of elections in early March. His hope is that his probable successor, George Papandreou, who is now foreign minister, may snatch victory in the elections. The Socialists trail the opposition New Democrats in opinion polls.

GEORGE PAPANDREOU appears to sail through life with remarkable calmness. Whether galvanising the faithful at noisy rallies, or parleying with Brussels and Washington from remote Greek villages, the foreign minister--and leader-designate of the ruling socialist party--looks cool and unruffled.
And yet he has reason not to be. The polls suggest that his Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok), which has been in power for 19 of the past 22 years, will lose the election on March 7th. So far, the Papandreou effect--the fact that many voters like the man more than his party--has not sufficed to reverse the opposition's lead.
Admittedly, the edge enjoyed by New Democracy, the centre-right opposition party, plunged to 2 points after it emerged earlier this month that Mr Papandreou, not Costas Simitis, the prime minister, would lead Pasok into battle. But Mr Papandreou's halcyon phase proved short-lived. New Democracy's lead widened again as details emerged of a sleazy affair that seemed to epitomise the sharp practices that Pasok has failed to uproot.
The opposition sniffed blood after a deputy economy minister, Christos Pachtas, used a quiet parliamentary moment to push through an amendment to allow holiday homes to be built on sensitive coastal land in northern Greece. When it became obvious that this move was an ugly piece of cronyism, it was denounced by Pasok's leaders, and the guilty were held to account. Mr Pachtas resigned in disgrace, and he and nine other deputies who backed the amendment have been excluded from the election. Fresh legislation will reverse the concession to developers; but the electoral fall-out could still be felt.
Mr Papandreou has also had to react nimbly to an acceleration of diplomatic moves over Cyprus, which could make or break the Greek-Turkish rapprochement that is his biggest achievement as foreign minister. A month ago, the Greek side of the Cyprus conundrum was basking in moral authority, after the UN had blamed the Turkish-Cypriot leader, Rauf Denktash, for wrecking its latest bid to reunify the island; and the Greek-Cypriot government was looking forward to joining the European Union--and hence to a surge in its bargaining power--on May 1st.
But on January 24th, the Turkish side deftly regained the initiative by calling for a fresh round of negotiations, using the UN plan as a ""reference point"", not a blueprint, and floating the idea of an early referendum on some bits of a settlement. To any Greek politician, especially one in the throes of an electoral contest, that sounds like a trap. For it may mean locking in concessions that are painful to the Greek-Cypriots--sharing power and money with their Turkish neighbours--with no promise of the demilitarisation or internal boundary adjustment that the Greeks most keenly desire.
In all this Mr Papandreou's gifts, including the use of his personal authority to break the foreign-policy mould, will be tested to the limit. A soft-spoken consensus-builder, he has never built a power base in Pasok, relying instead on name recognition as the son of a populist prime minister, Andreas Papandreou. Politics is a family business in Greece: Costas Karamanlis, the New Democracy leader, is the nephew and namesake of a respected prime minister, and even reformers seem to find that the dynastic factor still counts.
Born in America and educated in Sweden and Britain, Mr Papandreou sounds kinder and gentler than many Greek politicians, including his late father. After Mr Simitis, nicknamed ""the book-keeper"" because of his interest in financial minutiae, Mr Papandreou's Clintonian style--with his talk of social inclusiveness, and the folksy electronic diary that he posts on the web--makes a welcome change to Greeks.
Yet both election rivals still need to find answers to problems that Mr Simitis has failed to solve: creating more jobs, tackling corruption and removing bureaucratic hurdles that deter foreign investors. Although the stadiums are close to completion, the Athens Olympics in August will be a big challenge for the election winner. Organisers fret about putting the security measures demanded by American and British advisers in place in time. The games could exceed their euro4.6 billion ($5.8 billion) budget by a wide margin, say bankers in Athens. Mr Papandreou may yet defy the polls--but whoever takes power in March will find his in-tray overflowing.

New Democracy 's lead widened again as details emerged of a sleazy affair that seemed to epitomise the sharp practices that Pasok has failed to uproot . 
 The opposition sniffed blood after a deputy economy minister , Christos Pachtas , used a quiet parliamentary moment to push through an amendment to allow holiday homes to be built on sensitive coastal land in northern Greece . When it became obvious that this move was an ugly piece of cronyism , it was denounced by Pasok 's leaders , and the guilty were held to account . Mr Pachtas resigned in disgrace , and he and nine other deputies who backed the amendment have been excluded from the election . Fresh legislation will reverse the concession to developers ; but the electoral fall - out could still be felt . 
 Mr Papandreou has also had to react nimbly to an acceleration of diplomatic moves over Cyprus , which could make or break the Greek - Turkish rapprochement that is his biggest achievement as foreign minister . A month ago , the Greek side of the Cyprus conundrum was basking in moral authority , after the UN had blamed the Turkish - Cypriot leader , Rauf Denktash , for wrecking its latest bid to reunify the island ; and the Greek - Cypriot government was looking forward to joining the European Union -- and hence to a surge in its bargaining power -- on May 1st . 
 But on January 24th , the Turkish side deftly regained the initiative by calling for a fresh round of negotiations , using the UN plan as a "" reference point "" , not a blueprint , and floating the idea of an early referendum on some bits of a settlement . To any Greek politician , especially one in the throes of an electoral contest , that sounds like a trap . For it may mean locking in concessions that are painful to the Greek - Cypriots -- sharing power and money with their Turkish neighbours -- with no promise of the demilitarisation or internal boundary adjustment that the Greeks most keenly desire . 
 In all this Mr Papandreou 's gifts , including the use of his personal authority to break the foreign - policy mould , will be tested to the limit . A soft - spoken consensus - builder , he has never built a power base in Pasok , relying instead on name recognition as the son of a populist prime minister , Andreas Papandreou . Politics is a family business in Greece : Costas Karamanlis , the New Democracy leader , is the nephew and namesake of a respected prime minister , and even reformers seem to find that the dynastic factor still counts . 
 Born in America and educated in Sweden and Britain , Mr Papandreou sounds kinder and gentler than many Greek politicians , including his late father . After Costas Simitis's , Mr Papandreou 's Clintonian style -- with his talk of social inclusiveness , and the folksy electronic diary that he posts on the web -- makes a welcome change to Greeks . 
 Yet both election rivals still need to find answers to problems that Costas Simitis has failed to solve : creating more jobs , tackling corruption and removing bureaucratic hurdles that deter foreign investors . Although the stadiums are close to completion , the Athens Olympics in August will be a big challenge for the election winner . Organisers fret about putting the security measures demanded by American and British advisers in place in time . The games could exceed their euro4.6 billion ( $ 5.8 billion ) budget by a wide margin , say bankers in Athens . Mr Papandreou may yet defy the polls -- but whoever takes power in March will find his in - tray overflowing .

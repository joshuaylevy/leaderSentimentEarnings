But Norway's Labour candidate for prime minister, Jens Stoltenberg, who has had the job for only a few weeks, already looks much closer to achieving the goal of power than does Bo Lundgren, the Swede who has led his country's rightish Moderates in opposition since Carl Bildt stepped down last autumn. 
Mr Stoltenberg is seeking to be Norway's answer to Tony Blair. At 40, he is able, goodlooking, modem-minded, media-friendly and keen to get Norway into the European Union. (He also happens to be the son of a former foreign minister.) Last month he replaced the rather staid Thorbjorn jagland as Labour's candidate for prime minister, though not yet as party leader. The opinion polls quickly surged by seven points, giving Labour a sturdy 38%, against 16% for Norway's ever shakier three-party coalition govemment led by a sometimes glum clergyman, Kjell Magne Bondevik, and his Christian People's Party. Women voters, especially, are said to like Mr Stoltenberg. 
An acrimonious television debate this week between Messrs Stoltenberg and Bondevik on the country's use of energy foreshadows a parliamentary one, due next week, on the same topic. It may become a vote of confidence, which might even push the government over. Mr Stoltenberg would then be odds-on for prime minister. 
Mr Lundgren's outlook is a lot less chirpy. Since taking over from the sharpedged Mr Bildt, he has struggled to make an impact. Chosen as a safe pair of hands ahead of two younger women, Chris Heister and Gunilla Carlsson (a lively Euro-MP), Mr Lundgren, long a close colleague of Mr Bildt, comes over as wooden. 
Besides, it is his bad luck that there are no clear issues on which to confront the coalition government led by Goran Persson and his Social Democrats, who have kept their Green and ex-communist partners under control while overseeing an economy that grew last year by more than 3.5%. The Moderates have long been more Europeminded than the Social Democrats and think Sweden should join the euro; but the Social Democrats now seem to be edging cautiously in the same direction. The latest opinion polls have about 44% of Swedes in favour, and 39% against. 
Recently, Mr Lundgren criticised Mr Persson for too hastily-as he saw it-joining Sweden's fellow EU countries in trying to isolate Austria when J6rg Haider's Freedom Party joined its government. But this is hardly an election-winning view. 
The most daring of Scandinavia's rightwingers these da is perhaps Norway's PerKristian Foss, a youthful leader of the Conservatives, which is the country's secondlargest opposition party, After Mr Foss declared himself to be homosexual, he easily won election earlier this year as party boss in Oslo, the capital. Now some Norwegian pundits think that he could become the party's next national leader. ","TWO new would - be leaders in Norway and Sweden are trying to put the jitters into their governments .

To the south-east of the European Union, Greece has formally applied to join the single-money club. At the other side of the continent, the Danish government has set a date for a referendum on the matter. The latest opinion polls suggest the Danes, twitchy as they have been on questions of sovereignty, will probably say yes. The Swedes, though less enthusiastic, are edging towards taking up the new money-and will feel obliged to move faster if the Danes do go in. Even the stay-away Norwegians, much farther back in the queue, may again, now that they have a new government of the centre-left, start thinking about joining the EU. 
The Greeks are most likely to take up the euro soonest. Greece was the only EU MeMber that sought to join the currency but was barred from its launch a year ago because it failed to meet the criteria laid out at Maastricht in 1991. in the past few years, however, under Costas Simitis's modernising centreleft government, Greece has been catching up fast. Tax collection has become far more efficient, thanks partly to computerising the system. Bond trading has been modernised. Spending as a proportion Of GDP is steady. As a result, inflation has fallen sharply, and the public debt and budget deficit have dropped to EU-respectable levels. The figures, broadly speaking, are good. 
Still, a lot has to be done if Greece is to prosper within the euro zone. Telecoms, energy and shipping need liberalising. But such things have a fair chance of being done because joining the euro remains so popular. Nearly three-quarters of Greeks, according to pollsters, want it. And even if the Socialists were to lose the general election due on April 9th, which looks unlikely, the momentum for joining would probably be sustained. if its fellow EU countries, Europe's Central Bank and the European Parliament approve, Greece could be in the euro next year. 
Denmark is the next keenest of the outsiders,but the government must persuade its own people before applying to join. The country's Social Democratic prime minister, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, has marked down September 28th for a referendum. Most political parties, trade unions, businessmen and bankers are with him. Having the euro would protect jobs and win back Danish influence in Europe, he argues. 
But Danish europhiles will have a fight on their hands. Pollsters put opponents of the euro almost on a par with the pros; a large minority is wavering. The doubters fear that the euro would undermine Danish welfare and prevent the government from protecting jobs. The euro-sceptic Danish People's Party, with the slogan ""For the krone and the fatherland"", fears the loss of Denmark's sovereignty to a federal Europe. Women are said to be particularly worried that Denmark might be submerged. 
Swedes have similar fears. But the ruling Social Democrats are coming round, albeit more slowly than their Danish cousins, to the euro. This month, at a special congress, they voted for the proposition ""Yes but later"", put forward by Goran Persson, the prime minister. They too agreed to resolve the matter by referendum, probably after the next general election, due by 2002. 
Mr Persson says he has gradually been persuaded of the euro's merits, seeing it, perhaps oddly, as ""the best protection against growing market forces"". But his party is still split; several of his cabinet ministers oppose it. The Swedish public is also wobbly, with recent polls showing the pro-euro camp only a few points ahead of the sceptics, the don't knows still, as in Denmark, a large minority. 
Norway is different again. it stands defiantly outside the EU, let alone the euro zone. But this month the Labour Party, which wants Norway to join the Union, took office, ousting a coalition led by Kjell Magne Bondevik, a Christian Democrat, that was broadly against. Jens Stoltenberg, the new prime minister, and his foreign minister, Thorbjorn jagland, who is also pro-EU, will try to drum up support for joining. 
They must tread warily. A referendum in 1994 bitterly divided Norwegians over whether to get into the Union; those in favour lost by a squeak. opinion polls suggest that the noes, including many in the Labour Party, are still just ahead. As Mr Stoltenberg's lot will be governing as a minority in parliament, he is unlikely to be bold, yet, on so controversial a matter. 
Even so, especially if the Danes and Swedes look set to join the euro, Europe is sure to feature in Norway's next general election, due in 2001. More Norwegians, despite their oil wealth, would then have to contemplate moving from membership of the European Economic Area to the EU itself And if they did join, the pull towards the euro zone might also eventually prove irresistibleleaving only Britain, in the EU, outside.

Finland, its Nordic (but not Scandinavian) neighbour, now enthusiastically belongs both to the Eu and to the euro-zone. Sweden and Denmark, as well as being in the eu club, are toying with the prospect of joining the euro too. Are Norway and its 4.5m people starting to feel the Arctic chill of isolation, with only Iceland's defiantly independent 280,ooo islanders giving them a splash of solitary Nordic comfort? 
fens Stoltenberg, Norway's left-of-centre prime minister since March, has long been keen for his country to join Europe's most popular club. ""Europe's future is Norway's future,"" he says eagerly. But ask whether he will now set about coaxing Norwegians towards their Euro-destiny and he becomes embarrassingly lame. He will merely ""discuss changing the party programme to give the possibility of raising a platform to consider possible membership after 2001 [ie, after the next general election]."" Not exactly the most stirring of pledges. Plainly, it will be hard to convince foreigners that he is a ""good European"" if he remains loth to urge his own people to ` join Europe"". 
On the face of things, as Mr Stoltenberg knows, Norway has little reason to change its ways. It is one of the richest countries (number three, in terms of income per person) in the world, and one of the most contented. It is the world's second-biggest exporter of oil. It has vast reserves of off shore gas and thoroughly efficient fish farms. Its unemployment rate, at 3%, is the lowest (bar Luxembourg's) in Europe. Its economy, with a slight blip last year when the oil price went down, is growing nicely at over 396 for the year. As a member of the European Economic Area, Norway enjoys all the free-trade perks of the EU. 
Still, if Mr Stoltenberg were to dare to try pulling his country Eu-wards, he would start off with some advantages. The country's youngest-ever leader at 41, he is bright, handsome, cosmopolitan: a gust of fresh air after his lacklustre predecessor as Labour's leader, Thorbjorn Jagland. He has deep roots in his party, not least because his father, Thorvald Stoltenberg, was a long-serving Labour foreign minister (and later the UN's high commissioner for refugees). Gro Harlem Brundtland, Norway's longest-serving prime minister since the war, was an attentive mentor. 
But Mr Stoltenberg knows that Norway is too divided, politically, to risk rushing into a controversial and bruising battle to shift its place in Europe or in the rest of the world. Though his Labour (ie, social democratic) government looks a shade more secure than its predecessor, an oddly shaped centre-right coalition led by Kjell Magne Bondevik, a clergyman inclined to bouts of gloom, it has only 65 seats out of 165 in Norway's parliament. Soon after he got the top job, Mr Stoltenberg was shaken by a series of strikes for higher wages which led to an expensive revision of the budget. Despite a spurt of goodwill after the new man's advent to power, the Labour Party, which has run Norway almost without interruption since the second world war, is far less popular than it was. A recent opinion poll gave Labour 28% against ao% for the right-wing populists of the Progress Party and 19% for the mainstream Conservatives: not the sort of figures to spur a new leader to start selling a policy that would buffet his own party as well as the country at large. In 1972 and again in 1994, Labour governments were rebuffed in referendums on joining the Eu (or its predecessor). Even now, the wounds have barely healed. 
So Mr Stoltenberg has to make do with trying to boost Norway's role in the world-outside the Eu. ""We want to take more global responsibility,"" he enthuses hopefully, while adding, somewhat forlornly, ""and in Europe we want as close a relationship as possible."" To give Norway its lonely due, it does strikingly well at holding its head up abroad. Its main boast, well-founded, is that it contributes more than its fair share towards NATO, the world's greatest military alliance. It has been keen to bolster the post-Soviet Baits. It has sent plenty of men, including muchneeded police, to Kosovo, and was quick to promise to put 3,500 Norwegians into a planned Eu-controlled rapid-reaction force. Norway, says Mr Stoltenberg, provides more uN peacekeepers, in proportion to its population, than any other country. 
It has also played a lively part in the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which the Russians have tried to boost as the continent's main conflict-settling forum; last year, Norway's foreign minister was its chairman. And Norway has played a notable part in seeking peace in such places as Israel (remember the Oslo accords of 1993), Myanmar and, more recently, Sri Lanka. 
It has also been outstandingly generous in handing out a bigger share of its wealth, 0.996 of GDP, to the world's poor than any other country; the prime minister says he wants that figure to rise to 1%. Some of Norway's social democrats fancy that, while eschewing the dirty business of big-power politics, they have made their country a ""humanitarian great power"". Noting that the uN's ""human development index"", which purports to measure people's overall well-being, ranks Norway second only to Canada, Mr Stoltenberg earnestly suggests that ""we can serve as a model to other countries. We are rich but our wealth is equally shared."" 
So why bother to reach out, in due course, to the Eu? For one thing, many Norwegians fret that, though within its free-trade zone, they have no influence on the club's rules, let alone the veto power that its smaller countries so treasure. And even that cherished place at NATO'S high table may look less safe if the EU's foreign and security policy gains substance: already, both bodies are scratching their heads over what to do about countries such as Norway and Turkey which are in one club but not the other. 
Suppose that Mr Stoltenberg stays on as prime minister after next year's general election. Norwegians may still feel happy to stand apart. But the sense of isolation may sharpen. And Mr Stoltenberg and his party may, once again, have to climb off the fence. ","WILL Norway remain the odd man out , the only Scandinavian country , in contrast to Denmark and Sweden , that stays outside the European Union ? Finland , its Nordic ( but not Scandinavian ) neighbour , now enthusiastically belongs both to the Eu and to the euro - zone .

The country 's youngest - ever leader at 41 , Jens Stoltenberg is bright , handsome , cosmopolitan : a gust of fresh air after Jens Stoltenberg's lacklustre predecessor as Labour 's leader , Thorbjorn Jagland . Jens Stoltenberg has deep roots in Jens Stoltenberg's party , not least because Jens Stoltenberg's father , Thorvald Stoltenberg , was a long - serving Labour foreign minister ( and later the UN 's high commissioner for refugees ) . Gro Harlem Brundtland , Norway 's longest - serving prime minister since the war , was an attentive mentor . 
 But Jens Stoltenberg knows that Norway is too divided , politically , to risk rushing into a controversial and bruising battle to shift its place in Europe or in the rest of the world . Though Jens Stoltenberg's Labour ( ie , social democratic ) government looks a shade more secure than its predecessor , an oddly shaped centre - right coalition led by Kjell Magne Bondevik , a clergyman inclined to bouts of gloom , it has only 65 seats out of 165 in Norway 's parliament . Soon after Jens Stoltenberg got the top job , Jens Stoltenberg was shaken by a series of strikes for higher wages which led to an expensive revision of the budget . Despite a spurt of goodwill after Jens Stoltenberg's advent to power , the Labour Party , which has run Norway almost without interruption since the second world war , is far less popular than it was . A recent opinion poll gave Labour 28 % against ao% for the right - wing populists of the Progress Party and 19 % for the mainstream Conservatives : not the sort of figures to spur a new leader to start selling a policy that would buffet his own party as well as the country at large . In 1972 and again in 1994 , Labour governments were rebuffed in referendums on joining the Eu ( or its predecessor ) . Even now , the wounds have barely healed . 
 So Jens Stoltenberg has to make do with trying to boost Norway 's role in the world - outside the Eu . "" We want to take more global responsibility , "" Jens Stoltenberg enthuses hopefully , while adding , somewhat forlornly , "" and in Europe we want as close a relationship as possible . "" To give Norway its lonely due , it does strikingly well at holding its head up abroad . Its main boast , well - founded , is that it contributes more than its fair share towards NATO , the world 's greatest military alliance . It has been keen to bolster the post - Soviet Baits . It has sent plenty of men , including muchneeded police , to Kosovo , and was quick to promise to put 3,500 Norwegians into a planned Eu - controlled rapid - reaction force . Norway , says Jens Stoltenberg , provides more uN peacekeepers , in proportion to its population , than any other country . 
 It has also played a lively part in the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe , which the Russians have tried to boost as the continent 's main conflict - settling forum ; last year , Norway 's foreign minister was its chairman . And Norway has played a notable part in seeking peace in such places as Israel ( remember the Oslo accords of 1993 ) , Myanmar and , more recently , Sri Lanka . 
 It has also been outstandingly generous in handing out a bigger share of its wealth , 0.996 of GDP , to the world 's poor than any other country ; Jens Stoltenberg says Jens Stoltenberg wants that figure to rise to 1 % . Some of Norway 's social democrats fancy that , while eschewing the dirty business of big - power politics , they have made their country a "" humanitarian great power "" . Noting that the uN 's "" human development index "" , which purports to measure people 's overall well - being , ranks Norway second only to Canada , Jens Stoltenberg earnestly suggests that "" we can serve as a model to other countries . We are rich but our wealth is equally shared . "" 
 So why bother to reach out , in due course , to the Eu ? For one thing , many Norwegians fret that , though within its free - trade zone , they have no influence on the club 's rules , let alone the veto power that its smaller countries so treasure . And even that cherished place at NATO 'S high table may look less safe if the EU 's foreign and security policy gains substance : already , both bodies are scratching their heads over what to do about countries such as Norway and Turkey which are in one club but not the other . 
 Suppose that Jens Stoltenberg stays on as prime minister after next year 's general election . Norwegians may still feel happy to stand apart . But the sense of isolation may sharpen . And Jens Stoltenberg and Jens Stoltenberg's party may , once again , have to climb off the fence .",385,Norway,A29-6061,IN TERM,True,"fens Stoltenberg , Norway 's left - of - centre prime minister since March",32,True

Denmark and the Nordics 
THE top brass in Brussels have been remarkably reluctant to speculate on the outcome of Denmark's euro referendum ever since Romano Prodi, the commission's president, waded into the debate in May, commenting that membership of the euro zone was, by definition, permanent. The Danish government had already assured the voters that they could join the euro and change their minds later. Chastened by the experience, Javier Solana, the European Union's ""high representative for foreign affairs"", at a meeting with Nordic and Baltic foreign ministers in Middelfart, Denmark, last week said he would not dream of interfering. The decision, Mr Solana told the Danes, was theirs alone. The latest opinion polls put the europhiles a shade ahead. 
Mr Solana also suggested that the outcome of the referendum on September 28th would not have the far-reaching implications that many Danes presume: the Eu's expansion would proceed in any event. But suppose the Danes vote to keep their krone? Other Nordic governments are especially worried. In four of the five Nordic countries, Social Democrats are in power; Sweden and Finland are inside the Eu, Norway and Iceland still outside it. Among party leaders across the Social Democratic board, proeuro sentiment has recently blossomed. 
Jens Stoltenberg, Norway's prime minister since March, and Thorbjorn Jagland, his foreign minister, have raised the possibility of a fresh application for EU membership. Their voters have twice before spurned Europe, but opinion polls suggest they are again beginning to get edgy about being isolated. Mr Stoltenberg is trying hard to put the EU back on the political agenda, even while he struggles with a dive in his government's popularity. Polls show that Labour (as Norway's social democrats are called), the country's largest political grouping since 1927, has been overtaken by the abrasively right-wing populists of the Progress Party. So the prime minister has little room for manoeuvre, and fears that a Danish no to the euro would kill off his moves towards the EU. 
Sweden, the only other Eu country besides Britain so far to have stayed out of the euro zone voluntarily, is also keeping a close eye on Danish goings-on. Its prime minister, Goran Persson, scored a notable victory in March when he persuaded his Social Democrats to adopt a pro-euro policy at a special congress. Sweden too is to hold a referendum on the euro, at a date yet to be fixed. There is still a strong streak of scepticism among voters, which Swedish politicians and pundits agree would be strengthened by a Danish no, postponing a Swedish referendum, probably till 2003, possibly even later. A yes would have the opposite effect. 
Finland was the only Nordic participant when the euro was launched. According to a European Commission survey in euro-zone countries in July, opposition to the euro was strongest in Austria, followed by Finland, the only two countries where support was below 500, though the latest opinion poll in Germany puts it at just 340. A Danish no would intensify Finnish disenchantment. 
Iceland has clung to its original decision to remain outside the Ev. The fear that, if the Swiss eventually join, it could end up with such heavyweights as Liechtenstein, Monaco, Andorra and San Marino as the only West European countries outside the club has provoked some soul-searching in Reykjavik. But Iceland's reliance on fishing, and the fact that EU membership would expose it to foreign fleets, makes it a delicate issue. Last week, Icelanders got into a flap when a Danish newspaper quoted their foreign minister, Halldor Asgrimsson, implying that Iceland was on the brink of applying to join. Mr Asgrimsson hastily said he had been reported out of context. If Iceland were to apply, ""which I'm not going to confirm at this stage,"" he said, ""it wouldn't work unless a solution were found to suit Iceland's fishing industry."" A no from the Danes could prove as big a barrier as the fish. 
At the other end of the Nordic zone, the Baltic trio-Estonia (which particularly likes to think of itself as Nordic), Lithuania and Latvia-are getting twitchy too. Denmark was one of the Balts' keenest champions when the Soviet Union began to implode. Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the Danish prime minister, says that getting the Baits into the EU is a top foreign-policy goal for his country. If the Danes say no to the euro, Denmark, he fears, will become a less powerful magnet for pulling the Baits into the Nordic familyand into the EU.

 THE Norwegians have sent a nervous shudder down the spines of Scandinavia's social democrats, who have ruled their respective roosts, with only occasional and brief hiccups, for the past 70 years. In fact, Norway's ruling Labour Party, as the country's social democrats are called, still won the general election on September 10th. But they drooped spectacularly, from 35% four years ago to 24%; four decades ago they got nearly half of all the votes. It will take a while for a new government to be formed, but there is a fair chance that a clutch of right-wing parties, perhaps led by the Conservatives, who got 21%, will take office.
 Despite his setback, Jens Stoltenberg, Norway's clever prime minister, who has led a minority government since last year, has refused to resign--yet. The voters, he rightly points out, have not spelt out their alternative. Indeed, Norwegians gave no fewer than five parties each more than 12% of the vote and enabled eight in all to take seats in parliament. ""Norwegian voters are like chickens without a head, rushing from one party to another in the hope of a miracle,"" says a pundit.
 They certainly veered to both left and right. The tally of the Socialist Left, the nearest thing in Norway to a communist party, doubled from 6% to 12%. It wants to spend a lot more of the country's vast revenues from oil and gas on sprucing up hospitals, schools and the country's already generous welfare state. By contrast, the Conservatives, led by Jan Petersen, a rather grey foreign-policy analyst, saw their score shoot up from 14% to 21%, with their calls for drastic tax cuts plainly striking a chord.
 This time the ticklish issue of whether Norway should join the European Union, which split the country down the middle in referendums in 1972 and 1994--both resulting in narrow No votes-- played little part in the campaign. The virulently anti-EU Centre Party saw its support slump by a third, to 6%.
 When parliament comes back in October, the Labour government may be replaced by a coalition of Conservatives, Christian Democrats and Liberals. Either Mr Petersen or the Christian Democrats' Kjell Magne Bondevik, who was prime minister from 1997 until he bowed out last year after taking time off for depression, will probably run the show.
 But it might not be plain sailing for a coalition crew on the right. Such a government would still need at least the occasional support of the right-wing populist Progressives, led by a veteran maverick, Carl I. Hagen. He matches the Conservatives with his calls for lower taxes and the Left Socialists with his demand that oil money should be spent on welfare, especially on pensioners. Mr Bondevik, however, would be loth to depend on the controversial Mr Hagen.
 Whoever takes office, do not expect Norway to change dramatically. Consensus will almost certainly reign as usual. The country is still awash with oil money. Though all governments, for fear of inflation, have kept much of the cash in a special pot, known as the Petroleum Fund, for the day when the oil runs out, many Norwegians now think that more of it should be spent on their dowdier schools, understaffed hospitals and run-down services for the old. A particular reason for Labour's decline was that instead of spending the oil money and cutting taxes, Mr Stoltenberg was trying to revamp the public sector--and promptly lost the backing of the powerful state-sector trade unions.
 This inconclusive election result may, oddly, give many Norwegians what they want: a weak government in thrall to an obstreperous and perhaps more populist legislature which may insist that more of the oil money should be dished out. Meanwhile, the social democrats' still-ruling counterparts in Denmark and Sweden will nervously wonder what lessons they can draw. The Danish lot, under the prime minister, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, are flagging in the polls and face a general election by next March. The Swedish party, under Goran Persson, is better liked, but must face the voters' verdict within a year.","  The right may form the next Norwegian government

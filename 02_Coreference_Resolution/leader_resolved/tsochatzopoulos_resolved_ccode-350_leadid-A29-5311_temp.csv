In his five months in office, he has had to contend with a confrontation with Turkey, bad news about the economy and rumbles of dissent within his own party from colleagues who were against his appointment in the first place In the next few weeks, however, he has a chance to assert his authority and, with luck, to get 
Greece moving in the right direction. Worries about Turkey and infighting within his Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) have meant that Mr Simitis has been unable to devote enough time to the economy. Reforms are creaking, inflation has risen again, to more than 9%. Greece's always dim hope of hitting the European Union's target for joining economic and monetary union has become still dimmer. 
Still, Mr Simitis and his more modernminded friends are likely to prevail at a party congress later this month. The younger barons, such as the public-works minister, Costas Laliotis, and an influential party official, Costas Skandalides, support him and are expected to help squash a disloyal minister, Akis Tsochatzopoulos. Mr Simitis has one other useful weapon: most Greeks still like his performance. 
His start, though, has been inauspicious. An argument with Turkey over the ownership of some rocks in the Aegean broke out within days of his appointment. Mr Simitis sensibly let the Americans prod him into compromise, which his enemies derided as a humiliating climbdown. 
But Mr Simitis has clawed his way back in the polls, partly because Greeks are still so relieved that Andreas Papandreou, his predecessor, is no longer in charge The frail Mr Papandreou now languishes with his young wife Dimitra in their embarrassingly glitzy ""pink villa' in northern Athens. 
He is occasionally glimpsed on television. He may appear briefly at the party congress. As Pasok's founder, he will stay on as chairman-for-life, but he is physically and politically too weak to stop Mr Simitis from strengthening his grip. 
Part of Mr Simitis's appeal is his very lack of the charisma that Mr Papandreou had in spades. Whereas the old guard used the spoils of office to build garish villas, Mr Simitis lives like most Greeks: in a trafficbegrimed block on a noisy street. He usually walks to work and sometimes chats with old pals from the Panteios School of 
Political Science in a local cafe. No whiff of corruption hangs over his earnest advisers. 
But that pleasant prime ministerial change of style will not be enough, on its own, to drag Greece out of its foreign-policy and economic troubles. This month Turkey raised the stakes in the Aegean by questioning Greek sovereignty over yet another tiny island, Gavdos. This latest flashpoint lies south of Crete, closer to Libya than to Turkey. Moving from verbal to lethal exchanges of fire cannot be ruled out. 
Tension with the Turks is bad for the economy. Mr Simitis seems likely to give in to the hard men in his cabinet, such as Gerasimos Arsenis, the defence minister and another of Mr Simitis's rivals, who now cites Gavdos-among other things-as a reason for boosting the defence budget. 
Mr Arsenis says Greece must buy new fighter aircraft and weapons systems. The defence budget this year is already 4.6% of GDP, the highest proportion in NATo. Another big jump could wipe out the gains of the past five painful years, which have seen the public-sector deficit slowly but steadily shrinking. Mr Simitis is keen not to raise taxes, and cannot want to borrow either: Greece's public debt is already over ill% of GDP, compared with the 60% limit prescribed by the European Union's Maastricht criteria. Yet, if he cannot convince the Greeks that he will eventually bring them into Europe's mainstream, his popularity will start to fall.

His opponent for the leadership of the ruling PanHellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok), Akis Tsochatzopoulos, ranted hoarsely in a final bid for votes. Most Greeks watching last week's congress, broadcast live on television,wanted Mr Simitis to win. He did, by a slimmish margin, getting 54% of the votes cast. Mr Simitis also won control of Pasok's zoo-member central committee, its main decision-making body. But his duel with Mr Tsochatzopoulos is not over. 
Because the congress opened the day af ter the elaborate state funeral of Andreas Papandreou, Pasok's founder, emotions were running unusually high. Mr Simitis's criticism of Mr Papandreou's autocratic ways further raised the temperature. So did his threat to resign as prime minister if he failed to become Pasok's chairman. Most members of Pasok's ""politburo"" (a nickname reflecting the party's Marxist origins) favoured a power-sharing deal to split the jobs of prime minister and party leader and so curb Mr Simitis's zeal for economic reform. The politburo will be replaced by a new executive to Mr Simitis's liking. 
So Mr Simitis can now pursue his hopes of dragging Greece out of its Balkan backwardness and raising it to something like West European levels of efficiency. The day after his victory, foreign investors keen to take advantage of high interest rates on a new issue of government bonds pumped in more than $5oom. Greece is at last setting up an agency to shepherd foreign companies through the bureaucratic maze and help them get government grants to set up factories in the north-eastern province of Thrace, within easy reach of new markets opening up around the Black Sea. Cutting red tape should also speed the disbursement of another lo billion ecus ($iz.4 billion) of European Union grants for improving Greece's roads, ports and railways. If Mr Simitis succeeds in easing tension with Turkey in the Aegean, still more foreign capital should flow in. 
His victory should also break the budget log-jam. His scheme to cut 300 billion drachmas ($1.2 billion) a year from government spending-1.5% of GDP--should now, after languishing on his desk for months, win the party's approval. Controls on procurement for hospitals, clinics and so on would be tightened, and local-government spending capped. 
But the biggest battle will be over that curse of Mr Papandreou's Greece: patronage. Mr Simitis wants to cut the public-sector payroll by hiring only one new civil servant for every three who leave. But the 4o% of Pasok's members who are public-sector workers will fight ferociously to keep their jobs and win new ones for cousins and friends. Mr Tsochatzo poulos, the public-administration minister who has let public-sector employment grow by 2.7% in little over a year, is right behind them. 
For the moment, Mr Simitis is being gentle. Rather than sack Mr Tsochatzopoulos and his cabinet supporters forthwith, he will try to win them over. If he fails, he will have no choice but to call an early election, probably this autumn. Opinion polls suggest he would win. He might then start, in earnest, to destroy Mr Papandreou's legacy of an all-powerful, bloated and corrupt state.

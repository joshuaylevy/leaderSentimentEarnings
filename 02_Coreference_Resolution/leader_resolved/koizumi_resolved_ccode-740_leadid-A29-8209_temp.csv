IN THE past few years, Japan's politicians have managed to transform the country's public debt from something of hill-like proportions into something truly mountainous. The government is about to make the mountain even bigger, with yet another spending package. Financial folk have been sounding the alarm for years. Now, a few reformist politicians are joining in. This week Junichiro Koizumi, a senior, reform-minded member of the Liberal Democratic Party, which dominates the ruling coalition, said that the government's profligate policies risked causing a fiscal crisis. Even a few of the old guard are getting cold feet. 
As well they might. Although the latest proposed package is not that large-in reality it is worth just under Y4 trillion ($37.4 billion)-it comes on top of the Y120 trillion that the government has spent since 1992 to get the economy moving. Central-government debt, which has grown by 50% over the past four years, topped Y500 trillion in April. Add in local-government and other government-guaranteed debt, and gross public debt is now Y675 trillion-or 136% Of GDP, by far the worst among rich countries. 
The rapid increase in the country's gross debt burden is hurting Japan's creditworthiness. Earlier this month, Moody's, a creditrating agency, downgraded Japan's domestic debt once again, to Aa2, two notches below its best rating, even though Japan is the world's biggest creditor nation. Can the government carry on splurging in this way? 
Certainly, much of the money that it has been spending has been squandered on wasteful building projects or ill-thought-out information-technology schemes. if it continues to inject the economy with fiscal laxatives, the money ought to be better spent But the bigger question is whether it can afford much more of anything. 
Your word is my bond 
Despite the dismal state of its finances, the government still manages to borrow extraordinarily cheaply: ten-year bond yields are below 2%. This is because Japan's battered financial institutions, mainly its banks and life insurers, want to buy only risk-free domestic assets, and because inflation is not considered likely. That will not last for ever: if government debt continues to grow at its present rate, they may start to realise that Japanese government bonds are not the risk-free investments that they still consider them. Yields will then rise-and, if history is any guide, quite sharply. 
That would not only jack up the government's interest bill; it would also cripple the already weak financial sector and snuff out the recent glimmers of recovery among nonfinancial firms. Investment bankers say that some Japanese companies are so worried about rising public debt leading to a bondmarket crash or to inflation (how else to get rid of debts of this size except by printing money?) that they are trying to shrink their domestic operations and expand their foreign ones. If more companies-and investors-follow suit, those who have grimly predicted capital flight and a collapsing currency, could yet be vindicated. 
To make matters worse, the government and the Bank of japan disagree on economic policy. The Bank thinks that the economy is over the worst,which is why it raised interest rates in August, albeit only to 0.25% The government, on the other hand, says that Japan's economy is still fragile, which is why it wants to carry on spending. Even as the government tries to prop up corporate Japan, the central bank's policy has the opposite effect, increasing deflationary pressures and keeping the yen high. 
With no inflation in sight, it was probably premature for the Bank to raise interest rates. it would perhaps have been better to have run a looser monetary policy (by printing money) and a tighter fiscal one, either by cutting spending or by raising taxes. Unfortunately, the government has little appetite for either. The last time that taxes were raised was in 1997, when consumption taxes were put up, helping to tip the country back into recession. Cutting spending holds little appeal to the likes of Yoshiro Mori, the prime minister, who is a firm believer in traditional pork-barrel politics. It was probably the lack of political leadership that forced the hand of the Bank, which thinks of itself as Japan's only credible institution. 
Advocates of fiscal reform need not despair. Pro-reformers within the LDP, led by Koichi Kato (widely viewed as the leading candidate to replace Mr Mori), while not proposing actual spending cuts, are at least opposing new spending plans. The Democratic Party, the leading opposition party, is calling for a 30% reduction in public-works spending, and it is gaining popularity in urban Japan. In a recent poll by the Sankei Shimbun, a centre-right newspaper, twothirds of respondents opposed the new stimulus package. But can Japan afford to wait? It does not require an overly vivid imagination to worry that Japan's inability to make ends meet might one day cause a great deal of pain.

SO MUCH for Koichi Kato's long game. All autumn, Mr Kato and his reform-minded followers in Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) have prepared patiently for the right moment to make a push for power, reckoning on next summer at the earliest. By accident or design, however, they find themselves pitched into a real contest much sooner. Already Yoshiro Mori, Japan's unpopular prime minister, looks finished. Mr Kato will now want to press home his advantage. ""The voice of the people will prevail in the end,"" he told reporters this week. 
Unusually for Japan, Mr Kato may be right. An old ally, Taku Yamasaki, has been quick to pledge his support. With the opposition parties preparing to back a no-confidence vote in parliament as soon as November zand, Mr Kato now has to persuade his supporters to vote against their own prime minister, inviting their possible expulsion from the LDP. Party hacks have already been working on the rebels. But, to general surprise, Mr Kato's supporters are holding fast, at least for the moment. Faced with more determined opposition than the party expected, Mr Mori's support is crumbling. If two-thirds of Mr Kato's and Mr Yamasaki's combined factions join the opposition to vote against Mr Mori, he will lose. If the LDP rebels merely abstain, he can survive. 
Everyone now waits to see how Mr Kato plays his hand. His liberal economic thinking puts him closer to the reformist half of the Democrats, the biggest opposition party, than to the LDP's conservative mainstream. This invites thoughts of an LDP split, a broad political realignment and a new coalition government, with Mr Kato at the helm. Some of the younger members of Mr Kato's faction have been working to build loose ties with the Democrats recently, even suggesting that they co-operate on policy. On November 15th, Mr Kato himself met opposition leaders, claiming, improbably, that they talked only about the economy. Despite these manoeuvrings, Mr Kato still says he does not want to leave the LDP. 
For now, Mr Kato should probably be taken at his word. After flirting briefly with reform in the mid-1990s, the LDP's recent lurch back towards special-interest politics has convinced some of Mr Kato's more hotheaded supporters that the party is beyond rescue. But, for all its shortcomings, the LDP and the organised vote at its heart still offers a stable, albeit shrinking, political base and ready access to campaign funds. 
More likely, Mr Kato will be hoping to press his case with the LDP's elderly executive. The party will not want an open fight. That would risk a general election in which, thanks to Mr Mori's bungling leadership, the LDP could expect a hiding. Nor, though, will the party barons meekly defer to Mr Kato's claim to the top job, with all the loss of face that this would entail. Instead, they may offer to bring the LDP'S leadership election forward to next month. Even then, Mr Kato may not be assured of victory. Mainstream factions are considering a third candidate. 
One possible replacement is Yohei Kono, Japan's foreign minister. If Mr Kono's old rivalry with Mr Kato scuppers this choice, the LDP may instead pick junichiro Koizumi, whose mischievous indiscretions are said to have drawn Mr Kato into his present fight. A third candidate is Masahiko Komura, a former foreign minister. But Mr Kato seems in no mood to compromise. Party barons must now decide whether they ought to offer him more, or to call his bluff.

EVEN as Japanese political squibs go, it was a pretty damp one. Koichi Kato, the leading light on the reformist wing of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), had briefly threatened fireworks by planning, with his allies, to vote against the country's hapless prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, in a no-confidence motion. Since the LDP, even with its coalition partners, holds only a slender majority in the Diet (parliament), that would have forced Mr Mori either to resign or to call a fresh election. Instead, on November 20th Mr Kato backed off, demonstrating how weak the reformists still are, and how tenacious the LDP'S gerontocrats can be (see page 99). After a weekend of arm-twisting by party bosses, who control the party's election coffers, half of Mr Kato's faction deserted him. Tearfully staging what he called an ""honourable retreat"", Mr Kato then abstained from the vote. The Tokyo stock exchange greeted the survival of Mr Mori, best known for a series of verbal gaffes that have sent the cabinet's approval rating in opinion polls crashing below the 20% mark, by sliding still further. 
Deeply unpopular, and with an uncanny knack for getting himself into trouble, Mr Mori is unlikely to survive for long. Mr Kato's failed rebellion may have prolonged his reign a bit. But the greater damage has been to the cause of reform. When Mr Mori is eventually dumped, whether that is soon or after he takes the rap for what is sure to be a dismal LDP showing in elections to the Diet's Upper House next July, Mr Kato is now most unlikely to succeed him. Party elders will not want to reward so unprecedented a display of insubordination. There are other reformers, such as Junichiro Koizumi, who bravely (but unsuccessfully) proposed privatising Japan's post office, but they lack Mr Kato's abilities and stature. 
Blocked within his own party, Mr Kato has sometimes hinted that he might leave the LDP altogether, and throw in his lot with the main opposition party, the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ). A strengthened DPJ would at least be able to present Japan's voters with a choice of governments at the next election. The great weakness of the Japanese political system has been the absence of any real competition for votes: the LDP has held power continuously since its foundation in 1955, with just one ten-month break in 1993-94. 
But Mr Kato may have difficulty taking many of his supporters with him. Besides, the opposition parties still lack credibility. They are widely seen as being stuffed with LDP deserters, and lacking new ideas. Half of Japan's voters say they do not support any particular party, and at a prefectural election this month, a candidate backed by both the LDP and the DPJ was rejected in favour of an independent. More likely, Mr Kato will stay with the LDP and fight from within. 
The follies of a one-party state 
There is still much to fight for. Japan's reformists point out that, ever since its economy first went into decline in 1991, the LDP has been tackling the problem the wrong way: by throwing money at it. This has more than doubled Japan's government debt, which now stands at over $5 trillion, or some 110%. of GDP, the highest among industrialised countries. Yet this has failed to revive the economy, which despite temporary rallies shows no sign of returning to even European, let alone American, levels of growth. Meanwhile, such profligate government spending tends to crowd out more efficient private money, and to make consumers cautious. One credit-- ratings agency has already downgraded Japan's debt to Aa2, a worrying trend in the world's second-largest economy. 
What Japan ought to be doing is precisely what the LDP finds hardest: deregulating the economy, which is now badly handicapped by government red tape, such as the high telecoms charges that are allowing other Asian countries to overtake Japan in e-commerce. But that means tackling Japan's special-interest groups: the construction industry, the retailers, the post office, the farmers, NTT, the banks. As so often happens in one-party states, these have all developed unhealthily close links with the ruling party, which is correspondingly reluctant to take them on. 
What Mr Kato has realised, but the LDP leadership still refuses to see, is that this kind of support is no longer enough. Thanks partly to electoral reform, and partly to the growth of the DPJ, it is much harder for the LDP to win elections than it used to be. The party needs to reach out beyond its traditional support-base to the ordinary voter. But as long as it is led by politicians like Mr Mori, there is not much chance of that.

 FRANCIS DRAKE did it, although his game was bowls, and once it was over he sunk the Spanish armada. Yoshiro Mori, Japan's much-abused prime minister, has been less fortunate. When news of a collision, on February 9th, between an American nuclear submarine and a Japanese fishing boat reached Mr Mori, he was enjoying a round of golf. He played on for another three holes and arrived back at his official residence some three hours later. Beset by a weakening economy, a falling stockmarket, assorted scandals and riot within his own ranks, Mr Mori's golfing gaffe has done him more harm. This week, senior officials from New Komeito, which shares power with Mr Mori's Liberal Democratic Party in a three-way coalition, were calling for his head.
 Like the LDP, New Komeito faces an election for Japan's upper house in July. But it must also contest local elections for Tokyo's metropolitan assembly in June. The party is strong in Tokyo. Because it is in bed with the LDP, however, New Komeito's strained reputation for clean politics is coming under daily assault. A campaign-finance scandal involving KSD, a small-business foundation that showered the LDP with money, has already led to the arrest of an LDP politician. A scandal in the foreign ministry, involving a low-level bureaucrat said to have used government money to buy racehorses, is doing yet more damage.
 The gossip in Nagatacho, Tokyo's political district, is that Mr Mori's fate may have been sealed at a meeting between New Komeito and LDP dons in an Azabu restaurant on January 24th. Mr Mori would supposedly be required to announce his resignation, perhaps at the end of February. The annual election for the party's presidency, which decides the prime ministership, would then be brought forward, from September to the party's general meeting on March 13th. With the much-fancied Yohei Kono, the foreign minister, done in by the scandal in his ministry, the main candidates are Ryutaro Hashimoto, a former prime minister who joined Mr Mori's cabinet in December, and Junichiro Koizumi, who heads Mr Mori's faction in the LDP. After some early gains by Mr Hashimoto, Mr Koizumi now seems to be inching ahead.
 The difficulty will be persuading Mr Mori to leave. The KSD mess may lead to the arrest of other LDP politicians. The foreign- ministry scandal may claim the scalp of Mr Kono. Mr Mori's tax position is not entirely clear. Yet nothing seems to penetrate his leathery hide. He seems still to enjoy life, especially away from Tokyo. Next time he plays a round, he may be tempted to leave his mobile phone behind.","  Japan

 HE CANNOT quite bring himself to say it out loud. But Yoshiro Mori is finished, and everybody knows it. On March 13th, Japan's prime minister confirmed that he was bringing forward the Liberal Democratic Party's leadership election, which was due in September. As the LDP dominates the coalition government, whoever wins this race will also claim the prime minister's job. Once the budget is through parliament, Mr Mori will then make his departure official, perhaps in early April. That, however, is all the party can agree on right now. Who will succeed Mr Mori--and even how and when--remains as mysterious as ever.
 The how dictates the when. Mr Mori's own route to the top, via a shady backroom deal among five party barons last April, made him deeply unpopular from the start. This time, the LDP must at least put on a show of democracy. But a by-the-book election, involving all 2.4m party members, would take more than a month to organise. That would leave little time to reverse the party's dismal fortunes before July's crucial upper-house election. So the party elders are pushing to restrict the vote to the parliamentary party, plus one representative from each of the 47 prefectural chapters. Naturally, local bosses want a bigger say. But the larger the electorate grows, the longer it will take to fix the outcome.
 There is plenty to fix. Mr Mori's 11 months in office have left the LDP looking desperately split. Yawning policy differences between the party's conservative mainstream and liberal minority have already led to one attempted coup on Mr Mori's watch, by a young reformer, Koichi Kato. Since then, the mainstream itself has split over Mr Mori's future. One camp, led by a faction headed by Ryutaru Hashimoto, a former prime minister (see chart), has worked feverishly to rid the party of the stunningly unpopular Mr Mori. The other, an alliance between Mr Mori's own faction, and one jointly led by his policy chief, Shizuka Kamei, has been struggling vainly to prop up Mr Mori. Although Mr Mori is now going, the split remains. One of the two candidates most likely to succeed him, Hiromu Nonaka, is from Mr Hashimoto's camp. The other candidate, Junichiro Koizumi, is from Mr Mori's.
 The two men could not be more different. Mr Koizumi is all privilege and polish. After graduating from Keio, a posh Tokyo university, he followed his father (and his grandfather before him) into politics. Accomplished and sophisticated--his interests span opera, classical music and kabuki theatre--Mr Koizumi looks good on television and is popular with the voters, especially women. He even has a reputation as a bit of a reformer, although his cowardly betrayal of his liberal allies in November's failed coup has put a big dent in this.
 Mr Nonaka is a much more interesting character. He comes from Sonobe, a district in Kyoto known for its large population of burakumin, literally ""village people"". This is a group that, like India's untouchables, used to handle the jobs no one else would do, such as tanning, butchery and rubbish collection. Mr Nonaka himself left school at 15 to become a railwayman. Discrimination pushed him into local politics, where he eventually won his spurs breaking the Communist Party's armlock on Kyoto's municipal government. The LDP rewarded him with a seat in parliament.
 To voters, Mr Nonaka and his allies, among them Muneo Suzuki and Makoto Koga, are an intimidating bunch. Mr Suzuki comes from a rough working-class background. Mr Koga, whom Mr Nonaka installed as the LDP's secretary-general when he resigned from that post in December, is said to describe himself as a kawasujimono. This word is from the southern island of Kyushu, where Mr Koga's father worked in the coal mines, and suggests a proud, rough, hard-drinking working man. The LDP is just as intimidated by Mr Nonaka himself. His chief currency is information, especially the sort of information that puts politicians in hot water. He employs his black arts to gain advantage behind the scenes and, last November, to put down Mr Kato's rebellion. ""Some flowers like the sunlight,"" says one insider. ""Others prefer the shade. Mr Nonaka is the latter variety.""
 It is still too early to tell for sure. But Mr Nonaka may soon have his time in the sun. Because he champions the poor, immigrants and other underdogs, he is close to the Buddhist-backed New Komeito party, the most important of the LDP's two coalition partners. Komeito is supposed to be the party of ""clean government"", and so has been especially upset by the lingering presence of Mr Mori, around whose cabinet swirl assorted scandals. Komeito is even threatening to abandon the coalition altogether. Mr Nonaka is probably the best man to patch things up.
 Party barons then hope to mend fences within the LDP by offering Mr Koizumi a plum job in Mr Nonaka's new line-up, either as party secretary-general, or as foreign minister. The deal will be sweetened, it is hoped, by giving Mr Nonaka the job for just five months. He is, after all, 75 years old, on the aged side even for Japan. Yet another party leadership election will then be held in September, after the upper-house election is out of the way.
 What this all might mean for Japan's economy, which lurches from bad to worse, is anyone's guess. Almost nothing is known about Mr Nonaka's economic thinking. But some optimists hope he will appoint as his finance minister a younger reformer like Yasuhisa Shiozaki as a sop to the party's discontented youth, who are frustrated by the LDP's rigid seniority-based system of promotion. Unlike Mr Mori, Mr Nonaka would also be his own man, and may return some welcome control to Japan's disturbingly chaotic politics and economy.
 In the meantime, there will be more drift and more muddle as Mr Mori limps on for another month or two. In the end, the LDP avoided the ugly scenes that had threatened the party's annual conference on March 13th. Outside, however, local party members were forlornly handing out leaflets, on which they had written, ""The party is going to die."" The message is not getting through.

After Yoshiro Mori told the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in March that he would resign as prime minister, there was an embarrassing shortage of candidates to replace him. Yet on April 9th Junichiro Koizumi, a former posts and telecoms and health minister, said he would be a candidate for the top job. A day later Taro Aso, the economics minister, and Shizuka Kamei, the LDP's policy chief, offered their services. Ryutaro Hashimoto, a former prime minister and, lately, minister in charge of government reform, added his name to the list on April 11th.
 With less than two weeks to go before the vote, suddenly the LDP is spoilt for choice. In truth, there are only two men in the race: Mr Hashimoto and Mr Koizumi. That makes the contest a rerun of the LDP's leadership election of 1995, when party barons fielded two fresh-faced young politicians to help revive the LDP's sagging fortunes with the voters.
 The two rivals are no longer so young or so fresh-faced, but some things never change. In 1995, Mr Hashimoto won handsomely. This year, he is likely to do so again. Mr Hashimoto has two things going for him. First, he is head of the LDP's largest and best-organised faction. Not all of the Hashimoto faction's 102 Diet members--almost one third of the parliamentary party--will vote for their leader, whose haughty airs go down better with the public than with the LDP. But the faction's unrivalled campaign-finance network, the chief bequest of the late Noboru Takeshita, still buys plenty of loyalty among the rank and file. Second, Mr Hashimoto is the choice of Hiromu Nonaka, the LDP's most influential power-broker, who decided last week not to go for the top job himself. Mr Nonaka belongs to Mr Hashimoto's faction, but his tentacles reach everywhere.
 Against these mighty forces, Mr Koizumi has wisely chosen to fight on policy, not factional loyalty. As in 1995, Mr Koizumi's platform is party reform, which he wants to achieve by privatising the post office. The idea is to take the drugs away from the addict. The post office helps to deliver the LDP's organised rural vote. But, although electoral reform, migration and demography are all weakening the power of the countryside, the LDP still clings to its political roots. This week, for instance, the government decided to slap import curbs on Chinese vegetables, despite protests from urban consumers who pay through the nose for expensive home-grown alternatives.
 Mr Koizumi says he wants to sever the LDP's old rural ties and rebuild the party around the urban majority. His message is not entirely lost on the LDP. He is popular among its grassroots members, who have a keener sense of crisis than the sheltered politicians in Tokyo. The LDP's local chapters will cast about one-third of the votes in the leadership election on April 24th, and opinion polls suggest Mr Koizumi is their first choice.
 Support from the minority of liberal thinkers in the parliamentary party, such as Taku Yamasaki and Koichi Kato, will boost Mr Koizumi's chances further. In the end, though, this may not be enough. Although Shizuka Kamei has no chance of winning the LDP's leadership race himself, he is hoping to gain enough support to cast the deciding vote. Mr Kamei is from the LDP's old guard, firmly wedded to vested interests and addicted to pork-barrel fiscal stimulus. In return for his support, Mr Kamei is demanding that he should stay on as the party's policy chief. Until now, he has used this post to frustrate deregulation and bank reform, and to push for more government spending.
 Despite his reputation as a reformer, Mr Hashimoto may now be preparing to make the necessary concessions, by watering down his previous support of structural reform, and backing away from an immediate tightening of government finances. But it is these sorts of policies that find increasing favour with the voters. In 1998, Mr Hashimoto led the LDP to a humiliating defeat in that summer's upper- house elections. Another upper-house poll is due in July. The signs are that Mr Hashimoto will win the dubious honour of committing the same sin twice.

 ""THIS is a total reversal of the past,"" declared Junichiro Koizumi as he won the election for the presidency of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), and with it the prime ministership. And he was right. In Japanese political terms his accession, shoving aside the anointed candidate of the party bosses, was little short of revolutionary. But now, as history has repeatedly shown, there is bound to be some form of counter-revolution.
 Until even a week ago, no one would have given much for Mr Koizumi's chances. His main opponent, Ryutaro Hashimoto, had appeared to have the LDP election stitched up. His faction, after all, is by far the largest of the LDP's groups and always used to get its way. A conservative alliance between business, the banks and the rural voter, it is one of the main impediments to the reforms that Japan so badly needs, and which Mr Koizumi is trying to deliver.
 Mr Koizumi's victory was a consequence of an apparently minor change to the party's election procedures, which expanded the vote given to ordinary party members by giving each of Japan's 47 prefectures three votes, out of a total of 487. Because they were mostly cast as blocks, the result was startling: a landslide for the unorthodox Mr Koizumi, with his silver suit, dishevelled hair and professed liking for heavy metal music. When the parliamentarians came to vote, the result of the ""primary"" prompted enough of the other factions to back Mr Koizumi to ensure his victory. That, however, was the relatively easy part. He now has to deliver.
 The new prime minister's biggest difficulty is probably his own party. The sorts of reforms he talks about--slashing government spending to restore the public finances and allowing heavily- indebted businesses to go bust--are anathema to the LDP's traditionalists, who have systematically watered down all attempts in the past to dispense similar medicine. Such changes, after all, would hit hardest at some of the LDP's most committed, and generous, supporters.
 The pressure on Mr Koizumi to backtrack will be intense, and unfortunately, there are already signs that he is ready to do so: he is talking about the virtues of compromise, and has struck some sort of a deal with Shizuka Kamei, one of the main LDP architects of Japan's failed attempts to spend its way out of the recession that has afflicted it since the early 1990s. Could Mr Kamei's endorsement mean that Mr Koizumi is already shifting before even being sworn in?
 Nor will the pressures for immobility come only from within the party. After it lost its majority in the 1998 election for the upper house of parliament, the LDP was forced into coalition government, and is now dependent on the much smaller New Komeito and New Conservative Party. But New Komeito is resistant to the kinds of reforms that Mr Koizumi is billed as wanting to make. Any attempt to end the privileges of Japan's farmers, shopkeepers or postal workers (the privatisation of the post office, with its vast savings deposits, is a pet project of Mr Koizumi's) will not go down well.
 Mr Koizumi's other main task is to avoid an electoral catastrophe for his party this July in the election to the upper house. His victory, after all, comes courtesy only of the LDP's members, not the voters at large. Though he will be able to claim that after barely two months it is hardly his fault if the LDP-led coalition loses its majority in the upper house, as was expected at least until Mr Koizumi took over, such an outcome would make the business of governing Japan nearly impossible: the upper house, though not as influential as the lower house, has extensive powers of veto. The leader of the main opposition party, Yukio Hatoyama, has already vowed to use victory in July to force a new election for the lower house, which might smash the LDP there as well.
 Stand and deliver
 How can Mr Koizumi avoid this awful fate? Only by delivering reforms that actually seem to be working. The trouble is that the timing is so tight. True, voters seem to be fed up with the LDP's spendthrift ways, which have already taken Japan's debt to 120% of GDP, the highest ratio in the developed world. And true, too, that they are concerned about a banking system which, on a broad definition, is reckoned to have more than $1 trillion in bad or doubtful debt on its books. But reforming either of these inevitably means short-term pain. The benefits would not appear until long after the election.
 Besides, for all his carefully cultivated maverick image, Mr Koizumi is rather an insider, the son and grandson of former LDP members of parliament, and a minister in two previous cabinets, including that of Mr Hashimoto when he was prime minister. Mr Koizumi loyally supported the disastrous outgoing prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, almost to the end.
 Yet if there is one thing that emerges from all opinion studies and recent by-elections, it is that the Japanese are fed up with established politicians, whether of the LDP or of the main opposition party, the Democratic Party of Japan. Time after time, they have rejected the mainstream candidates in elections, preferring instead novelists, NGO workers or entertainers. By reaching over the heads of his party elders, and campaigning in a deliberately American style, Mr Koizumi has at least shown that he understands the problem, and that he offers some of the right solutions. He will need, and he deserves, a lot of luck in implementing them.","  Junichiro Koizumi's achievement in winning the leadership of Liberal Democrats is impressive -- and so is the battle in front of Junichiro Koizumi 
  "" THIS is a total reversal of the past , "" declared Junichiro Koizumi as Junichiro Koizumi won the election for the presidency of Japan 's Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) , and with it the prime ministership . And Junichiro Koizumi was right . In Japanese political terms Junichiro Koizumi's accession , shoving aside the anointed candidate of the party bosses , was little short of revolutionary . But now , as history has repeatedly shown , there is bound to be some form of counter - revolution . 
  Until even a week ago , no one would have given much for Junichiro Koizumi's chances . Junichiro Koizumi's main opponent , Ryutaro Hashimoto , had appeared to have the LDP election stitched up . His faction , after all , is by far the largest of the LDP 's groups and always used to get its way . A conservative alliance between business , the banks and the rural voter , it is one of the main impediments to the reforms that Japan so badly needs , and which Junichiro Koizumi is trying to deliver . 
  Junichiro Koizumi's victory was a consequence of an apparently minor change to the party 's election procedures , which expanded the vote given to ordinary party members by giving each of Japan 's 47 prefectures three votes , out of a total of 487 . Because they were mostly cast as blocks , the result was startling : a landslide for Junichiro Koizumi's music . When the parliamentarians came to vote , the result of the "" primary "" prompted enough of the other factions to back Junichiro Koizumi to ensure Junichiro Koizumi's victory . That , however , was the relatively easy part . Junichiro Koizumi now has to deliver . 
  Junichiro Koizumi's biggest difficulty is probably Junichiro Koizumi's own party . The sorts of reforms Junichiro Koizumi talks about -- slashing government spending to restore the public finances and allowing heavily- indebted businesses to go bust -- are anathema to the LDP 's traditionalists , who have systematically watered down all attempts in the past to dispense similar medicine .

 ""GAMBARO!"" cheered Junichiro Koizumi, punching the air with his fist. ""Let's do our best!"" Japan's new prime minister will have to do better than that. By winning the leadership election of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) against the wishes of its top men, Mr Koizumi has already performed one conjuring trick. If he is to honour his bold promises of reform, he will have to perform another.
 No one seemed more surprised by the election upset than Mr Koizumi himself. Only a week ago, Ryutaro Hashimoto seemed to have the keys to the kantei, the prime minister's official residence, in his pocket. Now Mr Hashimoto has been soundly beaten and his faction, which controlled Japanese politics for nearly 30 years, finds itself out in the cold. ""It seems the earth is shaking,"" said Mr Koizumi, his flowery rhetoric getting the better of him. ""The simmering magma is about to explode.""
 This is a disaster for the party bosses and they will want to put it behind them as quickly as possible. Along with his own faction, by far the biggest in the LDP, Mr Hashimoto was also the choice of Hiromu Nonaka, the party's top power-broker. Yet while Mr Nonaka was stitching up the parliamentary vote, the LDP's local chapters had other ideas. The last time the LDP changed leaders, a year ago, the party's 2.3m rank-and-file members had no say in picking Yoshiro Mori, a terrible choice. This time they demanded a big vote, and cast it in such overwhelming numbers for Mr Koizumi that his popularity carried the parliamentary party too.
 Mr Hashimoto's faction was supposed to be the mightiest vote- gathering machine in Japanese politics. Put together by Kakuei Tanaka, the father of money politics, and lovingly tended by Noboru Takeshita, his political heir, the influence of Mr Hashimoto's faction reaches far down into the industrial support groups, whose members make up two thirds of the LDP's party faithful. Once the faction had picked Mr Hashimoto, the word duly went out to the shopkeepers, the farmers and the postal workers. According to the Asahi newspaper, the postal workers' outfit, whose 250,000 members form the LDP's single biggest support group, was asked to return blank ballot papers on to which Mr Hashimoto's name would then be written. Yet with an election for the upper house of parliament looming in July and the LDP desperately unpopular, the party revolted. ""We picked the best man to lead us into the election battle,"" says one party hack. ""It's as simple as that.""
 Mr Koizumi will now have to prove that he is more than a ""poster boy for the elections"", as Naoto Kan, a leading opposition politician, is calling him. With his shaggy permed hair and outspoken views, Mr Koizumi's carefully cultivated image as a political eccentric makes him popular with voters, who are heartily sick of mainstream politics, though, as the LDP's election has shown, Mr Koizumi can play factional politics with as much finesse as any insider.
 Not so grey
 Parts of Mr Koizumi's colourful new line-up look decidedly experimental. With a nod, perhaps, to the unpopularity of all elected politicians in Japan, Mr Koizumi has leant heavily on unelected policy experts like Heizo Takenaka, a sparky, media-friendly economist who, as an adviser to the last administration, became known as ""Mr Mori's brain"". Mr Takenaka's new job, as economy minister, gives him a chance to push for the sweeping structural reforms he has championed outside government.
 Five of Mr Koizumi's cabinet will be women, including Atsuko Toyama, another non-politician, and, as foreign minister, the acid- tongued Makiko Tanaka, who, like Mr Koizumi, has an image as an LDP outsider. Critically, Mr Koizumi has also kept on as minister in charge of the financial clean-up Hakuo Yanagisawa, whose tough plans for the banks have come under assault from the LDP establishment. Less likely to please the markets, however, is Mr Koizumi's strange choice for finance minister, the 79-year-old Masajuro Shiokawa, an old political ally with scant financial experience. The hope had been that he would put a fellow-reformer, such as Koichi Kato, into that job.
 The new prime minister still falls far short of the sort of platform he needs to push genuine reform. However he juggles the numbers, liberal thinkers like Mr Koizumi are a minority in the LDP. He has the support of Taku Yamasaki, whom he quickly installed as the party's secretary-general, and possibly of Mr Kato, who last autumn took on the Hashimoto faction and lost. But Mr Koizumi must reach beyond the LDP's ""anti-mainstream"" if he is to survive more than a few months. He has already started trying to sway factions within the LDP, such as that of Shizuka Kamei, which are at heart hostile to his ideas. Inevitably, this will involve compromise, as did his appointment of Taro Aso, the outgoing economics minister, to the post of LDP policy chief. Mr Aso's past fiscal policies conflict with Mr Koizumi's plans.
 Eventually, he may even have to reach outside the LDP's existing coalition partners, the Buddhist-backed New Komeito and the New Conservative Party, although he is sticking with them for now. New Komeito, which champions Japan's underdogs, is an active brake on reform. If truth be told, Mr Koizumi is closer to elements within the main opposition Democratic Party of Japan than he is to much of his own party. A fundamental realignment of Japanese politics, long predicted and long overdue, may beckon again.
 Mr Koizumi's campaign promises (""Change the LDP, change Japan"") have aroused expectations that something is about to happen for the better. Mr Koizumi's new cabinet is an interesting start. But, with his camp surrounded by counter-revolutionaries, he has only three precious months in which to turn the LDP's dismal fortunes round. After July's election comes another LDP presidential poll in September, unless the party changes its rules first. Mr Koizumi's televisual charms, winning smile and punchy soundbites will get him only so far. Japan's voters are in a brutal mood. They want nothing less than miracles.","  Will the "" Junichiro Koizumi revolution "" catch or fizzle ?

 POLITICS is in crisis. The people despair. A dashing reformer appears. The people rejoice. The reformer fails. The people despair. Never mind the surge of hope that has lifted Junichiro Koizumi, Japan's new prime minister, into power. Tokyo's hard-bitten political hacks think they have seen it all before.
 In 1993, a maverick politician, Morihiro Hosokawa, took power with promises of reform. By the following April, this bold new leader had resigned. Mr Koizumi has Mr Hosokawa's looks, charisma and heterodox appeal, though the match is not perfect: not even Mr Hosokawa was as popular.
 Accounting for Mr Koizumi's instant and overwhelming popularity is by no means easy. He comes from the same party, the discredited Liberal Democrats (LDP), as his ridiculed predecessor, Yoshiro Mori. Mr Koizumi and Mr Mori even come from the same wing of the LDP, the Mori faction, which has a distinctly conservative colour.
 Mr Koizumi has already taken a new broom to some corners of Mr Mori's cabinet (see table). But some of Mr Mori's old dinosaurs have won themselves another term in office. The two men even share many policies: Mr Koizumi's first job will be to push through an economic bundle that Mr Mori drew up in April. There is one big difference, though. In its final months, Mr Mori's cabinet had an approval rating in single figures. Amazingly, Mr Koizumi's tops 80%.
 Part of Mr Koizumi's appeal is his flair for theatre. He looks good. He sounds good. He plays the press skilfully. Where Mr Koizumi has made cabinet changes, he has brought in slick performers, like himself: Makiko Tanaka as foreign minister, for instance, and Heizo Takenaka, a bouncy academic, as economics minister. Mr Mori was a backroom co-ordinator. In the glare of the television cameras, he seemed old-fashioned and oafish. Mr Koizumi is a thoroughly modern politician, with an ear for the right soundbite. There may be fierce resistance to his plan to ""change Japan"", he says, ""but I must grit my teeth and face it.""
 Unfortunately, counter the cynics, these soundbites are creating unrealistic expectations of change. As Mr Koizumi runs into opposition to his reform plans--from his own party, his coalition partners, bureaucrats and businessmen--his ratings will falter and he will fail, just as Mr Hosokawa did. Yasuo Fukuda, the government's top spokesman, seems as uncomfortable with Mr Koizumi's soaring popularity as he was with the cabinet's dismal ratings when he served under Mr Mori. Thank you for the vote of confidence, Mr Fukuda told reporters this week. The new government would certainly do its best not to let the people down.
 In the newspapers and on the talk shows, meanwhile, the Koizumi revolution marches on. He plans to clean up the banks, voters are told, and restore competitiveness to once world-beating industries. He will sort out the government's debt problem and balance the budget. He will overhaul the bureaucracy, change education and reform the legal system. He will even rewrite the constitution. There will be nothing sacred in his zealous pursuit of structural reform.
 Mr Koizumi clearly over-reaches himself a bit. But those who patiently wait for him to honour his extravagant promises may be missing the point about what has really changed in Japan. It is not just the LDP's old-fashioned policies that turn off the voters, but its stubbornly old-fashioned way of conducting politics. Its policy presentation is execrable. Its leaders are old and unattractive and they mumble their lines, even when they read their speeches. Regardless of the substance, on which the jury is still out, Mr Koizumi represents a new style of politics in Japan. His rise to power is a sign that Tokyo's spin-free political world has at last woken up to the role that the media play in politics everywhere else.","  Junichiro Koizumi arouses great expectations .

 ""REFORM with nothing sacred,"" boomed Junichiro Koizumi in his maiden policy speech to parliament this week. Really? Japan's new prime minister was certainly generous with his promises, pledging that his ""ceaseless reform cabinet"" would battle to change politics, the economy, society and government. Now all he has to do is to fill in the details.
 One pressing subject on which Mr Koizumi did offer some particulars was his promise to clean up the government's awful finances. A decade of deficit spending has saddled Japan with 689 trillion ($5.6 trillion) of debt, making it the most heavily indebted country in the world. The budget deficit is nearly 10% of GDP. On present trends, the government's debts will double in less than a decade.
 And that is the good news. In some ways, Japan's position is even worse than it looks. Long-term interest rates of barely more than 1% keep the government's interest bill low. In fact, thanks to falling interest rates, annual interest payments have hardly budged since 1986 even though, over the same period, the government's debts have nearly tripled. What really rattles Japan's budget planners is the thought that rates might start to rise again. At worst, this could happen uncontrollably, with investors charging ever higher rates as the government's finances grow weaker and weaker. That way lies chaos, a run on the yen and economic collapse.
 Mr Koizumi promises a two-stage clean-up. As a first step, he says, the government will limit the bonds it issues in the year beginning next March to 30 trillion. Then, much harder, he will set about returning the budget to ""primary balance"", which is achieved when new loans raised go only towards servicing existing debts. This should eventually bring the growth of the government's debts under control.
 Quite how Mr Koizumi plans to achieve these feats, however, is not entirely clear. The Finance Ministry thinks it will need to issue 33.3 trillion of bonds in 2002, suggesting that, if Mr Koizumi is to meet his first pledge, he needs to find more than 3 trillion of budget cuts or extra tax revenues just to stay below the cap--itself only a start, given the mountain of accumulated debt. With the economy weakening, Mr Koizumi, in a second speech this week, appeared to have ruled out a tax increase. But if he is to attack the debt mountain, he will have to raise taxes, and by a staggering amount.
 What is now powering the government's ever-deeper descent into debt is the growth in its social-security and health-care bills. Since 1970, health spending as a proportion of GDP has doubled, and social-security spending trebled, while the government's revenues, about 30% of GDP, have grown much more modestly. Japan's problem is that it is financing European standards of welfare with American levels of taxes, and has to borrow the rest.
 The long-term solution is the sort of tax rise Mr Koizumi shows no stomach for. Heizo Takenaka, the new economics minister, is sitting on one figure. In 1998, as an adviser to a previous government, Mr Takenaka helped to draft a plan to restore the budget's primary balance by 2007. Higher corporate taxes, went the thinking then, would hurt Japan's competitiveness. Higher income taxes would take away the incentive to work. That left consumption tax, which, said Mr Takenaka, would have to rise from 5% to 14%.
 Others put the number higher still. Andrew Smithers, a London- based economist, argues that, because Japan's ageing population will drive pensions and health-care costs ever higher, the government needs to raise taxes now by the equivalent of 15% of GDP.","  Junichiro Koizumi needs to give more details

 ""REFORM with no sacred cows"" is Junichiro Koizumi's slogan, and no Japanese cow is more sacred than Article 9 of its constitution, which renounces war. So it is entirely characteristic of the new prime minister that he aims to rewrite, or at least reinterpret, the constitution to allow Japan, like other countries, to have an army-- rather than ""self-defence forces""--and to use it to take part in collective security arrangements, which it currently forswears.
 Unfortunately, as may also turn out to be characteristic of Mr Koizumi, this is a reform that he will struggle to achieve. Amending the constitution requires a two-thirds majority of the Diet, which he has not got: even a reinterpretation, though less controversial, has in the past involved a unanimous parliamentary resolution. Hostility to anything that smacks of militarism runs deep in Japan, not least within New Komeito, the main partner in Mr Koizumi's ruling coalition. But assuming that he can swing it--and the voices calling for Japan to be treated as a normal nation are growing--this is a reform that is long overdue. At present, Japan's position is anomalous. After the United States, Japan is the largest contributor to the United Nations, and to its peacekeeping budget. Yet it does not allow itself to send combat units for any of the Security Council's peacekeeping operations. Until it can back up the Security Council with men, and hence share the political risk, as well as just the cost, it cannot reasonably expect to take up the permanent seat there that it considers to be its right.
 Japan's self-defence forces--themselves the product of an earlier reinterpretation of Article 9, which on the face of it pledges that Japan will never maintain armed forces--are by far the best-equipped in Asia, and its defence spending is comparable to that of China, despite the fact that it has only a tenth the number of men in uniform that its much larger neighbour does. Yet those forces at present contribute nothing to Asian security, but for guaranteeing Japan's own defence. In the event of an American conflict--perhaps with China, over, say, the rights of passage through the South China Sea or the Taiwan Strait, matters of great strategic importance to Japan--Japan would have to let its planes and ships stand idly by.
 Any attempt by Japan to change Article 9 would be viewed with concern by its neighbours, and draw particularly loud protests from China. Japan's history--which the Japanese have failed to come to terms with as admirably as the Germans have with theirs--means that any such effort has to be handled with tact and humility, and in parallel with renewed efforts to convince its neighbours of its penitence. Japan could, to take one example, get on with compensating the tens of thousands of Korean ""comfort women""--that is, sex slaves- -whom it exploited during the war.
 Stay away from that shrine
 So it is unfortunate to see Mr Koizumi, just as he is trying to take a proper step towards what might be called nice nationalism, at the same time taking another towards its nasty counterpart, by pledging to visit its most notorious symbol.
 There is nothing innocuous about a trip to the Yasukuni shrine, in central Tokyo. It is true that it is a place where, quite reasonably, Japanese pay homage not just to the dead of the Pacific war, but also to the kami--the divine spirits--of all the 2,466,000 men and women who have lost their lives for Japan since the shrine was founded in 1869. But it also undeniable that the shrine represents a potent symbol for nationalism. The shrine's own literature makes no mention of any war guilt: it declares that ""to maintain the independence and peace of the nation and for the prosperity of all of Asia, Japan was forced into conflict."" Among the kami commemorated there are General Hideki Tojo and the six other executed Class A war criminals, as well as all those who ""were cruelly and unjustly tried by a sham-like tribunal of the Allied forces"".
 To understand how the Chinese and the Koreans might feel about a prime-ministerial visit, imagine a German chancellor attending a church commemorating Hitler, Gring, Himmler, Jodl and the rest. It is for this reason that only one post-war prime minister, Yasuhiro Nakasone in 1985, has officially visited Yasukuni, though Ryutaro Hashimoto also visited in 1996, supposedly in a private capacity.
 There are better ways to commemorate the dead. The leader of Japan's socialist party, Takako Doi, annually visits a far less controversial site, the nearby park containing a tomb for an unknown soldier.

 AMID the imperial army's field guns that rust in the spring rain lies the massive hulk of the kaiten, a manned torpedo. At the gift shop, the white-robed Shinto priest sells guidebooks, charms and telephone cards bearing photographs of a suicide aircraft, the prize exhibit in the shrine's museum. Inside, an inscription honours Japan's kamikaze warriors. Before the shrine, a middle-aged man in a black suit throws coins into the offertory box and claps his hands, summoning the spirits of friends or relations who gave their lives for their country. Two great gold chrysanthemum crests, symbols of the imperial household, emblazon the gate.
 It is to this Yasukuni shrine that Junichiro Koizumi, Japan's new prime minister, says he will pay an official visit on August 15th. Mr Koizumi says he wants to pay his respects to Japan's war dead, whose spirits Yasukuni enshrines and commemorates. Like most of what Mr Koizumi has said since he took office last month, his Yasukuni visit has struck a popular chord at home. Since the war, only Yasuhiro Nakasone has dared to worship at Yasukuni as prime minister, and even he went only once, after a barrage of criticism from China and South Korea blocked any return. Now, trumpets the right-wing press, the Japanese have a prime minister with the courage to brave foreign bullies and show pride in his nation. But if Mr Koizumi goes, there will be a huge uproar. Among the enshrined spirits are the souls of seven executed war criminals.
 What this says about Japan's new prime minister is not entirely clear. In part, he seems typical of a younger generation of conservative Japanese politicians. He wants to end the pretence of Japan's ""self-defence forces"" and call them what they are: modern, well-equipped armed forces. He seeks a more active role for Japan in its security alliance with America, including an explicit commitment to come to America's aid in the event of an attack on its forces in the region. That would mean revising, or at least reinterpreting, Japan's war-renouncing constitution, which Mr Koizumi also says he favours. He wants a more assertive Japan, ready to take its place among the world's great powers.
 Amid these modern nationalist currents lie traditional conservative roots. Mr Koizumi has spent his entire career in the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) among hawks, with what is now called the Mori faction. As a young man, he got a start in politics as a private secretary to Takeo Fukuda, the faction's boss at the time. Mr Fukuda did not support Japan's Asian empire-building with the passion of the faction's previous leader, Nobusuke Kishi, who was briefly imprisoned after the war as a suspected class A war criminal. But, as a bureaucrat in the 1930s, Mr Fukuda spent some of his formative years in China, where he advised the pro-Japanese puppet government in Nanjing. Among Mr Fukuda's protgs is Shintaro Ishihara, a populist nationalist and professional China- baiter who governs Tokyo. ""This is Mr Koizumi's DNA,"" says Takao Toshikawa, editor of Insideline, a newsletter.
 The trouble with books
 An early test of Mr Koizumi's populist leanings has come in the form of a row about Japanese history textbooks, whose contents the education ministry vets. On May 8th, South Korea handed Japan a list of revisions that it wants to see made to several textbooks for pupils aged 13 to 15. Of the 35 items on the Korean list, 25 concern a new book, edited by a group called the Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform, which China has also objected to. This society, formed in 1997, wants to rid history textbooks of what it says are excessive descriptions of the imperial army's cruelty in China and the rest of Asia. This ""tendency towards masochism"" teaches self- loathing and suppresses a healthy love for one's country, says the society.
 It also distorts history, argues Nobukatsu Fujioka, a Tokyo University professor and a founding member of the society. ""I am not saying that it did not commit acts of cruelty. But compared with the Chinese, or the Americans, the Japanese army was not unusually cruel,"" he says. In Mr Fujioka's view, Japanese schoolchildren are taught a naive version of history which plays up the moral barbarism of the Japanese army at the expense of the realpolitik of colonial Asia, with Japan battling America and the European powers for an equal and independent footing in the world.
 Right-wing newspapers such as the Yomiuri are thumping the table in protest at Korea's ""interference"" in Japan's domestic affairs, though the education ministry says it will bring together Japanese historians to look again at the textbooks, with Korea's complaints in mind. But Mr Koizumi has now said there will be no changes, prompting Chinese rage. He does propose that Japanese and Korean historians should work together, an old idea the Koreans say distracts from the issues at hand.
 If Mr Koizumi indeed turns out to be a moderate nationalist, he will be a pioneer in Japanese politics. Japan has passionate ideologues, on both left and right, but precious little in between. As the LDP's hawks try to rewrite the constitution, left-wing opposition parties still fight the security alliance with America. The Social Democratic Party pins its faith for peace in East Asia on a much-shrunken, strictly constitutional self-defence force and a multilateral ""comprehensive security system"". Mr Koizumi wants to restore national pride. But Japan's far-from-clean break with its past and its cold-war ideological battles have left almost no symbols of nationhood untainted. To the left, even the flag and the national anthem are symbols of repressive Japanese militarism, hopelessly entangled, like the Yasukuni shrine, with Japan's dark history.","  Junichiro Koizumi's has made it clear that Junichiro Koizumi is a nationalist . But it is not clear what sort of nationalist 
  AMID the imperial army 's field guns that rust in the spring rain lies the massive hulk of the kaiten , a manned torpedo . At the gift shop , the white - robed Shinto priest sells guidebooks , charms and telephone cards bearing photographs of a suicide aircraft , the prize exhibit in the shrine 's museum . Inside , an inscription honours Japan 's kamikaze warriors . Before the shrine , a middle - aged man in a black suit throws coins into the offertory box and claps his hands , summoning the spirits of friends or relations who gave their lives for their country . Two great gold chrysanthemum crests , symbols of the imperial household , emblazon the gate . 
  It is to this Yasukuni shrine that Junichiro Koizumi , Japan 's new prime minister , says Junichiro Koizumi will pay an official visit on August 15th . Junichiro Koizumi says Junichiro Koizumi wants to pay Junichiro Koizumi's respects to Japan 's war dead , whose spirits Yasukuni enshrines and commemorates . Like most of what Junichiro Koizumi has said since Junichiro Koizumi took office last month , Junichiro Koizumi's Yasukuni visit has struck a popular chord at home . Since the war , only Yasuhiro Nakasone has dared to worship at Yasukuni as prime minister , and even he went only once , after a barrage of criticism from China and South Korea blocked any return . Now , trumpets the right - wing press , the Japanese have a prime minister with the courage to brave foreign bullies and show pride in his nation . But if Junichiro Koizumi goes , there will be a huge uproar . Among the enshrined spirits are the souls of seven executed war criminals . 
  What this says about Junichiro Koizumi's is not entirely clear . In part , Junichiro Koizumi seems typical of a younger generation of conservative Japanese politicians . Junichiro Koizumi wants to end the pretence of Japan 's "" self - defence forces "" and call them what they are : modern , well - equipped armed forces . Junichiro Koizumi seeks a more active role for Japan in its security alliance with America , including an explicit commitment to come to America 's aid in the event of an attack on its forces in the region . That would mean revising , or at least reinterpreting , Japan 's war - renouncing constitution , which Junichiro Koizumi also says Junichiro Koizumi favours . Junichiro Koizumi wants a more assertive Japan , ready to take its place among the world 's great powers . 
  Amid these modern nationalist currents lie traditional conservative roots . Junichiro Koizumi has spent Junichiro Koizumi's entire career in the Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) among hawks , with what is now called the Mori faction .

 SLIDING currencies, weak stockmarkets, soaring corporate defaults: it all bears an eerie resemblance to the nightmare of 1997-98. After achieving economic growth of around 7% in both 1999 and 2000, the countries of developing East Asia are suffering a sharp slowdown. In Thailand, where the last crisis began, some analysts believe the economy may actually have shrunk in the first quarter of this year. Recoveries in the other countries worst hit in 1997-98--Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and South Korea--are all also under threat. Policymakers and multilateral lenders insist another crisis is not looming. But this month's announcement of a string of defensive ""currency-swap"" arrangements shows there are genuine concerns.
 In one respect, matters look much bleaker than they did in 1997. Then the region--most of it, anyway--was seen as politically stable. Now, from Indonesia to the Philippines, it looks explosive. In other respects, there are some uncomfortable parallels. As in 1996-97, exports from the region are sagging, and the yen is showing weakness against the dollar.
 Apart from America's immediate neighbours, no part of the world is as vulnerable as is East Asia to a downturn in demand in the world's largest economy. In non-Japan Asia, exports account for as much as 37% of regional GDP. Worse, much of the region relies heavily on sales to America's technology industry. The bursting of that bubble has thrown workers out of jobs in Asia as well as in Silicon Valley. Malaysia is the worst affected: some 80% of its exports to America are information-technology (IT) products.
 Economists now worry that two factors may make the present troubles more than a cyclical slump. The first is evidence that American firms have heavily over-invested in IT, so even if the American downturn proves short-lived, rapid recovery may not be accompanied by a similar revival in IT spending. Second, many analysts now expect the policies of Junichiro Koizumi, Japan's new prime minister, to lead to a period of continued yen weakness, despite Japan's big current-account surplus with America. As was seen in 1997, a weak yen puts competitive pressure on other Asian currencies to depreciate. Since many companies in the region still have debts denominated in dollars, that is dangerous to corporate health.
 Nevertheless, these are reasons to worry about long-term economic performance rather than about an imminent crisis. And, as the Asian Development Bank argued at its annual meetings last week, there are many reasons why the region is much less vulnerable to a sudden financial shock than it was in 1997. Of its currencies, only China's, Hong Kong's and Malaysia's are now pegged to the dollar and, of those, only Malaysia gives immediate cause for concern, though China has said that the weak yen threatens its own currency. All five ""crisis"" countries now run current-account surpluses. None is as dependent on short-term bank loans.
 Some economists even see room for optimism. Manu Bhaskaran of SG, a French securities firm, in Singapore, argues that the present shake- out in America may actually be good news for the region's exporters. He sees a strong correlation between lay-offs by American companies and American imports of Asian electronics a few months earlier. Companies replace people with machines, and machines need electronic components made in Asia, so ""bad news for American workers is good news for Asia"".
 Others look to another quarter altogether for hope: China. It is customary to see China as something of a threat to the rest of the region, because of its success in hoovering up nearly four-fifths of the foreign direct investment that comes there. But it also offers an opportunity. It remains relatively cushioned from the impact of the stuttering of other parts of the global economy, and its expected accession to the World Trade Organisation should open more of its market to Asian exporters.
 But China remains too small an economy to do much to fill the gap left by falling American demand. Nor can Japan, still wading in stagnant economic waters, or Europe take up the slack. Moreover, regional integration, which has seen intra-South-East Asian trade climb to about a fifth of the total, makes a regional export slump somewhat self-reinforcing.
 The region's leaders may be wishing they had done more to build the foundations of stronger domestic demand during the years when the American economy was cruising and pulling the rest of the world along in its wake. In particular, they may rue not having undertaken a more thorough restructuring of indebted companies, and of the banks that had lent them money. The necessary reforms always entailed painful short-term economic, social and political costs. But if they were difficult when the global economy was humming, they are very much more difficult now that it is wobbling."," East Asian leaders are worrying about a new economic downturn

 CENTRAL bankers are often assumed to spring from the same pod, with the same cautious instincts. Yet the contrast between the Bank of Japan and America's Federal Reserve could hardly be greater. After Japan's stockmarket crash in January 1990, the Bank of Japan continued to raise interest rates; it did not start cutting them until July 1991, and then modestly. Contrast that with the Fed, which has cut rates by two-and-a-half percentage points in the past five months. Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, clearly has no intention of copying the Bank of Japan by keeping policy too tight for too long.
 That was just the first in a long list of errors by Japanese policymakers. Not only was monetary policy too tight in the early 1990s; more recently the Bank of Japan has also failed to respond firmly enough to deflation. Successive governments have expanded fiscal policy, but in the shape of wasteful public works rather than cuts in income-tax rates that might have improved incentives. Banks' bad loans have been allowed to fester, and deregulation and structural reforms been delayed.
 These errors have been costly. The bursting of a bubble as vastly inflated as Japan's was always going to hurt. But with sensible policy the economy should have recovered by now. Instead, Japan has had a decade of stop-go, with average growth of just over 1%, the slowest of all the G7 economies. Japan is not only suffering a cyclical slump in demand; its long-term potential growth rate has also fallen, to only 1-1.5%, thanks largely to sluggish productivity growth. Now the economy seems to have slid into recession once again.
 Part of the blame for Japan's woes lies with politicians. Structural reforms have been repeatedly resisted by vested interests within the Liberal Democratic Party. Japan's popular new prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, now offers hope that Japan will push ahead with the reforms needed to boost long-term growth. But the Bank of Japan remains guilty for allowing deflation to persist. Deflation is a deadly disease in a country where both government and private sector are up to their necks in debt, because it increases the real burden of those debts. Worse, structural reform and a write-off of banks' bad loans may only intensify deflationary pressures.
 Short-term pain is an inevitable concomitant of structural reform: it is not an excuse for not doing it. But in Japan, the pain makes it all the more essential to accompany reform with more aggressive monetary easing (see article). The Bank of Japan cannot cut short- term interest rates, which are already zero. But, by purchasing government bonds, it could still affect the economy through inflationary expectations, a fall in the exchange rate and a rise in equity prices. Yet it is reluctant.
 The bank seems to be mostly concerned that, by creating inflation, it might let debtors off the hook and thereby reduce the pressure on firms to restructure and on the government to make structural reforms. Yet in playing this game, the Bank of Japan has failed in its primary duty as a central bank: to ensure price stability. Its agenda of pressing for structural reform and corporate restructuring, commendable as it is, is outside this mandate. Structural reform is a matter of political decision, to be taken by a democratically elected government.
 Since Masaru Hayami, the bank's governor, has so clearly failed in his main task of ensuring price stability, he should be sacked. The government should also consider altering the terms of the Bank of Japan's law. In particular, it should set a formal inflation target, as is done for some other independent central banks, such as the Bank of England. This would make the bank more accountable to parliament, while not reducing its independence in monetary operations. The Bank of Japan risks dragging the idea of central-bank independence into disrepute.

 NOBODY any longer disputes that the patient is seriously ill. Japan in recent years has exhibited the first bad case of deflation in a big economy since the 1930s. It has the highest ratio of public debt to GDP of any big economy in peacetime, though the lowest long- term rates on record somewhat temper the debt burden. Over the past decade, Japan has averaged annual growth of only just above 1%, the worst ten-year performance of any big economy in the past half- century. And now, a mere two years after it crawled out of one recession, Japan seems to have slipped back into another. What will it take to restore this patient to health?
 Deceptively, figures for GDP in the first quarter of the year, to be published in early June, are likely to show reasonable growth, if only because a new law on recycling old electrical products has encouraged households to accelerate their purchases. More telling, industrial production has plunged in the past four months by 20% at an annual rate and unemployment has risen to a near record of 4.8% in April. Plummeting American investment in information technology has hit Japanese exporters hard. In the second and third quarters of this year, GDP will probably shrink. Deflation is likely to persist into 2002.
 The country's new prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, offers hope- he is Japan's Margaret Thatcher, in the eyes of some. He wants to shift from the demand-side stimulus pursued so far to structural reform. Mr Koizumi has set three priorities: cleaning up the banks, reducing the government's huge budget deficit and deregulating the economy. A lot is riding on Mr Koizumi, yet his ambitions will be resisted by many within his own Liberal Democratic Party. But suppose he gets his way. Is this the right economic medicine?
 There is a lively debate between those who applaud Mr Koizumi's microeconomic reforms and those who urge more macroeconomic stimulus. The first camp argues that the economy will not revive without structural reforms that lift Japan's productivity growth. Besides, the argument goes, there is no room for more monetary and fiscal expansion; and what there has already been has allowed inefficient firms to survive at the cost of faster economic growth. Most economists reckon that Japan's long-term potential growth rate has fallen to 1-1.5%, down from 4% in the 1980s. Structural reformers also argue that, until banks' bad loans are written off, they will be unable to increase lending to support a recovery.
 The second camp, which includes two vocal American economists, Jeffrey Sachs and Paul Krugman, has it that Japan's slow growth over the past decade is due not to low productivity and hence insufficient supply, but to inadequate demand. Structural reforms aimed at improving the supply side of the economy may even widen the output gap (already 5% of GDP) and worsen deflation. If banks are forced to write off bad loans and foreclose on debtor firms, this will lead to rising bankruptcies and unemployment. This camp's prescription is massive monetary easing and a depreciation of the yen.
 How could Japan need a cheaper yen, when it already has a huge trade surplus? Andrew Smithers, a London-based economist, argues that Japan's biggest problem is a large net surplus of saving, a result of its demographic structure. An ageing population wants to save more than the country's firms can profitably invest. At present, this gap is matched by a total public-sector deficit (government dissaving) of 7% of GDP, and a current-account surplus of 3% of GDP. In the long run, the budget deficit is not sustainable. So if Japan is to absorb its excess saving and to have a sustainable recovery, it needs, says Mr Smithers, to run an even bigger current-account surplus. A weaker yen will also push up prices and halt deflation, so helping to solve Japan's second big problem: excessive debt. Goldman Sachs estimates that total public and private debt amounts to five times GDP. As long as deflation persists, the real debt burden will rise.
 Not one or the other, but both
 Yet the truth is that neither structural reforms nor macroeconomic stimulus will, on their own, be enough to cure Japan's ills of deflation and slow productivity growth. By itself, restructuring probably will intensify deflation in the short run, although in the long run deregulation should boost jobs and business. Mr Koizumi is naive in saying that, should his structural reforms cause the economy to contract, ""that's just too bad"". Easier monetary policy needs to accompany debt write-offs if fresh bad loans are to be avoided. Figures this week suggest that new bad loans are appearing almost as fast as banks have written off their old ones.
 By the same token, monetary or fiscal expansion alone will fail to deliver sustainable growth, because they would reduce the pressure for structural reform. And Mr Smithers is wrong to take Japan's structural savings surplus as given. Japan's high saving is due not just to an ageing population, but also to a return on capital that is about half that in America. This low return forces households to save more in order to build their desired nest-egg for retirement. Corporate restructuring would shift resources to more productive uses and thereby raise the return on capital. Households might then save less and spend more.
 Structural reform and macroeconomic stimulus must proceed hand in hand. With public debt equivalent to more than 130% of GDP, the scope for further fiscal stimulus is limited. Even so, Mr Koizumi's intention of making cuts in the budget deficit a top priority is ill- considered: to cut public spending or increase taxes at the same time as writing off bad loans would leave the economy winded. Fiscal consolidation should therefore wait until the economy is growing again.
 Yet even if the budget deficit is held at its present level for a few more years, the mix of spending and taxes could be changed to provide a more effective stimulus. Wasteful public works could be cut to make room for lower income-tax rates or a more generous unemployment safety-net, to cushion the impact of restructuring.
 Monetary madness
 If fiscal policy cannot be significantly loosened, that leaves monetary policy. Nominal short-term interest rates are zero, but real interest rates remain high. The yen's trade-weighted exchange rate is also quite high by historical standards, a sign that monetary policy is tight.
 Recognising its error in raising interest rates last August, the Bank of Japan announced a new framework for monetary policy in March. This returned interest rates to zero, but with three important twists. First, it is now targeting the level of banks' reserves (their deposits at the central bank) instead of interest rates. The Bank of Japan has to inject liquidity by offering to buy treasury bills and other securities from banks, so as to achieve its target. Second, the bank says it will stick with this policy until the core inflation rate (excluding fresh foods) rises above zero. And third, the bank has said it may, if necessary, increase its purchases of long-term government bonds to meet its goal.
 This is bold stuff. Yet so far there has been little genuine monetary loosening. The increase in reserves is too small, and the bank has failed even to meet this target several times over the past month because, with lending declining, banks do not need extra cash. Still, this is a more flexible framework within which the bank could, if it chose, pursue more aggressive monetary easing.
 Yet the Bank of Japan continues to insist that it has done all it can. It is true that the bank cannot cut interest rates further. On the other hand, ""quantitative monetary expansion""-printing money by buying bonds directly from the government-can still work at zero interest rates, through its impact in raising inflationary expectations, in pushing the yen lower, or in lifting the prices of assets such as equities.
 One way to affect expectations about inflation would be to set a formal inflation target, perhaps 0-2%. If this helped to convince firms and households that the bank would not allow prices to keep falling, it would lower real interest rates. Japan's measure of consumer-price inflation (currently minus 0.4%), is thought to overstate inflation; the true rate is probably closer to minus 2%. This August the index will be revised to include new goods and services, such as mobile-phone charges and personal computers, which have been falling sharply in price. By revealing a faster pace of deflation, it may force the central bank to do more.
 The most effective channel through which quantitative easing would work is the exchange rate. Printing lots of money should push down the yen and help to create inflation and to lift exports. Tadashi Nakamae, an independent Japanese economist, estimates that the yen's purchasing-power parity is around Yen 160 to the dollar. So long as the exchange rate remains at around Yen 120, deflationary pressure will persist, as the yen moves towards this purchasing-power parity through a decline in prices rather than a fall in the exchange rate.
 The snag is that a falling yen is likely to meet with complaints from Japan's trade partners. But America might accept a weaker yen were it combined with serious structural reforms. Japan's Asian neighbours are also concerned: a fall in the yen helped to trigger their currency crises in 1997-98. But most Asian currencies now float, so they can slide down with the yen. China, whose currency is still pegged to the dollar, has already complained that the fall in the yen over the past year has hurt its economy. However, in the longer term the strength of Japan's economy is more important for the region than the strength of the yen.
 Further monetary easing is essential to halt deflation. So why has the Bank of Japan resisted it? First, because it worries that quantitative easing might be ineffective, thereby undermining its credibility. And second, it frets that a massive monetisation of debt might create runaway inflation. These worries underscore the bank's muddleheadedness. What credibility does it still have, after years of deflation? And how can it argue that an expansionary policy will not work, while at the same time worrying about hyperinflation?
 The bank also worries about something more substantial. If it buys government bonds, and if this increases inflationary expectations (the point of the policy), bond yields could rise. This would reduce the value of the huge amount of bonds held by banks, further damaging their balance sheets. But this is only half the picture: if it succeeded in ending deflation, the Bank of Japan would help to reduce banks' losses on their loan portfolios, which are bigger than those on their bond portfolios.
 The last, but probably most important reason for the Bank of Japan's stubbornness is that it is unwilling to stimulate the economy until the government cleans up the banking system and forces firms to restructure. The bank believes that inflation would erode firms' debts and so ease the pressure to restructure. It is true that, without reform, productivity growth will remain low, but by imposing deflation for longer than necessary across the whole economy, the bank is playing a dangerous game. Its mandate does not-and should not- include structural reform.
 The main responsibility of any central bank is to promote price stability. Allowing deflation is a greater sin than allowing inflation. But even if the central bank sees sense, there will be no painless cure for Japan. If structural reforms are not implemented, the latest recession may be mild, but, according to Tetsufumi Yamakawa, an economist at Goldman Sachs, long-term potential growth may decline to only 0.6% a year by 2009, as productivity growth stalls and the labour force shrinks. If Mr Koizumi pushes through reforms, then, even with monetary easing, the recession may be deeper. But after that, estimates Mr Yamakawa, Japan's potential growth rate could increase to 2-3% within a decade.
 Such figures illustrate how expensive has been the perpetual delay of reform. Though structural reform is deflationary in the short term, it is still necessary. The Japanese patient needs both structural reform and aggressive monetary stimulus, and it needs them now.","  After a decade of sluggish growth , what is the right medicine for Japan ? 
  NOBODY any longer disputes that the patient is seriously ill . Japan in recent years has exhibited the first bad case of deflation in a big economy since the 1930s . It has the highest ratio of public debt to GDP of any big economy in peacetime , though the lowest long- term rates on record somewhat temper the debt burden . Over the past decade , Japan has averaged annual growth of only just above 1 % , the worst ten - year performance of any big economy in the past half- century . And now , a mere two years after it crawled out of one recession , Japan seems to have slipped back into another . What will it take to restore this patient to health ? 
  Deceptively , figures for GDP in the first quarter of the year , to be published in early June , are likely to show reasonable growth , if only because a new law on recycling old electrical products has encouraged households to accelerate their purchases . More telling , industrial production has plunged in the past four months by 20 % at an annual rate and unemployment has risen to a near record of 4.8 % in April . Plummeting American investment in information technology has hit Japanese exporters hard . In the second and third quarters of this year , GDP will probably shrink . Deflation is likely to persist into 2002 . 
  Junichiro Koizumi's , offers hope- Junichiro Koizumi is Japan 's Margaret Thatcher , in the eyes of some . Junichiro Koizumi wants to shift from the demand - side stimulus pursued so far to structural reform . Junichiro Koizumi has set three priorities : cleaning up the banks , reducing the government 's huge budget deficit and deregulating the economy . A lot is riding on Junichiro Koizumi , yet Junichiro Koizumi's ambitions will be resisted by many within Junichiro Koizumi's own Liberal Democratic Party . But suppose Junichiro Koizumi gets Junichiro Koizumi's way . Is this the right economic medicine ? 
  There is a lively debate between those who applaud Junichiro Koizumi's microeconomic reforms and those who urge more macroeconomic stimulus . The first camp argues that the economy will not revive without structural reforms that lift Japan 's productivity growth . Besides , the argument goes , there is no room for more monetary and fiscal expansion ; and what there has already been has allowed inefficient firms to survive at the cost of faster economic growth . Most economists reckon that Japan 's long - term potential growth rate has fallen to 1 - 1.5 % , down from 4 % in the 1980s . Structural reformers also argue that , until banks ' bad loans are written off , they will be unable to increase lending to support a recovery . 
  The second camp , which includes two vocal American economists , Jeffrey Sachs and Paul Krugman , has it that Japan 's slow growth over the past decade is due not to low productivity and hence insufficient supply , but to inadequate demand . Structural reforms aimed at improving the supply side of the economy may even widen the output gap ( already 5 % of GDP ) and worsen deflation . If banks are forced to write off bad loans and foreclose on debtor firms , this will lead to rising bankruptcies and unemployment . This camp 's prescription is massive monetary easing and a depreciation of the yen . 
  How could Japan need a cheaper yen , when it already has a huge trade surplus ? Andrew Smithers , a London - based economist , argues that Japan 's biggest problem is a large net surplus of saving , a result of its demographic structure . An ageing population wants to save more than the country 's firms can profitably invest . At present , this gap is matched by a total public - sector deficit ( government dissaving ) of 7 % of GDP , and a current - account surplus of 3 % of GDP . In the long run , the budget deficit is not sustainable . So if Japan is to absorb its excess saving and to have a sustainable recovery , it needs , says Mr Smithers , to run an even bigger current - account surplus . A weaker yen will also push up prices and halt deflation , so helping to solve Japan 's second big problem : excessive debt . Goldman Sachs estimates that total public and private debt amounts to five times GDP . As long as deflation persists , the real debt burden will rise . 
  Not one or the other , but both 
  Yet the truth is that neither structural reforms nor macroeconomic stimulus will , on their own , be enough to cure Japan 's ills of deflation and slow productivity growth . By itself , restructuring probably will intensify deflation in the short run , although in the long run deregulation should boost jobs and business . Junichiro Koizumi is naive in saying that , should Junichiro Koizumi's structural reforms cause the economy to contract , "" that 's just too bad "" . Easier monetary policy needs to accompany debt write - offs if fresh bad loans are to be avoided . Figures this week suggest that new bad loans are appearing almost as fast as banks have written off their old ones . 
  By the same token , monetary or fiscal expansion alone will fail to deliver sustainable growth , because they would reduce the pressure for structural reform . And Mr Smithers is wrong to take Japan 's structural savings surplus as given . Japan 's high saving is due not just to an ageing population , but also to a return on capital that is about half that in America . This low return forces households to save more in order to build their desired nest - egg for retirement . Corporate restructuring would shift resources to more productive uses and thereby raise the return on capital . Households might then save less and spend more . 
  Structural reform and macroeconomic stimulus must proceed hand in hand . With public debt equivalent to more than 130 % of GDP , the scope for further fiscal stimulus is limited . Even so , Junichiro Koizumi's intention of making cuts in the budget deficit a top priority is ill- considered : to cut public spending or increase taxes at the same time as writing off bad loans would leave the economy winded . Fiscal consolidation should therefore wait until the economy is growing again . 
  Yet even if the budget deficit is held at its present level for a few more years , the mix of spending and taxes could be changed to provide a more effective stimulus . Wasteful public works could be cut to make room for lower income - tax rates or a more generous unemployment safety - net , to cushion the impact of restructuring . 
  Monetary madness 
  If fiscal policy can not be significantly loosened , that leaves monetary policy . Nominal short - term interest rates are zero , but real interest rates remain high . The yen 's trade - weighted exchange rate is also quite high by historical standards , a sign that monetary policy is tight . 
  Recognising its error in raising interest rates last August , the Bank of Japan announced a new framework for monetary policy in March . This returned interest rates to zero , but with three important twists . First , it is now targeting the level of banks ' reserves ( their deposits at the central bank ) instead of interest rates . The Bank of Japan has to inject liquidity by offering to buy treasury bills and other securities from banks , so as to achieve its target . Second , the bank says it will stick with this policy until the core inflation rate ( excluding fresh foods ) rises above zero . And third , the bank has said it may , if necessary , increase its purchases of long - term government bonds to meet its goal . 
  This is bold stuff . Yet so far there has been little genuine monetary loosening . The increase in reserves is too small , and the bank has failed even to meet this target several times over the past month because , with lending declining , banks do not need extra cash . Still , this is a more flexible framework within which the bank could , if it chose , pursue more aggressive monetary easing .

 WILL Junichiro Koizumi do the double? Talk that Japan's prime minister may call a snap election for parliament's lower house at the same time as the upper-house poll in July will not die away. The odds ought to favour a double election: opinion polls suggest that Mr Koizumi's reform-minded cabinet enjoys the support of almost every voter in Japan. Yet Mr Koizumi's position is unusual. A victory for his party, the Liberal Democrats (LDP), might hurt his cause, not help it.
 Mr Koizumi is, of course, wrestling with the old problem of Japan's muddled party politics. Some of the most ardent supporters of his reforms, which centre on smaller, more open government and a reinvigorated private sector, sit on the opposition benches. His biggest enemies, on the other hand, lie within his own party. Already, Mr Koizumi's push to shrink Japan's bloated road-building budget has met with howls of protest from the LDP's road tribe, a group of political neanderthals who dedicate themselves to the grubby, money-soaked business of paving the countryside with asphalt. From the opposition benches, meanwhile, comes hardly a murmur of dissent. For all his popularity with the public, Mr Koizumi lacks the support within the LDP's parliamentary party to take on the likes of the road tribe in an open fight. So some of his supporters are urging him to go to the voters, and return with a stronger mandate for reform. Yet it is the fear of what might happen at the polls that helps to keep Mr Koizumi's enemies in the LDP in check. They do not attack him openly. Instead, they snipe at his foreign minister, the redoubtable Makiko Tanaka, a woman whose outspokenness is unsettling those who prefer Japan's usual ultra-cautious diplomacy.
 With the lower-house election out of the way, however, Mr Koizumi himself could become fair game. In fact, it may be the upper-house election, scheduled for July 29th, that offers Mr Koizumi his biggest chance to shake up Japanese politics. The opposition parties have pinned all their hopes on winning this election. Yukio Hatoyama, leader of the Democratic Party, the biggest of the opposition forces, says he will use control of the upper house to block legislation and so force an early general election. But Mr Koizumi's extraordinary popularity has thrown Mr Hatoyama's plans into disarray.
 If the Democrats lose at July's polls, they have nowhere to go. Except, perhaps, into government. Since taking office in April, Mr Koizumi has been careful not to rule out co-operating with the Democrats, even hinting, from time to time, that he would welcome it. If Mr Hatoyama did join hands with Mr Koizumi, the Democrats would undoubtedly split. A large minority, descendants of old cold-war socialists, would never brook Mr Koizumi's calls for more active defence forces. Yet the party might split anyway. A few younger Democrats have openly voiced their support for Mr Koizumi, and many more admire him in private.
 With more reformers in government, meanwhile, the LDP's road tribe and other cavemen may be encouraged to go.

 AN UNWANTED dam in Nagano. A controversial tax on plastic bags in Tokyo. A fight in Chiba to save precious wetlands from the bulldozers. The stuff of Japanese local politics might seem low- grade fare beside the larger drama now unfolding on the national stage. Yet amid the talk of a revolution in Nagatacho, Tokyo's political district, it is important not to forget the many minor acts of rebellion that went before it. Junichiro Koizumi, Japan's reformist prime minister, came to power in April on a wave that began, in a thousand small ways, in the regions.
 The most eye-catching change has been among Japan's local political leaders, until recently as grey and as dull as their counterparts in Tokyo. In October, the conservative voters of Nagano, a rural prefecture, chose as their new governor Yasuo Tanaka, a chubby playboy novelist with a fondness for tight leather suits. In March, the people of Chiba, another conservative bastion, elected as their governor Akiko Domoto, a former journalist who began her campaign with no party backing and a support group of just 60 people. Shintaro Ishihara, the novelist and media celebrity who governs Tokyo, has brought life and colour-and a worrying whiff of nationalism-to the capital's politics.
 It is not just their style that sets these politicians apart. Traditionally, Japan's 47 prefectural governors have enjoyed intimate ties with the old home-affairs ministry (now part of the leviathan Ministry of Public Management, Home Affairs, Posts and Telecoms), a throwback to the pre-war system under which the ministry appointed Japan's regional bosses directly.
 Even now, despite more than 50 years of democratic governors' elections, over half of the governors are still ex-bureaucrats. Thanks to the nodal position of the prefectures, sitting as they do between the centre and Japan's 3,200 municipal governments, these ties have helped to preserve in modern Japan some of the features of pre-war society: uniform, centrally-determined policies and docile obedience in carrying them out. But Japan's economic woes have dragged the reputation for economic competence of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) through the mud, and all the old frustrations with top-down rule-which last surfaced in the 1960s-have come bubbling to the surface again.
 The evidence is everywhere. In Nagano, Mr Tanaka won with the support of citizens' groups that opposed a dam the construction ministry wanted built against the wishes of local residents. Akio Fukuda won in Tochigi on a similar platform. Masayasu Kitagawa, the governor of Mie prefecture and a pioneer of the new confrontational style, won celebrity last year by opposing the construction of a nuclear power plant. The government and the utility company, Chubu Electric, had been trying to build this plant, against local opposition, for 37 years.
 In Chiba, Miss Domoto wants to cancel a land-reclamation project that Tokyo's bureaucrats have been pushing for nearly 30 years. The project, which would create land for new factories, has long since stopped making sense, says Miss Domoto: thanks to the weak economy, Chiba has plenty of empty factory space already.
 Calls for referendums are being heard all over Japan, on all manner of issues from rubbish dumps to airports. Local politicians have begun to realise that there are votes in championing them. After a referendum in Tokushima in which the locals voted against a new dam, the mayor, a construction-ministry old boy, abandoned his support for the project. Instead, he threw in his lot with the anti- dam lobby and was duly re-elected.
 Along with opposition to the centre comes a more humble approach to government. Here and there, the usual arbitrary rule is giving way to more enlightened attitudes. In Mie Mr Kitagawa has introduced a system to evaluate the cost- effectiveness of major items in the prefectural budget. Everything is disclosed, for voters to see, on the Internet. In six years, says Mr Kitagawa, 800 of the prefecture's 3,300 budget items have disappeared. Mr Tanaka's administration in Nagano has become so transparent that he even sits behind glass walls, through which voters can see their governor at work.
 Clearly, Mr Koizumi owes a debt to the regions. With his sharp suits and his flair for political theatre, his style borrows heavily from the most popular of Japan's new governors. His reforms, meanwhile, mirror their confrontational politics. A plan to review the huge road budget pits Mr Koizumi against his own party's strong construction tribe. A call to reduce local-government subsidies takes on the bureaucrats of the old home-affairs ministry. ""Reform with no sacred cows"" sounds a suitably revolutionary note for a man who himself came to power-against the wishes of the antique leadership of the LDP in Tokyo-thanks to a revolt among the party's local chapters.
 Yet it should be remembered that, besides championing this revolution, Mr Koizumi must also find time to lead his party. Miss Domoto, Mr Tanaka, Mr Ishihara and the other unruly governors owe their success to their independence. No party affiliation binds them to the establishment: they attack it from outside. Superficially, Mr Koizumi resembles them. Yet if his reform drive were to falter, the voters might come to see him not as Japan's salvation, but as just another part of its problem.
 If that happened, his support could quickly melt away. In 1868, samurai from the two remote southern domains of Satsuma and Choshu seized the imperial palace in Kyoto, declared the restoration of the Meiji emperor and brought to a sudden end two-and-a-half centuries of rule by the Tokugawa shogunate. Mr Koizumi will need to watch his back.","  Once the pliant tools of Tokyo , the governors of Japan 's 47 prefectures are starting to assert themselves

A plan to review the huge road budget pits Junichiro Koizumi against Junichiro Koizumi's own party 's strong construction tribe . A call to reduce local - government subsidies takes on the bureaucrats of the old home - affairs ministry . "" Reform with no sacred cows "" sounds a suitably revolutionary note for a man who Junichiro Koizumi came to power - against the wishes of the antique leadership of the LDP in Tokyo - thanks to a revolt among the party 's local chapters . 
  Yet it should be remembered that , besides championing this revolution , Junichiro Koizumi must also find time to lead Junichiro Koizumi's party . Miss Domoto , Mr Tanaka , Mr Ishihara and the other unruly governors owe their success to their independence . No party affiliation binds them to the establishment : they attack it from outside . Superficially , Junichiro Koizumi resembles them . Yet if Junichiro Koizumi's reform drive were to falter , the voters might come to see Junichiro Koizumi not as Japan 's salvation , but as just another part of its problem . 
  If that happened , Junichiro Koizumi's support could quickly melt away . In 1868 , samurai from the two remote southern domains of Satsuma and Choshu seized the imperial palace in Kyoto , declared the restoration of the Meiji emperor and brought to a sudden end two - and - a - half centuries of rule by the Tokugawa shogunate . Junichiro Koizumi will need to watch Junichiro Koizumi's back .",740,Japan,A29-8209,IN TERM,True,"Junichiro Koizumi , Japan 's reformist prime minister ,",17,True

 SIR America suffers from ""a pathological obsession with safety"" because we foster such a monstrously litigious society (""Free Jenna!"", June 9th). There is a significant industry reaping profit through blame. There can be few faultless ""accidents"" any more.
 The parental hand-holding role of government and business is a self-perpetuating liability. To the toner-cartridge company that warns its customers not to eat the contents add the fast-food chain that prints ""Caution-contents hot!"" on its coffee cup, the school that disallows playground games, the firm that forbids lunchtime drinking or the garage that bans risque pin-up calendars. They are not protecting the consumer or employee but protecting themselves.

 SIR I must take issue with your comparison of Jenna Bush to The Maid of Orleans. Joan was born into what was, at best, a lower- middle-class family; Jenna was born into a wealthy, privileged and powerful dynasty. By the age of 19, Joan had helped reverse the outcome of the Hundred Years' war, crowned a king, conquered numerous cities, attempted to escape from prison by jumping from a high tower, successfully sparred with learned theological scholars at her trial and bravely died the death of a true martyr. By the same age, Jenna's main accomplishment has been to try (and fail) to buy booze. Americans may be puritanical but the hapless Jenna does not hold a candle (or a shotglass) to St Joan.
 Richard Einhorn; New York
 SIR I cannot agree with your comparison between smoking and drinking. There is nothing illiberal about restrictions on public smoking. If I sit next to a drinker, I am not required to share his beer; if I am one table over from a parachutist, I am not expected to throw myself out of a plane. Smoking, by its nature, is a participatory activity involving those nearby whether they wish it or not.
 Christophe Pettus; London
 SIR In the pantheon of silly laws you forget to mention America's speed limits. Even as highway deaths continue to drop and cars continue to get safer, we are forced to drive more slowly on our roads than any other nation. This is because we seem unable to provide proper driver training and prefer to feed the coffers of police departments with the billions of dollars they raise every year by ticketing the drivers who simply cannot maintain the effort required to drive at 65mph on roads designed to be safe at much higher speeds.
 David Ashe; Key Biscayne, Florida
 SIR Although I thoroughly agree with the rant against American puritanism, I find it somewhat ironic that such a spirited argument comes from a newspaper published in a country where finding a drink after the silly 11pm last call is damn near impossible.

 Britain and Japan
 SIR Britain's so-called democracy drove two native populations to the brink of extinction in Australia and North America (""A normal country"", May 19th). Neither Hitler nor Hirohito managed this. Britain also executed the opium war-the most shameless in the history of mankind-and behaved as the devil incarnate towards the closest we have to a modern-day saint: Gandhi. Britain has never apologised for these deeds.
 I am a leftish Japanese citizen and am dead against the new prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi. Naturally, I am sympathetic to your apprehensions about his nationalistic streak but would you turn a fraction of your critical eye to Britain's past? This would make your articles on Japan and elsewhere even more persuasive.

 Blind ambition
 SIR Bagehot (June 9th) suggests that David Blunkett's inability to deal with vast amounts of paperwork because of his blindness might prevent him from becoming prime minister. Is it not possible that this has contributed to his success? Rather than being overwhelmed with detail from his department he perhaps has more opportunity to consider the broader picture.

 Holiday in Nigeria
 SIR You paint an unpleasant picture of Nigeria and its largest city, Lagos (""Tourism in Nigeria"", June 9th). After making regular trips to Lagos over the past year, I have to report that the truth is, as usual, more subtle. Theft is endemic at all levels of society, the roads are chaotic, and services such as water, electricity and telephones are generally unavailable.
 However, Nigerians are warm, polite, organised and ambitious. There is none of the desolation of the spirit one sees in countries like Angola and Congo. Nigerians have embraced their nascent democracy. Armed police still man roadblocks but no longer demand money. The immigration and customs officials at Lagos's airport are friendlier and more efficient than anywhere else I have been to in Africa. Lagos can be scary, but no more so than the wrong side of an American city. It is still hard to get a tourist visa but anyone lucky enough to visit Nigeria will find a country filled with optimism and energy and the kind of nightlife that made Kinshasa famous in years gone by. Just leave your credit card at home.
 Pieter Hintjens; Brussels
 Britain and the euro
 SIR Your leader about the convenience or not of Britain joining the euro is a supreme expression of common sense (""And now for Europe?"", June 9th). It appears that Tony Blair considers it fashionable to be pro-euro but the truth is that no one knows for sure what kind of European Union we will have in five years' time, particularly after the Irish rejection of the Nice treaty. I think that until Europe adopts a constitutional framework, like the one you proposed last year, Mr Blair should remember the Spanish saying: ""it is worth more to be alone than to be in the wrong company"" (like Lionel Jospin).
 Jorge Payet; Madrid
 SIR Your arguments in favour of delaying a referendum on the euro are inconclusive. First, not enough is known about the assumptions of investors to correlate the high rate of foreign direct investment in Britain in the second half of the 1990s with our being outside the euro zone. It was only in October 1997 that the government said we would not be in the first wave, though it was broadly positive about our joining ultimately.
 On the effect of non-membership on Britain's political influence in Brussels, you are easily convinced by Tony Blair's denial. What else would you expect him to say while he holds fire on a referendum? It is true from a constitutional point of view that Britain's legislative rights in Brussels are unaffected but the group of 12 euro-zone finance ministers that meets, so far informally, can form a winning majority on an issue ahead of a vote in Ecofin and sideline Britain.
 Common sense suggests that Britain's ability to influence matters in Brussels would be much the stronger for participation in the European Union's most ambitious project to date. It seems perverse to wait until 2004 at the earliest to find that out for sure.

 Losses at sea
 SIR An important benefit of containerisation that you omit from your obituary of Malcolm McLean (June 2nd) was the end of wholesale pilferage. I was at sea for four years from 1942 and stealing by stevedores was rife. The mobs controlled the docks. On a trip to Port Elizabeth the hold contained a shipment of registered United States mail. After the ship cleared port the mate came to me-I was purser- with a cut-open canvas bag. Every bit of mail had gone.

 Law of diminishing returns
 SIR Russia's legal system is indeed in need of reform (""The path to reform-or another dead end?"" June 2nd). But low pay, and widespread corruption and incompetence are traits shared with Russia's police force. An accountable legal system is dependent on the enforcer on the street and Russians have no faith in their policemen. They are thought to be open to bribery, as well as being racist, corrupt and often downright criminal. Without a well-trained police force which is both respected and trusted, the law in Russia will still be selective and justice will not prevail.
 George Goss; Prague
 Kazakhs and democracy
 SIR Why do you find it newsworthy, much less bizarre, that Kazakhstan's government ruthlessly stifles political opposition, or that most Kazakhs demonstrate little enthusiasm for participatory democracy (""Don't know, don't care in Kazakhstan"", June 9th)? The authoritarian clique is understandably determined to keep control and enhance illicit self-enrichment. To sustain this scam with essential hard-currency contributions from western aid donors and foreign investors, it must keep the republic's few courageous activists from gaining public exposure. A media monopoly and brutal intimidation are essential planks of this totalitarian platform.
 As for the ""passive"" citizens, no living Kazakh has ever experienced participatory democracy. Most do not understand its fundamental precepts, local relevance or potential benefits. Nurturing democratic awareness and transition in the face of zealous government resistance will be a slow, determined intrusion. Only when western patrons give democratic development equal weight to petroleum development will Kazakhstan's neglected citizens begin to know and care.

 Thatcher's long shadow
 SIR The Economist perpetually delights in lauding the Thatcher years. So besotted are you that you mention her name-or derivatives thereof-nine times in your article on Blairism (""Tony's big ambitions"", June 9th). What you fail to mention is that while Margaret Thatcher was one of the most effective politicians since the second world war she is perhaps the most detested. Her style, like her reforms, is remembered by many as hard and brutal, cruel even, creating an image of the Tories as a heartless and insensitive party in the minds of many voters. If the Thatcherite revolution is seen as necessary but painful then many Britons still bear the scars and feel the associated pain.
 The memory of Mrs Thatcher's swinging hatchet has damaged not only the British psyche but also the Tory party itself. To attain power again the Tories must distance themselves from the trauma of Thatcherism and dream up their own brand of ""compassionate conservatism"". British voters, once viciously mauled, are proving very wary indeed.

 No joke king
 SIR You say that ""France's monarchists are, deservedly, a joke"" (Charlemagne, June 9th). I am one of your ""mad monarchists"" who, with thousands of others, is ashamed of our French republic, the gueuse, scandals, embezzlement, corruption, inefficiency, and, of course, the past Trotskyite treason of our prime minister. What is the joke?

 SIR For the benefit of American readers could you provide an explanation of the more quaint English phrases that appear in your articles? Case in point: ""cock-a-hoop"" (Lexington, June 2nd). To my ears, this sounds like something one might buy in a San Francisco ""speciality"" shop.

 Letter from the Editor
 MADAMS, SIRS - In the first issue to use our new design, I invited readers to send me their reactions (""Our new design"", May 12th). Well, The Economist's readers are no shrinking violets. More than 750 have already written in, and the letters and e-mails are still arriving. And I am delighted to report that the response has been overwhelmingly positive.
 Human nature being what it is, anger tends to prompt more people to write letters to editors than pleasure. Yet a full two-thirds of correspondents said they were either definitely (436) or mainly (75) in favour of our new clothes. Of the third who were critical, only 82 people were clearly and strongly opposed. Many of the other 184 ""critical"" letters were put in that pile simply because nothing positive was said in them, and no clue was offered to the writers' overall feelings.
 There were many specific criticisms, both in the positive and the negative letters. We shall reflect upon them all as we review our progress with the new design after its first few months. The largest number concerned the new arrangements for The world this week and Contents, so I shall be thinking particularly hard about those pages.
 One fear loomed especially large in the negative letters. It was that The Economist now looked less different from other magazines, notably our American rivals Time, Newsweek and BusinessWeek, so presumably we were going to become more like them in other ways, too, running cover stories on celebrities, or self-help, or the 25 top this or that. Fear not: we won't be. Vive la difference.

 NEVER has austerity been so popular. Each week brings news of fresh wounds to Japan's bloodied economy. Exports are falling, company profits have collapsed, manufacturing production is slumping and the stockmarket looks perilously weak. In all likelihood, Japan is already back in recession, for the fourth time in ten years. Yet nothing can touch the prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, whose popularity rises as Japan's economic fortunes sink. On the contrary, pain is part of Mr Koizumi's pact with the voters.
 His economic plans, due to be unwrapped on June 21st, could well push Japan deeper into recession. At their centre sit two pledges: to tighten public spending and to clean up the banks, which labour under a mountain of bad debts. A proper cleansing of the banks, which Mr Koizumi promises to finish in two to three years, will mean doing something about their dud borrowers in the building, property and retail industries. Many companies will have to go bankrupt, putting hundreds of thousands, perhaps even millions, of people out of work. Cutting government spending at the same time will, of course, add to the general suffering, which is why some economists say Mr Koizumi should clean up the banks first and the government's finances later.
 But the Japanese must bear the double pain, says Mr Koizumi. Only then will the economy rid itself of its rotten parts. In part, this extraordinary purgative finds favour because of past policy mistakes. The problems at the banks date back ten years or more. Until now, the government has concentrated on promoting economic growth through extra public works, tax cuts and so on. Growth has come, in spurts. But it has not come abundantly enough to bail out the banks, whose bad debts constantly threaten to bring on a full-blown financial crisis. The debts that the government has run up in the meantime, moreover, now threaten to bring on a public-sector financial crisis as well.
 While these policies were failing, Mr Koizumi's party, the Liberal Democrats (LDP), split into two camps. One favoured yet more economic stimulus, with reform coming later, if at all. The other fought to tackle the banks and the borrowers first. In the pro-stimulus camp were LDP leaders like Keizo Obuchi, who pursued spending and postponed reform. In the hit-the-banks group sit people like Mr Koizumi.
 Tussles over party reform harden the divisions. The pro-spenders see nothing wrong with the LDP's old-fashioned ways. The anti- spenders consider those ways part of the same Japanese disease, money politics. So the anti-spenders are also anti-LDP, which adds to their attraction. As the wildly popular Mr Koizumi puts it: ""Change the LDP, change Japan."" And so there has grown up among reformers in Japan a whole philosophy of pain. Government spending props up bad old habits, keeping duff companies going and rewarding their sins with plum public contracts. Banks, building companies, property developers, gangsters, politicians and bureaucrats cannot hope to cleanse each other. Corruption binds them in secret ties of interdependence, making the political economy beyond rescue: better to burn down the lot and build again.
 It is not just Mr Koizumi who seems to believe in the politics of pain. The opposition Democratic Party pushes shock therapy too. Its policymakers merrily talk about putting 2m people out of work. Journalists and economic pundits cheer them on. To the Japanese ear, there is martial poetry in Mr Koizumi's resolve to suffer-like a samurai warrior's noble death restoring honour to a worthless life. For now, the voters love the sound of it. But modern Japanese are softer than their ancestors, and the real pain has hardly begun.","  Junichiro Koizumi pledges economic disaster , and the voters love Junichiro Koizumi for it

The anti- spenders consider those ways part of the same Japanese disease , money politics . So the anti - spenders are also anti - LDP , which adds to their attraction . As Junichiro Koizumi puts it : "" Change the LDP , change Japan . "" And so there has grown up among reformers in Japan a whole philosophy of pain . Government spending props up bad old habits , keeping duff companies going and rewarding their sins with plum public contracts . Banks , building companies , property developers , gangsters , politicians and bureaucrats can not hope to cleanse each other . Corruption binds them in secret ties of interdependence , making the political economy beyond rescue : better to burn down the lot and build again . 
  It is not just Mr Koizumi who seems to believe in the politics of pain . The opposition Democratic Party pushes shock therapy too . Its policymakers merrily talk about putting 2 m people out of work . Journalists and economic pundits cheer them on . To the Japanese ear , there is martial poetry in Junichiro Koizumi's resolve to suffer - like a samurai warrior 's noble death restoring honour to a worthless life . For now , the voters love the sound of it . But modern Japanese are softer than their ancestors , and the real pain has hardly begun .",740,Japan,A29-8209,IN TERM,True,Junichiro Koizumi,12,True

 EVER since his days as a young, wide-eyed politician, Junichiro Koizumi has wanted to privatise Japan's powerful post office. He came closer to his goal when he was elected prime minister in April. One of his first acts was to set up an advisory panel, stuffed with pro- reformers, to look at post-office reform. The panel, which met for the first time this month, is already demanding that the government- run postal savings system disclose all sorts of figures, including the true extent of its unrealised profits and losses.
 Yet change will not be easy. With Yen 255 trillion ($2.1 trillion) of deposits, Japan's postal savings system is the biggest financial institution in the world. When prodded, it flexes political muscle through its huge branch network, whose employees are staunch supporters of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
 To be fair, the post office has been reformed a little in recent years. Its funds, which traditionally provided the government with a ""shadow"" budget, no longer fill the coffers of the finance ministry. In 2003, the post office will be turned into an ""independent"" public company. Afterwards, if Mr Koizumi gets his way, it might even be privatised. This would represent ""the most significant and difficult structural change in Japanese finance"" since the second world war, argues Thomas Cargill, professor of economics at the University of Nevada, and Naoyuki Yoshino, professor of economics at Keio University in Tokyo, in a recent paper on the postal savings system.
 Further post-office reform could boost Japan's ailing financial system in several ways. Postal savings accounts make up 35% of all household deposits, nearly as much as all deposits in commercial banks put together. The postal insurance business has Yen 117 trillion in policies, and controls more than a third of the country's life-insurance market. Traditionally, the government has been able to pour much of this money into its own programmes, such as state- housing loans or inefficient public-works projects. It has invested most of the remainder in government bonds. Critics argue that this has prevented money from flowing into higher-yielding assets, such as equities or venture start-ups, in a way that would help the economy to grow.
 Competitors of the post office also want to be able to compete on even terms. For years, bankers have resented the perks that the postal savings system enjoys. It pays no taxes. Its deposits are guaranteed by the government, an attraction to depositors worried about the state of the banking system. For now, the banks also have a government-guaranteed safety net. But this will be withdrawn next April. Meanwhile, banks pay a premium for deposit insurance, while the post office gets it free.
 Without having to worry about profitability, the post office has come up with products that private-sector rivals cannot hope to match: more flexible deposit accounts with higher rates of interest, for instance. Life-insurance companies have also suffered. They argue that the post office started to raise rates of return on its policies in the 1980s, forcing the insurers to follow suit. The burden of these high payouts has already led several life insurers to go bust, and has left the rest greatly weakened.
 The post office has also been able to cross-sell its three main products (postal services, savings and insurance), unlike banks and insurance companies, which are prohibited from entering each other's businesses. It enjoys greater freedom from inspectors and regulators, since, as a government agency, it does not fall under the thumb of the Financial Services Agency. What is more, the post office has no external auditors to check its accounts. Rather, these are examined by bureaucrats in the Ministry of Public Management, Home Affairs, Posts and Telecommunications (MPHPT), to which the postal savings agency also happens to belong.
 Banks and insurers have long argued that the post office was never meant to compete with the private sector. It was set up in 1875 to offer small-lot deposits and insurance policies that were not offered by banks or insurers at the time. Now, nearly half of the retail banks' deposits are defined as small, as are nearly three-quarters of life-insurance policies. Although the 24,700 post offices across the country do indeed serve people in areas where there are no banks, Mr Cargill suggests that the post office could rent out these facilities to retail banks, so earning a fee-based income.
 Whether any of these mooted changes will happen in 2003 is unclear. The signs are not promising. Bankers are worried that reforms could end up sharpening the post office's competitive edge, by letting it participate in areas from which it is currently excluded. Meanwhile, the MPHPT insists on drawing up the reform legislation behind closed doors. Banks and insurers have repeatedly asked to take part in the process, but so far the ministry has not let them.
 For now, reformers hope that Mr Koizumi will ensure that the postal savings system will eventually be deregulated. But with so many interests dug in, the prime minister and his supporters face a huge battle to dismantle the most powerful financial institution in the country.","  There is talk of reining in Japan 's largest and most powerful financial institution

 TO THE United States and Europe, then, for Junichiro Koizumi. Japan's new prime minister leaves behind him a dazzling victory in Tokyo's municipal elections and an adoring public pining for his swift return. The Japanese cannot get enough of him. Housewives queue to buy his posters. Screaming schoolgirls flock in their thousands to hear ""Jun-chan's"" latest thoughts on structural reform. His rejuvenated Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is rushing to produce imaginative new lines of Koizumi merchandise, among them dolls of Mr Koizumi wearing a lion-skin, a nod to the first issue of his e-mail magazine, which begins, straightforwardly, ""I am Koizumi the lionheart.""
 Britain and France are both to be honoured with a chance of a closer look at Japan's celebrity leader as he zips around the world. But first, and most important, comes the United States, where Mr Koizumi meets President Bush on June 30th. Will they be wearing Jun- chan T-shirts at Camp David? There is much for America to like about Mr Koizumi. The customary economic measures he brings for Mr Bush's inspection, rubber-stamped by his cabinet on June 26th, look superior to the usual dull LDP mix of pork-barrel public works and vague assurances of reform.
 Privatisation, deregulation and a budget overhaul are all promised. So is a proper fix at last for Japan's desperately weak banks, about which Jim Kelly, assistant secretary at the State Department and a Japan hand, is said to spend most of his time worrying. Japan has, of course, made plenty of promises before. But Mr Koizumi does a good job of making them sound as though they come from the heart. Equally encouraging is Mr Koizumi's economic brain, Heizo Takenaka, who was a professor at Harvard. His trip to Washington earlier this month helped to banish some old prejudices about the competence of Japanese economic policymakers.
 Warming to this new spirit of mutual intellectual respect, Mr Bush and Mr Koizumi will announce the creation of a bilateral economic forum, at which great thinkers from both countries will exchange nuggets of wisdom. This arrangement is supposed to help supplant the American hectoring of Japan that took place under bully-boys such as Larry Summers in Bill Clinton's administration. With this come Mr Koizumi's helpful attitudes towards reforming, or at least reinterpreting, Japan's war-renouncing constitution.
 Mr Bush puts great store in the future of America's alliance with Japan, whose strategic importance as a check against Chinese expansion figures large in the minds of the Republican Party's China hawks. A greater share of the security-alliance ""burden"", a more active role for its self-defence forces abroad and a commitment to come to the defence of America's troops in Asia if attacked are all demands that the Japanese have heard before from Republican presidents. In Mr Koizumi, however, the Americans at last have a Japanese constitutional hawk with mass appeal.
 If he finds the right ground on which to fight for constitutional reform, Mr Koizumi may even make some progress. Reassurances that Japan shows ""understanding"" for Mr Bush's missile-defence plans, together with a suggestion that it may join the United States and abandon the Kyoto protocol on climate change, promise a warm contrast to Mr Bush's cooler reception in Europe.
 These are not the only reasons Mr Bush will be going out of his way to cosy up to Mr Koizumi. Not surprisingly, the Americans have quickly grown mistrustful of Makiko Tanaka, Mr Koizumi's foreign minister. They will be hoping to bypass the foreign ministry and instead exploit more direct routes of communication between the White House and the Kantei, Mr Koizumi's official residence.
 Mrs Tanaka's spirited fight with her ministry and her enemies in the LDP has put a few stoppers in Japan's conventional diplomatic channels. Visiting Americans can find no end of people to tell them that Mrs Tanaka is doing an awful job. She herself is threatening legal action against her top officials-whom she wants to sack for an earlier scandal-for leaking her private conversations with the foreign ministers of China, Italy, Australia and Germany. Whoever did the leaking did a good job, editing Mrs Tanaka's remarks to make the most of her pro-Asian, anti-American leanings. A generous handshake during her recent visit to Washington from Mr Bush-who she is reported to have said loves his missiles because of the Texan oil lobby-has helped to smooth over some of the awkwardness. But much remains.
 Other problems loom on the horizon. With America's economy still slowing, Japan's many domestic weaknesses appear more threatening, especially the troubles of its banks, which could tip the economy into financial crisis at any time. Mr Koizumi's economic measures do offer some hope of new thinking in Tokyo (see article). But apart from the odd detail, his plans still look vague and undigested. Like Tokyo's foreign bankers, Mr Bush's economic team has begun to lose patience with Hakuo Yanagisawa, Mr Koizumi's minister in charge of the financial clean-up. Until recently, Mr Yanagisawa had a reputation as a reformer. But Mr Koizumi's slow progress in sorting out the banks has begun to leave the impression that Mr Yanagisawa is now holding things back.
 A final worry is that Mr Koizumi's reforms lack any sense of priorities. If he tried a bit of everything at once-the most likely bet at the moment-Japan's economy would weaken badly. All the Americans want Mr Koizumi to tackle the bad loans first. For now, Mr Bush will politely keep these urgings private. But if Jun-chan does mess up the economy, don't expect the smiles to last.","  The "" lionheart "" of politics braves Junichiro Koizumi

And the old guard has managed, under the guise of reform, to sneak through some pet schemes designed to coddle, rather than reform, the financial system.
 Chief among these is a stock-buying body, guaranteed by the government, that aims to help banks shrink their loss-ridden equity portfolios. This, argues the Financial Services Agency, is a step to a deeper reform that would restrict banks' equity shareholdings to less than 100% of their ""tier-one"" capital by about 2004. The entity will be funded by contributions from the banks themselves.
 Although limiting the shares that banks may own has met with widespread approval, the stock-buying fund has not. The banks say they would prefer to sell stocks in the open market, as they have done so far; they fought hard to ensure that the fund's use will be voluntary. Sceptics also question how a fund that may buy at most Yen 2 trillion ($16.1 billion) of shares can help banks make the Yen 13 trillion or so of share sales needed to meet the new limitations. And reformers such as Yasuhisa Shiozaki, a politician in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), argue that the scheme contradicts Mr Koizumi's stated goals of structural reform. It distorts market mechanisms that help weed out bad from good.
 A new initiative to strengthen the role of the Resolution and Collection Corporation (RCC), an institution that buys duff assets from banks, seems more promising. Reformers hope that proposals to create a new section within the RCC in charge of corporate restructuring might speed up the disposal of bad loans: it should allow bulk sales and the securitisation of bad loans and property collateral. The plan's flaw is that it applies only to the Yen 13 trillion of dud loans already being tackled by the banks. The RCC cannot touch the remaining Yen 60 trillion or so of problem loans that still need to be sorted out.
 That these loans are souring dangerously was highlighted by a recent study by the Nikkei newspaper, based on data from the Financial Services Agency. It showed that almost three-quarters of loans to companies that went bust last year had been classified as sound or merely in need of monitoring. Banks are either misclassifying problem loans, or the economy is deteriorating faster than they expected.
 The restriction on the RCC illustrates the government's reluctance to tackle these ""grey"" problem loans. Mr Koizumi's latest structural reform programme pledges to remove all bad loans from the banks' books over the next three years, but, with such restrictions, it is not clear how. Pro-reformers believe that better bank inspections and stricter rules on loan classification would help tackle the rot.
 Such ideas have met surprising resistance from Hakuo Yanagisawa, the minister in charge of financial affairs, who insists that bank inspections and loan classifications are tough enough already. Until recently, Mr Yanagisawa was seen as a leading reformer in the LDP. He is now being attacked, especially since he denies that banks need more public funds. Some suggest he does not want to admit that the previous round of public funding, which he oversaw, was a failure. Others suggest that Mr Yanagisawa might have become afraid to push reform, because he knows how big the problem is.
 Whatever. The government has stuck to merely toying with bank reform rather than tackling the root of the bad-debt problem. Parts of the plan seem to have been cobbled together so that Mr Koizumi can take them to America on June 29th. He might find folk in Washington, DC, less easy to convince than voters at home.","  A step forward , a step back for bank reform

 NOT without America, Junichiro Koizumi told his friends in Washington at the weekend. Together with Europe, he said in Britain on Monday. On July 4th, with Japan's prime minister now in Paris, his country's stance on whether it would ratify the Kyoto Protocol, a UN treaty on global warming, had become as uncertain as the solution to the phenomenon itself.
 Japan's discomfort is about to get worse. Not only is the government caught between warring Europeans and Americans, its own house is divided too. Although George Bush has made it clear that America will not ratify Kyoto after the next round of climate talks, which begin in Bonn on July 16th, the Europeans say they want to press ahead anyway, hoping to shame America into joining later. For the treaty to take effect, however, one condition is that Kyoto must be ratified by countries accounting together for at least 55% of industrialised countries' greenhouse gas. With Japan, the Europeans clear the hurdle. Without Japan, they do not.
 The Japanese cannot hide behind their ambiguities for much longer. On July 9th Margot Wallstrom, the European Union's environmental commissioner, will be in Tokyo to press the government for a straight answer. The Japanese will find that hard to provide. The environment ministry wants to ratify Kyoto as quickly as possible. The economy, trade and industry ministry, or METI, is less enthusiastic. From the start, METI has argued that Japan got a bad deal out of Kyoto. Kyoto sets the base year, against which countries' efforts to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions are measured, as 1990. By that time Japanese companies, responding to the second oil shock, had worked furiously to cut energy consumption and the most straightforward ways of reducing greenhouse gases had already been exhausted.
 METI sets great store by a voluntary emissions-curbing scheme organised by the Keidanren, a big-business lobby. However, there are plenty of Japanese industries that stand to benefit from Kyoto. Japan's car companies, for instance, are world leaders in green technologies. And ""Kyoto"" is not set in stone. METI is ready to live with it, given the use of ""flexible"" rules in meeting emissions targets. If Japan were allowed to make full use of this flexibility, by offsetting credits for its forests (which absorb carbon dioxide) against debits for its polluters, its present obligation-to reduce emissions to 6% below 1990 levels in a decade's time-would be cut in half.
 European purists have in the past heaped abuse on this flexibility, arguing that it is a roundabout way for countries to do nothing. Recently, however, Europe has become less unbending. Mrs Wallstrom is likely to offer the Japanese almost everything that METI wants. Whether that will be enough may in the end depend on the foreign ministry. Its pro-American faction-almost slavishly pro- American, in some eyes-hates the thought of siding with the Europeans against Mr Bush. Yet Japanese public sentiment has this week been inflamed by the United States' slowness in handing over an American airman suspected of yet another rape in Okinawa, where it has a military base. The battle, it seems, is on.

And now the builders, badly hurt by a decade of low private demand, are being squeezed by a slow decline in public-works projects.
 Junichiro Koizumi, Japan's reform-minded prime minister, who sees shock therapy as the economy's salvation, has defied traditional party interests by threatening to slash pork-barrel spending. Plans to build new dams and airports have been frozen. Another 300 or so projects could be stopped.

Their overall losses for this period were smaller, at Yen 389 billion, but only because some of the biggest, such as Kumagai Gumi and Mitsui Construction, were in such a bad way that their banks forgave large chunks of their debts.

 There is growing speculation that wobbly builders will ask for more debt waivers, maybe as early as this month.

Many potential candidates, such as Tobishima Construction and Fujita, are companies that not long ago received similar debt waivers in return for promises to restructure-which they have failed to fulfil.

 WHAT is at stake in Bonn? That is the question hanging over the current gathering in Germany's former capital of the world's environment ministers. The answer ranges from everything to nothing, depending on whom you ask.
 Officially, ministers are meeting in Bonn to work out the final details of the Kyoto Protocol. That UN treaty, if ratified, would bind industrialised countries to cut their emissions of greenhouse gases significantly over the next decade. Such gases, most notably carbon dioxide, keep the earth warm by slowing the radiation of heat into space. A recent increase in their quantity is, however, causing the planet's surface temperature to rise, which may have adverse climatic consequences.
 Ask many environmentalists, and they will say that the planet's very future is at stake at Bonn. They will point to mounting evidence that climate change is real, and insist there is not a moment to lose. The publication earlier this month of the final report of the UN's Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change lends weight to their position. The report's most dramatic conclusion, heavily trailed beforehand, is that the range of warming over the next century is likely to be between 1.4 degrees C and 5.8 degrees C. This doubles the upper bound of the IPCC's previous estimate.
 Ask the Americans (or, at least, the American delegation), and you will get the opposite response: nothing much is at stake in Bonn. The American administration considers the pact ""fatally flawed"", and will not change its mind in any circumstances, according to Paula Dobriansky, the head of that delegation. She will turn up in Bonn merely to ensure that ""American interests"" are not trampled on by overzealous Europeans.
 Those Europeans have pitched their tents in the same camp as the greens. They reckon that the Kyoto Protocol, though imperfect, is the only game in town. On July 17th, the EU issued a declaration proclaiming that ""climate change is taking place now. Its consequences will be felt globally. Time is pressing and the international community cannot afford to postpone action."" Jrgen Trittin, Germany's environment minister, goes further. Referring to America, he said that ""we cannot allow the country with the biggest emissions of greenhouse gases to escape responsibility for protecting the global climate.""
 Even before the inauguration of George Bush in January, Europe and America did not exactly see eye to eye over what should happen. Last November, negotiators met in The Hague to try to iron out their differences. The Americans, then represented by the Clinton administration, insisted on a reinterpretation of the Kyoto treaty. They wanted to allow the liberal use of ""carbon sinks"", such as new forests, to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by converting it into plants. They also wanted unfettered emissions trading (buying the right to emit greenhouse gases from places that would find applying controls cheaper than did the purchaser).
 That was hardly an outrageous request, for it would have made tackling climate change as flexible and inexpensive as possible. It would also have made the treaty more palatable to a hostile American Senate. EU ministers nevertheless rejected it, striking a moralistic note by insisting on sharp limits to such flexibility. The meeting broke up in disarray.
 The parties agreed to continue their negotiations at this week's Bonn jamboree. But now Europe has to deal with an even more sceptical American administration. In March, Mr Bush reaffirmed his campaign pledge to reject the Kyoto treaty outright. When they realised they could not persuade him to change his mind, the Europeans vowed to forge ahead anyway. Unfortunately for them, the treaty cannot come into force unless it is ratified by 55 countries making up the source of at least 55% of the greenhouse-gas emissions of the rich world. Europe, with all the allies it can muster, cannot quite leap that hurdle. The crucial vote lies with Japan.
 Tokyo v Kyoto
 The early betting was that the Japanese could not bear the shame of seeing a global environmental treaty forged in their country's ancient capital go down in flames. However, while some parts of the Japanese establishment do want to stand by the EU, it now appears that a group of pragmatists, led by Junichiro Koizumi, the new prime minister, is gaining the upper hand. This crowd is wary of alienating America, which is Japan's strongest ally and chief trading partner. What is more, Mr Bush's men have been arm-twisting Japan to distance itself from the pact.
 That has outraged the Europeans still further. They claim that Mr Bush had explicitly promised them, when they met at a recent summit in Sweden, that he would not pressure other countries to join him. To woo back the fickle Japanese, the Europeans have now moderated their hard line on carbon sinks, which the Japanese have indicated are of particular importance to them. Ironically, though, the EU softening on sinks comes just as a new report by the Royal Society, one of Britain's most venerable scientific institutions, argues against relying on them too heavily. The society's panel of experts reckons that too little is known about how sinks behave.
 All in all, it is hard to see how the Kyoto treaty can be saved at Bonn. The only way would be if the Japanese suddenly swung to Europe's side. There is a slim chance this might happen: heads of government of the rich and powerful G8 meet in Genoa, Italy, this weekend, and the group's European members plan to ambush Mr Bush and Mr Koizumi on the matter.
 But on balance, a volte face seems unlikely: Japanese governments tend to put off hard decisions for as long as possible. The likelier outcome is that the Bonn meeting will prove inconclusive, and that Kyoto will limp along until negotiators meet yet again, in Marrakech in October. It would almost be kinder to kill it off now.","  The future of the global climate - change treaty looks bleak . The negotiations in Bonn are unlikely to change that

 Israeli tanks and infantry advanced threateningly in the occupied territories after a suicide-bomb exploded in Israel. While militants pressed for all-out war, Ariel Sharon and Yasser Arafat struggled to keep their tense confrontation within limits.
 Supporters of George Bush's controversial missile-defence plan claimed a victory when a prototype system successfully shot down a dummy rocket over the Pacific Ocean. Previous attempts had failed.
 Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, downplayed the chances of a fast recovery for America's slowing economy. He said that he hoped that the economy had hit the bottom; but he acknowledged that it was not yet free of risk, leaving the door open for possible further interest-rate cuts.
 Economic indicators left uncertain the hopes that an American recovery was on the cards. Industrial production fell in June for the ninth month in succession to 3.6% lower than a year ago. Inflation was also on the up. The consumer-price index edged up in June to 3.2% over a year earlier.
 Mr Greenspan's less than optimistic prognosis for the economy was also backed up by a slew of company results, most of which were bad.
 Profits at Intel, the world's biggest chip maker, nose-dived by 94% in the second quarter to $200m, as the slowing economy hit PC sales and sparked a price war. The company tried to cheer investors with the information that business was unlikely to deteriorate in the next quarter.
 Second-quarter losses at Ford hit $752m, partly because of an expensive recall of vehicles fitted with suspect Bridgestone tyres. General Motors fared better.

 THE sea wall is built and the giant barges are swinging lazily into place, dumping their cargo of earth and rocks into the water. Building a second runway at the Kansai international airport, perched on a man-made island in the bay of Osaka, Japan's second city, has not been easy. Airport officials have battled grimly against hostile public opinion, campaigning local politicians and budget planners at the Finance Ministry, which keeps an anxious eye on the airport's ugly finances. At last, however, the sight of all that soil sinking into the sea has begun to lift their spirits. Only a severe earthquake, say airport officials, can stop their plans now.
 The celebrations may not last. Suddenly, there are new worries at ""mini-Kasumigaseki"", the airport's six-storey administrative offices, named after Tokyo's bureaucratic district because of its hundreds of government officials. Junichiro Koizumi, Japan's reform-minded prime minister, says he wants to take on his country's mighty bureaucracy. His targets are the myriad public-sector companies, called special corporations, whose business interests have spread into everything from mortgage loans to motorways.
 Mr Koizumi has already claimed one scalp, the Japan National Oil Corporation, whose accumulated losses, from financing nearly 300 failed or failing oil-exploration ventures, may run to $10 billion or more. In the autumn, say Mr Koizumi's officials, the oil company will be divided and privatised. Officials at the Kansai airport must be wondering if they are to be next.
 The company that runs the airport is a special sort of special corporation, called a ""third-sector"" project. The idea of these projects, born in the late 1980s as a wave of privatisations swept Britain and then other countries, was to improve public-sector efficiency with private-sector money and management. At Kansai, this principle was not so much lost as never discovered. Almost all the company's shares are owned either by the national government or by a consortium of five local governments. Its borrowings are guaranteed by the government. Most of the company's 500-odd staff are government workers on secondment. Most of its board members are former government officials.
 Shoddy management has hobbled the company from the start. The airport is built on a type of clay whose behaviour, under a heavy load, is hard to predict. When the management asked its scientific advisers how much the island would sink into the bay, says Koichi Akai, who chaired the scientific committee, the scientists came back with a wide range of possibilities.
 The managers chose the most optimistic estimate, and built their island and the company's finances on the hope that they would be lucky. They were not, and more soil and more loans were needed. The extra soil made the island heavier, so it sank even deeper into the mud. Although the airport opened in 1994, it is still sinking today, and Mr Akai reckons it may have another metre to drop. The extra soil, together with building work to protect fuel tanks and the terminal building have added $4 billion to costs, putting the first phase of the project about 50% over budget.
 Flights to and from the airport did not match the company's sunny forecasts, and its losses started to mount. If the airport went ahead with phase two and built a second runway, it soon became clear, its finances would collapse. The solution, in the minds of the Transport Ministry's creative bureaucrats, was to establish a second airport company. This second company has borne the new runway's huge construction costs, partly financed, this time, with subsidised, interest-free loans from the government. The second company will lease the runway to the first company when it is ready for use, in 2007. The first company will then buy the runway from the second company after a further 30 years, and the second company will be duly wound up. Thanks to a ten-year holiday on the debt, no one has to pay anything until 2007.
 But not even these arrangements have satisfied the Finance Ministry that the airport's finances will improve. Last summer the ministry floated the idea that the project should be scrapped. Fierce lobbying put a swift stop to that, but the Finance Ministry still insisted on another financial restructuring. The plan, due to be unveiled at the end of August, will centre on converting yet more bank loans into subsidised, interest-free debt. At a meeting last month the airport's shareholders once again reappointed the management.
 It is attitudes like these that Mr Koizumi must change if he is serious about tackling his government's sprawling commercial interests. Officials work within a tradition of all-powerful bureaucracy, and their contempt for the humble citizen is boundless. Yet the Japanese are not fools. ""Japan is sinking,"" says a middle- aged man as the airport train rumbles over a 5km bridge towards the island, ""just like this airport."" What delight there would be in Osaka if Mr Koizumi left the airport standing, but buried its management.","  The building of Osaka 's new airport is burdened by bureaucracy

IT IS women's day for the candidates and supporters of Japan's biggest opposition party, the Democrats, and the campaign bus is out in Ginza, a posh Tokyo shopping district. On the open upper deck, Miyuki Hatoyama, wife of Yukio, the party leader, gives a punchy speech. The banners unfurl, the all-female brass band begins to play and, in the sweltering heat, Mrs Hatoyama starts to dance.
The campaign for the election to the upper house of parliament on July 29th has been taxing for Japan's opposition parties. Only three months ago, they were contemplating the real possibility of seizing power from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, for only the second time since the LDP was founded in 1955. The opposition parties had agreed on their tactics: win control of the upper house, block all legislation (only the budget and foreign-policy legislation can be enacted without the approval of both houses of parliament), force a general election and remove the LDP from office. In those three months, however, Junichiro Koizumi, the LDP's new leader, has pulled off a remarkable reversal of fortune.
It has not all been one way. As campaigning drew to a close this week, the signs were that Mr Koizumi's extraordinary popularity was at last beginning to flag. On his return from Europe, where he had wrestled with the G8 summit and the Bonn meeting on global warming, Mr Koizumi was greeted with more bad economic news. On July 23rd the stockmarket hit a 16-year low.
The wounds do not appear mortal, however. The latest opinion polls still put the cabinet's approval ratings at over 70%, up from the single digits it enjoyed before Mr Koizumi took charge. Even among the Democrats' supporters, over half say they support Mr Koizumi. With their cameras and their flags, the voters have come in their tens of thousands to hear Japan's celebrity prime minister speak. The opposition has tried to pick its targets carefully: global warming, a controversial visit to a nationalist shrine and the unequal place of women in society. But none of these looks like a big vote-winner, and the government's equivocation on the Kyoto protocol ended with a compromise in Bonn that should please voters. 
Mr Koizumi already has a record five women in his 18-member cabinet, including his entertaining foreign minister, Makiko Tanaka. The Democrats, by contrast, look more than a bit old-fashioned. Mrs Hatoyama is not standing for office. As a good party wife, she is campaigning for the Democrats' Tokyo candidate, Kan Suzukiawho happens to be a man.
The real question is how Mr Koizumi's popularity translates into votes for the LDP. His proposition to the voters is admirably clear, but it is by no means straightforward. Vote for me, says Mr Koizumi, and you will give me the mandate to reform my party, from top to bottom. Yet to retain power, he needs not just personal popularity, but a convincing majority in parliament. And that means getting LDP members elected.
Unfortunately for Mr Koizumi, the LDP's candidates hardly suggest the party is changing. Of the 75 hopefuls, 19 are former bureaucrats and 53 have made public their factional loyalties, despite Mr Koizumi's plea for all candidates to abandon the LDP's faction system, which gets the blame for some of the party's most backward habits. Among those standing for the LDP is a candidate supported by Taiju no kai, a powerful lobby group that protects the many privileges of the publicly-owned post office and its workers. Mr Koizumi is quite insistent about the post office: he wants to break its power over the party and privatise it.
In fairness, Mr Koizumi could not have done much about these awkwardnesses. Most of the LDP's candidates were picked before he took over. But the broader point remains. If the voters return politicians like the Taiju no kai candidate, the LDP could claim it has a mandate to ditch Mr Koizumi and all his proposals for change.
Faced with Mr Koizumi's daunting popularity, however, the opposition seems to have given up on the niceties of political debate. The LDP, say the Democrats, is taking the country for yet another ride, handing out Koizumi posters and pendants and T-shirts simply so it can cling to power. At the Democrats' rally, Mrs Hatoyama does her best, but the crowds are thin. Most, it turns out, have come to watch the famous Mullion building clock strike the hour. The real star is elsewhere.","The opposition parties have struggled in their campaigns

 In fairness , Junichiro Koizumi could not have done much about these awkwardnesses . Most of the LDP 's candidates were picked before Junichiro Koizumi took over . But the broader point remains . If the voters return politicians like the Taiju no kai candidate , the LDP could claim it has a mandate to ditch Junichiro Koizumi and all Junichiro Koizumi's proposals for change . 
 Faced with Junichiro Koizumi's daunting popularity , however , the opposition seems to have given up on the niceties of political debate . The LDP , say the Democrats , is taking the country for yet another ride , handing out Junichiro Koizumi posters and pendants and T - shirts simply so it can cling to power . At the Democrats ' rally , Mrs Hatoyama does her best , but the crowds are thin . Most , it turns out , have come to watch the famous Mullion building clock strike the hour .

Siemens, a European technology giant, was hit by heavy losses in the latest quarter, driven by the poor performance of its telecoms businesses. The German firm said that it would speed up restructuring of its telecoms operation, which could involve further job losses on top of the 8,000 that have gone so far this year.

STOCKBROKERS simply haven't been selling shares at the right prices. That, more or less, was how Masajuro Shiokawa, the finance minister, explained Japan's tumbling stockmarkets on July 23rd, when the benchmark Nikkei 225 fell to a 16-year low (see chart). Another reason why share prices were so weak, he added, was that the brokers weren't marketing enough equity-based investment trusts. 
Mr Shiokawa's swift response ahe called the head of the securities industry organisation and urged him to rectify these flawsaworked wonders. Japanese shares rose the next day. But the climb may be brief. Three months ago investors had high hopes of Junichiro Koizumi, the incoming prime minister, who promised structural reform. Today, they are disappointed by his lack of progress. Meanwhile, Japan's sickly economy only looks worse. Industrial production is falling sharply, and consumption continues to disappoint. Corporate profits are sliding, and now there is no strong American economy to help. 
The government will almost certainly try to boost the economy with a supplementary budget in August. But this causes unhappiness all round. Those who favour yet more government spending are upset over Mr Koizumi's refusal to commit himself to another budget. No matter that the prime minister will probably do it once the election for parliament's upper house this weekend is over. His coyness, they argue, has knocked market confidence over the past couple of weeks. 
Those seeking a fresh approach, on the other hand, fear that a combination of extra spending and scant reform leaves Japan exactly where it was under Yoshiro Mori, the previous prime minister, who was both inept and unpopular. Mr Koizumi, who is fond of pledging supply-side reform without explaining what it will actually entail, will not be able to get away with mere sound bites any longer. After this weekend's election, he will have to come up with real strategies, which he will then have to blend with the plans for fiscal stimulus desired by his party. 
For the stockmarket, this suggests bumpy times ahead. Thank goodness, then, that Mr Shiokawa will know exactly what the problem is.","Sinking to old lows

 ""I WAS able to overcome the first obstacle"" was Junichiro Koizumi's sober take on his election victory on July 29th. This was modest: his achievement was little short of astounding. In the three months since he became leader of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the wavy-haired, trendily clad Mr Koizumi, whose predecessor was driven from office by dismal opinion-poll scores, has notched up approval ratings of over 80% and translated them into an impressive 65% of the contested seats for his ruling coalition in the upper- house election last Sunday. Before he took over, most people had expected the coalition to lose its upper-house majority. Some even spoke of the extinction of the venerable LDP, which has held power for all but ten months since 1955.
 Yet Mr Koizumi's downbeat assessment was realistic too, because his real problems are only now beginning. He actually has to do something to try to revive the world's second-largest economy, which has lain flat on its back for almost a decade, rather than just talking about it. This is hardly a propitious time to take the task on, given that the rest of the world--including, most notably, Japan's biggest export market, the United States--is also now in, or close to, a recession. For that reason, though, Mr Koizumi's success or failure matters more than for any recent Japanese prime minister.
 The outcome will depend most of all on the LDP itself. Its dinosaurs, the ones who have steadfastly opposed ending the feather- bedding of privileged (and duly appreciative) groups like Japan's farmers, builders, utilities and banks, have been pretty quiet up till now; after all, there was an election to win. But perhaps they have not really believed themselves to be under threat. After all, Mr Koizumi has been pretty vague about most of his reforms. And the dinosaurs know, as Mr Koizumi knows, that he won the LDP presidency against the wishes of most of his own parliamentary party (). Yet, strong though the old guard is, Mr Koizumi has strength of his own. He is so hugely popular that it would be politically risky for anyone to be seen to be too obviously frustrating his plans.
 The pain won't hurt too much
 Japan's recent political history is littered with the corpses of reformers, swept in on a wave of hope only to be swept out again when those hopes were dashed. The voters may say they want change, but they have shown no great taste for the discomfort that tends to go with it.
 Will Mr Koizumi fare any better than others before him? He has certainly not been shy about promising pain. Throughout the election campaign he stressed his theme: ""reform with no sacred cows"". And few would deny that sacred cows, herds of them, need slaughtering. A list would include the building industry, relentlessly protected and propped up by public spending, agriculture, also hideously protected, as indeed are service industries of all kinds. Perhaps top of the list would be the utilities, among the world's most expensive and cosseted, whose inefficiency throttles economic activity at every level.
 Economic recovery, however, will demand more than a wholesale opening up to competition. It will require, in particular, action on the country's huge stock of dodgy debt. The government itself says the banks have Yen150 trillion ($1.23 trillion) in bad or doubtful loans on their books. Yet Mr Koizumi has said little about what he would do about it. Current plans talk of dealing with only Yen13 trillion. A far more ambitious programme is needed, one that will in effect nationalise the unsound banks temporarily, while regulators hive off their bad loans and then sell whatever good bits remain of the banks to help cover the cost. Until that happens, the normal lending and borrowing on which any economy depends will not resume, and neither households nor companies will regain the confidence to start spending money again.
 Lots of pain; and a purge of the banks. It sounds worthy. But the risk is that this could just make a weak Japan even weaker, by intensifying deflation and raising unemployment. It is worryingly reminiscent of the early 1930s in America, when following the 1929 Wall Street crash the consensus favoured ""liquidation""--ie, pain and a purge--accompanied by tight money in order to enforce ""discipline"". What followed was the Great Depression.
 ...if everyone goes on a spending spree
 That danger means that demand must also be boosted, even while Mr Koizumi's supply-side purge is under way. The rigidities in its banks, utilities and service industries are not Japan's only problem: as bad is a systemic deficiency of demand, rooted in the asset-price collapse of the early 1990s, since when some property prices have fallen by 80%. Individuals and companies who have seen their net worth so badly eroded save more and spend less.
 Japan has already tried one kind of demand-management: vast extra spending on public works that have littered the landscape with roads leading nowhere, bridges no one crosses and airports that lie idle. About $1 trillion has been pumped into the economy in this way over the past decade. An alternative way to stoke demand would be to cut taxes, but the scope for doing so is limited by the huge budget deficit, which stands at over 130% of GDP.
 There is, however, another way to do it: a much looser monetary policy. Interest rates are at zero, and cannot be cut further. But the Bank of Japan could buy in much more government debt, reducing its stock and in effect printing more money. The problem is that its governor, Masaru Hayami, is reluctant to do so on the scale required: he fears inflation, and thinks, like his 1930s American forebears, that loose money will erode the incentive for structural reform. It is Mr Koizumi's task to persuade him he is wrong. Failing that, he should seek his removal, pointing out that, independent though the bank may be, Mr Hayami has failed in his duty to achieve price stability. All this is a tall order for any prime minister, not least one whose relations with his own party are still evolving. But unless Mr Koizumi is bold, Japan's deflation will only continue, and with it today's national despair.","  Junichiro Koizumi's , now has a popular mandate . Junichiro Koizumi must use it

 UNLESS he has a last-minute change of mind, Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, will next week ignite a row with China, with South Korea (co-host with Japan of the 2002 football World Cup), with his main coalition partner and with much of his own party, including his foreign minister. He will do this by visiting a shrine dedicated to the country's war dead on August 15th, which is the anniversary of Japan's surrender in the second world war.
 Why shouldn't a Japanese prime minister pay his respects to his country's dead? Indeed he should, just as German chancellors should, and do. But German chancellors do not visit places that celebrate the nastier sort of German nationalism, let alone the memory of men such as Hitler, Goring and Himmler. Mr Koizumi, by contrast, wants to go to Yasukuni precisely because it is a symbol of Japanese nationalism, as well as a place to commemorate all Japan's war dead. Why is it so symbolic? To some, at least, because of the spiritual presence there of General Hideki Tojo and a dozen others convicted as ""Class A"" war criminals in the 1946-48 Tokyo trials. They are not enshrined there lightly, because it is hardly obvious that men executed for war crimes have given their lives for their country. They are there because, in 1978, the shrine's authorities took a deliberate, and secret, decision to admit them.
 Since then, the authorities have rejected all appeals to ""remove"" the war criminals, including proposals from such establishment figures as Hiromu Nonaka, who has served as Japan's cabinet secretary and secretary-general of Mr Koizumi's Liberal Democratic Party. The shrine's authorities are emphatically not in the mainstream of Japanese opinion on this issue. Rather, the shrine--and its adjacent war museum, with its kaiten human-guided suicide torpedoes and its ohka suicide rocket-bombs--has become a place of veneration for all those who believe that Japan has nothing to apologise for in its conduct of a war that was forced upon it.
 Even without the war criminals, Yasukuni would remain controversial. After its foundation in 1869, it served as the pre- eminent shrine of state Shinto, a late 19th-century fusion of an ancient religion with modern absolutist government. State Shinto was abolished (by the Americans) after the war as being widely associated, by Japanese as well as foreigners, with the rise of militarism. An official prime-ministerial visit to Yasukuni, therefore, threatens to erode the separation of state and religion laid down in Japan's constitution.
 With the sole exception of Yasuhiro Nakasone, who went ""officially"" in 1985 but never dared do so again, Japan's post-war prime ministers have treated the shrine with immense caution, in fear as much of the Japanese as of the foreign backlash. The others who visited it insisted they were doing so in their private capacities. Mr Koizumi rejects that as a fudge, in which, at least, he is right.
 Mr Koizumi can still back down, though he has made it hard for himself, and he may well think he needs the support of conservatives on this matter if he is to offend them with his economic reforms. But there are other acceptable, indeed desirable, ways of showing a decent sort of nationalism, such as amending the constitution to allow Japan to play its full part in the world's collective security. And there are other, less controversial places Mr Koizumi could visit to honour Japan's uncriminal war dead.

 The euro hit a five-month high, rising above 90 cents against the dollar. The IMF gave a warning that America's current-account deficit was unsustainable and that the dollar was likely to weaken further. The dollar also slid against the yen.
 America's economy suffered. Industrial production fell for the tenth month in a row to end 3.2% down in the year to July. Germany's economy is also in trouble. The Bundesbank estimated that GDP was flat in the second quarter.
 The British government suspended political institutions in Northern Ireland, after Unionists there refused to accept the IRA's talk of a ""scheme""--no details, no date--for weapons-decommissioning as a substitute for action. The IRA promptly withdrew its scheme.
 Three suspected members of the IRA were arrested in Bogota. Colombian army chiefs said that they had been giving bomb-making courses to the FARC guerrillas.
 While Spain's central and Basque-region politicians swapped insults over the regional police force's willingness to fight
 ETA
 terrorists, ETA supporters publicly commemorated four of them blown up by their own bomb a year ago.
 In Turkey, one of the country's most popular politicians, Tayyib Erdogan, a former mayor of Istanbul, set up a new Islamic party. Meanwhile, civilians are openly questioning the political role of the armed forces, determined enemies of religious influence in politics.
 On Saudi Arabian television, three more Britons confessed to carrying out bomb attacks. The incidents are all thought to be connected with the illegal trade in alcohol.
 For his second term, Iran's president, Muhammad Khatami, disappointed reformists by largely reappointing his old cabinet of moderate loyalists.
 American and British aircraft twice attacked anti-aircraft sites in southern Iraq. Syria's prime minister paid a ground-breaking three- day visit to Baghdad.
 The Indian prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, marked independence day by blaming Pakistan for wrecking relations between the two countries and ""believing it can gain Kashmir through terrorism"".
 Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf promised a general election for October 2002, but it looked likely that the country would stay under military control.

 A Justice Department report on the Los Alamos spy inquiry said that the FBI's investigation was deeply flawed from the beginning, had looked into the wrong crime and had ignored some possible suspects.
 A United States federal judge ruled that controversial snapshots of Barbie, an iconic plastic doll, were protected by the photographer's free-speech rights. Mattel, which makes the dolls, plans to appeal.
 After several days of talks, officials from Argentina were reportedly close to an agreement with the IMF over a new loan aimed at calming continued fears of a debt default or devaluation.
 Meanwhile, Brazil slipped towards recession. Its economy shrank by nearly 1% in the second quarter compared with the first.
 Cuba's Fidel Castro watched as Presidents Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil and Hugo Chavez of Venezuela inaugurated a 680km (425-mile) electricity-transmission line linking their two countries.
 Kenya's parliament threw out an anti-corruption bill despite a first-time visit from the president, Daniel arap Moi, to encourage it through. Rejecting the bill puts in doubt millions of dollars in aid. Opponents argued that the bill was not tough enough.
 As the situation in Zimbabwe worsened, the Southern Africa Development Community took away the chairmanship of its defence committee from Robert Mugabe and said they were worried about the ""spillover effect"" of the troubles there. Attacks continued on around 100 white-owned farms. Four journalists from the main independent newspaper were arrested but released by a court.
 A triumph for family values: under pressure from the pope himself, Archbishop Emmanuel Milingo, from Zambia, agreed in Rome to abandon his South Korean wife, married in a Moonie ceremony in May, and ""return to the church"". I'm pregnant, he's been drugged, said she.
 The relationship between Deutsche Bank and Deutsche Telekom became frosty after the bank disposed of shares in the telecoms giant worth around euro1 billion ($880m) on behalf of an unnamed seller. Coincidentally, Deutsche Bank issued a research report, which recommended purchasing Deutsche Telekom shares around the time of the sale.
 Morgan Grenfell's name looked likely to disappear after 163 years in investment banking. Deutsche Bank, which acquired Morgan Grenfell some 12 years ago, intends to fold Morgan Grenfell Private Equity into its own private equity division, DB Capital Partners.
 Bayer, a German drug company, said that it was considering a co- operative venture for its drug business with a larger pharmaceutical company; a sell-off could follow. It had previously announced the withdrawal of an anti-cholesterol treatment. That will wipe up to $650m ($590m) off full-year profit and result in the loss of 5,000 jobs.
 Profits fell at UBS by 26% in the latest quarter compared with a year ago. Shares in Switzerland's biggest bank rose; profits had been expected to fall further. Citigroup, the world's biggest financial conglomerate, said that it would cut 3,500 jobs over the coming year to bolster slowing profits.
 The IMF and the World Bank decided to shorten to two days September's annual meeting in Washington, DC, fearing a repeat of the violence witnessed at a recent G8 summit in Genoa. Anti- globalisation protesters claimed a victory in the fight against global capitalism but said that they would turn up and protest anyway.
 US Airways became the latest airline to reveal that it was suffering from the economic downturn and the decline in business travel. It issued a profit warning, saying that losses for the next quarter will exceed $160m.
 Blue-chip companies were glum on both sides of the Atlantic. Continued huge losses and an ever-dwindling share price persuaded Mark Schneider to quit as chairman and chief executive of UPC, a Dutch cable firm. Enron, the world's largest energy trader, lost its president and chief executive, Jeffrey Skilling. He quit the American power giant for personal reasons after just six months in the job.
 Some executives who were ""let go"" recently had cause for celebration. Michael Bonsignore, former chief executive at Honeywell International, will receive $9m as a separation payment, as well as a variety of perks including executive travel (but not use of the office jet).
 Lucent Technologies, a struggling telecoms-equipment company, agreed to pay Richard McGinn, its former chairman and chief executive, a package worth $13m for barely three years' service. Deborah Hopkins, a former chief financial officer, will get near $5m.",740,Japan,A29-8209,,False,,0,True

 IT WAS a fudge--and not a very successful one at that. Junichiro Koizumi, Japan's new prime minister, had pledged before his appointment in April to go to Yasukuni, a controversial shrine for the war dead, on August 15th, the anniversary of Japan's surrender in the second world war. Last month he started publicly wavering, as protests, both inside and outside Japan, got louder. When he eventually went to Yasukuni, two days earlier than promised and with a minimum of warning, he pleased few and angered many.
 Mr Koizumi, the first sitting prime minister to pay an official visit to the shrine in 16 years, had hoped that the change in date and a carefully prepared statement acknowledging Japan's wartime aggression would mollify critics. He was wrong. China, South Korea, and other Asian countries were furious that he went to a shrine which honours, among millions of other war dead, 14 ""Class A"" war criminals, and were not in the slightest bit mollified by his changing of the date. Tensions that had been running high following a row over Japanese history textbooks that omit reference to the sexual exploitation of local women by Japanese occupation forces rose even further: in South Korea a group of particularly incensed men each cut off a little finger in protest. Japan's foreign ministry, led by Makiko Tanaka, its minister, is now scrambling to patch things up.
 Mr Koizumi also lost support at home. Those who opposed his Yasukuni trip--New Komeito, his main coalition partner, and most of the opposition parties--were angry that he went at all. Worse, those in his own Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) who wanted him to go on the 15th were upset because he partially caved in to what they call pressure from the political left.
 The loss of his conservative chums comes at a bad time for Mr Koizumi. His cabinet has just approved a stringent set of budget guidelines for 2002, which trim overall government spending by 1.7%, the biggest cut ever. The prime minister, it seems, is determined to stick to his promise of capping new issues of government bonds to less than Yen30 trillion ($246 billion) next year. He ventured into sacred LDP territory, slashing public-works spending by 10% or Yen9.3 trillion. The folk in the LDP, mindful of their constituents, will now start fighting for their pieces of the shrunken pie. With few allies and lots of enemies, Mr Koizumi may find it hard to control the rows that will surely erupt in the coming weeks.
 He will have to do battle himself if he is to push through administrative reforms to sort out Japan's debt-ridden public corporations, such as the Japan Highways Public Corporation and the post office. Not only does he face strong resistance from the bureaucrats that oversee them, but he is likely to clash with many politicians who rely on these groups for support. As for his structural reform plans for the private sector (which he has yet to unveil), these too are unlikely to be greeted kindly by many members of his party.
 Mr Koizumi has ended up wasting precious political capital by going to Yasukuni. He has even lost some credibility with voters. His strongest support group, ordinary voters, cared little about his visit to the shrine, but were left with the impression that Mr Koizumi backs and fills when the going gets tough.","  Junichiro Koizumi's shrine visit wo n't help Junichiro Koizumi's mollify the right

 NOT so stubborn after all? After insisting for months that it wouldn't, the Bank of Japan eased monetary policy on August 14th. It was not just the mounting criticism both at home and abroad that the bank was not properly fighting Japan's persistent deflation that did the trick. Nor was it just that the stockmarkets had hit a near 16- year low the previous day. Months of political sniping, which has culminated in a small group from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) calling for the laws governing the central bank to be revised, suggests that the central bank bowed, at least in part, to political pressure.
 The group, led by a trio that includes Kozo Yamamoto, a former official from the finance ministry, and Yoshimi Watanabe, a younger party activist, wants to introduce formal inflation targets for the Bank of Japan. Mr Watanabe believes that the bank, which already looks at consumer prices when its sets its policy, should target asset prices as well. The group wants these revisions passed by the end of the year, arguing that the Bank of Japan, which is a government-authorised corporation, falls within the scope of plans to shake up public organisations. Less likely to pass, however, is a revision proposed by Yoichi Masuzoe, who used to be a popular commentator and is now the group's third leader. He wants to strip the bank of its independence, which it won three years ago, by giving the prime minister the power to hire and fire the governor.
 In easing its stance, the Bank of Japan has targeted the quantity of money flowing through the economy, rather than interest rates, which can hardly go lower. It announced that it would increase by half its monthly purchases of government bonds, to Yen600 billion ($4.9 billion), paid for, in effect, by printing money. By buying bonds from banks, it wants to push up the reserves that commercial banks deposit with the central bank, from Yen5 trillion to Yen6 trillion. Not nearly enough, cry those who want a far more aggressive response to Japan's slump. Still, since the central bank started pumping money into the economy in March, Japan's monetary base has expanded. In July, it grew by 8% compared with a year earlier (see chart).
 With more money in the system, banks ought, in theory, to be able to increase their lending to companies, which would then be able to invest more and so help the economy grow. The trouble is, first, that a slowing world economy offers no prop to crippled Japan. Second, without serious attempts at structural reform--cleaning up banks' bad debts and management, and enforcing corporate bankruptcies--monetary easing will have little effect, for banks will still prove unwilling to lend. Junichiro Koizumi, the prime minister, has often promised structural reform. Yet no co-ordinated programme is in sight that would tackle the government's unsustainable levels of debt, clean up the banks and allow monetary easing on a scale sufficient to offset the pain.
 Despite all this, some of the new money could flow into stocks and property. A lot could find its way into dollar-denominated assets, especially if the Bank of Japan eases again in the autumn. A weakening yen would be good for exporters. It would also help ease deflation. But a weak-yen strategy brings risks. Nominal long-term interest rates could rise, and bond prices fall. Too steep a fall could perhaps spark a fresh crisis among the banks, since they own huge amounts of government bonds.
 Nonetheless, the Bank of Japan seems at last to have woken up to the notion that a gently weakening yen might, after all, be in Japan's best interests. The question now is whether the realisation has come just a little too late."," Japan's central bank eases monetary policy. Too little, too late?

 ANOTHER week, another set of impressive-sounding, or painful- sounding, job cuts from one of Japan's finest high-tech exporters. Last week it was Fujitsu, the country's top computer firm, cutting 16,000 jobs; this week it was the turn of Toshiba, a maker of memory chips, laptops and much else, to declare its plan to cut 19,000 jobs. Other cuts have come from NEC, a big telecoms and chips firm, and more are rumoured to be on the way from Hitachi, one of the country's older conglomerates ()see page 59. The whiff of change is in the air: along with a new, reformist, no-gain-without-pain prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, perhaps corporate Japan is starting to restructure, shedding its old lifetime employment rules and shaping up for a more vigorous future?
 Alas not. Or at least, not yet. These big job-cut announcement have more of the old Japan about them than the new. Lifetime employment is still being protected: Fujitsu's cuts were mainly overseas, and Toshiba's are being phased in over three years. The pain is being borne mainly by the new school-leavers and graduates who will not now be recruited, rather than by higher-cost workers, who will be retained. Thanks to new consolidated accounting rules, there is less shuffling off of redundant workers to travel agencies or other make-work subsidiaries than might once have been the case. But these firms, and others among Japan's big battalions, remain unwieldy conglomerates doing far more tasks than they can manage efficiently. Hitachi consists of more than 1,000 companies; Fujitsu of more than 500.
 Too few jobs lost, but far too few created
 The right place to look in order to understand what is happening in Japan is at the broader picture. And that picture is looking steadily worse. If deregulation and real corporate restructuring get going, a time will come when rising unemployment and job-cut announcements are actually good news rather than bad, because they will indicate that change really is under way--as they did, in the 1990s, when countries in Central Europe were switching from communism to capitalism. Japan, alas, has not yet reached that point in its own transition from sclerosis back to capitalism. This week, the official unemployment rate rose to 5% of the labour force, the highest since 1953. This is a sign of the collapse of smaller firms, where lifetime employment has never prevailed, and of falling demand--which is why the Tokyo stockmarket fell this week to its lowest level for 17 years, despite those big high-tech firms' apparently inspiring efforts to cut jobs and limit their losses.
 On the face of it, the official unemployment numbers suggest that Japanese joblessness is only a little above that in the United States. Yet the true level of unemployment is thought to be much higher than the official figure, because many of those who have lost their jobs have either not chosen to, or been unable to, register for unemployment benefit. Total employment has been dropping speedily: since December last year 800,000 jobs have gone (on a seasonally adjusted basis); over the past four years, the total is almost 1.8m. Since December last year more than a million people have left the officially counted labour force.
 Clearly, with the world economy no longer doing Japan any favours, this is a tough moment at which to be considering radical reform and restructuring, which is what Mr Koizumi has said he is going to implement. As regulations are shaken up and firms restructure, unemployment could rise far beyond current levels, depressing consumer confidence, prices and demand even more, causing more job losses in an ever nastier downward spiral.
 Tune in, reflate, start up
 That is why, as well as his efforts to bring on the pain of restructuring, Mr Koizumi and his government need to keep their eyes on two other things. One is by now familiar: demand, which can be stimulated by an aggressive expansion in the money supply. The Bank of Japan has edged tentatively in this direction, but is still showing little enthusiasm for the task. There is some talk of direct monetary expansion by the Ministry of Finance, which it could achieve by borrowing directly from banks to finance its spending rather than (as is normal) from the bond market. But there is no sign of more than talk. If Mr Koizumi is not to lead Japan into a depression, he will need to take a strong personal interest in the money supply.
 The second forms part of Mr Koizumi's plans for supply-side reforms. But it is too often overlooked amid all the talk of pain and purges. This is that, outside the financial sector, the main target of reform and restructuring must be the encouragement of new businesses and markets, and of new entrants to existing markets. Any economy can destroy jobs. It is much harder to create them, but if the rise in unemployment is to be limited and then put into reverse, that is what must happen.
 It is often claimed that there is no real entrepreneurial culture in Japan, so all the new jobs will have to be created at existing firms. This is not true. Even well after the post-war age when the Sonys and Hondas were being founded, the flow of start-ups remained high in manufacturing, distribution and services all through the 1960s and 1970s. It was only in the 1980s that entrepreneurial activity really slowed down, presumably as many markets became gummed up by incumbents and by regulation.
 Even now, amid a sliding economy, the fires of entrepreneurship are flickering. The number of initial public offerings on Japan's stockmarkets has been rising: there were 18 in July and 19 in August, and more than 20 are planned for September. Many more will be needed. If they are to come, then the government will have to force big, old dominant firms, such as NTT in telecoms and all the other big utility companies, to stop squashing innovation and new competition. Millions of jobs were destroyed in America by deregulation. But millions more were created by start-ups and by expansions of existing small and middling firms. That is what Japan must now do: free its budding entrepreneurs. Without them, the growing legions of the jobless will have little real hope.","  Rising unemployment is necessary , if Japan is to reshape and recover . But it is not sufficient

 AN AUTUMN of reform is what Junichiro Koizumi promised Japan's desperate voters. Yet two weeks after the new prime minister returned from his holidays in the cool of the mountains, there is no sign that one is on the way. Like so many of his predecessors, Mr Koizumi seems to be gently subsiding into Japan's familiar political quicksand.
 Central reforms are being abandoned, say his critics, or neutered. In anticipation of a mountain of legislation, the Diet (parliament) was supposed to have reconvened in August. Now, it will not start work until the end of September. There is still no word from Mr Koizumi about his policy priorities, despite a promise that he would draw up a list by August. The stockmarket is plunging, the banks are weakening by the day and the economic recession deepens. But half of the government's most crucial ministers are travelling abroad. As for Mr Koizumi himself, he is holed up in his official residence, say political gossips, listening to opera.
 Something Wagnerian would go well with the terrible news outside. Big exporters, like Hitachi and Toshiba, are announcing huge layoffs. Small-firm confidence continues to plunge. Output is falling rapidly and deflation is deepening. Statistics due out on September 7th may, it is feared, show that between April and June the economy shrank by 4% or more at an annualised rate. With confidence in the government's policies ebbing rapidly, the markets are abuzz with talk of a fresh financial crisis. Since Mr Koizumi's return to Tokyo, the stockmarket has fallen by nearly 10%, a drop so far interrupted only by hopeful rumours that Hakuo Yanagisawa, Mr Koizumi's minister in charge of the bank clean-up, will soon resign.
 Mr Yanagisawa is now Mr Koizumi's number-one problem. Mr Koizumi went to the voters before the election in July for Japan's upper house with a promise to clean up the banks within two to three years. But the plan for doing so that Mr Yanagisawa has been touting round Europe and America this week looks almost identical to the one he drew up in April, under the discredited administration of Yoshiro Mori. The markets condemned it at the time. Not surprisingly, they are passing the same judgment now.
 At the heart of the matter lies the fact that no one believes the government's figures for the amount of bank loans that could turn sour. Goldman Sachs, an American investment bank, thinks the true number may be an eye-popping Yen170 trillion ($1.4 trillion), seven times the official figure. By pushing bank shares ever lower, the markets are saying that the banks are short of capital and need public money. But Mr Yanagisawa will not countenance that. His staff are back in siege mentality, railing at Goldman Sachs and suchlike and furious with the IMF, whose request last week to inspect Japan's financial system got a dusty response.
 Even by Japanese standards, Mr Koizumi has shown himself to be remarkably insensitive to these market signals. It took him a whole week to ""correct"" Mr Yanagisawa's all-too-honest gaffe that it would take not three years but seven to clean up the banks, by which time the damage had been done. Among cabinet members, only Heizo Takenaka, Mr Koizumi's economics minister, retains the confidence of the markets. But Mr Takenaka is an academic economist, and is not faring well among the insiders of Nagatacho, Tokyo's political district. Mr Takenaka wants Mr Yanagisawa sacked. But Mr Yanagisawa has far more political clout
 Damaging cabinet divisions are appearing elsewhere. Despite the awful economic news, Mr Koizumi is still trying to push ahead with his dubious plan to tighten government spending. In fact, as cabinet heavyweights like Takeo Hiranuma, the economy, trade and industry minister, have defied the prime minister and called for a big emergency budget, Mr Koizumi has been upping the stakes. Now Mr Koizumi says he wants to bring forward his plan to cap government bond issues at Yen30 trillion from next year to this year, which would tighten public finances almost immediately. In recession, however, Mr Koizumi will have to issue more bonds simply to cover the government's tax shortfall. Already the Ministry of Finance is indicating that this year's tax revenues may fall below target.
 Other battles that Mr Koizumi persists in fighting look less wrong- headed than simply irrelevant. While the banks burn, Mr Koizumi has been prodding his minister in charge of public-sector reform, Nobuteru Ishihara (also travelling abroad), to crack the whip over the government's hugely ambitious privatisation programme. The true scale of this task became a little clearer this week. Of the 74 public-sector corporations that Mr Koizumi wants abolished or privatised, the bureaucrats agreed to part with just four, all of which the government had previously earmarked to get rid of anyway.
 How much of Mr Koizumi's dithering reflects a change of heart is not yet clear. The talk in Nagatacho is that Mr Koizumi has begun to cosy up to the dinosaurs of the Hashimoto faction in his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). On the election trail, Mr Koizumi strongly suggested that he would take on these anti-reformists in a straight fight. His ardour cooling, say some LDP insiders, Mr Koizumi has become more interested in cutting the sorts of political deals that would secure him a longer period in office.
 Most damning of all, the Hashimoto faction's big cheeses no longer seem threatened by Mr Koizumi's reforms. Let Mr Koizumi labour away, is their judgment, because he is unlikely to be around long enough to upset things too badly. Whatever the reason, ""Jun-chan"" already seems a shadow of the man who led his party to victory in July.","  Junichiro Koizumi flounders as the economy worsens

 HOSOKAWA, Hashimoto, Koizumi. The names change. But the aspirations of Japan's political leaders stay the same. Curbing bureaucratic power has been at the top of almost every Japanese government's agenda since Morihiro Hosokawa took office in 1993. Equally unchanging has been the record of failure. Mr Hosokawa was gone in less than nine months. Ryutaro Hashimoto settled for cosmetic change and lost the support of the voters. Now Japan's latest prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, is launching another assault on the bureaucrats' kingdom.
 Poor Mr Koizumi, smile the mandarins, still believes he can win. He does not lack ambition. His targets are the government's 163 ""special corporations""--state-owned businesses whose interests span everything from home loans to oil exploration. On one level, Mr Koizumi is borrowing from the economic textbooks of the West. If the private sector can do the job, he says, the state should not, a principle that he wants to make the basis of his public-sector review, due by the end of December. But Mr Koizumi's fight with the bureaucrats has a deeper dimension.
 This emerges from the baggage of Japanese history. The bureaucrats of feudal Japan were samurai, the old elite warrior class, who had hung up their swords during the long peace of the Tokugawa shogunate. Under the imperial restoration of 1868, these bureaucrats became servants of the emperor, who claimed divine descent. After the second world war, the new constitution, written with American help, gave sovereignty to the people. But bureaucratic presumption endured. In office, the mandarins busied themselves with economic micromanagement, helping to make Japan's mixed economy really very mixed indeed. On retirement, they ""descended from heaven"", as their own saying has it, into cushy jobs in the private sector, or the myriad special corporations that mushroomed after the war. Their relationship with the public is captured, with characteristic Japanese economy, in the phrase kanson minpi--respect for authority, contempt for the masses.
 Only extreme unaccountability can explain the operation of these special corporations. The government forks out more than Yen5 trillion ($41 billion) a year in subsidies just to keep them afloat. Yet up to now, not a single former bureaucrat has resigned to take responsibility for this epic mismanagement. On the contrary, the mandarins are not even prepared to admit there is anything wrong.
 The ex-bureaucrats reward themselves handsomely. By regularly shuffling from job to job among the public corporations, in just ten years top civil servants can earn $1m or more in lump-sum retirement pay alone, half of which is exempt from income tax. Because bureaucrats retire in their mid-50s, and can serve on the public corporations well into their 80s, some become seriously rich.
 Mr Koizumi's reforms, concede aides, have quickly become an uphill struggle. So he has singled out seven corporations for special attention. Although, with a couple of exceptions, they are not the most heavily subsidised, these corporations have been chosen for what they symbolise. Four of the seven build and manage roads and bridges, an activity that has come to represent everything that is wrong with Japan's political economy.
 According to its latest annual report, the Japan Highway Public Corporation manages 6,851km (4,280 miles) of tolled motorways, whose charges are among the most expensive in the world. Another 4,669km of motorways are planned, of which 2,213km are already under construction. Because these new motorways will run through mountains and round cities, they will cost Yen5 billion or more per kilometre to build, suggesting total outlays of at least Yen25 trillion. Unlike existing motorways, the construction costs of future roads cannot be recouped through toll fees, explains the corporation, because traffic is expected to be light in the mountains.
 The Japanese government is already the most heavily indebted in the world. Yet its bureaucrats insist on a ruinous road-building programme that has the taxpayer shelling out for more road building in 2001 than in 1969, when Japan needed many more motorways and its economy was growing at 10% a year. At first, the bureaucrats flatly rejected Mr Koizumi's push to privatise these road-building enterprises. They have since agreed, but crucial issues remain unresolved.
 First, the mandarins want to be in charge of their own reform, a principle that the politicians have honoured in all administrative reforms up to now. Mr Koizumi says this is nonsense: the task of drafting privatisation plans must go to an independent authority. Second, the bureaucrats say they will accept privatisation only if existing road-building plans do not change. Again, Mr Koizumi disagrees. Unless the corporations' finances are sustainable, no one will buy their shares.
 Mr Koizumi wants answers by the end of November. The bureaucrats are appealing, in time-honoured fashion, to the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's road lobby. With Mr Koizumi visibly wearying, the fight is swinging against him. But even if Mr Koizumi's reforms do fail, the mandarins have surely entered a long twilight in Japan. The old deference to authority is giving way to more assertive attitudes. The era of fast growth is over, and recession and financial crisis have undermined the bureaucracy's reputation for competent rule. The political resolve for reform endures because the voters have changed, and now they demand it. Whatever plans they have for Mr Koizumi, the mandarins cannot escape that uncomfortable truth.","  Once again , Japan 's bureaucrats are under attack

 IT WAS a fishy business, from start to finish. On October 24th, the three partners in Japan's coalition government announced that they planned modifications to the lower-house electoral system. No one had been expecting changes to the present mix of single-seat constituencies and proportional representation, introduced in 1994 to cure the ills bedevilling Japanese politics. Nor was there any public pressure for the politicians to act. With this in mind, perhaps, the proposed alterations were small and poorly publicised. So poorly, in fact, that no one had an official explanation of why the changes were needed in the first place.
 Unofficially, of course, the reason was obvious. Since the ending of multi-seat constituencies, old-fashioned Japanese machine politics have been in decline. Under the old multi-seat system, party placemen could be sneaked into parliament with a fraction of the popular vote. By contrast, securing success in single-seat constituencies involves a risky and more demanding appeal to the majority.
 Big parties, such as the opposition Democrats and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), have struggled, though with mixed success, to adapt. But New Komeito, one of the LDP's two junior coalition partners, finds it cannot change. Beyond its highly- organised vote, the 8m households that count themselves members of Soka Gakkai, the lay Buddhist movement that backs the party, New Komeito has zero appeal. On the contrary, most non-believers are thoroughly hostile to the Buddhists. New Komeito badly needs the multi-seat system to be revived. So when, despite its pacifist leanings, New Komeito supported legal changes, finally passed this week, that will allow Japan to contribute more to America's fight against terrorism, many suspected that there would be a pay-off. A promise on electoral counter-reform would be an eminently suitable price.
 Strangely, no one seemed to have been overly bothered about how shabby all this would look. The proposed changes were to affect just 14 constituencies, most of them in or around Tokyo. There was no explanation why these particular constituencies would revert to the multi-seat system, while the rest of Japan would continue to use the 1994 single-seat principle. With no convincing alternative explanation, the public quickly came to its own conclusions: the list was New Komeito's, carefully drawn up in the light of its recent electoral failures. After a weekend of outrage, the reforms are now on ice for a year.
 What morals from this tale? It may well be that the wily old men who run the LDP never entertained the idea of actually pushing through any changes. After all, they can now go back to New Komeito and say that they did their best. But there has been on display abundant political stupidity of another kind. When he took office in April, Junichiro Koizumi rescued the LDP from a cynical and despairing electorate. The fragile trust the prime minister has since managed to build rests on his direct appeal to the voters, and an attention to how things look that has been lacking in the past. Unfortunately, it seems that the rest of his party is not yet on message.","  A fiasco over electoral reform

 FOREIGNERS may not have noticed the difference, but Japanese diplomacy has ""ceased to function"", according to the Yomiuri newspaper, Japan's most popular daily. For this grave state of affairs, blame Makiko Tanaka, Japan's foreign minister. Mrs Tanaka's supposed crimes mount daily. She lost a ring, and accused a staff member of stealing it. She threw tantrums about the invitation list for the emperor's autumn garden party. Heaven forbid, she seems even to have her own opinions about foreign policy. Naturally, the voices of reason are unanimous: Mrs Tanaka must go.
 In truth, Mrs Tanaka's card has been marked from the start. It is not that she is hopeless at her job. True, her grasp of foreign affairs can sometimes seem shaky, but that is hardly a novelty for a Japanese foreign minister. Her behaviour is a little erratic from time to time: she has taken to locking ministry officials in, and out of, their offices, for instance, and screaming at them. But great figures often have eccentric streaks. The mudslinging in the press says more about the petty vindictiveness of foreign-ministry bureaucrats than about Mrs Tanaka's particular shortcomings. What has hurt most, however, is the enmity of Yasuo Fukuda, the chief cabinet secretary. Mr Fukuda's star is rising, and he wants Mrs Tanaka's job.
 Mild-mannered and cautious in public, Mr Fukuda has quickly established himself behind the scenes as the only real heavyweight in the cabinet of Junichiro Koizumi, the prime minister. The son of a celebrated former prime minister, Takeo Fukuda, Mr Fukuda has connections among Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) grandees that have become indispensable to Mr Koizumi, who is struggling to take on his party's vested interests.
 So far, Mr Fukuda has played a shrewd game. He has blocked Mrs Tanaka's attempts to move her enemies in the foreign ministry to new jobs. In return, ministry officials have briefed him on policy, while keeping Mrs Tanaka in the dark. It was Mr Fukuda, it is said, who brokered the recent diplomatic reconciliation with China, for instance. Japan's scurrilous weekly news magazines call Mr Fukuda ""the real foreign minister"". His supporters in the LDP are agitating for a cabinet shuffle.
 This has put Mr Koizumi in a tight spot. Mrs Tanaka landed the foreign ministry because her support for Mr Koizumi was crucial in lifting him to power in April. The press has since been turned against her. But Mrs Tanaka is still hugely popular with the voters, who admire her sharp tongue, quick wits and penchant for abusing the foreign ministry's haughty mandarins. With his party and officialdom against him, Mr Koizumi limps on only because of his public popularity, part of which he owes to Mrs Tanaka. Mr Koizumi cannot afford to sack her. Quite the contrary: she is essential to his survival.
 Caught between two indispensable warring colleagues, Mr Koizumi seems to have decided, in sadly characteristic fashion, to do nothing. The bureaucrats are at fault, he says, but so is Mrs Tanaka. A cabinet shuffle, he says, is out of the question.
 Since Mr Koizumi will not sack his foreign minister, Mr Fukuda is now trying to persuade Mrs Tanaka to resign by ""filling in the castle moat"" around her, as the Japanese idiom has it. The spadework began this week, when Mrs Tanaka found her request to attend the G-8 foreign ministers' talks in New York this weekend turned down by a committee of the Diet, which must approve all ministerial trips abroad at times when the Diet is sitting. The committee's chairman, an LDP elder, maintained that Mrs Tanaka's skills were needed for parliamentary debate on supplementary budgets. Mrs Tanaka appealed to Mr Koizumi, who has conveniently been travelling abroad. He may have felt tempted to stay there.

  FOREIGNERS may not have noticed the difference , but Japanese diplomacy has "" ceased to function "" , according to the Yomiuri newspaper , Japan 's most popular daily . For this grave state of affairs , blame Makiko Tanaka , Japan 's foreign minister . Mrs Tanaka 's supposed crimes mount daily . She lost a ring , and accused a staff member of stealing it . She threw tantrums about the invitation list for the emperor 's autumn garden party . Heaven forbid , she seems even to have her own opinions about foreign policy . Naturally , the voices of reason are unanimous : Mrs Tanaka must go . 
  In truth , Mrs Tanaka 's card has been marked from the start . It is not that she is hopeless at her job . True , her grasp of foreign affairs can sometimes seem shaky , but that is hardly a novelty for a Japanese foreign minister . Her behaviour is a little erratic from time to time : she has taken to locking ministry officials in , and out of , their offices , for instance , and screaming at them . But great figures often have eccentric streaks . The mudslinging in the press says more about the petty vindictiveness of foreign - ministry bureaucrats than about Mrs Tanaka 's particular shortcomings . What has hurt most , however , is the enmity of Yasuo Fukuda , the chief cabinet secretary . Mr Fukuda 's star is rising , and he wants Mrs Tanaka 's job . 
  Mild - mannered and cautious in public , Mr Fukuda has quickly established himself behind the scenes as the only real heavyweight in Junichiro Koizumi . The son of a celebrated former prime minister , Takeo Fukuda , Mr Fukuda has connections among Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) grandees that have become indispensable to Mr Koizumi , who is struggling to take on his party 's vested interests . 
  So far , Mr Fukuda has played a shrewd game . He has blocked Mrs Tanaka 's attempts to move her enemies in the foreign ministry to new jobs . In return , ministry officials have briefed him on policy , while keeping Mrs Tanaka in the dark . It was Mr Fukuda , it is said , who brokered the recent diplomatic reconciliation with China , for instance . Japan 's scurrilous weekly news magazines call Mr Fukuda "" the real foreign minister "" . His supporters in the LDP are agitating for a cabinet shuffle . 
  This has put Mr Koizumi in a tight spot . Mrs Tanaka landed the foreign ministry because her support for Mr Koizumi was crucial in lifting him to power in April . The press has since been turned against her . But Mrs Tanaka is still hugely popular with the voters , who admire her sharp tongue , quick wits and penchant for abusing the foreign ministry 's haughty mandarins . With his party and officialdom against him , Mr Koizumi limps on only because of his public popularity , part of which he owes to Mrs Tanaka . Mr Koizumi can not afford to sack her . Quite the contrary : she is essential to his survival . 
  Caught between two indispensable warring colleagues , Mr Koizumi seems to have decided , in sadly characteristic fashion , to do nothing . The bureaucrats are at fault , he says , but so is Mrs Tanaka . A cabinet shuffle , he says , is out of the question . 
  Since Mr Koizumi will not sack his foreign minister , Mr Fukuda is now trying to persuade Mrs Tanaka to resign by "" filling in the castle moat "" around her , as the Japanese idiom has it .

 THE debate in Japan over whether the government should lift its blanket protection of bank deposits next April is heating up. Conservatives within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party want to keep the safety-net in place for another year or so, while a sick economy and a rotten banking system are sorted out. Junichiro Koizumi, the prime minister, insists that deposit-insurance reform, already postponed for two years, should go ahead as planned. He seems to fear further damage to Japan's credibility. Hakuo Yanagisawa, in charge of financial reform, also wants the net removed; officially, he believes that the banks are perfectly sound.
 It is by no means clear that the safety-net will go. Still, some depositors are taking no chances. If the reform goes ahead, deposit insurance for savings accounts will be capped at Yen10m ($83,000). Not surprisingly, time deposits, especially those bigger than Yen10m, have steadily declined over the past year (see chart); liquid deposits, such as current accounts, which will be protected for an extra year, have surged.
 Local governments, which lodge large sums of public money at banks, are particularly worried. Last month, Tokyo's metropolitan government set up a committee that includes a bank analyst, an economics professor and an analyst from a rating agency to set up guidelines on how to manage its money, most of which is placed in deposits at 20 banks. These, as well as another 200 or so banks that accept tax payments on its behalf, are to be reviewed ahead of the April deadline. The Kyoto municipality says it may buy more government bonds rather than keep the bulk of its money in banks. Hiroshima has the same idea--although it admits that its greatest worry about money is that it has less of it, thanks to recent falls in tax revenues. Other townships are besieged by securities salesmen smelling opportunity.
 In the corporate world, Seiyu, a large supermarket chain, transferred deposits of its sales proceeds from small banks to big city banks last year. Kirin Brewery and Omron, a high-tech company, are reviewing the credit risk of their banks and may withdraw from those that fail to meet new standards. Rotary Yoneyama Memorial, a charity that provides scholarships for overseas students coming to Japan, has been moving money into securities whenever one of its time deposits matures.
 Many individuals are spreading their money across different banks to limit their exposure. Others are simply consolidating their accounts in banks they consider either healthy, or at least ""too big to fail"". In desperation, a bunch of credit unions in northern Japan are now offering big depositors a new service that distributes funds among them to keep accounts at less than Yen10m. Even so, healthier ones such as Jonan Shinkin Bank, a savvy credit union that once offered sacks of rice to new depositors, have managed to buck the national trend. Jonan's savings accounts rose by Yen110 billion, or 6%, over the past year. Half the money, it says, has come from worried depositors, especially those with accounts at city banks.
 But maybe depositors should not worry. Although the government is likely to go ahead with deposit-insurance reform, it can, in an emergency, find new ways to protect depositors--for instance, by temporarily nationalising banks.","  Depositors lack faith in the banks

 IN ONE of Myanmar's rare government reshuffles, it was announced on November 10th that the fourth-ranking member of the military junta had been sacked, along with a senior minister. The next day five more ministers followed. A further movement of top brass is under way. In a recent conversation with Junichiro Koizumi, Japan's prime minister, Than Shwe, Myanmar's most senior general, had raised the possibility of a role for Aung San Suu Kyi, leader of the country's democracy movement. Is Myanmar on the brink of something momentous?
 Probably not. At the time of the last big reshuffle, in 1997, the junta changed its name from the sinister-sounding State Law and Order Restoration Council to the less-intimidating State Peace and Development Council, and reiterated its determination to restore democracy. Nothing changed. Another frisson ran through the country last year, when the junta and Miss Suu Kyi revealed that they had begun secret talks.
 Some exiles in Thailand hope that the new shake-up is designed to smooth the way for some sort of deal with Miss Suu Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy (NLD). The regime, optimists point out, has allowed the NLD to reopen a few offices in Yangon, the capital, and has freed some 200 political prisoners. But many more remain behind bars. A Yangon-based diplomat cautions that the junta has made no concessions it cannot easily reverse.
 Some senior NLD figures, indeed, detect signs in the reshuffle that the junta, which has run the country since 1988, is stronger and more determined than ever. The three most senior members, often said to be at loggerheads, have evidently managed to put their differences aside for a spell. They also took the bold step of recalling many of the powerful regional military commanders to desk jobs in Yangon. They are evidently making preparations, but whether to dig in or open up is unclear.

 ""THE Kyoto Protocol is saved,"" proclaimed Olivier DeLeuze, head of the European Union's delegation to the latest round of negotiations on the UN treaty to fight climate change. He made this triumphal claim on November 10th, at the end of two weeks of bitter wrangling in Marrakech, Morocco, that almost resulted in the collapse of the ill-starred treaty. Does this mean that business should start taking Kyoto seriously?
 The answer is only maybe. The optimistic case rests on the fact that this latest deal brings the Kyoto pact one step closer to reality. Once enough countries ratify it, the industrialised world will be legally bound to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) by about 5% below their 1990 level over the next decade.
 The most encouraging news for Kyoto fans came from the shift in Japan's position on the pact. When George Bush declared earlier this year that he wanted nothing to do with the treaty, the EU's leaders flew into fits of rage and disbelief. The Japanese, however, were non- committal. The prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, was concerned about upsetting his strongest ally, and his country's businessmen were worried that they would lose competitive edge to American rivals not burdened with Kyoto's costs.
 The treaty needed the support of countries accounting for 55% of greenhouse-gas emissions to come into force; that gave the Japanese delegation a crucial swing vote. Along with Australia, Russia and Canada, Japan accordingly pushed the EU hard to reduce the economic impact of the treaty, in several ways. Their most important demand related to whether countries that fail to meet their Kyoto targets face penalties that are legally binding or merely ""political"". The EU, faced with a possible collapse of the treaty, yielded.
 Cheerleaders
 Is the resulting compromise now toothless? No, says Jennifer Morgan of the World Wildlife Fund, a green group. She insists that this latest deal ""sends a strong signal to the shrinking ranks of doubters in politics and business"" that they should start to get serious about global warming. She may be right: two Kyoto-inspired initiatives have just been announced by business lobbies.
 The first is the GHG Protocol, which was developed by the World Business Council on Sustainable Development--which counts among its members such multinational giants as Ford, DuPont and ABB--and the World Resources Institute, an environmental think-tank. It establishes an international standard that will make it easier for businesses everywhere to report their emissions of GHG, measured according to the same criteria.
 The second business-led scheme, the Emissions Market Development Group--consisting of Credit Lyonnais, Swiss Re and Natsource (an emissions broker)--aims to kick-start the nascent market for emissions trading. Frank Joshua of Andersen, an audit firm that produced the plan for EMDG, says the goal is to create an entirely new ""commodity for international trading of greenhouse-gas reductions"".
 Margaret Beckett, Britain's environment secretary and a force behind the Marrakech compromise, thinks the deal could even spur efforts in America to take domestic action on climate change. But this may be wishful thinking. Asked whether the deal would influence his country's intransigent position at all, one senior American negotiator in Marrakech reportedly snapped: ""Other countries have chosen their path, and our answer is still 'No'.""

 THIS year offers a turning-point for Japan's troubled banks. Until now, rather than forcing banks to clean up bad debts of as much as Yen150 trillion ($1.1 trillion), the government has favoured stop- gap measures that have propped up the banks' weakest borrowers when they should have gone under. Investors in bank shares despair that the banks' problems will ever be confronted; or that if they are, there will be no end to them.
 Certainly, the news in November that the biggest banks would write down Yen6 trillion of problem loans in the year to March 2002--three times their original target, and almost double their combined operating profits--failed to persuade investors of the banks' resolve. The four biggest banking groups saw more than Yen5 trillion wiped off their market capitalisation, a drop of roughly one-third, in the final six weeks of 2001. The Topix banking index is close to record lows.
 The long drawn-out bank crisis may be coming to a head, however. The government has for years insisted that the banking system is sound, but now it is badly worried. Unless it restores confidence by April, when it has promised to lift its blanket protection of all deposits, the government fears runs on banks that could trigger a fresh crisis. To calm such concerns, the prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, said on December 27th that he may inject public funds to boost banks' capital bases. The Financial Services Agency (FSA) is also, belatedly, trying to weed out the weakest banks. Its re- examination of Ishikawa Bank, a regional bank which it had earlier found to have more liabilities than assets, led to the bank's collapse on December 28th. The FSA is conducting a ""special"" inspection into the banks' biggest problem borrowers, in hopes of improving inadequate provisioning.
 Indeed, officials seem quietly to be planning a ""controlled collapse"" of the banks' worst debtors, to start later this month. Just how many borrowers will be affected is unclear, but a handful of big construction companies, among others, are expected to go bust. The clean-up could also involve sorting out other big companies in dire financial straits (without officially bankrupting them): one example may be Daiei, the country's biggest supermarket chain, which has Yen2.6 trillion in debts. In a bid to persuade investors, especially foreign ones, that it is serious about reform, the government wants most of this choreographed clean-up finished before deposit insurance is lifted in April.
 That will not be easy. A mere handful of big bankruptcies would probably be seen as little more than a token gesture of reform, given the numbers of walking dead in Japan. On the other hand, a ""controlled"" exercise could soon get out of hand. Dealing with Daiei will be particularly tricky. A huge employer, its collapse would have political implications. Daiei is these days considered a test of the government's appetite for painful change.
 In little over a year, Daiei has spent the best part of a Yen500 billion credit line, yet it has been unable to stem falling sales. Sanwa Bank, one of the chain's four biggest creditors, is weighing several schemes, including one in which Daiei's main supermarket operation has its debts forgiven, allowing it to survive, but other parts of the group are sold or shut down. Sanwa is under pressure to act quickly, for its exposure to Daiei will double when it merges with Tokai Bank, another lender, in April. It also wants to act before too many jittery suppliers start refusing to do business with Daiei. One problem will be persuading Sumitomo Bank, a third big lender to Daiei with several other costly headaches (eg, two life insurers and a bunch of construction companies), to approve the plans. The alternative is a much uglier outcome for Daiei, and for the dozens of banks from which it has borrowed.
 With plenty of weak companies at risk, unforeseen corporate bankruptcies could upset the government's orderliness. The cost of credit has shot up in the wake of recent bankruptcies, putting the viability of many more companies in doubt. External events, too, could prove a trigger. Japan's giant trading houses, for example, worry about Indonesia defaulting on its debt to them, leading to casualties. And officials are concerned about banks' exposure to derivatives issued by Enron, America's spectacularly bust utility, which have yet to be fully assessed.
 All the while, regulators have to worry about Japan's own economy, and about the risk that prices of government bonds may fall, damaging banks' huge bond portfolios. This could happen if Japan's sovereign- debt rating falls another notch, which--given the country's worsening finances--could easily happen. Or a sharp fall in the yen (see next story) might conceivably lead to capital flight and rising bond yields.
 Then again, 2002 could turn out to be yet one more year of government irresolution, in which banks are propped up and not cleaned up. That would be the worst outcome of all.","  Whether intentionally or not , it may be crunch time for the banks

In a bid to persuade investors , especially foreign ones , that it is serious about reform , the government wants most of this choreographed clean - up finished before deposit insurance is lifted in April . 
  That will not be easy . A mere handful of big bankruptcies would probably be seen as little more than a token gesture of reform , given the numbers of walking dead in Japan . On the other hand , a "" controlled "" exercise could soon get out of hand . Dealing with Daiei will be particularly tricky . A huge employer , its collapse would have political implications . Daiei is these days considered a test of the government 's appetite for painful change . 
  In little over a year , Daiei has spent the best part of a Yen500 billion credit line , yet it has been unable to stem falling sales . Sanwa Bank , one of the chain 's four biggest creditors , is weighing several schemes , including one in which Daiei 's main supermarket operation has its debts forgiven , allowing it to survive , but other parts of the group are sold or shut down . Sanwa is under pressure to act quickly , for its exposure to Daiei will double when it merges with Tokai Bank , another lender , in April . It also wants to act before too many jittery suppliers start refusing to do business with Daiei . One problem will be persuading Sumitomo Bank , a third big lender to Daiei with several other costly headaches ( eg , two life insurers and a bunch of construction companies ) , to approve the plans . The alternative is a much uglier outcome for Daiei , and for the dozens of banks from which it has borrowed . 
  With plenty of weak companies at risk , unforeseen corporate bankruptcies could upset the government 's orderliness . The cost of credit has shot up in the wake of recent bankruptcies , putting the viability of many more companies in doubt . External events , too , could prove a trigger . Japan 's giant trading houses , for example , worry about Indonesia defaulting on its debt to them , leading to casualties . And officials are concerned about banks ' exposure to derivatives issued by Enron , America 's spectacularly bust utility , which have yet to be fully assessed . 
  All the while , regulators have to worry about Japan 's own economy , and about the risk that prices of government bonds may fall , damaging banks ' huge bond portfolios . This could happen if Japan 's sovereign- debt rating falls another notch , which -- given the country 's worsening finances -- could easily happen . Or a sharp fall in the yen ( see next story ) might conceivably lead to capital flight and rising bond yields . 
  Then again , 2002 could turn out to be yet one more year of government irresolution , in which banks are propped up and not cleaned up . That would be the worst outcome of all .",740,Japan,A29-8209,IN TERM,True,"the prime minister , Junichiro Koizumi",2,True

 AFTER analysing Japan's economic and political problems at length, Koichi Kato suddenly turns rather emotional. As he shifts his attention to the environment, Mr Kato, who heads a prominent faction in Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), harks back to an idealised golden age, when the people of the Japanese islands lived more in tune with nature. ""Now,"" says Mr Kato, ""there are no trees on our mountains. There are no vegetables, no woods, no fish."" The confidence Japan once gained from economic development, he notes, has clearly vanished, and with it the compensation for the loss of a more harmonious life. ""Even many poor countries believe in something,"" says Mr Kato. ""What is our basic value?""
 Such laments are hardly unique to Japan, of course. In every developed country, voters and the politicians who woo them share a distaste for some of the environmental effects of economic growth. But in Japan, a decade of economic torpor--which the government warned voters recently would last at least another two years--has imparted a different twist to this debate. Instead of just looking for greener ways to boost output, politicians are pushing environmental reforms as a way to rescue Japan from its economic doldrums. Their proposals amount to the ultimate free lunch--one full of fish and vegetables and no doubt served on a leafy mountainside.
 Some, such as Mr Kato, believe that exports provide one of the magic links, as they have so often before. By developing cleaner, greener technologies, they say, Japanese firms can foster yet another world-beating industry and sell their innovations abroad.
 Other politicians have latched on to different angles. Naoto Kan, secretary-general of the opposition Democratic Party, proposes several traditional environmental schemes, such as promoting windmills and tightening rules on dioxin, a pollutant produced by some industrial processes which can cause birth defects. But he, too, thinks that some green policies can actually boost the economy. Instead of spending stimulus money on new dams, he asks, why not put people to work planting trees instead?
 These ideas try to respond to two chronic worries of Japanese voters: that the economy will continue to slide, and that the construction state will cover what little remains of their country with concrete in a vain attempt to fix the problem. After a decade of fruitless building schemes, which have wrecked much of Japan's coastline and littered it with bridges that no one uses, the government still pours 19% of its budget into public works. Clever environmental schemes, say the new greens, could hardly be less effective at stimulating the economy--and they would at least make the place a lot prettier.
 Given the power of Japan's entrenched construction industry, and the difficulty of pressing even the mildest of conventional reforms, such a shift of resources would be nearly impossible to pull off in practice. Besides, with a debt level of 130% of GDP, Japan is rapidly running out of room to afford any kind of economic stimulus, however environmentally friendly. Its government bonds have already been downgraded several times. Nevertheless, the slogan ""green growth"" does make a useful line of attack against the popular prime minister, Junichiro Koiziumi, whose cabinet continues to draw public support ratings well above 70%.
 For opposition leaders such as Mr Kan, as well as LDP reformists such as Mr Kato, distinguishing themselves from Mr Koizumi while still attacking the LDP's dinosaurs has proved difficult. Promoting pro-green stimulus plans is one way of allowing them to stake a claim to the rhetorical middle ground. They are against the LDP's grip on public-works spending. But they are also looking for ways to criticise Mr Koiziumi if his own reform efforts--which involve fiscal- spending limits and exhortations to endure short-term pain-- eventually prove unpopular. After all, when belt-tightening fails, free lunches become easier than ever to sell.","  Can Japan boost its economy by protecting nature ?

 WITH Asian exports slumping, security fears mounting and a new round of world trade talks beginning, Junichiro Koizumi had plenty to discuss with his counterparts in South-East Asia during his five- nation tour, ending with a speech in Singapore on January 14th. Mr Koizumi stressed the merits of using global agreements to lower trade barriers, implicitly dismissing the regionalism that many Asian politicians espouse. He offered to throw Japan's security forces-- especially its coast guard--more fully into the battle against piracy and arms smuggling. But since the prime minister's themes were general ones, to be followed at best by a string of low-key initiatives, they could hardly vie for attention with the awkward news of the moment: a weak yen.
 As Mr Koizumi began his trip, Japan's currency was trading below 133 to the dollar, after shedding 6% of its value in a month. That slide has rightly worried its high-tech north-eastern neighbours, South Korea and Taiwan, but ought to pose little threat to South- East Asia, since all its economies save Singapore's are too rudimentary to compete with Japanese exports. Moreover, the yen recovered slightly during Mr Koizumi's tour, after officials hinted that they did not favour a steeper drop. None of that stopped China, however, from trying to score some points.
 Its government has been grumbling for weeks, through the state press, that a weaker yen is not neighbourly. Just after Mr Koizumi's tour ended, it broadcast a more forceful complaint. On January 15th, Dai Xianglong, the central bank governor, warned that China might be forced to devalue if the yen does fall further--a move that would put far more pressure on South-East Asian exporters. He urged Japan to ""avoid the domino effect"". Malaysia's prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, had raised similar fears as Mr Koizumi passed through, saying that his country (which, unlike the other four economies visited, still fixes its exchange rate) might have to abandon its peg if China devalues.
 This dance looks much like the one following East Asia's 1997-98 collapse. Then, Japan's $80 billion in aid went largely unappreciated, while China won plaudits around the region for refusing to devalue the yuan: a policy shift that would anyway have done more harm than good to its own economy. If China devalues this time, Japan will receive much of the blame, regardless of whether a weak yen helps to stir its own economy from its decade-long slump.
 Although the other economies he visited--Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines--raised few worries about the yen, Mr Koizumi faced a tougher task over free-trade initiatives. Unlike Singapore, with which Mr Koizumi signed a new free-trade deal to spice up his visit, those three economies have big agricultural sectors. Any balanced effort to lower trade barriers would face resistance from Japanese farmers. Mr Koizuimi did not rule anything out, but there are no concrete concessions in sight.
 That makes it even harder to respond to China's other recent shot across the bows: a deal announced in November to push for a free- trade area between itself and the ten-member Association of South- East Asian Nations (ASEAN). While that announcement sparked Japanese fears of being locked out, it also presaged a less obvious attack on Japan's global trade and investment goals. Unlike most of its Asian neighbours, Japan has for decades held to an open, inclusive approach to Asian trade talks (though it has also remained fairly protectionist once the talking starts). It has thus resisted deals that aim to leave out other trading partners, especially the United States. Japan could, for example, ask to join, along with South Korea, the new free-trade area its neighbours are talking about. That would draw neat economic boundaries around the ""ASEAN-plus-three"" talking shop that already exists. But it would also give narrow regionalists, such as Malaysia's Dr Mahathir, the exclusive (and less sensible) arrangement they seek.
 Instead, Mr Koizumi has responded by continuing to champion a broader approach. For starters, he suggested last week that any cosier ties in the region ought to include Australia and New Zealand, two countries that, along with Singapore, have shared Japan's open approach. In the Singapore speech, he also made clear that such an ASEAN-plus-five ""community"" must continue to push for closer links to Europe and America, rather than turning inward. Mercifully, the United States itself has helped matters by remaining uncharacteristically quiet about China's November proposal. When Dr Mahathir proposed a similar arrangement in 1990 (essentially a previous version of ASEAN-plus-three), the American backlash won him some easy converts. Is Asia at last seeing a Japan that speaks for itself?

 WHEN he formed his cabinet last April, Junichiro Koizumi named one minister who, above all, seemed to prove that he meant business. Makiko Tanaka, the outspoken daughter of a 1970s prime minister, took over the foreign ministry and promptly declared war on its aloof and unaccountable bureaucrats. Although other ministries have done more to keep Japan's economy bedridden, most voters thought hers was a good enough place to start, and showered her with approval ratings that only Mr Koizumi could match.
 Unfortunately, Mrs Tanaka made a poor foreign minister. She showed little flair for diplomacy, offered no good foreign-policy ideas, and undermined her assault on the bureaucrats with petty personal feuds. So after her tangle with a powerful MP slowed the passage of an economic-stimulus bill, Mr Koizumi conceded yet another round to the bureaucrats. He sacked Mrs Tanaka on January 29th, saying her tribulations had begun ""to affect the entire government and parliamentary debate"".
 The row that finished off Mrs Tanaka followed a big international conference last week in Tokyo. Her underlings had at first barred a pair of aid groups from the gathering, which was held to pledge assistance for Afghanistan, but Mrs Tanaka decided to invite the two groups anyway. She says she did so after her deputy, Yoshiji Nogami, told her that the ban was the work of Muneo Suzuki, a powerful ruling- party MP who holds sway over the foreign ministry. Publicly, Mr Nogami--who was also forced to resign this week--says he knows nothing about this. And when Mrs Tanaka defended herself in parliament after the conference, Mr Suzuki called her a liar, a barb so treacherous that it later reduced her to tears.
 Mrs Tanaka's nine-month tenure has produced many similar episodes, from lost jewellery to hidden invitations for imperial garden parties. All the while her subordinates, who once worked feverishly behind the scenes to make their ministers look good, displayed an even greater talent for smear campaigns. But she has got no closer to her ultimate goal of calling the bureaucrats to account, and it has been clear for months that her days were numbered.
 In the event, domestic policy rather than foreign affairs seems to have triggered her downfall. The economic bill that had been held up by her row with Mr Suzuki--and which was eventually passed this week- -involves a supplementary stimulus. It will stuff an extra Yen2.5 trillion ($19 billion) of spending into the budget for the year that ends on March 31st. Though tiny in the context of the economic slide, Mr Koizumi was keen to push some form of anti-recession plan through the Diet. The need for speed seemed especially great early this week, when the government released a new string of scary statistics.
 The unemployment rate ticked up to 5.6% in December, the highest figure since the second world war. More than 1m heads of households are now out of work. All this contributed to a fall in real household spending of 4.4% in the year to December. The news, combined with another warning from a foreign rating agency, drove the Nikkei stockmarket index below 10,000, close to the 18-year low that it hit in the wake of last year's terrorist attacks in America.
 These problems, of course, far outweigh those at the foreign ministry. Indeed, its inability to reverse a decade-long slump is arguably Japan's biggest foreign-policy problem, as well as its biggest domestic one. Whatever its effect on the foreign ministry, therefore, the sacking of Mrs Tanaka must be judged by whether it strengthens Mr Koizumi's ability to sort out the economy. By removing a large distraction, it may do that. But if Mrs Tanaka's failings hold any lessons for Mr Koizumi, it is that popularity ratings ultimately mean nothing if they are not backed by results.","  Junichiro Koizumi may come to regret sacking Junichiro Koizumi's foreign minister

 A GRIMMER week even than usual in Japanese finance. The Nikkei 225 share average fell below America's Dow Jones Industrial Average for the first time in 45 years; at its peak in 1989, the Nikkei was 15 times higher than the Dow (see chart on next page). One rating agency, Standard & Poor's, cut the credit ratings of seven banks. Moody's placed seven life insurers on review for possible downgrades.
 The stockmarkets form the battleground between investors, who demand that the banks and their equally sick debtors be sorted out, and the government, which seems to have abandoned recent promises of a sort-out. Investors are all the more frustrated, because late last year it seemed that the big banks, which have some Yen150 trillion ($1.1 trillion) of bad debts, were at last about to clean up their act. The government itself, in an effort to restore confidence by April, when it is due to lift its blanket protection of bank deposits, also hinted at a ""controlled collapse"" of some big companies with heavy debts to banks. Daiei, a supermarket chain with Yen2.6 trillion in debts, has become a test of banks' resolve.
 When Daiei unveiled a fresh restructuring plan last month, it fell short of expectations. The retailer really needs to spin off the healthy bit of its operations, and sell or shut down the rest--a process that could cost creditor banks some Yen800 billion. But banks have promised only half that amount, leaving Daiei to muddle through again. One reason, says Hironari Nozaki of HSBC Securities, is that Sumitomo Mitsui Bank, one of three main creditors, whose budget for writing off bad loans is half that of the other two, UFJ Bank and Mizuho Financial, cannot afford any more.
 Late last month Mitsui Construction and Sumitomo Construction, two duds in an overcrowded industry, announced that they might merge within a couple of years. Bank shares fell sharply again. Mergers will do little to ease oversupply in the construction business. So far there has been only one token failure.
 On January 31st Tokio Marine & Fire, Japan's biggest property-and- casualty insurer, suddenly scrapped plans to buy the new-business operations of Asahi Mutual, a shaky life insurer, in March. Tokio Marine, whose share price had fallen after it announced a full merger with Asahi in 2003, postponed these plans as well. Asahi is now in deep trouble, desperate to get Yen100 billion from banks to boost its capital. Yet the fate of the country's fifth-biggest insurer, with Yen10 trillion of assets, is awkward for investors and bureaucrats. Propping Asahi up smacks of fudge. But its failure could harm Mizuho Financial, which holds a large chunk of Asahi's debt as well as Daiei's.
 What really frightens investors is the risk of a domino effect. Confidence in the insurance industry could get shakier still, leading to more cancellations of policies and outflows of funds. Sumitomo Life and Mitsui Mutual would be especially vulnerable, with implications for Sumitomo Mitsui Bank, thought to have lent Yen415 billion to the two insurers. Although banks do not want to contemplate the collapse of big life insurers (which are, after all, among the banks' biggest shareholders), they cannot afford to do much to help.
 Political credibility is at a low, particularly after the prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, sacked his foreign minister, Makiko Tanaka, late last month. So when it comes to the banks, the government is trapped. Frustrated investors drag down share prices. This damages banks' share portfolios, and reduces their ability to write off bad loans, upsetting investors further. At current share prices, banks are sitting on almost Yen5 trillion of equity losses, more than one-and-a-quarter times their annual operating profits. If the government waits too long, banks could become too weak to survive the reforms that investors demand.","  Mounting risks in the financial system

 ANXIOUSLY, the world is waiting for signs that its biggest economy, America, is resuming its growth. Many are also wondering how strongly Europe's economies might grow this year, and whether that could help the rest of the world to revive the flows of trade and investment that were such a feature of the 1990s. No one, though, is wondering whether the world's second-biggest economy, Japan, might provide further assistance. For everyone knows that it will not: the only debate concerns how long and deep its recession will be. The charitable consider Japan an irrelevance. The less charitable see it as a liability. The panicky see it as a danger. Most Japanese simply shrug their shoulders.
 Next Monday, February 18th, when President George Bush meets Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, in Tokyo, the air will be thick with attempts to paper this over. From the Americans, there will be diplomatically phrased urgings that Japan should do more to reform its economy. From the Japanese government, there will be strenuous efforts to claim that reform is under way, that problems are being solved, that new measures are being considered. The claims will even be true, in a sense: there are plans aplenty, with stages and pillars and fine aspirations. But in a rather stronger sense they will be false: reforms are not being implemented, problems are not being solved, new measures are likely to make as little progress as the old ones. Japan is in a slow, so far genteel decline.
 The reformer stymied
 Perhaps the saddest thing is that there is nothing new about this. The turn in Japan's fortunes began in 1990 with the crash in its stock and property markets, and then took firm hold in the mid-1990s when banks started to crumble and public borrowing lost its ability to keep the economy growing. As long ago as September 26th 1998, The Economist lamented on its cover about ""Japan's amazing ability to disappoint"". A canny Japanese parliamentarian interjected that we had got it wrong. The headline ought really to have read: ""The Japanese people's amazing inability to be disappointed"". He had a point: despite all the country's troubles, the same old bunch--the Liberal Democratic Party--kept on being elected to run, or at least lead, the government.
 That is why Mr Koizumi's entry to office last April came as a welcome sign of disappointment. He is also one of the old bunch, but a maverick who seemed to stand for change. He grabbed the party leadership by winning support at the grassroots, and secured remarkably high ratings in opinion polls. He helped his party do well in elections to the upper house of Japan's parliament last summer. His slogan suggested that he understood that the real problem was obstruction within his own party: ""Change the LDP, change Japan!"" So far, though, he has failed to solve that problem and therefore has failed to deliver any noticeable reform. His modest attempts have been blocked, or put in the slow lane. Since he sacked his popular (if erratic) foreign minister, Makiko Tanaka, last month, his poll ratings have fallen. That calls into doubt the one powerful card he has had up his sleeve: the threat of calling a general election and trying to make it, in effect, a referendum on reform.
 The party dinosaurs are blocking his policies--on privatisation, bank clean-ups, administrative reform and deregulation--because change threatens the interest groups that vote for them, or finance them, or both. Another possibility should also be kept in mind, however. It is that the blockers realise that reform is not terribly popular with the general public, either. Voters may in principle like a man (or a woman, Ms Tanaka) who stands against the establishment, but as soon as it gets down to real policies that might cause real pain, they are naturally less keen. This has yet to be tested in a general election. But the old guard's hunch could well be right. Their best bet is to keep Mr Koizumi only so long as he remains popular, but meanwhile to stop him achieving anything.
 No silver bullets
 This apparent acceptance, among the general public as well as the political old guard, of a long, slow decline is rather sad for a once- vibrant nation, but not all that surprising. Life during the decline is by no means terrible: public services and infrastructure are good, people are affluent, families are strong. And the alternative is far from easy. There is no single solution to Japan's ills: neither a depreciating yen, nor monetary expansion by the Bank of Japan, nor fiscal reform, nor nationalisation of the banks, nor privatisation, nor deregulation, nor mass bankruptcies of zombie companies will bring Japan's economy leaping back to productive life. The government needs to do all of these, over a period of years, in order to reflate demand as well as reinvigorating private enterprise and restoring consumers' confidence ()see pages 25-27. All measures will be painful, in their different ways. How much easier it is simply to muddle through, slipping downhill more or less gracefully.
 Which is why that is the likeliest thing to happen. Matters will turn out differently only if the Japanese public finds a new ability to become disappointed. That could occur in one of two ways: if a panic over bank deposits or a collapsing government-bond market makes them worried about their savings and determined to force change, rather as Argentines have done with their pots and pans; or if, in a general election, they finally kick out the old guard. Alas, either of these outcomes would bring with it the danger of opening the way to more extreme, nationalist political leaders such as Shintaro Ishihara, the foreigner-baiting governor of Tokyo.
 It is not a pretty prospect. President Bush will know that Japan is not part of his ""axis of evil"", and that it will support (discreetly) his efforts to constrain North Korea. But he should also note that, on current trends, Japan is going to be a drag on the world economy, not a help to it, that its efforts to depreciate the yen without embarking on real reform are liable to cause friction with its neighbours, especially China, and that there is some chance that its economy could genuinely collapse during the next few months and years.

 WHEN George Bush and Junichiro Koizumi met in Washington last June, it was the American president who seemed the more politically insecure and the Japanese prime minister who was riding high. Now, as they prepare to meet in Tokyo next week, their positions seem to be reversed. Mr Bush looks more sure-footed than he did last summer, and he has the kind of sky-high public approval once enjoyed by his Japanese counterpart. Mr Koizumi's fall from grace, meanwhile, has been swift and stunning. Since he sacked his popular foreign minister last month, his poll numbers have plunged. Worse, Mr Koizumi's plight may make him more helpless than ever against Japan's triple menace of debt, deflation and political deadlock.
 That is why Mr Bush's anti-terrorism campaign will not seem the most pressing issue when he arrives on February 17th, starting a week- long tour of Japan, South Korea and China. Of course, Mr Bush will want to discuss the regime in North Korea, which he has recently fingered as a member of his ""axis of evil"". He will also praise Japan for sending support ships to the Indian Ocean to help America in the Afghanistan campaign. But all eyes next week will be on Japan's economic slide, and on Mr Koizumi's newest set of promises--to be unveiled for Mr Bush's benefit--that he will do something about it.
 Those glancing in from a distance may find it hard to tell Japan's current mess from the general doom and gloom of the past decade. But people watching more closely see three especially strong reasons to tremble now. The first is that deflation and depressed spending continue unabated, bringing fears of an accelerating downward spiral. Consumer prices have fallen every month for more than two years. Retail sales have fallen for more than three years, and were down by nearly 6% in the year to December. GDP is once again falling in real terms; nominal GDP is falling even faster (see chart 1).
 Only a few months ago many Japanese economists were still saying that Japan's deflation might be healthy, since lower prices make life better for consumers. Those optimists have gone silent, however, as falling prices have continued to be matched by dwindling jobs. Japan's unemployment rate rose to 5.6% in December, the highest since the second world war and nearly a percentage point above the rate a year ago (see chart 2 on next page). More than a million heads of Japanese households are now out of work.
 The job losses follow collapsing balance sheets at weak Japanese companies, as falling prices squeeze profits and make it harder for them to service their debts. More than 19,000 companies went bankrupt last year, many of them small and mid-sized suppliers feeding Japan's bigger conglomerates.
 Worse, the job cuts keep accumulating. Successive waves of lay- offs eat further into national income and confidence, hampering household spending and sending slightly healthier firms to the wall. Last year, such well-known corporate giants as Fujitsu, Hitachi and Toshiba announced massive cuts in employment as their profits collapsed. These were matched by countless smaller lay-offs at less well-known Japanese firms.
 Banking blues
 This deflationary trend is one reason why informed observers now feel so jittery. A second reason stems from Japan's rickety banking system (a natural consequence of all those indebted companies), and from the common knowledge that the government must one day accept that it will have to do more to deal with the burden of banks' bad loans. Although this has been obvious for years, a confluence of coming events has persuaded many investors that the day of reckoning is near.
 On April 1st, Japan will start a new financial year, which this time round will set off a pair of decisive changes. Banks, which own lots of Japanese equities, will be made to value these shares at market prices. Because equity prices have fallen sharply since the shares were bought, the banks will have to show losses of more than one-and-a-quarter times their operating profits. Although those losses have already occurred, admitting to them could cause fresh problems if it prompts more depositors or investors to flee.
 Depositors are anyway nervous, because of another change due on April 1st. After putting it off last year, the government will finally begin rolling back the blanket deposit insurance that it introduced in 1998. The first stage will affect only time deposits, and will limit insurance to Yen10m ($75,200) per depositor at each bank in which the person or institution holds an account. Many depositors have already moved their money, spreading it around in Yen10m instalments and transferring much of the rest into other types of deposits, which will remain insured for another year. The risk remains that the partial repeal will cause bank runs. Some Japanese have been buying gold for safety.
 These looming changes, by raising the odds that Japan's long- awaited crisis will at last arrive, leading to some kind of economic meltdown that could be cathartic but might be disastrous, have helped to send asset prices tumbling. Share prices have fallen yet again, to their lowest levels since the mid-1980s. The Nikkei 225 stockmarket average, which in its proudest moment in 1989 approached 40,000, now languishes at around 10,000 (see chart 3).
 Worse will follow if bond investors come to share the alarm. So far they have been subdued, keeping the government's debt-service payments in check. But, after running up fiscal deficits throughout the past decade's slump, Japan's official public debt has risen to 130% of GDP. Even the fuzziest maths cannot disguise that the real problem is much worse. For a start, Japan's deflation is causing nominal GDP to shrink, driving up the debt-to-GDP ratio even without any new spending. Add to that a continuing annual deficit, to avoid adding fiscal contraction to the economy's other woes, and the debt ratio will go on rising. The budget that Mr Koizumi wants to pass, which is modest by his ruling party's standards, will easily drive the ratio above 140% within a year.
 None of this includes the cost of the government's other liabilities, stemming from publicly-backed corporations, social- security promises, and, if it is forced to nationalise the banks, the cost of cleaning up their balance sheets. Japan's fiscal position is, in short, pretty dreadful. This has already prompted downgrades by the rating agencies: this week, Moody's said it might lower Japan's credit rating to the same levels as Poland and South Africa. The only blessing is that foreigners hold little of the government's debt, which may still allow it to postpone a bond-market panic.
 Thus both the pace of economic deflation and the risk of financial implosion seem to have gone up a notch or two lately. But neither of these threats is new. And, even if the risks are now higher, Japan might still find a way to muddle through and delay any real crunch-- as it has managed to do for most of the past ten years.
 Even those onlookers who still downplay the situation are fretting, however, for a third reason. Unlike most previous bouts of panic over Japan, they fear, this one has far more potential to cause trouble in the rest of the world. With much of East Asia still in recession, and an American recovery still shaky and uncertain, an implosion of what is still the world's second-biggest economy could seriously damage the global economy. Japan remains a big trader, investor and lender, so any collapse would affect all its counterparties. And even if Japan pursues mild efforts to avoid it, its trading partners, especially in the rest of Asia, will still share its pain.
 The most visible sign of this risk is the yen, which began sliding towards the end of last year. It has recently settled down, hovering around 133 to the dollar (see chart 4). But even that has prompted outcries from Japan's East Asian neighbours, as well as from the United States. America's big car makers petitioned Mr Bush, apparently with little success, to put their troubles with Japanese rivals on the agenda of his meeting with Mr Koizumi. Last month America's treasury secretary, Paul O'Neill, also delivered a mild rebuke while he was in Tokyo, by urging Japan not to drive its currency down at the expense of other ""reforms"".
 Reform, reflate or both
 Mr O'Neill thus plunged headlong into a contentious and confused debate that has plagued Japan for years: reflate first and reform later? Or vice versa? Or just reflate? A simple dispute over this is hardly the crux of the problem. Vested interests--among the bureaucracy, the politicians of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the disproportionately powerful voting blocks that back it- -are clearly the prime culprits. These groups benefit in some ways from Japan's malaise, especially from the fiscal gravy train that has rattled along unhindered throughout the slump. Just as important, these factions are perennially battling each other, over which of them should bear the shame and financial costs of fixing the problem.
 Japan's vested interests do not merely frustrate reform through unpopular votes in the Diet, Japan's parliament. They also command much of the machinery through which ideas are evaluated and turned into legislation. If a prime minister wants to challenge them, he has little chance of even bringing a good alternative up for a vote. That makes it harder for the Japanese voters to vet recovery plans clearly, and make their wishes known. When combined with backroom dealing, lacklustre mass media and the cacophony of factional battles, this had made it all but impossible for any plan to achieve a consensus. And, when there is no consensus, Japan tends to revert to autopilot.
 Politically, therefore, Japan would find it hard to recover even if disinterested experts could agree on what it should do. Yet, even without worrying about who wins and loses, economic analysts continue to bicker among themselves over the answer. All agree, however, on Japan's need to inflate its way out of trouble. Its private and public debts are enormous. Falling prices make almost everything worse. Any effort to tackle Japan's numerous other problems will require much more borrowing or take another big chunk out of domestic demand. There is no realistic way forward, therefore, without steps to get Japanese prices rising, preferably by several percentage points a year. This would not only boost nominal demand, but would lower the public and private debt burden in real, inflation- adjusted, terms.
 Unfortunately, a collapsed asset bubble followed by years of inaction have made it hard for Japan to achieve inflation, since expectations of flat or falling prices are so entrenched. With short- term interest rates at zero, the Bank of Japan has tried to loosen things further through ""quantitative easing"", making more funds available to banks. But that has done little to boost broad-money supply; bank lending has been falling inexorably for four years.
 Technocrats debate ways to fix this problem. One approach is to get the banks to finance Japan's fiscal deficit directly, bypassing the bond markets. Another is to print yen and use them to buy up foreign bonds. But most economists agree that, if Japan is to achieve inflation, the yen will have to fall much further, perhaps to between 180 and 200 to the dollar.
 What about structural reform? Should it wait for inflation or be done in parallel? Various groups are juggling different reform plans to fix Japan's ""structural problems"" and help restore growth. There is certainly a risk that harsh supply-side reforms would, on their own, make things worse, rather as they did in American in the 1930s; Japan's chief problem is shortage of demand, even though some demand may be suppressed by supply-side problems. So the most sensible option is to work in parallel with inflation, to the extent that Japan can achieve it. The prime candidates for reform are Japan's insolvent banks, along with their mirror reflections, overly indebted companies.
 Along with slumping demand, Japan is now beset by overcapacity in many industries, such as construction and retailing. Many of these companies can never be profitable, but because the banks continue to prop them up they can avoid going bust. As they continue to cling on, meanwhile, the walking dead drive down prices and capture business from healthier rivals.
 Looked at in isolation, this competition seems good for consumers, since everybody must cut prices. But when you step back and look more carefully, say structural-reform advocates, far from promoting ""market competition"" in Japan, the corporate zombies are perpetuating the deflationary spiral. Take over the banks and let these companies go bust, say the reformers, and you will help arrest deflation by eliminating much excess capacity.
 It does not matter so much exactly how the government does this. It could nationalise the banks, and use its control to deny credit to hopeless debtors. Or it could single out the most indebted companies and find some way to drive them into receivership, perhaps by simply publishing a list and letting suppliers and lenders do the job. Either way, the effect would be the same. It would also be helpful to cut off the fiscal tap to sectors such as construction, and perhaps channel more public money towards the workers who will be laid off after structural reforms.
 Koizumi's conundrum
 How has all this affected Mr Koizumi's calls for reform? The basic, abridged, version is that Mr Koizumi, a longstanding LDP insider with a funky hairstyle and a gift for plain talk, persuaded the party's grass roots that he was more eager for change than his rivals in the LDP leadership, and that this was a good thing. The party rank-and-file propelled him to the top last April, after the previous prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, bumbled himself out of the job.
 Mr Koizumi started off well, promising to clean up the banks, restrain government borrowing and derail the gravy train through ""structural reform without sanctuary"". The wider public adored his brisk style of speaking, and his promises to inflict pain for the sake of future gain. When teamed up with his combative foreign minister, Makiko Tanaka, who promised to expose corruption and insubordination in her ministry, Mr Koizumi achieved strong public approval, with more than 80% of Japanese voters, at the high points, saying that they backed his government.
 But three developments have helped to pull Mr Koizumi to earth. First, he could not reform much since he does not really run Japan. The despised ""resistance forces"" in the LDP and the bureaucracy have watered down all his plans and slowed their passage, depriving Mr Koizumi of both momentum and results.
 Second, these forces, having bought time, have cashed in on the recession by persuading people that Japan needs to pursue ""anti- deflation"" (by which the LDP means more public spending) before structural reforms (which would cut off the tap). This put pressure on Mr Koizumi to push his own budget, which at least has better priorities than his opponents'.
 But then he botched his response to the third development: Ms Tanaka's battle with the bureaucrats and the LDP old guard. In order to ease the passage of his budget, Mr Koizumi sacrificed Ms Tanaka, foolishly provoking a backlash and losing his only real asset, his popularity.
 What happens now? Many of Mr Koizumi's reforms seem less likely than ever to happen. If asset prices continue to slide, the government may have to deal more actively with the banks' bad debts. More likely, it will keep muddling through, announcing just a few measures to prop up the banks, without solving their underlying problems. A mildly lower yen might, in the meantime, mildly boost exports; and Japan may get a boost in May and June when it co-hosts soccer's World Cup. Alas for Mr Koizumi, and for Japan, the real crisis that would force an acceptance of reforms could still take longer to arrive.

 WITH allies like those in Asia, George Bush must have been thinking on his way to Beijing on February 21st, who needs ""strategic competitors""? Before arriving in China, that erstwhile competitor, for a two-day state visit, America's president had spent the earlier part of the week trying to bolster the reforming instincts of Japan's faltering prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, and then braving ""frank"" discussions (a diplomat's word for a fallout) with South Korea's president, Kim Dae Jung, over how to handle North Korea. It is not that there wasn't also plenty to disagree about in China, from human rights and Taiwan to missile defences and Mr Bush's determination to prevent countries such as Iraq, Iran and North Korea from developing the technologies of mass destruction. But, like many a president before him, Mr Bush is discovering that diplomacy in Asia never quite goes smoothly.
 The events of September 11th have cast America's relations with each of the three countries he visited this week in a new light. In Tokyo Mr Bush called the American-Japanese security alliance the ""bedrock for peace and prosperity in the Pacific"". Pointedly making Japan the first stop on his three-country tour (Bill Clinton had caused unneeded offence by failing even to visit Japan when he went to China in 1998), he claimed the alliance had ""never been stronger"". In some ways that is true. Witness Japan's decision to send support ships to the Indian Ocean, to provide logistical help for America's campaign in Afghanistan. Some in America would have preferred Japan to send its powerful destroyers, but it marked a big shift for Japan.
 Japan is also looking for ways to use its coastguard to help police shipping lanes off Indonesia, where piracy and smuggling are rampant. And in December a coastguard vessel fired on what appears to have been a North Korean spy ship, which subsequently sank. America welcomed this new assertiveness, which makes neighbouring China and South Korea queasy. Most encouraging of all, Mr Koizumi has presented such sallies as being in Japan's own interests, rather than actions foisted on it by its big ally. Slightly less enthusiastically, he also backed Mr Bush's stern new line against countries, including North Korea, that are suspected of building weapons of mass destruction. He praised Mr Bush for being ""calm and cautious"", in marked contrast to the criticism the president's ""axis of evil"" remarks provoked from some allies in Europe.
 For his part, Mr Bush gave high marks to Mr Koizumi for his intention to carry through much-needed economic reforms. But results are what count. Mr Koizumi was frank in declaring that ""Japan has lost confidence in itself"". But that is no comfort to the United States. Even as Mr Bush arrived in Tokyo, Paul Wolfowitz, America's deputy defence secretary, was declaring in Washington that Japan's continued economic stagnation could eventually hurt American interests in Asia, since Japan's ""influence gradually declines and its ability to assist declines with it"" (and, he might have added, enables China to increase its influence in the region).
 One place where America needs everyone's assistance is in dealing with North Korea. Mr Bush has struck a noticeably chilly tone towards the place. ""I'm troubled by a regime that tolerates starvation,"" he said this week in South Korea. And though he repeated his offer to talk to North Korea, he also repeated that ""we must not permit the world's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world's most dangerous weapons"". At Dorasan, only 50 metres from the heavily fortified border, he called on the North to open up to contact with the South.
 Many in South Korea would agree with both sentiments. Yet street protests were a constant backdrop to his talks with South Korea's Mr Kim, who finds Mr Bush's plain words jarring. Mr Kim's ""sunshine"" policy to the North, hoping that promises of economic help will encourage it to end its hostility and isolation, is in difficulties, but any expectation that his visitor would help him revive it by softening his tone proved forlorn. In any case North Korea has so far spurned an offer of talks from both presidents.
 Could China help? Though unhappy to see a fellow communist country chastised by Mr Bush, China has no desire for another diplomatic blow- up like the one that followed North Korea's test in 1998 of a three- stage rocket over the Pacific. That event helped make the case for new missile defences in America--a development China opposes in large part because technology that could defend America or its troops in Japan from the North's rockets could defend Taiwan from China--and gave Japan and America an excuse to enhance their military co- operation.
 Ironically, as America worries that Japan's weakness enhances China's influence in Asia, China worries that militarily Japan is going from strength to strength. Yet in the wake of the September 11th attacks, China has said little in public about Japan's new military role. It has been equally reticent about America's new military foothold in Central Asia, even while it applauds the war on terrorists that have also stirred up trouble from time to time in its restive province of Xinjiang.
 On the whole, September 11th has provided China with a welcome pretext to improve relations with America. But other things have also helped. One is President Vladimir Putin's decision to ally Russia more closely with America, and not just in the fight against terrorism. China had been counting on Russia to fight Mr Bush's plans to abandon the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Instead Mr Putin has acquiesced, hoping to win deep cuts in nuclear weaponry before Mr Bush visits Russia in May.
 Another factor is President Jiang Zemin's desire for a quiet life at a time when China's Communists are preparing for a change of leadership in the autumn. Mr Jiang sets great store by being treated as an equal by America. Despite differences over Taiwan and the tensions caused last year by the collision between an American spy plane and a Chinese fighter aircraft, Mr Jiang sees Mr Bush as more likely to deliver what he promises than Mr Clinton, whose China policy was more pliant but was forever being hijacked by Congress.
 Since Mr Jiang is not without his critics at home, were China's relations with America to turn suddenly sour again, he could quickly find his hard-fought succession arrangements at home unravelling too. (Mr Bush was expecting to meet Hu Jintao, tipped to take over from Mr Jiang as party boss and president). Perhaps this also explains China's decision to tone down its invective over Taiwan. Clearly doing his part to make his China trip a success, Mr Bush had tried to please both sides by promising to ""remember our commitments to the people on Taiwan"", while also working ""with China in the great task of building a properous and stable Asia"".
 American officials no longer talk openly of China as a ""strategic competitor"", preferring to stress hopes for constructive co- operation. Yet Mr Bush was blunt in Beijing too. At a news conference he said the Chinese should be free to choose how they worship and he repeated this view in private talks with Mr Jiang. He also wants China to crack down harder on weapons proliferation. America's ambassador to China, Clark Randt, says both countries now realise this is ""more important than ever"". Earlier, he had called it ""a make or break issue"". Which will it be?
 America has long accused Chinese businesses of supplying technology and materials to a whole range of countries (not least the three in the evil axis). It continues to apply sanctions, most recently against two companies for transferring chemical- and biological-weapons technology to Iran. Just over a year ago, America thought it had achieved a breakthrough when the Chinese agreed to publish a list of dual-use missile-related technologies that would be subject to export controls. The list has yet to appear. Building a stable and prosperous Asia with China will be no easy task.","  President Bush exchanges plain words with Kim Dae Jung ( above ) and other Asian leaders 
  WITH allies like those in Asia , George Bush must have been thinking on his way to Beijing on February 21st , who needs "" strategic competitors "" ? Before arriving in China , that erstwhile competitor , for a two - day state visit , America 's president had spent the earlier part of the week trying to bolster the reforming instincts of Junichiro Koizumi's , and then braving "" frank "" discussions ( a diplomat 's word for a fallout ) with South Korea 's president , Kim Dae Jung , over how to handle North Korea . It is not that there was n't also plenty to disagree about in China , from human rights and Taiwan to missile defences and Mr Bush 's determination to prevent countries such as Iraq , Iran and North Korea from developing the technologies of mass destruction . But , like many a president before him , Mr Bush is discovering that diplomacy in Asia never quite goes smoothly . 
  The events of September 11th have cast America 's relations with each of the three countries he visited this week in a new light . In Tokyo Mr Bush called the American - Japanese security alliance the "" bedrock for peace and prosperity in the Pacific "" . Pointedly making Japan the first stop on his three - country tour ( Bill Clinton had caused unneeded offence by failing even to visit Japan when he went to China in 1998 ) , he claimed the alliance had "" never been stronger "" . In some ways that is true . Witness Japan 's decision to send support ships to the Indian Ocean , to provide logistical help for America 's campaign in Afghanistan . Some in America would have preferred Japan to send its powerful destroyers , but it marked a big shift for Japan . 
  Japan is also looking for ways to use its coastguard to help police shipping lanes off Indonesia , where piracy and smuggling are rampant . And in December a coastguard vessel fired on what appears to have been a North Korean spy ship , which subsequently sank . America welcomed this new assertiveness , which makes neighbouring China and South Korea queasy . Most encouraging of all , Junichiro Koizumi has presented such sallies as being in Japan 's own interests , rather than actions foisted on it by its big ally .

 THE latest Japanese political scandal has already cost a foreign minister her job. It has lost Junichiro Koizumi, the prime minister, precious popularity points. It even threatened to hold up the passage of Japan's Yen81 trillion ($623 billion) budget for 2002, on which politicians have pinned their hopes for an economic recovery-- though, in the end, the budget was comfortably passed by the lower house of parliament on March 6th. The scandal-ridden foreign ministry and Muneo Suzuki, a Diet member belonging to the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), are at the centre of the storm, both reeling from accusations of misconduct that may carry criminal implications.
 It all started innocuously as a dispute over who was to blame for banning two non-governmental organisations from attending an Afghan aid conference held in Tokyo in January. Makiko Tanaka, the foreign minister at the time, accused Mr Suzuki, an excitable politician from Hokkaido, a northern island, who appears to have great sway with mandarins in the foreign ministry, of blocking the aid groups (supposedly because they had criticised the government) and tampering in ministry matters. Mr Suzuki denied the claim. Ms Tanaka's deputies failed to back her up. Mr Koizumi, anxious to restore calm and get the budget passed, sacked her for her part in the dispute--along with other sins--and opined that Mr Suzuki had not exercised undue influence in the affair. Unfortunately for Mr Koizumi, evidence given to parliament from the head of the groups in question on March 4th backed Ms Tanaka's version of events and not his.
 But his role in the Afghan affair may now be the least of Mr Suzuki's problems. Fresh allegations of bid-rigging and meddling are coming thick and fast. Internal ministry documents appear to show that Mr Suzuki skewed bidding requirements for aid contracts in Kunashiri, one of four Russian-held islands claimed by Japan, to favour companies from his own constituency. There are also suspicions that Mr Suzuki may have interfered in an aid project to build a hydroelectric power station in Kenya.
 Pressure from opposition parties forced Yoriko Kawaguchi, the new foreign minister, to conduct a rushed internal investigation into some of these accusations. The findings, released on March 4th, confirmed some of the claims, but fudged more. Though Ms Kawaguchi called the relationship between Mr Suzuki and her ministry ""abnormal"", and added that it should never have been allowed, critics liken the foreign ministry's tepid investigation to ""one robber investigating another robber"". Now that Mr Suzuki's pals in his party seem to have forsaken him and given in to opposition demands, he will have to respond to the allegations against him under oath in parliament on March 11th. Depending on what he says, the prosecutor's office could move in. He may also be asked to leave the LDP, or even step down as a member of the Diet. But he may manage to hang on: Mr Suzuki is a party loyalist, with strong ties to Hiromu Nonaka, a former king-maker in the LDP.
 Whether Mr Koizumi, whose strategy so far has been to distance himself from all this, can tackle the rot will have important implications for his own future. His popularity, which has plunged since he sacked Ms Tanaka, could fall further if he fails to act. It will be a huge task. Voters want the foreign ministry, which is just as culpable as Mr Suzuki for the emerging scandals, cleaned up properly. Mr Koizumi has yet to keep his other promises of reform. He had better deliver this time.","  More trouble at the foreign ministry

 AS THIS week's continued ructions at Britain's Consignia show, post offices around the world are struggling to turn themselves into modern, well-managed, profitable companies. But of all the problems that they face, few can be as bizarre as the one with which Japan's postal agency is currently grappling: gangsters who want their mail treated with special care.
 An embarrassed postal operator has admitted that 344 post offices, including 50 in Tokyo, have for years been giving special treatment to mail sent to or from folk in Japan's powerful crime syndicates. Gangsters had been upset when envelopes turned up scuffed, dirty or late. Consequently, their mail, marked ""handle with care"" or ""violent"" (the character for ""violent"" is also the first character in the word for gangster organisation), was placed in special bags, given kid-glove treatment and, in some cases, expedited.
 The authorities are now cracking down on the practice. To help nervous postal workers say no, post-office managers will be sent on courses run by local public-safety commissions on how to resist intimidation from goons. The postal agency will also set up fresh guidelines of its own and improve contacts with the police.
 The post office, which will be turned into an ""independent"" public company next year (and might even be privatised after that if Junichiro Koizumi, the prime minister, has his way), is also Japan's biggest financial institution. It controls more than a third of the savings and life-insurance markets.

 YASUHISA SHIOZAKI starts tapping his finger on the dismal economic chart on his coffee table. ""Unless we change the decision- making process,"" he says bluntly, ""we are not going to be able to solve this kind of problem."" With the economy in such a mess, it may seem a bit of a diversion to be trying to sort out Japan's political structures as well as its economic problems. But Mr Shiozaki, a 51- year-old MP from Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), can hardly be accused of time-wasting. He has consistently prodded the government to take a firm hand to ailing banks, and has given warning against complacency after a recent rise in share prices. Far from being a distraction, his latest cause highlights how far Japan is from genuine economic reform.
 Since co-writing a report on political reform, which was released by an LDP panel last week, Mr Shiozaki has further upset the party's old guard. Its legionaries, flanked by columns of the bureaucracy, continue to hamper most attempts to overhaul the economy. Junichiro Koizumi was supposed to change all that, by going over their heads and appealing directly to the public. Yet nearly a year after becoming prime minister, Mr Koizumi has precious little to show for his efforts. His popularity is now flagging and his determination is increasingly in doubt.
 As hopes of immediate economic reform fade, optimists are focusing on another potential benefit of Mr Koizumi's tenure. They hope that his highly personalised style of leadership will pave the way for a permanent change in Japanese politics: towards more united and authoritative cabinets that are held directly accountable for their policies. As that happens, the thinking goes, real economic reforms will be able to follow.
 Unfortunately, damage-limitation in the face of scandal too often substitutes for real reform. On March 15th, Muneo Suzuki, who had come under fire after a run-in with Makiko Tanaka--a popular foreign minister who was sacked in January--was himself drummed out of the LDP. He left just ahead of Koichi Kato, a one-time hero of the reformists who had been tarnished by the practices of his chief fund- raiser. Occasionally, these purges lead to useful changes. Ms Tanaka's successor at the foreign ministry, Yoriko Kawaguchi, is pushing new measures to keep track of contacts between MPs and her bureaucrats. More often, however, the scandals serve merely as distractions. What is really needed is an overhaul of the rules themselves.
 A leading candidate for change is the 40-year-old system-- informal but religiously followed--through which the LDP machinery vets every bill before it ever gets to parliament. Most legislation starts in the LDP's party committees, which mirror the parliamentary committee structure. Proposals then go through two higher LDP bodies, which hammer out political deals to smooth their passage. Only then does the prime minister's cabinet get fully involved in approving the policy. Most issues have been decided by the LDP mandarins long before they reach this point, let alone the floor of parliament, leaving even the prime minister limited influence, and allowing precious little room for public debate and even less for accountability.
 Consider Taro Kono, a second-term MP who collided with the system two years ago. While sitting on parliament's commerce committee, he had doubts about a bill on the reprocessing of nuclear fuel. He tried to raise these at the party's private committee meeting, with little luck. Then, when the party's leaders asked whether he would raise questions in the parliamentary committee--a public forum--Mr Kono admitted that he might not be able to restrain himself. So they booted him off the committee before he could get the chance. As a result, Mr Kono's opposition to the measure, which he had tried to voice from the beginning, was registered publicly only in a statement on his website.
 To his credit, Mr Koizumi has made attempts to bypass this machinery. He began by choosing his own ministers, rather than accepting a team drawn up for him by the LDP party bosses. He has also relied heavily on a special economic advisory council, an outfit that first began meeting under his predecessor, Yoshiro Mori. These changes have made it a little easier for Mr Koizumi to formulate his own policies, independently of the party.
 So far, though, he has fully exploited these resources only once. Mr Koizumi hopes to avert a health-care financing crunch by raising the portion of medical costs paid by some patients. When the LDP demurred, Mr Koizumi threatened to break with 40 years of precedent and send the bill directly to parliament. To avoid this calamity, the LDP's secretary-general cut a deal and had the party's top policy-making body rubber-stamp it. ""I think the party blinked,"" says Mr Kono. Even though Mr Yamasaki managed to preserve the faade of party approval, Mr Koizumi still succeeded in taking a radical shortcut, skipping two tiers of LDP machinery.
 It was an important victory, for which Mr Koizumi has probably received too little credit. Yet Mr Shiozaki argues that Japan must go much further. For a start, taking on the LDP system through bluff and bravado is no substitute for clear institutional changes. Moreover, now that Mr Koizumi's popularity has plunged, he will find it harder to flout the party's rules. His proposals for tax reform, for instance, risk becoming bogged down, with his own economic council locked in dispute with both the LDP's tax committee and another committee dominated by bureaucrats.
 As a result, progress will probably remain slow. Since they know that political reform leads to economic reform, and hence poses a threat to their interests, most of the LDP will resist any real changes. But at least a handful of insiders have now bought into one of Mr Koizumi's best slogans: ""Change the LDP, change Japan"".","  Until Japan 's political system changes , attempts to tackle its economic woes will remain tied in knots

Junichiro Koizumi began by choosing Junichiro Koizumi's own ministers , rather than accepting a team drawn up for Junichiro Koizumi by the LDP party bosses . Junichiro Koizumi has also relied heavily on a special economic advisory council , an outfit that first began meeting under Junichiro Koizumi's predecessor , Yoshiro Mori . These changes have made it a little easier for Junichiro Koizumi to formulate Junichiro Koizumi's own policies , independently of the party . 
  So far , though , Junichiro Koizumi has fully exploited these resources only once . Junichiro Koizumi hopes to avert a health - care financing crunch by raising the portion of medical costs paid by some patients . When the LDP demurred , Junichiro Koizumi threatened to break with 40 years of precedent and send the bill directly to parliament . To avoid this calamity , the LDP 's secretary - general cut a deal and had the party 's top policy - making body rubber - stamp it . "" I think the party blinked , "" says Mr Kono . Even though Mr Yamasaki managed to preserve the faade of party approval , Junichiro Koizumi still succeeded in taking a radical shortcut , skipping two tiers of LDP machinery . 
  It was an important victory , for which Junichiro Koizumi has probably received too little credit . Yet Mr Shiozaki argues that Japan must go much further . For a start , taking on the LDP system through bluff and bravado is no substitute for clear institutional changes . Moreover , now that Junichiro Koizumi's popularity has plunged , Junichiro Koizumi will find it harder to flout the party 's rules . Junichiro Koizumi's proposals for tax reform , for instance , risk becoming bogged down , with Junichiro Koizumi's own economic council locked in dispute with both the LDP 's tax committee and another committee dominated by bureaucrats . 
  As a result , progress will probably remain slow . Since they know that political reform leads to economic reform , and hence poses a threat to their interests , most of the LDP will resist any real changes . But at least a handful of insiders have now bought into one of Junichiro Koizumi's best slogans : "" Change the LDP , change Japan "" .",740,Japan,A29-8209,IN TERM,True,Junichiro Koizumi,26,True

 JAPAN'S prime minister could not have picked a more propitious time to travel to South Korea. After months of high tension last year, the two countries at last seem to be rubbing along a bit better. They have little choice if they want the 2002 World Cup soccer competition, which they host together this summer, to be a success. Junichiro Koizumi's three-day visit to Korea, which started on March 21st, and his meetings with Kim Dae Jung, South Korea's president, seem intended to build on a new sense of partnership. But will the current friendliness last? There are two obstacles: Japan's continued reluctance to make full amends for its wartime atrocities, and its hawkish stance towards North Korea.
 Relations between South Korea and Japan have always been volatile. They began to improve four years ago, during Mr Kim's visit to Tokyo, when Keizo Obuchi, then Japan's prime minister, offered his ""heartfelt apology"" for Japan's colonisation of Korea, which lasted for 35 years until 1945. With improving relations came a sharp increase in tourism and trade between the two countries.
 But the upswing did not last long. Last April, a group of Japanese right-wing scholars published a history textbook which failed to mention that thousands of women from Asia, mostly from Korea, were made to work in Japanese army brothels. It also put a positive gloss on Japan's occupation. Mr Koizumi aggravated the sore with an official visit last summer to the Yasukuni shrine, where Japan's war dead, including war criminals, are venerated.
 Mr Koizumi has tried hard to patch things up since then. He made a seven-hour visit to Seoul last October to tour a prison in which many Korean resistance fighters were tortured during Japan's colonial rule. While there he again apologised for Japan's aggression. He also agreed to commission a group of Japanese scholars to co-operate with the South Koreans to pin down any distortions in Japan's history books. On top of this, Japan eased immigration rules earlier this year to allow South Korean passport holders a longer stay in Japan--up to 90 days, the same as Americans and Europeans get, rather than two weeks. But these efforts to restore relations with South Korea will go out of the window if Mr Koizumi (or a successor) pays another visit to Yasukuni.
 The other contentious issue is North Korea. Mr Koizumi seems to side with George Bush, who included North Korea as a member of the ""axis of evil"" along with Iraq and Iran. Japan wants to see a number of its citizens, abducted by North Korean agents years ago, return home and fears the North's missiles. His stance is unpopular with Mr Kim, who has pursued a ""sunshine policy"" of trying to thaw relations with the communist regime by supplying aid.

 JUST two months ago, April 1st was being billed as Japan's day of reckoning. Doomsayers predicted that, as the government partially repealed deposit insurance, to coincide with the start of a new financial year, jittery savers would panic and rickety banks would buckle. But by fiddling the rules a bit, the government helped to defuse this threat, which had anyway been overblown. So when the once-dreaded date arrived, the only economic event worth noting was the release of a prominent quarterly business survey. Its prognosis: far from sliding into crisis, the economy seems poised for a fillip.
 The companies polled in the latest Tankan survey are still suffering, of course. Among large manufacturers, pessimists outnumbered optimists by 38 percentage points in the quarter just ended (see chart). Yet for the first time since September 2000, that figure has stopped getting worse. Moreover, those companies expect their prospects to become much brighter over the next quarter, as America's improving economy bolsters exports and profits abroad. And so, as the clouds begin to lift, it looks more likely than ever that Junichiro Koizumi's government will avoid tackling the most difficult reforms.
 Although it has averted a banking crisis, the government has once again done so mainly by helping the banks avoid their problems. In late February it meddled with stockmarket rules to boost equity prices, helping to lift the value of the shares on banks' balance- sheets at the end of the financial year. And though it will unveil the results of special bank audits later this month, few onlookers expect an honest assessment of their plight.
 Instead, Mr Koizumi's economic team continues to talk up other ideas for fixing the economy. His budget for the coming fiscal year, which passed the Diet (parliament) last week, calls for a 1.7% cut in overall spending. Though budget cuts rarely help in recessions, Mr Koizumi argues that channelling money to weak companies in glutted industries has only made Japan's deflation problem worse. Having got his way on spending, the prime minister is now turning his attention towards reforming the Japanese tax system.
 Since Japan's tax code is so inefficient, Mr Koizumi could improve it in any number of ways. This week, his three-party coalition said it wants to scrap the rules that stifle demand for property. Japanese businesses, meanwhile, complain that high tax rates make it harder for them to invest and grow. Large companies polled in the Tankan survey forecast an 8.4% drop in capital spending this year. With internal profits low and bank loans shrinking inexorably, the government is keen to help them through corporate tax cuts. Lastly, besides bolstering land prices and encouraging investment, Mr Koizumi's team hopes to close some loopholes in the tax code, so that any cuts in tax rates will not increase Japan's public debt too much.
 Though much depends on the details, most of these changes seem worth making. But even if Mr Koizumi can push them past the powerful Finance Ministry, and reach agreement on a decent tax deal with his party's faction leaders, tax reform alone is not going to fix Japan's problems. Richard Jerram, chief economist at ING Barings in Tokyo, likens the current approach to ""listing all the structural reforms from A to Z, and then crossing off the ones that are impossible, until you get to tax reform"". But if the tougher reforms are impossible now, imagine what will happen if the pressure for change starts to diminish because of a mild recovery.","  The economy looks headed for yet another short - lived bounce later this year

 WHAT should opposition parties do when their ideal leader is the man they are meant to be opposing? Nearly a year after taking office, Junichiro Koizumi has fallen on hard times, with party scandals and local-election setbacks compounding his failure to implement quick reforms. Yet even as they complain about his performance, and talk of a no-confidence vote in June, Japan's opposition parties can offer no convincing alternative.
 Though Mr Koizumi campaigned on pledges to reform the Liberal Democratic Party, he has always held out the option of bolting it and forming a new coalition, drawn from ruling and opposition groups, should it frustrate his plans. The two largest opposition parties--the Democratic Party of Japan and the Liberal Party--both contain large blocks of former LDP members who back his kind of reform, and who might well go along with such a move. This threat was much more convincing, however, when Mr Koizumi commanded over 80% support. In the latest poll, his government drew half of that. These days, its chances look ever more remote.
 Even before Mr Koizumi's popularity slid, the opposition parties had resolved to start being more critical of him. The head of the Liberal Party, Ichiro Ozawa, began sidling up to the Democrats late last year, in a bid to unite the two parties against the government. Many Democrats are former members of the Social Democratic Party, which used to be the LDP's main opponent but has recently likewise fallen on hard times. This faction has grown much more critical of Mr Koizumi since September 11th, as his government has adopted a more robust defence policy. The Democrats' other main faction is closer to the LDP on security issues, and favours the sort of reforms Mr Koizumi promised. But the longer he fails to deliver, the more disgruntled this group becomes.
 Since sacking his popular foreign minister in January, Mr Koizumi's troubles have mounted. Two prominent LDP MPs have been engulfed in corruption scandals. One of them, Koichi Kato, was until recently a close ally of Mr Koizumi's.
 Poor performances in two local elections have also hurt the prime minister. On March 31st, an independent candidate defeated his coalition's man to win the mayor's race in Yokohama. And though the coalition's candidate won the Kyoto governorship on April 7th, the biggest opposition parties had also backed him in an attempt to gain local spoils. The Communist Party candidate, however, did well enough at the polls to further rattle Mr Koizumi's fans. The LDP faces a tougher test in parliamentary by-elections on April 28th, when the big opposition parties will field their own candidates.
 Against this backdrop, the opposition parties are going to press their advantage. They have agitated for hearings into the recent LDP scandals, and succeeded on April 8th in forcing Mr Kato's resignation from parliament. They have criticised the slow pace of Mr Koizumi's reforms. And this week the head of the Democrats, Yukio Hatoyama, repeated his party's desire to force Mr Koizumi to dissolve parliament and call snap elections.
 Yet the same fatal handicaps remain. If they are to pull MPs away from the LDP, or peel off one of its two coalition partners, New Komeito and the New Conservatives, the opposition parties need a more compelling leader. After Mr Ozawa's wheeling and dealing over the years, few members of other parties trust him. The two most prominent members of the Democrats, Mr Hatoyama and Naoto Kan, are uninspiring. The bottom line for the opposition is that Mr Koizumi is their best candidate.

They have criticised the slow pace of Junichiro Koizumi's reforms . And this week the head of the Democrats , Yukio Hatoyama , repeated his party 's desire to force Junichiro Koizumi to dissolve parliament and call snap elections . 
  Yet the same fatal handicaps remain . If they are to pull MPs away from the LDP , or peel off one of its two coalition partners , New Komeito and the New Conservatives , the opposition parties need a more compelling leader . After Mr Ozawa 's wheeling and dealing over the years , few members of other parties trust him . The two most prominent members of the Democrats , Mr Hatoyama and Naoto Kan , are uninspiring . The bottom line for the opposition is that Junichiro Koizumi is their best candidate .

 IMAGINE a country where the streets are clean, drugs cause few problems and muggings are almost unheard of. Imagine further that the trains run on time, most people are well dressed and many--at least to judge by the giggling girls shopping in the capital's swankiest area--are able to afford the most expensive trifles that money can buy. In such a prosperous country, life would be long, taxes modest and unemployment certainly lower than in Europe, probably even than in America. People would be polite, thrifty and unbelligerent. Rather, they would be munificent givers of foreign aid, vigorous investors abroad and profuse lenders. Such a country is Japan, and to many it might seem paradise. Yet open a newspaper and you will see that this is a country in crisis. How so?
 The newspaper headlines are likely to suggest that the problem is the banks, which are undeniably in trouble. Japan has too many of them, they are chronically weak and they are burdened by duff loans. The government admits these loans stand at Yen37 trillion, about 7% of GDP, but some say the true figure is nearer Yen70 trillion-80 trillion, and the Tokyo branch of Goldman Sachs, an investment bank, takes an even gloomier view, putting the debts of all companies either bust or potentially bust at more like Yen170 trillion (in 2000, since when conditions have grown worse). Unfortunately, these non-performing loans cannot be treated like recalcitrant creatures in a circus act; they cannot simply be written off or replaced by performing substitutes, because Japan is going through a nasty bout of both recession and deflation, whose effect on the banks is to create new bad loans out of yesterday's good ones.
 Behind the banks' troubles lie those of the companies they lend to. As a broad generalisation, it can be said that few companies outside the plain that extends from Tokyo to Osaka are internationally competitive, and some--notably in retailing and construction--are in particularly frail health. Property companies also require intensive care. Since 1991, commercial property prices have dropped by an average of 84% in Japan's six biggest cities.
 Share prices, too, have been skidding. In February, the Nikkei 225, the most commonly used share-price index, dropped below the Dow Jones Industrial for the first time since 1957, though in the 1980s it had briefly stood at 14 times the Dow. By chance, the Nikkei had been almost equal with the Dow after the second world war. Though it rallied in February and March, at its February 1st level, the Nikkei had fallen by three-quarters since its zenith in 1989.
 The bad news does not stop there. Unemployment stands at 5.3%, just below its recent post-war record of 5.6%--and the official figure, because it excludes those too discouraged to register, understates the true picture. Electronics giants such as Fujitsu, Hitachi and Toshiba have been laying off workers in droves. Supermarkets, such as the huge Mycal chain which went bust last September and even bigger Daiei which was bailed out in January, are shedding jobs all the time, as are building companies such as Aoki and Sato Kogyo, which collapsed in December and February respectively. The number of bankruptcies last year had been surpassed only once since the war, in 1984.
 With America also in recession, Japan's trade surplus has plunged too (by 40% in 2001, in dollar terms). The economy is shrinking-- the Bank of Japan forecasts a contraction of 0.9-1.2% this year-- and, though many hope that America's recovery will start to help Japan at the end of this year, few are optimistic about the future.
 The curse of price destruction
 Many companies--over 2,000 of Japan's 3,700 listed businesses-- are not investing but paying down their debts. Why, it may be asked, when interest rates are virtually zero? The answer is that they must clean up their balance-sheets, thrown into disarray by the fall in asset prices. Falling prices play merry hell with normal business practices, and prices are still decreasing in Japan--consumer prices by about 1% a year, as they have done since 1999 (or 1995, if your measure is the broad GDP deflator). For consumers, deflation is a delight: money grows more valuable as it rests in the purse or pocket-book. But that encourages consumers to save, not spend. For those who have borrowed, deflation is a nightmare: the burden of the debt becomes heavier simply with the passage of time. That helps to explain companies' desire to clean up their balance-sheets--and the awful problems of their creditors, the banks.
 Suddenly, the idyllic, safe and prosperous Japan looks rather less attractive. Can this really be the country that little more than ten years ago was set to conquer the world? It was certainly set to buy it. In the late 1980s, after all, Japan invested $650 billion abroad, nearly half of it in the United States, where such icons as Columbia studios, Pebble Beach golf course and Rockefeller Centre in New York fell into Japanese hands. Americans had already become used to the idea of ""Japan as Number One"", as the title of Ezra Vogel's best-selling book put it in 1979. By the late 1980s, with companies such as Sony, Honda, Toyota and Toshiba sweeping all before them, Japan Inc truly seemed invincible.
 That this was an illusion had become clear by the end of the decade, but what has been happening since? The short answer is that a succession of governments, led by 11 prime ministers since the start of 1989, has been trying to clear up after what turned out to have been a gigantic party in the 1980s. They have tried, or at least promised, more or less everything--stimulus after stimulus (the fiscal packages amounted to a grand total of Yen120 trillion between 1992 and 2000), constant restructuring, bail-outs and bankruptcies.
 Now the choices are limited. If the government boosts demand with yet more spending, or perhaps a tax cut, the national debt, which already stands at over 130% of GDP, will rise higher than Mount Fuji. If it bails out the banks, it will squander more money, probably to no avail: less than three years have passed since Yen7.5 trillion was thrown at 15 under-capitalised banks, yet the duff- loan problem persists. Interest rates can hardly be cut further from their current 0.001%. And, though the yen fell 13% against the dollar last year, any depreciation big enough to make a significant difference to exporters would probably infuriate Japan's trading partners and competitors, causing a huge row with America and setting off other devaluations in Asia.
 The options boil down to a much looser monetary policy, some sort of nationalisation of the banks, or crossing fingers and hoping that Japan can continue to muddle through. Any easing of monetary policy looks improbable as long as 77-year-old Masaru Hayami remains governor of the Bank of Japan. His main concern is inflation--hence his insistence that structural reform must precede any other action. Moreover, the bank did allow an increase in the monetary base last year--of 16%--without any appreciable effect on money supply. As for nationalisation, the mere talk of it puts everyone in a spin for fear of setting off a financial crisis. The collapse of a regional bank in 1997, causing depositors to lose everything, is a painful memory for politicians, as is the failure of a big broker, Yamaichi Securities, that year, and the ensuing run on an associated savings bank.
 Disaster has been predicted for Japan's banks for years, and has yet to happen. That does not mean it never will, or that it is inevitable. But there is plainly a big risk, and the consequences would be severe. Japan is the world's second-biggest economy. Its fortunes are intimately tied in not just with Asia's but with America's and the rest of the world's. Exactly how convulsive a Japanese banking crisis would be would depend on the gravity of the country's current situation, which no one is really sure about. Everyone assumes that the 30 to 50 heavily indebted big companies, mostly in property and construction, would be inevitable casualties. If Goldman Sachs is right, though, almost all industries have their share of seriously rocky companies, whose collapse would be felt much more widely, both in Japan and internationally.
 In the face of such a possible catastrophe, it might be thought that some corrective action would be taken. Junichiro Koizumi, who has been prime minister for a year, came to power promising reform. But even Mr Koizumi's greatest admirers admit the task may be too great for him.
 All this prompts some questions. First, since Japan has lurched from recession to recession--the current one is the fourth in ten years--and since the 1990s have been called ""the lost decade"" for several years now, why has concerted action not been taken before? And, second, will Mr Koizumi succeed where others have failed, or, perish the thought, is the political system that delivered Japan's economic miracle with such panache after the war now incapable of seeing the economy through to its new, mature stage? These are the questions this survey will seek to answer.","  Twelve years in the economic doldrums : what does that say about the political system ?

 IF JAPANESE politicians have shied away from trying to sort out the country's problems, that may be partly because it is so difficult to identify where one problem ends and the next begins. Anyone looking for neat separations in Japan will search in vain. Instead, academics usually refer to an ""iron triangle"" comprising big business, the long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the bureaucracy, whose interlocking relations form a nexus of power. And as with the power-wielders, so with the activities they control: none can be said to be discretely economic, or political, or bureaucratic; they are usually all three. So if you wonder how Japan got into its current mess, it is hard to know where to begin. But a start can be made by looking at industry, business and the banks.
 Japan's banks are not notably inefficient by international standards, but they have plainly engaged in some foolish lending. Why? One reason is that, after the Plaza currency accord in 1985 led to an appreciation of the yen, the Ministry of Finance opened the monetary throttle and lowered interest rates. That set off a borrowing binge, with much of the money flowing into property. Before long, prices--which were set not by the market but by indexes drawn up by bureaucrats to suit their own purposes--went crazy. The gardens of the Imperial Palace in central Tokyo were said to be theoretically worth as much as the entire state of California, or all of Canada. Borrowing became easy, since land was used as collateral for almost all bank loans. Share prices shot up; the Nikkei doubled between 1987 and 1989. And because Japanese banks and businesses have long had huge holdings in each other, the popping of the speculative bubble brought both of them crashing down together.
 The banks had also been lending at the behest of bureaucrats-- few of whom are trained economists--to companies they happened to like. This followed a ""long-standing social practice"", as Noriko Hama, of Mitsubishi Research Institute puts it, whereby the banks were treated as quasi-public-sector organisations to be used to get Japan's post-war business back on its feet. Next came the country's spectacular macroeconomic growth, fostered to some degree by the system of cross-shareholdings. But as the economy grew more complex, the collaborative relations between banks and businesses turned in the early 1980s to collusion and even conspiracy. As interest rates fell, the banks began to lend to poorly managed land developers and even gangsters. Then it all went wrong.
 The politicians were hardly blameless in all this. They pumped money--taxpayers' money--into companies that were so inefficient that they should have been allowed to go bust. Their motives were not all bad. In a society where work is all, especially for men, and welfare benefits limited, the politicians were desperate to avoid unemployment. They therefore used some industries, notably construction, to soak up labour laid off by other industries. Construction was also used as an instrument of regional aid. By building roads, bridges, airports, tunnels, no matter how unnecessary, they could direct money and jobs to the many parts of the country with no efficient companies.
 The construction companies showed their appreciation by giving generously to their local member of the Diet (parliament) and to the ""road tribe"" who sat on the LDP's policymaking committees in Tokyo. Some of the money was given openly, much more probably rubbed off through rigged contracts. In any event, even today the building budget is gigantic: construction-related spending has comfortably exceeded the budget of the American Defence Department in recent years, and about 10% of Japan's workforce, some 6m people, still derive their jobs from it, far more than in other rich countries. Unsupported, about half the industry might collapse, throwing millions out of work.
 Not all of Japan's industry is inefficient, though. The parts that have been exposed to foreign competition, which drove the country's post-war GNPism, are proven world-beaters. But practically all of industry has, by tradition, been to some degree influenced or controlled by non-commercial actors--if not politicians, then bureaucrats. This ""administrative guidance"" was given partly informally, partly through bureaucratic control of the access to capital, partly through regulation. In a heavily regulated state, the bureaucrats could and did allow the keiretsu--the bank-centred conglomerates that dominate the economy--to make arrangements to their own advantage. The bureaucrats' main concern was to ensure a satisfactory flow of corporation tax, and during the good years it was not difficult for them to do this by fixing the pre-tax profits of the banks.
 The perfect arrangement
 For years it all worked well. With their flows of capital assured, Japanese companies were able to take the long view. With the help of lifetime employment, pliant enterprise unions and a seniority system whereby labour came cheap at the outset in return for guaranteed rewards at the end, companies could invest in research and development. Productivity and profits soared, and everyone grew rich.
 But the bureaucrats guiding this venture were not infallible. In particular, they chose to operate the financial and banking system as though Japan were an economy short of savings, when in reality centuries of uncertainty about the future--always likely to be punctuated by earthquakes, typhoons, tsunami and volcanic eruptions- -have made the Japanese among the most thrifty of peoples. Unfortunately, their thrift now contributes to the lack of demand, which keeps the economy mired in recession. Unfortunately, too, though they are the biggest exporters of capital in the world, their savings swell the coffers of the banks, not to mention some other formidable institutions at home, thus complicating the bad-debt problem.
 At least until next March, the bulk of these savings are guaranteed by the government. That is one reason why those in authority have no wish to see too much carnage among the banks. Yet they also know that any bail-out of the banks will be intensely unpopular with the voters. Unless their own money is at risk, those voters will surely see any rescue as a lifeline for the incompetent friends of collusive politicians and bureaucrats.
 But not all savings in Japan go into the banks. The most trusted institution, and certainly the largest, is the post office, whose assets stand at Yen250 trillion, excluding the postal life insurance system's Yen123 trillion. These two sources of funds, plus the social-security contributions gathered through payroll taxes, feed the Fiscal Investment and Loan Programme, the FILP. Through this programme, the Ministry of Finance lends money at subsidised rates to a variety of institutions and projects. In other words, money is distributed according to a grand plan worked out in the ministries and financed by the banks and the postal system: no wonder aspects of Japan are so often likened to the Soviet Union.
 Since the bureaucrats have always lent on the basis of equality of access to cheap funds, the successful have not been rewarded and the unsuccessful punished, as economic logic would demand. In the days of high growth, that did not matter. The lending then was mostly to industrial borrowers and the system seemed to work all right, or at least its shortcomings could be hidden. Nowadays, though, the biggest borrower is the Housing Loan Corporation, which provides low-cost mortgages--undercutting private-sector competitors (just as the postal life-insurance system undercuts its private competitors) and thus contributing to the country's current economic mess. All told, the government has been providing over Yen5 trillion a year to keep the Housing Loan Corporation and other ""special corporations"" afloat.
 Mr Koizumi wants to change all this. But why did no one try in the 1990s? The answer lies in the mysterious world encompassed by Nagatacho, Kasumigaseki and Toranomon, the homes of, respectively, the Diet, the main ministries and the special corporations.

Nowadays, though, the biggest borrower is the Housing Loan Corporation, which provides low-cost mortgages--undercutting private-sector competitors (just as the postal life-insurance system undercuts its private competitors) and thus contributing to the country's current economic mess. All told, the government has been providing over Yen5 trillion a year to keep the Housing Loan Corporation and other ""special corporations"" afloat.
 Mr Koizumi wants to change all this. But why did no one try in the 1990s? The answer lies in the mysterious world encompassed by Nagatacho, Kasumigaseki and Toranomon, the homes of, respectively, the Diet, the main ministries and the special corporations.

 THE bizarre FILP system did not in fact get through the 1990s wholly free from assault. Ryutaro Hashimoto, prime minister from 1996 to 1998, made a start on tackling it when he was in reform- minded mood. But look at what he was up against.
 First, the bureaucrats. The people who administer the system, the heirs of those who devised it, stand to gain enormously from its perpetuation. One way they do so is through amakudari (descent from heaven), the practice whereby top bureaucrats on retirement land in comfortable sinecures in the industries they used to be responsible for. That is bad enough: it leads to an utterly improper relationship between the civil servants and the very people who, in a system less collusive and secretive than Japan's, they would be monitoring. But the sinecures they fill on retirement are not only in private industry, they are also in the special corporations such as the one for housing (subsidy in 2000 Yen443 billion) and the one for highways (Yen306 billion).
 When they come down from heaven, these bureaucrats land on their feet. Retiring in their 50s, they can hope to spend up to 30 years doing the rounds among the special corporations, and over ten years the senior ones may earn $1m or so in lump-sum fees alone, half of it tax-free. They can hardly be expected to welcome an end to such post-celestial rewards.
 And bureaucrats are creatures of extraordinary power in Japan. Todays' elite are the functional descendants of the samurai, the warrior class that provided the administration in feudal Japan. After the Meiji restoration in 1868, these bureaucrats became the servants of the emperor, whose lineage supposedly came from the deities. To the prestige this gave them, the necessities of the second world war added power, notably through ""the 1940 system"" which put them in charge of the entire industrial economy. After the war that power grew, largely thanks to the desire of the victorious Americans to rule indirectly through the bureaucracy rather than through a political elite. Soon the latter-day samurai were involved in every aspect of control, from micromanagement of the economy to writing the laws of the land. To this day, says Stephen Church of Analytica Japan, a consultancy, ""It is widely...believed to be true that the civil-servant vice-ministers meet on Mondays and Thursdays to decide the agenda to be rubber-stamped by the cabinet on Tuesdays and Fridays.""
 Mr Church sees three main influences on the Japanese bureaucracy: Yamato (the state that started to emerge about 1,700 years ago, introducing a tradition of obfuscation of responsibility), China (where flourished a mandarinate of superior persons) and Prussia (with its rule-bound civil service). Masao Miyamoto, a psychiatrist and former bureaucrat himself, saw in the modern bureaucracy a microcosm of Japanese society. In ""The Straitjacket Society"" (1994), he enumerated its main characteristics, including control of the market through permits and regulations (hence hostility to deregulation and opening up); giving priority to producers over consumers (to promote Japan Inc); the philosophy of messhi hoko, self-sacrifice for the sake of the group (ie, Japan Inc, once again); and the promotion of conformity, especially through the education system (to reduce dissent). ""What distinguishes Japan's 'totalitarianism',"" he wrote, ""is that there is no observable Big Brother figure. It is the structure itself that functions as Big brother, [which] makes it almost impossible to change the system.""
 Serving the people
 With a caste of people exercising such enormous and deep-rooted power, Japan might be considered an oligarchy or an autocracy. It is of course a democracy, and not just in form. Indeed, in at least one respect, it is highly democratic: that is, that elected politicians dutifully serve the people, or, to be more exact, their constituents (and, no doubt, themselves). By tradition at least, they do not engage in forming policy, nor do they really have any sense of the common good. In the Japanese system, politicians chiefly act as mediators between the bureaucrats and the voters, a role they perform mainly by delivering goodies back to their districts.
 The main vehicle for doing this is the LDP, which has ruled, for all but a few months in 1993-94, since 1955. This makes Japan a one- party state in many respects, with some similarities to the Soviet Union (central planning, enforced conformity), more to pre-2000 Mexico (reformers and ""dinosaurs"" within the ruling party) and even more to pre-1990s Italy (constant changes of prime minister without any change of party control, manipulation of power from behind the scenes, an opaque faction system within the ruling party). To these characteristics could be added two more that are common to all one- party states: corruption and conservatism.
 In such a system, huge quantities of money flow between government and voters. Japanese politicians are expected, for instance, to be lavish givers to their constituents when they marry, but largesse distributed by public works through politicians' koenkai, their personal support organisations, plays an even bigger part. This is where the construction industry comes in again. The country is littered with airports that no one uses, bridges that carry no traffic and roads that go nowhere. To give just one example, the Seto inland sea is already served by three bridges connecting the islands of Shikoku and Honshu, yet vested interests have been agitating for two more. Not for nothing is Japan known as the construction state.
 Benefiting from all this are politicians not just in Tokyo but in local governments too, as well as the building companies and, through them, at least some ordinary people. The cost is vast. Much of the money goes on projects that serve no useful purpose. Much rubs off corruptly (and brazenly: one boondoggle involving a bridge across Tokyo Bay was so huge that the politician behind it openly said he would be content with 2% rather than the usual 3%). And meanwhile the government's debt heads ever higher.
 It is not hard to see why the LDP is so resistant to change. Its two main purposes--rent-seeking and self-perpetuation through electoral success--have both flourished under the status quo. Almost every interest-group imaginable is represented within its ranks, and it takes care to look after them. Farmers are treated especially well, mainly through protection of their markets. And, thanks to a gerrymandered electoral system, their votes count disproportionately in the Diet.
 How does the LDP get away with it? Partly at least thanks to a supine judiciary, which is always loth to defy parliament-- accepting in one instance an electoral arrangement whereby five urban votes were considered equal to a single rural one. The law, it should be noted, does not count for much in Japan. Although, or perhaps because, the country's top bureaucrats have typically graduated from Tokyo University's law department, the number of lawyers is controlled by the government. At present it stands at just over 18,000. The United States, with a population a little over double Japan's, has 891,000.
 A system in which power lies in an amorphous swamp of bureaucracy and ruling party, each plumbed into the private sector, is unlikely to welcome scrutiny, and indeed secrecy is one of its notable features. Even more serious perhaps is the general lack of any sense of responsibility or accountability. Who, for instance, might take the blame for the problems of the banks, or the money squandered by the special corporations? People sometimes bow out--literally--when caught in some egregious malpractice; they may even commit suicide, if honour is considered at stake. But among bureaucrats at least, honour never seems to be at stake where the victims are mere taxpayers.
 Never rock the boat
 Complaisant attitudes are fortified by compliant institutions. To some extent this is a consequence of the post-war constitution, which was partly written by the Americans to ensure that Japan stayed politically and militarily weak. It has never been amended. In any event, most ministries are adept at serving their clients, and not much else. Some, it is true, have done much better than that: during its heyday, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry was a master of picking and backing winners. But that was when things were going well. When things go badly, the ministries neither propel forward any individual to take charge nor do they provide the institutional impetus needed for corrective action. Japan has no equivalent to the British Treasury's public-spending review, for instance, nor does it have any institution like America's Congressional Budget Office or its General Accounting Office. Diet members, each with only three staffers paid for by the government, are particularly poorly served. They huddle in tiny offices, looking after constituents and interest-groups and deferring to more senior figures on weightier matters.
 At the apex is the prime minister. In the past ten years prime ministers have come and gone every year or so, grey old men, most of them, frequently controlled by faction leaders behind the scenes and unable anyway to do much before some scandal or failure unseated them. The factions they serve may have some modest ideological flavour, but most are vehicles for distributing party and ministerial posts; they seldom promote reform. Mr Koizumi's predecessor, Yoshiro Mori, hardly promoted anything. On some issues, the dominant Hashimoto faction--named after Ryutaro Hashimoto, but in fact the faction of Kakuei Tanaka, who came to power in 1972-- simply failed to consult him at all.
 The civil servants, however clever, are neither trained nor disposed to provide the prime minister with a skilful diagnosis when things go awry. They can and do offer proposals to be endorsed with little change by the LDP's policy committees, but conservatism, self- interest and the lack of accountability usually ensure that these fall far short of what is needed. In short, the status quo is a recipe for failure.

 TO SORT out the mess, enter, last April 26th, one Junichiro Koizumi. To some, Mr Koizumi may seem an improbable new broom. His family has been part of the system since before the war, his grandfather having served 35 years in the lower house of the Diet (some as a cabinet minister), his father having served 25 (ditto) and he himself having already clocked up 28 (and yes, he too has been a minister before).
 Despite his conventional background, he is nonetheless an unusual figure in Japanese politics. A long-standing admirer of Takeo Fukuda, a prime minister (1976-78) with a reputation for reform, he is nowadays a member of no faction, and indeed has long criticised the faction system and the cosy relations among politicians and business on which it thrives. He is relatively young by the standards of Japanese politicians (60), divorced, speaks a bit of English (attended the London School of Economics for a while) and, more important, addresses his countrymen in language they can understand. Indeed, he is a master of television, the popular press (particularly sports papers) and modern media in general; his e- mail magazine Lionheart goes out to over 2m subscribers each week. With flamboyant wavy hair, a weakness for both opera and heavy metal, and all the appearance of a human being rather than a waxwork gerontocrat, he proved last year to be wildly popular with the Japanese voters.
 The ecstatic enthusiasm he aroused swept him first to the leadership of the LDP, thus to the prime ministership, and then to triumph at the head of his party in the election for the upper house in July. Since his campaign had been based partly on criticism of that party and partly on the need for painful reform, all this seemed rather extraordinary. The party elders, who had accepted his rise to the LDP leadership only because they shared the universal view that the alternative was certain defeat, could not quite bring themselves to welcome his victory. But the LDP had had its best result since 1992.
 Mr Koizumi soon showed that he had been sincere in promising change. Though the Hashimoto faction remained much the largest in the Diet, he gave it only two cabinet positions, down from five in the outgoing government of Mr Mori: merit, not faction, was what Mr Koizumi sought. He broke with tradition, too, by bringing in outsiders, giving three portfolios to non-politicians from the private sector. Bolder still, he handed five of his 17 cabinet jobs to women, one of whom, Makiko Tanaka, was almost as popular as he was, and for much the same reasons: she was seen as a straight- speaking, heterodox reformer determined to do battle with the system, even though she was the daughter of perhaps the most corrupt and manipulative of modern Japan's prime ministers.
 The new-broom effect
 Mr Koizumi then lost no time in announcing an ambitious programme of reform. In his inaugural address last May, he was promising ""structural reform without sanctuary""--meaning no quarter would be given to sacred cows. The next month he was unveiling programmes to transform government through privatisation and regulatory reform, to bring in a new tax system, to tackle the banks' bad debts, to liberate local governments and to control the budget deficit by issuing no more than Yen30 trillion of new bonds. In August, the cabinet adopted a budget that cut public-works spending by 10%. And in September he declared war on the special corporations.
 It was all great stuff, and the pundits loved it. So did the public: Mr Koizumi's popularity ratings soared. But critics pointed out that most of what he promised to do concerned the public sector. This was certainly ripe for reform, but the action plan left the immediate problem of the banks virtually untouched. And there were, inevitably, doubts about whether Mr Koizumi, however good his intentions, would be able to achieve his ends.
 As an old hand, Mr Koizumi knows the LDP well. Within the party he has had two allies, Taku Yamasaki and Koichi Kato, whose surnames' initials, along with Mr Koizumi's, form the letters YKK, by which the trio are known. The new leader made Mr Yamasaki secretary-general of the party, where he remains influential. But Mr Kato (a former secretary-general) resigned from the Diet this month amid allegations that he had misappropriated political donations; he had already been weakened by a bungled attempt to become prime minister 18 months ago.
 Mr Koizumi has brought in several outsiders to offer advice: a historian, Naoki Inose, now helps him prepare the special corporations for slaughter, for instance, and an economist, Haruo Shimada, offers ideas for microeconomic reform. He also leans heavily on his chief cabinet secretary, Yasuo Fukuda, the son of his prime-ministerial mentor. But the two on whom he relies most are Heizo Takenaka, the minister for economic and fiscal policy, and Nobuteru Ishihara, the minister for administrative and regulatory reform, both considered highly capable. In so far as politicians run things in Japan, these two, and Mr Koizumi himself, are the ones who count. All three, incidentally, are graduates of Keio University, which sets them at odds with the top bureaucrats, most of whom are Tokyo University men.
 What of the policymaking institutions? Mr Koizumi's aim is to remove policymaking from the clutches of the LDP tribesmen and the bureaucrats. The idea is that he and his associates should make their proposals, have them endorsed by the cabinet and, when appropriate, by the new (albeit pre-Koizumi) Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy, thus bypassing the party's Policy Research Council and the vested interests in the ministries. It is a nice idea and to some extent it works. But in some areas it does not: Japan's foreign aid, for example, is still largely dictated by interest-groups (ie, the construction lobby), and the party's tax committee remains powerful.
 The clean sweep that didn't happen
 In truth, the LDP's dinosaurs will not go quietly. Plenty remain in positions of influence: the deputy chairman of the Policy Research Council's subcommittee on highways is none other than Hiromu Nonaka, the power behind Mr Mori's do-nothing administration. In January, 13 highway projects that had been killed a month earlier were resurrected by the road tribe. In February, Mr Koizumi's health reforms were under threat.
 This does not mean that Mr Koizumi has had no successes. Some consider it a triumph that he should even be proposing the abolition of such outfits as the highway-construction corporation, or the ending of the system of hypothecated taxes that helps to sustain their spending habits. But Mr Koizumi has made some mistakes: he caused a needless fuss last August by insisting on visiting the Yasukuni shrine, where Japan's war dead--and some war criminals-- are commemorated. He was then somewhat sidetracked from domestic matters by Japan's response to September 11th. And all the while he has shown himself unwilling to take controversial action to deal with the banks' bad loans.
 Doubts about the strength of his commitment to reform were reinforced in January when he proudly took the credit for the Yen420 billion bank bail-out that saved the Daiei retail chain from going under. A month earlier he had seemed to welcome the collapse of the Aoki building company, saying it was ""a sign that structural reforms were making smooth progress."" Of course, Mr Koizumi knew that Japan's retail industry was overcrowded and inefficient, but Daiei was a bigger company, with 50,000 employees. Next the government was intervening to help Snow Brand, a food business that had admitted to repackaging beef to enable it to receive special government subsidies. Courage seemed to be failing the Lionheart.
 That was soon to be confirmed in many people's minds. On January 29th, driven to distraction by her persistent feuding, he sacked Ms Tanaka, his turbulent foreign minister. Her squabbles with her staff had often seemed pointless and petty, and she had achieved virtually nothing on the diplomatic front, but the public had liked the way she tried to defy the bureaucrats, who had now won a decisive victory over her. Mr Koizumi's popularity rating--from which he derives virtually all his strength--dropped from nearly 80% to 56%. Worse, as time went by, it was revealed that one of those with whom she had been feuding, an LDP politician of the old school called Muneo Suzuki, had been intricately and quite improperly involved in Foreign Ministry business. Accused of bid-rigging and other malpractices, Mr Suzuki was obliged to resign from the party, amid cries that Mr Koizumi had taken the side of a dinosaur of the worst kind against the virtuous Ms Tanaka. The scandal knocked another 12 points off Mr Koizumi's popularity rating, leaving his popular base as uncertain as his reformist credentials.

Junichiro Koizumi made Mr Yamasaki secretary - general of the party , where he remains influential . But Mr Kato ( a former secretary - general ) resigned from the Diet this month amid allegations that he had misappropriated political donations ; he had already been weakened by a bungled attempt to become prime minister 18 months ago . 
  Junichiro Koizumi has brought in several outsiders to offer advice : a historian , Naoki Inose , now helps Junichiro Koizumi prepare the special corporations for slaughter , for instance , and an economist , Haruo Shimada , offers ideas for microeconomic reform . Junichiro Koizumi also leans heavily on Junichiro Koizumi's chief cabinet secretary , Yasuo Fukuda , the son of Junichiro Koizumi's prime - ministerial mentor . But the two on whom Junichiro Koizumi relies most are Heizo Takenaka , the minister for economic and fiscal policy , and Nobuteru Ishihara , the minister for administrative and regulatory reform , both considered highly capable . In so far as politicians run things in Japan , these two , and Junichiro Koizumi , are the ones who count . All three , incidentally , are graduates of Keio University , which sets them at odds with the top bureaucrats , most of whom are Tokyo University men . 
  What of the policymaking institutions ? Junichiro Koizumi's aim is to remove policymaking from the clutches of the LDP tribesmen and the bureaucrats . The idea is that Junichiro Koizumi and Junichiro Koizumi's associates should make their proposals , have them endorsed by the cabinet and , when appropriate , by the new ( albeit pre - Junichiro Koizumi ) Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy , thus bypassing the party 's Policy Research Council and the vested interests in the ministries . It is a nice idea and to some extent it works . But in some areas it does not : Japan 's foreign aid , for example , is still largely dictated by interest - groups ( ie , the construction lobby ) , and the party 's tax committee remains powerful . 
  The clean sweep that did n't happen 
  In truth , the LDP 's dinosaurs will not go quietly . Plenty remain in positions of influence : the deputy chairman of the Policy Research Council 's subcommittee on highways is none other than Hiromu Nonaka , the power behind Mr Mori 's do - nothing administration . In January , 13 highway projects that had been killed a month earlier were resurrected by the road tribe . In February , Junichiro Koizumi's health reforms were under threat . 
  This does not mean that Junichiro Koizumi has had no successes . Some consider it a triumph that Junichiro Koizumi should even be proposing the abolition of such outfits as the highway - construction corporation , or the ending of the system of hypothecated taxes that helps to sustain their spending habits . But Junichiro Koizumi has made some mistakes : Junichiro Koizumi caused a needless fuss last August by insisting on visiting the Yasukuni shrine , where Japan 's war dead -- and some war criminals-- are commemorated . Junichiro Koizumi was then somewhat sidetracked from domestic matters by Japan 's response to September 11th . And all the while Junichiro Koizumi has shown Junichiro Koizumi unwilling to take controversial action to deal with the banks ' bad loans . 
  Doubts about the strength of Junichiro Koizumi's commitment to reform were reinforced in January when Junichiro Koizumi proudly took the credit for the Yen420 billion bank bail - out that saved the Daiei retail chain from going under . A month earlier Junichiro Koizumi had seemed to welcome the collapse of the Aoki building company , saying it was "" a sign that structural reforms were making smooth progress . "" Of course , Junichiro Koizumi knew that Japan 's retail industry was overcrowded and inefficient , but Daiei was a bigger company , with 50,000 employees . Next the government was intervening to help Snow Brand , a food business that had admitted to repackaging beef to enable it to receive special government subsidies . Courage seemed to be failing the Lionheart . 
  That was soon to be confirmed in many people 's minds . On January 29th , driven to distraction by her persistent feuding , Junichiro Koizumi sacked Ms Tanaka , Junichiro Koizumi's turbulent foreign minister . Her squabbles with her staff had often seemed pointless and petty , and she had achieved virtually nothing on the diplomatic front , but the public had liked the way she tried to defy the bureaucrats , who had now won a decisive victory over her . Junichiro Koizumi's popularity rating -- from which Junichiro Koizumi derives virtually all Junichiro Koizumi's strength -- dropped from nearly 80 % to 56 % . Worse , as time went by , it was revealed that one of those with whom she had been feuding , an LDP politician of the old school called Muneo Suzuki , had been intricately and quite improperly involved in Foreign Ministry business . Accused of bid - rigging and other malpractices , Mr Suzuki was obliged to resign from the party , amid cries that Junichiro Koizumi had taken the side of a dinosaur of the worst kind against the virtuous Ms Tanaka . The scandal knocked another 12 points off Junichiro Koizumi's popularity rating , leaving Junichiro Koizumi's popular base as uncertain as Junichiro Koizumi's reformist credentials .

 A FEW years ago, a visitor to Japan who asked for suggestions for places to visit outside the capital could be told, ""Don't bother. Everyone you need to see can be found within a mile or so of the Palace Hotel."" No longer. It would be wrong to say that power has overnight been devolved to the regions, but some of the things that are happening outside Tokyo may herald bigger changes than can be delivered by any single reformer, even a lion-hearted prime minister.
 Here is a tiny example: in January, Maihara, a town of 12,700 people in Shiga prefecture, held the first election in the country in which permanent foreign residents were allowed to vote. Bigger changes are happening elsewhere. In Mie prefecture, a dispute about whether to build a nuclear power plant had been running for 37 years before a new governor, Masayasu Kitagawa, broke with all tradition in 2000 by simply deciding against it. In a country that depends on nuclear power for 35% of its electricity, the consequences were felt much farther afield.
 Mr Kitagawa is one of a new breed of governors--independent of party, independent of ties to business and, at least in his case, independent even of ties to ties: in a bid to save money on electricity, Mie's officials do not have to wear suits or ties to work in the summer so that the air-conditioning need not be turned on until the temperature reaches 28 degrees C (82 degrees F). The annual saving is Yen500,000.
 Mr Kitagawa has cut about 800 budget items out of the 3,300 he inherited when he took office in 1995, but his real claim to be a reformer rests not on saving money but on his belief that the voters come first. ""You must start from the demand side,"" he says, ""not the supply side,"" before launching an attack on the bureaucracy, the LDP, Tokyo University, centralisation, environmental ruin and the rest.
 The beauty of grass roots
 The people of Mie love it. So, apparently, do the people of Akita, Chiba, Nagano, Tochigi, Tottori and Tokyo itself, in all of which places new-breed governors have been installed. In Akita, a rural prefecture in northern Honshu, the LDP candidate was trounced a year ago by the incumbent governor, Sukeshiro Terata, who ran unattached to any party. A month earlier in Chiba, which abuts Tokyo, a 68-year-old woman, Akiko Domoto, smote both the LDP and the Democratic and Communist Parties. Miss Domoto, a former television reporter, carried the day despite having business, the trade unions and the parties all ranged against her. She started her campaign with a group of only 60 supporters.
 Yasuo Tanaka, the governor of Nagano prefecture since 2000, is a playboy novelist who shows his commitment to open government by sitting behind glass walls. The new governor of Tochigi prefecture, Akio Fukuda, defeated a former bureaucrat who was supported by all the main parties. In Tottori, Yoshihiro Katayama has amazed everybody by opening the prefecture's books to one and all.
 Some of the new breed may yet disappoint; indeed Mr Tanaka, in his tight leather suits, is already the butt of criticism. Much the most controversial, though, is the governor of Tokyo, Shintaro Ishihara. He has a new contempt for the establishment and a populist nose to go with it: when he learnt that many banks were paying no corporate taxes, he slapped a 3% tax (since ruled illegal) on the gross operating revenues of all banks headquartered in Tokyo. But his notoriety derives mainly from his nationalism. An early admirer of Yukio Mishima, an accomplished author who committed ritual suicide in 1970, calling for a revival of militarism, Mr Ishihara is also a successful novelist, though he is better known for his non- fiction book, ""The Japan That Can Say No"", an anti-American diatribe.
 Whether he is dangerous or merely sinister is a matter for conjecture. He is capable of xenophobia, calling on the armed forces to be vigilant about foreigners in the event of an earthquake, and writing utter nonsense about Japan ""liberating"" Asia in the war. He has a gift for catching the public mood, first with his novels, especially ""Season of the Sun"". He also raises questions about Japan's place in the world that need to be discussed, and often are not.
 Many of these governors are vigorous champions of the environment. Mr Kitagawa in Mie is a fanatical recycler. Miss Domoto wants to kill a land-reclamation project that the bureaucrats in Tokyo have been promoting for nearly 30 years. Mr Tanaka has put a stop to dam-building in Nagano, and Mr Fukuda also opposes dams in Tochigi. But the main thing these rather different governors have in common is their heterodox, confrontational style. This they share, of course, with Mr Koizumi. But he lacks one thing they have: the direct support of the voters. It is this that gives the governors much of their power.
 That power is still largely latent. After all, over half the governors of Japan's 47 prefectures are still ex-bureaucrats. But the trend is clear. The regions, even some rural ones like Akita, are following the example of many towns and cities in electing outsiders--Communists, novelists, comedians, actors--in rejection of the old way of doing things. At the same time, at least until the upper-house election last July, when the Koizumi effect came into play, the LDP has been losing it appeal. The story from the provinces may not have the party's elders quaking in their boots quite yet. But they would be unwise to ignore it. The story of modern Japan begins, after all, with samurai from two southern provinces seizing the imperial palace in Kyoto and declaring the restoration of the Meiji emperor. Perhaps it could happen again.

 IN TRUTH, the Meiji restoration that marked the end of the Tokugawa shoganate and the beginning of modern Japan came about also as result of a different event: the arrival in Japanese waters in 1853 of Commodore Matthew Perry and his four menacing black warships, which led eight months later to a treaty with the United States and thus to the opening up of a country that had been largely closed to the world for centuries. If this was the first great transformation of modern Japan, and the second world war was the second, could the third also be promoted by some foreign agent?
 Two candidates present themselves. The first is the familiar one, the United States, occupier, progenitor of Japan's constitution, friend and defender, chivvier and competitor. In their ambiguous relationship, America has used Japan politically as a showcase for capitalism during the cold war, economically as the financier of its budget deficits and militarily as an unsinkable aircraft carrier in Asia. Japan has used America as a purchaser of its goods and the provider of its defence. On occasion, the link between the two countries has been called ""the most important bilateral relationship in the world, bar none."" Yet its history during recent decades has been one of constant friction--usually over trade, often over America's 38,000 troops in Japan and, especially during the 1990-91 Gulf war, over Japan's failure to send its armed forces abroad.
 We'd love to help, but...
 Few episodes have been as vexing as the Gulf war, and few have resulted in as much change as a result. The Americans, always conscious of their treaty obligation to defend Japan, whereas Japan has had no such duty to defend the United States, were outraged that a country that was totally dependent on imports for its oil should risk not a single soul in the war to get Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait. Japan, moreover, spent more on defence than any country except Russia and America itself. After much temporising, Japan in the end picked up a bill for Yen1.5 trillion and, four months after the war had ended, sent six minesweepers to the Gulf. Uniquely among the coalition's members, its contribution to the war effort--a sixth of the $60 billion total--necessitated a tax rise.
 For this Japan got no thanks, but that was not its only complaint. If it could not send its ""self-defence"" forces abroad, that was because Article 9 of its constitution forbade it. And who had written Article 9? None other than General Douglas MacArthur, the American in charge of the post-war occupation, who had wanted to ensure that Japan would never again be able to intimidate another country.
 The entire episode left a nasty taste in the mouth, especially in that of a Foreign Ministry official, Yukio Okamoto, who resigned before it was over, vowing that nothing like it should happen again. Today he is an independent consultant and a special adviser to Mr Koizumi. His influence can, perhaps, be detected in the legislation that the Diet passed, with unusual dispatch, in the weeks after September 11th. By the end of October an anti-terrorism bill had become law, for the first time allowing Japanese forces to be sent to a theatre of operations for some reason other than ""survey or research"". True, it confined Japan's armed forces to ""rear-echelon"" activity (nothing violent) in non-combat areas. True, the bill was to expire after two years. Even so, by November five Japanese naval vessels had set sail for the Indian Ocean in the navy's first wartime venture abroad since 1945. By January they were refuelling British warships.
 The importance of all this is not the help that Japan can bring to the fight against al-Qaeda. It is that the great taboo embodied in Article 9 is now broached; a step has been taken towards unravelling the paradox that Japan, like other countries, holds the right to collective self-defence under international law but cannot exercise it without violating its constitution. With 600 Japanese troops taking part in the UN's peacekeeping operation in East Timor, and polls suggesting that a clear majority now favour a bigger peacekeeping role for Japan, it seems that the Japanese are becoming less timid about the use of force. Yet they will need to shift a lot more if they are ever to shed their role as chequebook diplomats and instead take up a seat as a veto-wielding member of the UN Security Council, as they have long wished. Such an ambition cannot realistically, in the current state of the world, be satisfied without the repeal of Article 9, and that still seems unthinkable.
 Japan will play a part on the world stage. It will hold environmental gatherings and conferences about Afghanistan, as it did in January. It will give aid generously, albeit 10% less generously this year than last. It will fret about North Korea's ability to send missiles over its territory, as it did in 1998. And it will co-operate with America on research into missile defences. But will it ever deploy them itself, and if so, would it ever fire an anti-missile missile if it saw a rocket whizzing past? That rocket might after all be heading not for Japan (in which case self- defence would allow it to fire) but for somewhere else (in which case Article 9 would forbid it). Pondering this for a few minutes would render the question academic, since the missile would be past interception.
 Such issues are discussed by defence pundits in Japan, but by few others. Mr Okamoto, admittedly two months before September 11th, wrote that ""there is no consensus among the Japanese about exposing their country or any of their citizens to any degree of risk."" Rather, he saw ""an obsessive concern to be on the safe side"". In other words, Japan is not going to change dramatically as a result of pressure from the United States. Such arm-twisting has been tried often enough in the past, especially over trade, but it has seldom had much effect. The Japanese simply do not care all that much about the outside world. They have a long history of isolation, they are deeply suspicious of foreigners (Japan accepted only 22 asylum- seekers in 2000, compared with Germany's 120,000) and they usually feel at a loss abroad. They will change, but things are not so bad that they have to change quickly.
 The dragon next door
 They hope. The one outside power that could shake their complacency is China. The Japanese have been trading merrily with China since the 1970s, indeed they had become its biggest trading partner by 1984. But the Japanese have, understandably, seen China as a poor country, and accordingly given copious aid (despite little evidence of gratitude: China regards the aid as reparations). Now their trading partner is not looking so poor.
 The Japanese have begun to notice that while their economy totters or shrinks--the average rate of growth in the 1990s was 1.4% a year--China's bounds ahead (by 7.3% in 2001, if you believe the figures). Whether you look at the change in the relative size of their GDPs, or at their respective share of the Asian economy as a whole, China is on the up while Japan is on the down. Add to that a second development, the Japanese worry that their economy is becoming ""hollowed out"": steel mills are closing, car plants are contracting and, worse, old export stalwarts like Isuzu are starting to import their trucks from Chongqing. One of the few stars of Japan's retail industry is Uniqlo, a chain of clothes shops whose trick is also to buy its garments from low-cost China.
 The Japanese may be foolish to worry about these developments; they merely reflect the fact that Japan is a mature economy that should be turning to services and more sophisticated products-- which it could sell to the Chinese, among others--rather than the clunky exports that served it so well in earlier times.
 The trouble is, though, that the Japanese are not very good at many of these new activities, whereas the Chinese are showing worrying signs of proficiency. In computer software, for example, China thrives while Japan flounders. One reason may be the Japanese education system. To man its electronics factories in the 1970s and 1980s, Japan could turn out numerate workers able to read a circuit diagram. But to crack the software market you need to speak English, and this, despite learning it at school for eight years, most Japanese cannot do. Often after just three years, Chinese can.
 All this has been troubling enough, but then a shock of another kind appeared: at a regional summit last November, China suddenly proposed a free-trade area with the countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations within the next decade. This looked like a clear bid by China for the leadership of Asia. It may not have succeeded, but it evidently set some mental machinery turning. In Indonesia, the Jakarta Post responded that it would not be long before China displaced Japan as the engine of the South-East Asian economy.
 It also set Mr Koizumi off double quick on a trip round the region. But how could he trump China's proposal? The best he could come up with was a free-trade area with just one country, tiny Singapore. And why Singapore? Because Singapore has no farmers, and Japan's protected farmers, the stoutest of the LDP's supporters, would not stand for free trade in agriculture. In such ways is Japan's foreign policy crimped by its vested interests.
 Chinese-Japanese relations are less than cordial, despite the gloss the Japanese press put on Mr Koizumi's visit to Beijing last October. They have been particularly strained recently by China's refusal to let Japan raise a North Korean boat that sank in China's exclusive economic zone after an exchange of fire with Japanese coastguard cutters last December. China and Japan mistrust each other, and Mr Koizumi is regarded by many Chinese, and some Koreans too, as a nationalist. They did not like his visit to the Yasukuni shrine, and they want him to intercede in the long-running row about Japan's history textbooks, which are still less than frank about Japan's wartime behaviour. Nor do they like Japan's anti-terror legislation or, come to that, the depreciating yen. For their part, the Japanese, like most others in Asia, regard China with great wariness.
 But will China force real change on Japan? One day, maybe. At present, though, the two economies look quite complementary, and Japan has no need to think that the countries of South-East Asia are eager to throw their arms round China's neck. Paradoxically, the event most likely to make Japan do something radical, such as amending its constitution or even going nuclear (as long ago as 1978 Takeo Fukuda said Japan reserved the right to build ""any type of weapon"" for its defence, even a nuclear or bacteriological one), would be a falling out with America over China.
 The fear that America may one day junk Japan in favour of China is an old if intermittent one among Japanese. It arose most recently when Bill Clinton went to China in 1998 and, it is said, persuaded President Jiang Zemin not to point his missiles at American targets, but neglected to ask for a similar favour for Japan. However, George Bush's administration is full of people who know Japan and are trusted by the Japanese. Having responded to September 11th so well, Japan seems unlikely to feel any exceptional heat from America in the near future.

Mr Okamoto , admittedly two months before September 11th , wrote that "" there is no consensus among the Japanese about exposing their country or any of their citizens to any degree of risk . "" Rather , he saw "" an obsessive concern to be on the safe side "" . In other words , Japan is not going to change dramatically as a result of pressure from the United States . Such arm - twisting has been tried often enough in the past , especially over trade , but it has seldom had much effect . The Japanese simply do not care all that much about the outside world . They have a long history of isolation , they are deeply suspicious of foreigners ( Japan accepted only 22 asylum- seekers in 2000 , compared with Germany 's 120,000 ) and they usually feel at a loss abroad . They will change , but things are not so bad that they have to change quickly . 
  The dragon next door 
  They hope . The one outside power that could shake their complacency is China . The Japanese have been trading merrily with China since the 1970s , indeed they had become its biggest trading partner by 1984 . But the Japanese have , understandably , seen China as a poor country , and accordingly given copious aid ( despite little evidence of gratitude : China regards the aid as reparations ) . Now their trading partner is not looking so poor . 
  The Japanese have begun to notice that while their economy totters or shrinks -- the average rate of growth in the 1990s was 1.4 % a year -- China 's bounds ahead ( by 7.3 % in 2001 , if you believe the figures ) . Whether you look at the change in the relative size of their GDPs , or at their respective share of the Asian economy as a whole , China is on the up while Japan is on the down . Add to that a second development , the Japanese worry that their economy is becoming "" hollowed out "" : steel mills are closing , car plants are contracting and , worse , old export stalwarts like Isuzu are starting to import their trucks from Chongqing . One of the few stars of Japan 's retail industry is Uniqlo , a chain of clothes shops whose trick is also to buy its garments from low - cost China . 
  The Japanese may be foolish to worry about these developments ; they merely reflect the fact that Japan is a mature economy that should be turning to services and more sophisticated products-- which it could sell to the Chinese , among others -- rather than the clunky exports that served it so well in earlier times . 
  The trouble is , though , that the Japanese are not very good at many of these new activities , whereas the Chinese are showing worrying signs of proficiency . In computer software , for example , China thrives while Japan flounders . One reason may be the Japanese education system . To man its electronics factories in the 1970s and 1980s , Japan could turn out numerate workers able to read a circuit diagram . But to crack the software market you need to speak English , and this , despite learning it at school for eight years , most Japanese can not do . Often after just three years , Chinese can . 
  All this has been troubling enough , but then a shock of another kind appeared : at a regional summit last November , China suddenly proposed a free - trade area with the countries of the Association of South - East Asian Nations within the next decade . This looked like a clear bid by China for the leadership of Asia . It may not have succeeded , but it evidently set some mental machinery turning . In Indonesia , the Jakarta Post responded that it would not be long before China displaced Japan as the engine of the South - East Asian economy . 
  It also set Junichiro Koizumi off double quick on a trip round the region . But how could Junichiro Koizumi trump China 's proposal ? The best Junichiro Koizumi could come up with was a free - trade area with just one country , tiny Singapore . And why Singapore ? Because Singapore has no farmers , and Japan 's protected farmers , the stoutest of the LDP 's supporters , would not stand for free trade in agriculture . In such ways is Japan 's foreign policy crimped by its vested interests . 
  Chinese - Japanese relations are less than cordial , despite the gloss the Japanese press put on Junichiro Koizumi's visit to Beijing last October . They have been particularly strained recently by China 's refusal to let Japan raise a North Korean boat that sank in China 's exclusive economic zone after an exchange of fire with Japanese coastguard cutters last December . China and Japan mistrust each other , and Junichiro Koizumi is regarded by many Chinese , and some Koreans too , as a nationalist . They did not like Junichiro Koizumi's visit to the Yasukuni shrine , and they want Junichiro Koizumi to intercede in the long - running row about Japan 's history textbooks , which are still less than frank about Japan 's wartime behaviour . Nor do they like Japan 's anti - terror legislation or , come to that , the depreciating yen . For their part , the Japanese , like most others in Asia , regard China with great wariness . 
  But will China force real change on Japan ? One day , maybe . At present , though , the two economies look quite complementary , and Japan has no need to think that the countries of South - East Asia are eager to throw their arms round China 's neck . Paradoxically , the event most likely to make Japan do something radical , such as amending its constitution or even going nuclear ( as long ago as 1978 Takeo Fukuda said Japan reserved the right to build "" any type of weapon "" for its defence , even a nuclear or bacteriological one ) , would be a falling out with America over China . 
  The fear that America may one day junk Japan in favour of China is an old if intermittent one among Japanese . It arose most recently when Bill Clinton went to China in 1998 and , it is said , persuaded President Jiang Zemin not to point his missiles at American targets , but neglected to ask for a similar favour for Japan . However , George Bush 's administration is full of people who know Japan and are trusted by the Japanese . Having responded to September 11th so well , Japan seems unlikely to feel any exceptional heat from America in the near future .

 THIS time, there was no fanfare or advance warning. On April 21st, Junichiro Koizumi, dressed in a morning suit, paid an unexpected visit to Yasukuni shrine, a memorial to Japan's war dead. By going during a spring festival, the prime minister said, he would avoid a trip in August, around the anniversary of Japan's surrender in the second world war. He may thus be able to avoid the drawn-out controversy of last summer, when his campaign promise to visit the shrine at the time of the anniversary prompted appeals not to, both at home and in Asian capitals. But his visit raised some eyebrows nonetheless.
 The shrine, which is steeped in nationalist symbolism, holds the remains of more than a dozen people who were executed in the late 1940s after their trials as war criminals. The remains were not placed there until 1978. By mingling the war criminals' remains with those of other war dead, the shrine's authorities presented subsequent leaders with a problem: neglect the soldiers who died in the war, or honour the war's masterminds along with them.
 Mr Koizumi, however, is hardly the innocent victim of devious nationalists. Far from being forced to choose, he used the Yasukuni controversy to his advantage during his internal party campaign last year. By saying that he would go there on the August 15th anniversary, he was able to appeal to nationalist supporters, helping him to win the party presidency. In the event, he fudged the issue slightly, by going to the shrine two days early.
 By contrast, this week's trip represents something of a concession, to political realities if nothing else. His visit triggered fierce criticism from the opposition, and angered the governments of China and South Korea, countries which have declined to forget Japanese conduct in the war, prompting formal protests from both. Japan is about to co-host the soccer World Cup with South Korea, which made things even more awkward. But by going now, and saying clearly that he would not go again this year, Mr Koizumi may have removed a potential distraction, one that no doubt would have grown as August approached.

 WHILE Junichiro Koizumi was enjoying a four-nation tour of the region, voters at home inflicted more damage on his embattled government. On April 28th, only four weeks after being upset in a contest for mayor in Yokohama, the ruling coalition suffered two more defeats, losing an upper-house by-election and a race for a vacated governor's seat. Though they will not affect his party's hold on power, the losses may further hamstring Mr Koizumi, just as he prepares to launch a legislative offensive.
 The defeats contrast starkly with Mr Koizumi's performance last July. Then, after only three months in office, he managed to reverse his Liberal Democratic Party's slide in the polls, leading it to a surprising victory in upper-house elections. Combined with his 80% popularity ratings, that success boosted his standing in the LDP, even though its power brokers only reluctantly tolerated his reformist message. Now, with his approval ratings cut in half, the voting booths have also turned against him.
 Losing the upper-house seat in Niigata, to a candidate backed by three main opposition parties, seemed especially humiliating. The conservative stronghold was once the base of Kakuei Tanaka, a dominant populist prime minister in the 1970s. It is also the home of his daughter, Makiko Tanaka, an outspoken lower-house MP whose sacking from Mr Koizumi's cabinet in January triggered the plunge in his approval ratings. Her subsequent denunciations no doubt hurt the LDP in Niigata.
 As in Yokohama, as well as this week's losing bid to hold the Tokushima governor's seat, exit polls in Niigata showed a sharp increase in the number of unaffiliated voters. In all three races, independents voted overwhelmingly against the ruling coalition's candidates. The same trend was apparent in this week's other by- election, for a lower-house seat in Wakayama, which the LDP won with lots of help from supporters of New Komeito, one of its two coalition partners.
 Yet despite these losses, it will not be easy for Mr Koizumi's LDP rivals--who still matter more than the leaderless opposition-- to exploit his weakness. Much of his fading popularity involves voters who like his anti-reform rivals even less. Yukio Hatoyama, who heads the largest opposition party, the Democrats, attributed this week's results not to Mr Koizumi's reform pledges, but rather to his failure to carry them out.
 Replacing Mr Koizumi soon, therefore, would probably drive such voters even further from the LDP. But the prime minister's opponents can try to use this week's defeats to weaken him, and stall the few reforms he is still pushing. They may renew their calls for a cabinet reshuffle, which Mr Koizumi has sought to avoid, although in Australia this week he said he would consider the possibility. They may also call more loudly for the head of Taku Yamasaki, the LDP's secretary-general, who has become embroiled in a sex scandal and is now being blamed for the party's haphazard campaigns.
 Mr Yamasaki is a potential Koizumi ally in the current Diet session, which is scheduled to close on June 19th. Before then, the prime minister wants to push through a series of bills that he hopes will revive his fortunes. These include measures to clarify the role of Japan's security forces, privatise parts of the postal service, reform health care and overhaul the tax code.

 THE battered market for commercial property, whose values have fallen by 82% in city areas since their peak in 1991, remains the most notorious symbol of Japan's economic troubles. Depressed commercial land prices belie the creative maths on firms' balance sheets, and threaten the solvency of the banks that have lent to them. That is one reason the government of Junichiro Koizumi, like those of his predecessors, is toying with ideas for propping up prices of commercial real estate. Yet for all the well-known troubles surrounding commercial property, the pall hanging over Japan's housing market may be even more disturbing.
 To see why, consider the ""affordability index"" compiled by Goldman Sachs, an investment bank. The index weighs everything from mortgage-interest rates and construction costs to wages and savings, and thus gauges how easy it is for Japanese to afford new homes under current conditions. Rie Murayama, Goldman's property analyst in Tokyo, says with a chuckle that when she first began using the index in 1996, and saw how well it matched housing starts over the previous two decades, she got excited: ""I thought, wow, for the first time I can predict what's going on in the housing market."" Then the bottom fell out of it.
 Since peaking in late 1996, owner-occupied housing starts have fallen by 43%, reaching an 18-year low in the fiscal year that just ended. Yet as the chart shows, new homes are just as affordable now as they were five years ago, since low mortgage rates and cheap land prices continue to offset stagnant wages. The reason demand collapsed, argues Ms Murayama, is that the arithmetic no longer matters as much to potential homebuyers, who are increasingly worried about their future. The widening gap between her index and the housing market serves as an index of economic confidence--and it is looking alarmingly negative.
 Many of the ideas that reformers champion, though laudable, will do little to boost urban property prices in the near term. Efforts to improve efficiency, such as by further relaxing zoning rules, would simply increase supply. If anything can spur corporations to disgorge their property holdings more quickly, it will have the same effect. The only steps that might bolster urban land prices would be tinkering with the tax code, or (less sensible but always possible) using government funds to buy real estate.
 Despite these excess-supply problems, growing demand for office space and centrally located flats could start to pull Tokyo around. The paralysis in the prefectures, by contrast, will be far harder to solve. For a start, the government is already constrained by high public debt and the need to keep banks afloat. By 2005 it plans to eliminate the Housing Loan Corporation, which offers fixed-rate, long-term mortgages, in competition with banks. It is cutting the corporation's budget by 20% this year, which is bound to hit demand.
 Other ideas mooted by Mr Koizumi's advisers might help a little. Efforts to make home appraisals more sensible might encourage people to buy and sell houses far more readily, as they do in the United States. But if it is really to have an impact, the government needs to tackle the confidence crisis much more directly. Unfortunately, instead of dealing with the problem of collapsed demand, Mr Koizumi seems content to carry on addressing the symptoms.","  The housing market shows just how deep Japan 's economic troubles run

  Since peaking in late 1996 , owner - occupied housing starts have fallen by 43 % , reaching an 18 - year low in the fiscal year that just ended . Yet as the chart shows , new homes are just as affordable now as they were five years ago , since low mortgage rates and cheap land prices continue to offset stagnant wages . The reason demand collapsed , argues Ms Murayama , is that the arithmetic no longer matters as much to potential homebuyers , who are increasingly worried about their future . The widening gap between her index and the housing market serves as an index of economic confidence -- and it is looking alarmingly negative . 
  Many of the ideas that reformers champion , though laudable , will do little to boost urban property prices in the near term . Efforts to improve efficiency , such as by further relaxing zoning rules , would simply increase supply . If anything can spur corporations to disgorge their property holdings more quickly , it will have the same effect . The only steps that might bolster urban land prices would be tinkering with the tax code , or ( less sensible but always possible ) using government funds to buy real estate . 
  Despite these excess - supply problems , growing demand for office space and centrally located flats could start to pull Tokyo around . The paralysis in the prefectures , by contrast , will be far harder to solve . For a start , the government is already constrained by high public debt and the need to keep banks afloat . By 2005 it plans to eliminate the Housing Loan Corporation , which offers fixed - rate , long - term mortgages , in competition with banks . It is cutting the corporation 's budget by 20 % this year , which is bound to hit demand . 
  Other ideas mooted by Junichiro Koizumi's advisers might help a little . Efforts to make home appraisals more sensible might encourage people to buy and sell houses far more readily , as they do in the United States . But if it is really to have an impact , the government needs to tackle the confidence crisis much more directly . Unfortunately , instead of dealing with the problem of collapsed demand , Junichiro Koizumi seems content to carry on addressing the symptoms .",740,Japan,A29-8209,IN TERM,True,Junichiro Koizumi,4,True

 ONE notch or two? That was the question hanging over Tokyo's markets this week, as investors waited for Moody's Investors Service to deliver another blow to Japan's sovereign credit rating. The agency had already served notice that it is mulling over another downgrade, perhaps lowering Japan by two pegs in one go. Yet instead of doing it early in the week, as expected, Moody's announced on May 14th that it will decide by the end of this month. Some onlookers concluded that only a one-notch downgrade is pending. But even that would give little solace to indignant Japanese officials, who continue to lambast the rating agencies' methods.
 Japan's local-currency sovereign debt (at Aa3 on the Moody's scale) is already languishing three grades below ""triple-A"". Another notch downward would put it on a par with Chile, Estonia, Hungary and Botswana. That last comparison seems especially to annoy Junichiro Koizumi, Japan's prime minister, who railed recently at being rated in the neighbourhood of ""African countries to which Japan is providing assistance"". Officials from the Ministry of Finance have chimed in as well, accusing Moody's and the other big agencies--Standard & Poor's and Fitch--of making unfair qualitative judgments and focusing too little on comparable figures.
 The agencies point out that, even at four or five notches below top grade, their ratings still imply a very low risk of default. But this argument does not appease the Japanese, any more than other debt issuers who wonder why the agencies need so many gradations if there is barely any difference in default risks.
 In taking on the rating agencies, Japan's officials make two main arguments. Masaki Omura, the Finance Ministry's point man in the discussions, claims that the agencies place too much emphasis on trends within a country, and not enough on consistency across countries. So if credit raters believe (misguidedly, you understand) that Japan's reform efforts are growing ever more pitiful, they will continue to knock its ratings down another peg from time to time. The trouble, says Mr Omura, is that this may take Japan far out of alignment with other countries where the reform outlook does not change much.
 On this point, Japan's government is on weak ground. The rating agencies never tire of listing hard numbers to describe Japan's economic plight. Its annual budget deficits run at 8% of GDP, its public debt will reach 157% of GDP this fiscal year, and a steady stream of deflation numbers suggests that the rot will become ever less manageable. If we repeated the figures on Japan's rapidly ageing population (which adds hugely to the future financial burden) the reader might start yearning for an afternoon nap.
 In truth, many of the countries that Japan's government looks down on boast far sounder economic fundamentals in many areas. They also lack some of Japan's advantages, such as its wealth, technology and high savings rate. But when countries are compared, the relative risks depend on what weights are assigned to different factors. Since Japan's economy is so unlike those of smaller countries with sounder finances, such comparisons become harder to make. But that does not mean that Japanese public finances are sustainable.
 The Finance Ministry's other complaint has more force, however. Unlike corporate-debt ratings, or sovereign ratings for foreign- currency debt, the entire rationale for local-currency sovereign ratings seems a bit moot. The point of credit ratings is, after all, to gauge the risk of non-payment. Yet when governments rack up huge debts in their own currency, inflation, not default, is the real risk to creditors. That is especially true in a country like Japan, in which domestic investors hold 95% of government bonds. ""Although we have no intention to monetise, it is the right of a sovereign issuer to make currency,"" says Mr Omura. ""So it is almost unthinkable that we would default.""
 The rating agencies do usually consider inflation when gauging default risk, since hyperinflation carries a risk of devaluation, political instability and other nasty effects. But such a back-door approach seems too fuzzy to justify fine distinctions between countries.
 Such arguments offer little solace to the Japanese citizens who actually hold so many of their government's bonds. Besides the risk that the government will one day inflate away the value of their holdings, they must also expect it to raise their taxes and/or slash their health and pension benefits. Like inflation, a broken social- security promise does not count as default; but if you are on the receiving end, it hurts just as much.

 THE economy may have found its bottom, but support for Junichiro Koizumi continues to slide. The prime minister's approval ratings dropped to 38% this week, and the next few months hold out little prospect of a rebound. Mr Koizumi has already conceded that he may soon have to shuffle his year-old cabinet, thus breaking one of his most visible pledges and dealing his public standing another blow. Before that happens, he hopes to salvage something from this year's session of parliament, which is due to end in late June.
 Though his agenda in the Diet hardly measures up to his early promises, it at least contains a few items that Mr Koizumi can wave around as evidence of progress. The bills fall into four categories: changes to the health-insurance scheme, a bill on privacy and the media, a package of bills defining the role of security forces, and measures to move the postal services closer to privatisation.
 The outlook for the first two items seems largely to be settled, with the two bills headed for opposite fates. The privacy bill looks nearly dead. It began as a proposal to protect the privacy of people's records, but ruling-party lawmakers expanded it to affect media reporting, prompting a public backlash. The health-insurance bill, by contrast, seems likely to pass uneventfully. The bill would shave the government's burden by raising the portion of costs that salaried workers must pay out-of-pocket, from 20% to 30%. Mr Koizumi fought the powerful doctors' lobby to get his party's approval, and the bill's passage in the Diet would mark one of his clearest victories to date.
 At the moment, most of the political manoeuvring concerns the other two items on Mr Koizumi's agenda. The security bills aim to clarify the ground rules for responding to an attack on Japan, including in situations when an attack is thought to be imminent but has not actually occurred. Their provisions, which would let the cabinet make faster decisions and make it easier for the army to shoot back, are fairly tame. They seem radical by Japanese standards, however, and would mark the first laws of this kind since Japan adopted a pacifist constitution after the second world war. One of Mr Koizumi's main coalition partners, New Komeito, is cool on the idea, and some MPs in his own Liberal Democratic Party have also resisted it.
 Many LDP lawmakers are also keen to thwart privatisation of postal services, since postal workers have been hard-core party supporters. Two of Mr Koizumi's postal bills--to set up an arm's- length public corporation next year--should pass easily. But party members, led by Hiromu Nonaka, a leading figure in the LDP's biggest faction, are resisting further changes. They have been scuffling with Mr Koizumi over how much to increase the scope for private mail delivery, and hate his insistence that he will eventually privatise the postal-savings and life-insurance schemes.
 The problem for Mr Koizumi's LDP opponents, however, is that they dare not leave him empty handed. He has already threatened to extend the Diet session until August, if need be, so he can pass the security and postal bills. Such a special extension carries risks, since a failure at that point could back Mr Koizumi into too tight a corner. ""The LDP could be wiped out if they call elections right now,"" says Shigenori Okazaki, a political analyst at UBS Warburg, ""but Koizumi might just do it because he is such an unpredictable person.""
 To avoid the risk, however slim, of such an ""accidental election"", Mr Koizumi and his party seem to have settled on a rough compromise. They will extend the Diet session by a week or so beyond June 19th, the scheduled closing date. The security bills should pass without much more fuss, and Mr Koizumi will get some form of bill freeing up mail delivery, while continuing to promise real postal privatisation later on. At that point he will head off to a G8 summit in Canada in late June, with little to show for his first 14 months in office.
 The security bills, to be fair, would mark an important step for Japan, following on its willingness to send ships to the Indian Ocean during America's military campaign in Afghanistan. In pressing health-insurance reform, Mr Koizumi has also shown a rare willingness to take on an important LDP constituency in earnest. When this Diet session is over, however, he will have yet to achieve any of the structural economic reforms that once formed the core of his agenda. Along with postal services, the rest of Mr Koizumi's privatisation goals remain distant future wishes. He has achieved few of the administrative reforms through which he once hoped to increase his government's clout. And he has done nothing to shrink Japan's pile of bad loans--the biggest barrier to a lasting economic recovery.
 This performance is as frustrating to Japan's economic partners as it is to most of its voters. So rather than show up empty handed, Mr Koizumi will head to the G8 summit with a blueprint for tax reform unveiled on May 21st, though not yet approved by the party, to add to his continued assurances that he has the economy in hand. If he is lucky, the prime minister will not draw too much attention at the summit. Then he can go home, shuffle his cabinet, and continue his downward slide.","  Junichiro Koizumi has a month or so to pass some face - saving bills

 COMPARED with some of Junichiro Koizumi's fiery slogans, Haruo Shimada's description of desired reforms sounds disarmingly modest. The prime minister talks boldly of ""reform without sanctuary"". Mr Shimada, who advises him, simply asks you to picture a Japan with ""500,000 small firms, making people happier and providing services that they badly need"". Yet although Mr Shimada says this without squinting, setting his jaw or chopping a hand in the air, the Keio University economist is advocating the same drastic changes that Mr Koizumi still says he wants. For in Japan it will be hard to make people happier or provide decent services without overhauling the entire small-business sector, and much of the country's political economy along with it.
 Messrs Koizumi and Shimada are hardly alone in wanting to tap the benefits of small companies. Countless Japanese pundits and officials harbour visions of eager young engineers and computer whizzes clustering together to churn out new technologies and jolt the economy to life. Bureaucrats at the trade and economy ministry want to promote closer links between university scientists and the private sector, to which they attribute much of America's success. They also talk up schemes to channel more money to small firms with promising new technologies.
 Low-tech counts too
 They are right to lament Japan's relative lack of small high- tech companies. But the trouble with this single-minded focus is that the rest of the country's small-business sector is also crying out for change. Solving these problems requires the sort of changes that Mr Shimada wants.
 James Kondo, a McKinsey consultant in Tokyo, points out that, besides high-tech firms, two other groups of small companies need fixing. One operates in service sectors tightly controlled by the government, running child-care centres, nursing homes and so forth. These outfits enjoy lots of subsidies and little competition, and are closely connected to powerful factions in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. The other group operates more freely in the private sector, but is just as inefficient, running outfits from food-processing plants to mom-and-pop retail stores on a scale far too small to achieve rich-country levels of productivity.
 Both of these groups of small firms warrant very different treatment from that of the high-tech firms the bureaucrats adore. Far from nurturing them, a decent reform programme would take steps towards putting them out of business, either to be replaced by consumer-friendly private services (the first group) or closed down to boost scale and efficiency (the second). Mr Shimada argues that the social-care sector should be deregulated, stripped of its subsidies and opened up to competition. This will face opposition from the usual vested interests, but could transform a large sector of the economy.
 Could Japan introduce such a change? Surveys have confirmed that consumers are not satisfied with existing services. Sensible reforms are likely to be popular with the voters. With Japanese women caught raising children while caring for two sets of parents, a push for better old-age and child care could win over many of them, along with the elderly. Hence Mr Shimada's interest in a swathe of independent small-scale social services, from nursery schools and nursing homes, to physical rehabilitation centres and preventative health-care services.
 If pitched the right way, Mr Shimada believes, it would be easy to build widespread support for changes. If competition can be paired with spending cuts, this could also release money to smooth the transformation of the mom-and-pop sectors. And perhaps best of all, argues Mr Shimada, overhauling social services is a great way to generate jobs in an ageing society. ""Sum them all together,"" he says, ""and they could be ten times bigger than Toyota or Sony.""","  The remedy for big problems

 ""THEY are rich but unhappy."" Shintaro Ishihara sums up the 12m people he serves as governor of Tokyo. In this respect, Mr Ishihara says, they are little different from the 115m Japanese who live outside its dominant city. And although the 69-year-old ex-novelist currently has no authority over the rest of Japan and its troubles, many onlookers suspect that he will in time.
 Even before Junichiro Koizumi's popularity began to fall early this year, those who doubted his political longevity had started to speak of Mr Ishihara as a candidate to succeed him as prime minister. In part, that is because Mr Koizumi's own personalised approach to politics may have paved the way for populists such as Mr Ishihara, who once sat in parliament for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), only to turn round, denounce the party, and strike out on his own.
 The governor's brand of provocative nationalism would also give him an edge should Mr Koizumi's reform pledges fall flat and leave voters in search of a simple new message. But perhaps the best reason for the speculation about Mr Ishihira's future, apart from his own ambition, is the pitiful performance in parliament of the minority parties. Their failure has allowed this local governor to emerge as a force of opposition on the national stage.
 Mr Ishihara has behaved like an opposition leader in three ways. First, he has used his pulpit to make pithy criticisms of the Koizumi government, from its failure to defend Japan's reputation to its willingness to compromise on economic reforms. Second, he has offered policies that point up differences between himself and the prime minister. For example, he tried to tax banks on their local activities. Although the courts have now overturned the tax scheme, the move let the governor look tough on banks at a time when Mr Koizumi's financial regulators were coddling them through half- hearted audits.
 The tax row also drew attention to complaints by Mr Ishihara and other governors about the central government's dominance over tax and spending decisions, a line that holds obvious advantages for an independent politician with national ambitions. While opposition MPs whinge about editors who ignore their campaigns, the stylish and demagogic Mr Ishihara has no trouble getting his proposals an airing.
 Hence the third way in which Mr Ishihara functions as the Koizumi government's opposition: he is one of the few politicians with a realistic chance to succeed him. Rumours that he would soon try to do so heated up in April, after the governor attended a dinner meeting with Mr Koizumi's rivals in the LDP. But Mr Ishihara has remained coy about becoming prime minister and says that his goal for now is to win re-election as governor next April, a race he should win easily.
 Playing the waiting game makes sense, given the difficulty of supplanting Mr Koizumi directly. To do so, the governor would have to give up his post and run for parliament. Since re-integrating himself into the LDP would destroy his maverick image, the best way to do this would be by forming a new party from splinters of the LDP and its rivals.
 That, however, is just what Mr Koizumi himself would do if he were to call a snap election. He and Mr Ishihara would therefore be forced to fish in the same pond for party defectors. So Mr Ishihara may prefer to wait for Mr Koizumi's ruling coalition to unseat the prime minister, then form a new party to challenge the LDP. ""Koizumi has to go first, he can't just take over,"" says Shigenori Okazaki, a political analyst at UBS Warburg in Tokyo.
 If Mr Koizumi falls, how might Japan's public greet an Ishihara bid? The governor's nationalist rhetoric, especially his barbs at China and the United States, brings him most attention. When The Economist spoke to him last week, Mr Ishihara lashed out at both China (for stealing Japanese technology) and the United States (for asking Japan to limit dual-use technology sales to China). Most of his complaints about other countries are economic. He wonders why Japanese institutions invest so much in American bonds, and would like to use Japan's security ties with the United States to bargain for economic concessions. This is a very far cry from making him a nationalist such as Austria's Jorg Haider or the Netherlands' late Pim Fortuyn: but in a country with Japan's historical ghosts, a politician who speaks out against foreigners is a rarity.
 An Ishihara government would annoy some of Japan's neighbours. Not all would welcome his plans to expand the navy. But most observers expect him to tone down military talk as prime minister and turn instead to economic populism to appeal to a broad range of voters.
 Mr Ishihara draws three main distinctions between his own economic approach and Mr Koizumi's. He complains that Mr Koizumi has been too soft on the banks (""Let them fail,"" he says succinctly). He says that structural reforms and reflationary policies can easily coincide; whereas Mr Koizumi is keen to restrict construction firms, Mr Ishihara is brimming with ideas for new infrastructure projects. And he does not think Mr Koizumi's proclaimed structural reforms go far enough (or at least fast enough) in practice.
 Overall the governor and the prime minister share a defect. Both talk tough on what ails Japan; neither has a political way of implementing the necessary changes. That, however, seems not to deter the governor's many admirers.
Caption: Bigger plans than Tokyo?","  As Junichiro Koizumi falters , Tokyo 's governor weighs his chances 
  "" THEY are rich but unhappy . "" Shintaro Ishihara sums up the 12 m people he serves as governor of Tokyo . In this respect , Mr Ishihara says , they are little different from the 115 m Japanese who live outside its dominant city . And although the 69 - year - old ex - novelist currently has no authority over the rest of Japan and its troubles , many onlookers suspect that he will in time . 
  Even before Junichiro Koizumi's popularity began to fall early this year , those who doubted Junichiro Koizumi's political longevity had started to speak of Mr Ishihara as a candidate to succeed Junichiro Koizumi as prime minister . In part , that is because Junichiro Koizumi's own personalised approach to politics may have paved the way for populists such as Mr Ishihara , who once sat in parliament for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) , only to turn round , denounce the party , and strike out on his own . 
  The governor 's brand of provocative nationalism would also give him an edge should Junichiro Koizumi's reform pledges fall flat and leave voters in search of a simple new message . But perhaps the best reason for the speculation about Mr Ishihira 's future , apart from his own ambition , is the pitiful performance in parliament of the minority parties . Their failure has allowed this local governor to emerge as a force of opposition on the national stage . 
  Mr Ishihara has behaved like an opposition leader in three ways . First , he has used his pulpit to make pithy criticisms of the Junichiro Koizumi government , from its failure to defend Japan 's reputation to its willingness to compromise on economic reforms . Second , he has offered policies that point up differences between himself and Junichiro Koizumi . For example , he tried to tax banks on their local activities . Although the courts have now overturned the tax scheme , the move let the governor look tough on banks at a time when Junichiro Koizumi's financial regulators were coddling them through half- hearted audits . 
  The tax row also drew attention to complaints by Mr Ishihara and other governors about the central government 's dominance over tax and spending decisions , a line that holds obvious advantages for an independent politician with national ambitions . While opposition MPs whinge about editors who ignore their campaigns , the stylish and demagogic Mr Ishihara has no trouble getting his proposals an airing . 
  Hence the third way in which Mr Ishihara functions as the Junichiro Koizumi government 's opposition : he is one of the few politicians with a realistic chance to succeed Junichiro Koizumi . Rumours that he would soon try to do so heated up in April , after the governor attended a dinner meeting with Junichiro Koizumi's rivals in the LDP . But Mr Ishihara has remained coy about becoming prime minister and says that his goal for now is to win re - election as governor next April , a race he should win easily . 
  Playing the waiting game makes sense , given the difficulty of supplanting Junichiro Koizumi directly . To do so , the governor would have to give up his post and run for parliament . Since re - integrating himself into the LDP would destroy his maverick image , the best way to do this would be by forming a new party from splinters of the LDP and its rivals . 
  That , however , is just what Junichiro Koizumi would do if Junichiro Koizumi were to call a snap election . Junichiro Koizumi and Mr Ishihara would therefore be forced to fish in the same pond for party defectors . So Mr Ishihara may prefer to wait for Junichiro Koizumi's ruling coalition to unseat Junichiro Koizumi , then form a new party to challenge the LDP . "" Junichiro Koizumi has to go first , Junichiro Koizumi ca n't just take over , "" says Shigenori Okazaki , a political analyst at UBS Warburg in Tokyo .

WHEN Muneo Suzuki, a politician who until recently was a prominent member of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), was arrested on June 19th, the only surprise was that it had not come sooner. Mr Suzuki, who was charged with accepting Yen5m ($40,000) in bribes from a lumber company in his constituency of Hokkaido, a northern island, four years ago, had for months swum against a stream of allegations of bid-rigging and meddling in foreign-ministry affairs.
Though his arrest is for allegedly trying to influence the Forestry Agency in return for money, most of the accusations against Mr Suzuki involve the scandal-ridden foreign ministry, over which he held great sway. His troubles began in January, after a bitter battle with Makiko Tanaka, the then foreign minister, who accused Mr Suzuki of tampering with her decisions. Ms Tanaka was this week suspended from the LDP, in an unrelated scandal. The foreign ministry had to conduct an internal investigation, which concluded that its relationship with Mr Suzuki had been ""abnormal"". Mr Suzuki ""resigned"" from the LDP in March. In April, his political secretary was arrested for allegedly rigging bids for public contracts. Last month, two foreign-ministry officials close to Mr Suzuki were charged with misappropriating public funds: they are also thought to have passed on state secrets to Mr Suzuki.
This is a painful time for the politicians and bureaucrats who deal with Japan's foreign and defence policies. The foreign ministry, in particular, has been dragged through the mud. Many dismiss as feeble its efforts to clean up after a corruption scandal last year. Nor has it escaped notice that much of Mr Suzuki's alleged wrongdoing required its co-operation.
Then, late last month, it emerged that the Defence Agency had secretly compiled personal reports on individuals seeking information from the agency. The reports, which included remarks about their attitudes towards the armed forces, was reminiscent of the work of Japan's pre-1945 special police, who persecuted people opposed to the ideas of the military regime of the time. The agency was next accused of covering up the results of an internal investigation into the affair. When a harassed Yasuo Fukuda, the chief cabinet secretary, then reportedly let slip that Japan might rescind its non-nuclear policy, it caused yet another uproar.
Such blunders have paralysed policymaking. Furious opposition parties have boycotted debates, leading the Diet, on June 19th, to extended its session by another 42 days. But the remaining session is likely to be no less turbulent, with opposition parties split over whether to extend their boycott or grill LDP politicians said to have received money from Mr Suzuki. 
Of the four big bills that have been held up, a controversial one on emergency defence legislation is now unlikely to pass, as is another on the protection of personal information (mostly from the media, rather than government agencies). A bill aimed at breaking Japan's powerful post office's monopoly on postal services is expected to go through, but it has by now been so watered down that it has become practically meaningless.
His inability to get bills through the Diet has badly hurt Junichiro Koizumi, the prime minister. Mr Koizumi, who has also been widely criticised for his indifferent response to the scandals, is getting weaker by the day, prompting speculation that he may soon have to give in to members of the old guard within his party and reshuffle the cabinet to give them more power, with dangerous implications for his so far largely unfulfilled promises of reform.

IT IS tempting--only natural, indeed--to be cheered by signs of a brightening economic picture in Japan. After all, growth in the first quarter of the year surprised everyone, with a jump of 5.7% at an annual rate. That sets the stage for positive growth this year, bringing to an end Japan's fourth recession in a decade. The Bank of Japan's latest Tankan report of business confidence shows that, although pessimists still outnumber optimists among executives, sentiment has leapt by bounds, mainly because overseas demand for cars and electronics is on the rise. What is more, the stockmarket has regained its poise even as American and European markets fret about the rot in their forms of capitalism. Earlier this year, the Nikkei 225 slid alarmingly, threatening to bring down Japan's enfeebled banks, which rely on their equity holdings for capital.
Not so fast. The new shoots of growth are real enough. But without the structural changes to Japan's economy that the prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, came to office in April last year promising to deliver--a clean-up of the banks' bad loans, privatisation, deregulation and administrative reform--those shoots will shrivel and die. They have, indeed, done so on several occasions before. Nothing in America or Europe matches the rot in the state of Japan. A return to export-led growth, however mild, ought to provide an opportunity to make the difficult choices that will bring efficiency and long-term growth to the economy. Instead, it appears to be the perfect excuse to put choices off.
Two pieces of excuse-making have come in the past week. Ever since he was postal minister in the mid-1990s, Mr Koizumi has said that the postal savings system needs urgently to be broken up. In effect, the post office, with Yen240 trillion ($2 trillion) in assets, is the world's largest bank; there is also an extra Yen120 trillion in its life-insurance system. Not only does the postal savings system undermine private-sector competitors. It also funds a shadow budget that squanders money by smothering almost every hillside and watercourse in concrete, and by building bridges and roads that lead nowhere useful. That is the system's direct hurt to the economy. The indirect hurt is that the money sloshing around the system keeps the old guard of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in business, and the old guard continues to stymie other reforms.
It has now stymied this one. The postal-reform bills that passed the lower house of the Diet on July 9th are a travesty of Mr Koizumi's earlier ambitions. They do not even attempt to think about the distortions caused by the savings and insurance systems. Rather, they focus on mail delivery--and even there, reforms are feeble. Competitors to the post office must set up a daunting minimum of 100,000 post boxes, while the legislation blocks any cuts in the number of state branches.
The second putting-off of hard choices comes with personnel changes at the Financial Services Agency (FSA), the body that is meant to be cleaning up banks' Yen150 trillion of bad loans, but whose ministerial head, Hakuo Yanagisawa, denies there is a crisis. This week the agency's top bureaucrat, Shoji Mori, retired ()see page 67. He preferred to prop up rotten banks--if need be, by rigging the stockmarket--rather than weed them out, and his place had been widely expected to be taken by a man more open to reform. Instead, Mr Mori is being replaced by an ally, close to the LDP's old guard.
Both episodes mark disappointment in Mr Koizumi himself: in a shaking up of the postal system, his experience was supposed to bring some heft, while the FSA appointments (unusually in Japan) fell to the cabinet office to make. Was it barely more than a year ago that a dashing Mr Koizumi came to power on a wave of popularity, promising ""structural reform without sanctuary""? Since then, reform efforts have run into the sands of LDP resistance (the post office), or they have been met with indifference by the prime minister himself (the banks). And since January, when Mr Koizumi cut a seedy political deal to get rid of his popular, if capricious, foreign minister, his ratings have tumbled by half.
Blame the PM
A spent force, then? Certainly, the costs of inaction mount, and trade-offs that are tough enough already get harder to make. One of the biggest is whether to cut taxes to spur growth or to raise taxes and cut spending in order to plug the fiscal hole ()page 58. Every extra year of spending on public works adds to Japan's government debt, already over 130% of GDP. 
Mr Koizumi's fans still argue that the prime minister may be down, but he is not yet out. Even if the public is no longer as impressed as it once was, he is still more popular than his party--which gives him some sway over it, if only by being able to call a general election in which the LDP would undoubtedly be mauled. Mr Koizumi, the fans claim, will still prove to be a mould-breaker.
Yet the party has now become emboldened by Mr Koizumi's pliability. Unless Mr Koizumi changes fast, deciding that compromises have got him nowhere, then it is time to write him off, just as the banks' bad loans should have been written off long ago.","Time to abandon any remaining hope in Junichiro Koizumi

MOST Japanese have long given up waiting for Junichiro Koizumi to achieve anything bold. On July 9th, parliament made a mockery of yet another of the prime minister's cherished causes, by passing a version of his postal-reform plans that fell far short of encouraging private competition. The mighty post office has resisted a necessary shake-up. 
But the compromises and failures have not stopped Mr Koizumi and his team from churning out other reform ideas, while billing each new proposal as another sweeping change. The prime minister's latest scheme for revamping the economy, unveiled as part of a broader economic plan last month, is tax reform.
Mr Koizumi hopes to have detailed proposals ready for parliament by the end of this year. But first he must resolve disputes between the tax committee of his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which wants to grant new tax breaks for corporate backers, and the finance ministry, which is keen to shore up revenues in the face of rising debt and ratings downgrades. Mr Koizumi has braced himself for these battles by proposing to do a little to meet the demands of each advisory group.
He does want to grant more tax breaks to Japanese businesses, especially the precious few that invest a lot and make a good profit. At 3.4% of GDP, corporate taxes yield revenues that are close to the OECD average. But because many Japanese companies report little or no profit, the government is getting its take from imposing high taxation rates on a relatively small number of successful firms.
Heizo Takenaka, Mr Koizumi's economy minister, reckons that cuts in tax rates for such firms would lower revenues by up to Yen1.6 trillion ($13.5 billion). Given Japan's public-debt worries, the government must offset this somehow, but despite Mr Koizumi's push to rein in public works, the prospect for filling the gap with spending cuts are ""limited"", the minister says. The plan calls for the cuts to be offset by higher taxes on unprofitable companies and households.
Some 70% of Japanese companies, mostly small firms, at present pay no tax. Although technically unprofitable, many firms shield their income by means of generous loopholes. Mr Koizumi aims to tax such things as rents, wages and other expenses. This would eliminate many loopholes, stress economic activity over profits, and generally put a degree of pressure on inefficient companies. 
Personal income taxes in Japan, at 4.8% of GDP, are less than half the OECD average (the government gets relatively more revenue from taxes raised to provide social security services). Although Japan's top tax rates are stiff, lower-income households fare relatively well. Mr Koizumi would like to bring down the thresholds for the lower tax brackets. He would also like to overhaul inheritance taxes, which keep savings trapped in the housing sector by discouraging families from selling.
Mr Koizumi's supporters liken these efforts to those of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, on the ground that the tax changes will boost productivity. Though such comparisons exaggerate the scope of the plan, the prime minister's proposals would on the whole promote more efficiency. Allowing breaks on investment might not be terribly clever, given that Japanese managers tend to over-invest and ignore profitability. But reducing the burden on vibrant firms, while making life tougher on the zombies, is nevertheless a step in the right direction. Or it would be, if he actually does it. If he cannot defeat his opponents in the LDP on other issues, can Mr Koizumi really take on working-class families and small firms?","Junichiro Koizumi goes into battle again

SO MUCH for the government's promises to clean up Japan's banks, which are weighed down with Yen150 trillion ($1.3 trillion) of bad debts. Since 1998, when a supervisory agency and a special commission were created, precursors to today's Financial Services Agency (FSA), there has been much talk but little action. An injection of public funds in 1999 turned out to be just a temporary rescue of the banks and their worst borrowers. Though Junichiro Koizumi made fresh promises when he became prime minister in April 2001, he has yet to deliver.
As reforms have stalled, so banks have weakened. Not counting public money and taxes that have been deferred, the big banks' capital is derisory: equivalent to barely 2% of their assets, a mere quarter of the minimum that international rules require. Banks are reluctant to take risks, so they have cut lending for each of the past four years, a drag on the economy. All the while, the two top men at the FSA, Hakuo Yanagisawa, the financial-affairs minister, and Shoji Mori, its bureaucratic head, have continued to insist that the banks are fine. The two are widely blamed for the lack of progress.
The prime minister missed a chance with his appointment of Shokichi Takagi as the FSA's new leader when Mr Mori steps down on July 12th. The announcement was a surprise, since the head of planning at the agency, Tsunekazu Haraguchi, was generally expected to win the top spot. Mr Takagi's promotion--he used to head the FSA's supervisory division and is a close ally of Mr Mori--has delighted Mr Yanagisawa and the old guard within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). It has dismayed reformers, who had hoped that policy would shift from propping banks up to cleaning them out.
Not that Mr Haraguchi was likely to prescribe harsh medicine for the banks, either. Yet he did at least listen to the lower ranks, where reformers are plenty; and he would probably have diligently carried out any orders for reform that he might have received from above. He appears to have distanced himself from some of the more blatant fiddling that took place on Mr Mori's watch: propping up the stockmarket by changing short-selling rules, for instance, and persuading banks to bail out Daiei, a supermarket chain with over Yen2 trillion of debts that was ripe for bankruptcy. That may have cost Mr Haraguchi the top job.
At first, Mr Koizumi asked Mr Yanagisawa to come up with candidates from the private sector, but was overruled by his minister. Mr Koizumi could also have chosen Hirofumi Gomi, a tough reformer who headed the agency's inspection division: he was the only candidate with real experience of regulating banks. Some still hope that Mr Gomi will overhaul the supervisory division he now heads, as he did the inspection division.
Still, not much can change until Mr Yanagisawa does, or until he is replaced. Some in the cabinet are critical of Mr Yanagisawa's foot-dragging. Mr Koizumi himself shows little interest in banking matters and until now has been content to follow his minister's advice. There is talk of a cabinet reshuffle, but few expect Mr Yanagisawa to go.
Mr Yanagisawa is slowing down reform, but the conservative bits of the LDP want to reverse it. They are urging the government to postpone (again) the second stage of deposit-insurance reform, when government guarantees are to be lifted next April on deposits of over Yen10m. (In the first stage, last April, guarantees on long-term deposits were lifted.) Mr Yanagisawa opposes the idea, which he insists is unnecessary since banks are healthy. But parliamentarians are pushing to get a bill of their own through in the autumn. They are concerned that weak regional banks and credit unions, which are already losing deposits, could suffer full-blown runs as the deadline nears. The bill will face at least some resistance from within the party. One LDP politician, Ichizo Ohara, fears that pushing back deposit-insurance reform will take away the incentive for banks to restructure and merge.
Consolidation among Japan's 100-odd banks (not counting the many credit unions) is badly needed. Weaker banks should go bust, then be wound up or sold to stronger institutions, including foreign bidders. New proposals unveiled on July 10th by the FSA offer tax breaks, higher caps on deposit insurance and public funds--all in the hope of promoting mergers of regional banks. Still, these measures smack of a rescue of weak regional banks, artificially prolonging their life. They would do little to make the industry any more efficient, says Hironari Nozaki, a bank analyst at HSBC Securities. 
Ironically, the government's failure to restore public confidence in banks may be good news for its own postal savings system, which, as the world's biggest financial institution, controls about a third of the savings market and is badly in need of reform. The deposits and insurance premiums that the post office collects are spent on wasteful public-works projects--such as bridges that nobody uses--or on propping up stockmarkets. At least Japanese banks channel money into enterprise, even if they do not do it very well.","A reshuffle at the Financial Services Agency , and an opportunity missed

A STYLISH, youngish politician wins office and begins to break the rules. He promises to clamp down on public works projects, calling them a scourge rather than a cure for economic ills. When legislators with deep ties to the construction industry complain, he rejects consensus and continues to talk tough. He seeks support from the media. Voters approve of his maverick approach. Finally, he braves a vote of no confidence. 
Has Junichiro Koizumi, Japan's prime minister, suddenly found his backbone? Alas, no. Instead, reformists must draw some hope from the drama playing out in Nagano, a rural prefecture north-west of Tokyo. On July 15th Nagano's governor, Yasuo Tanaka, announced that he will take on the prefectural assembly, which passed a no-confidence vote against him earlier this month, by calling a fresh poll and asking voters to re-elect him. 
Since winning office as an independent in 2000, 46-year-old Mr Tanaka, Japan's youngest governor, has consistently pledged to rein in public-works projects in his prefecture. He triggered his showdown with the assembly, and became the first prefectural governor in a quarter-century to lose a confidence vote, by announcing in June that he will halt construction on two dams in the prefecture. 
That decision infuriated Nagano's assembly members, many of whom, as elsewhere in Japan, enjoy close ties to the construction lobby. Because the central government pays most of the costs, Japan's profusion of highways, dams and bridges also tends to be a hit with rural voters, who have come to approve of the jobs and incomes those projects bring to slumping local economies. 
After decades of runaway construction, however, these monstrosities often serve little purpose after they are built, and have overwhelmed much of Japan's natural environment. A recent book on Japan's concrete craze by Alex Kerr, ""Dogs and Demons: Tales from the Dark Side of Japan"", claims that the government has dammed all but three of the country's 113 biggest rivers. Yet its enthusiasm for concrete is unappeased: an anti-dam pressure group claims the government plans to build 500 more dams over the next 20 years. 
By contrast, the only flow that Mr Tanaka wants to block is the river of concrete that has been inundating the countryside. A prizewinning author and social critic, he has drawn on his personality and media savvy to gain support from ordinary households. To demonstrate his openness as a politician Mr Tanaka moved his office to a glass-enclosed room on the ground floor, so that all who care to can watch him at work. 
Though he shares the prime minister's personalised approach to politics, Mr Tanaka's firmness stands in stark contrast with the political bargains Mr Koizumi has struck. The prime minister also came into office pledging to rein in public works. Yet despite some budget cuts, he has done little to dismantle the political machinery that keeps churning out these projects. Perhaps predictably, Mr Koizumi's cabinet secretary, Yasuo Fukuda, criticised the Nagano dispute this week, saying that ""it would have been better...if the governor and the assembly had just talked to each other more"". 
Will Nagano's voters back their governor's uncompromising approach? Mr Tanaka was supported by two-thirds of those questioned in a survey after the no-confidence vote. Yet his critics in the prefectural assembly reckon that his flamboyant approach may backfire with some voters. An important labour group that backed him two years ago seems unlikely to do so again. Moreover, the local economy is slumping badly after a public-works spending frenzy that accompanied Nagano's hosting of the winter Olympics in 1998. To those voters who are hooked on public works, the letdown may only stoke a craving for even more. 
The best guess is that the governor is likely to win re-election. And though he would still have to do battle with the same assembly, Nagano's voters have a golden chance to send a message: that in at least one little corner of Japan, it is possible to draw a line in the wet cement.

SO MUCH for summer. Less than two weeks before the end of the current session of the Diet on July 31st, Junichiro Koizumi, the prime minister, handed seven of his cabinet ministers tough holiday assignments. Their mandate: to come up with specific proposals to cut costs and deregulate the areas they oversee by the end of August.
The minister in charge of land, infrastructure and transport was instructed to reduce Japan's expensive and unwieldy public-works projects. The agriculture minister is to overhaul outdated rice-production policies that offer generous subsidies for farmers. The minister of economics, trade and industry must review energy policies and funding for small businesses. The home-affairs minister needs to come up with ways to cut personnel expenses in government, the education minister to trim funds for compulsory schooling.
By setting these, and 20-odd other tasks, Mr Koizumi wants to speed up structural reform, which he has often promised but so far largely failed to deliver. Much to the delight of the finance ministry (whose political head was not given any homework), the proposals are also designed cut spending next year. This would help curb rising public debt, which has swollen to 140% of GDP over the past decade. Ministers who want to keep their jobs have good reason to co-operate: Mr Koizumi is widely expected to reshuffle his cabinet in September. 
The prime minister hopes that fresh plans for reform will lift his collapsed popularity, which has only just begun to recover slightly, according to recent polls. Mr Koizumi, who is under pressure to appoint more of the old guard within his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to ministerial posts, may also be trying to set an agenda for reform while he can. Minoru Morita, a political commentator, predicts that if his popularity continues to improve, the prime minister could end up replacing only three ministers. Chikage Ogi, the land minister, and Chikara Sakaguchi, the health minister, represent two of the LDP's coalition partners, who are anxious to let others in their parties take a turn in the cabinet. Toranosuke Katayama, the home-affairs minister, might also go. Should Mr Koizumi's popularity drop, however, he will probably be forced into a more sweeping reshuffle, leaving him with a cabinet more reluctant to reform. 
Whether he can pre-empt this by setting an agenda by the end of the summer is uncertain. Ministers are already running into resistance from bureaucrats anxious to preserve their ground. And even if proposals become bills, many could go the way of a much-needed postal reform plan, which was watered down to near meaninglessness by the time it passed the Diet on July 24th.","Junichiro Koizumi demands new reform plans

IN THE late 1990s, the Japanese government tried to heal its ailing banks by pumping money into them, and the banks then spent most of their handouts bailing out dud borrowers. Big, weak banks also sought to fix themselves by merging with each other, but they failed to streamline their operations and become more efficient. The result today? The banks, with bad debts of Yen150 trillion ($1.3 trillion) and derisory capital, remain barely profitable.
Still, the government thinks that a combination of mergers and injections of public funds might work better the second time around. New proposals from the Financial Services Agency (FSA) unveiled earlier this month offer public funds (and other perks) to promote mergers between regional banks. Or so most people thought. It turns out, however, that the FSA did not exclude big banks from these measures: they too will be eligible for public funds if they decide to take regional institutions under their wing. 
The regulator hopes to hammer out more details by the end of August. They are sorely needed. It has not yet been decided how much money will be available; what strings, if any, will be attached; or if the present bank management will be asked to step down. In any case, the measures are unlikely to promote efficiency. They serve merely temporarily to prolong the life of regional banks through mergers with equally weak partners. 
The bail-out has also failed to satisfy the old guard within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which is pushing for more steps to help prop up sputtering regional banks. One group, led by Hideyuki Aizawa, a former head of the FSA and now chairman of the party's powerful committee on anti-deflation policies, is fighting the government over deposit-insurance reform, which is due to take place next April. That is the date by when the government has promised to lift its guarantee on ordinary deposits of over Yen10m.
Weak regional banks and credit unions, big lenders to hundreds of thousands of small businesses, especially in rural areas, are rapidly losing deposits as the deadline draws near. Some appear to be threatening to cut back lending, much to the consternation of politicians who fear that this could spark a wave of corporate bankruptcies in their constituencies. 
Mr Aizawa wants the government to postpone lifting its guarantee on deposits indefinitely. He says his group is mulling alternatives, such as limiting the guarantee to regional banks, or setting a two- or three-year limit to the delay. Hakuo Yanagisawa, the financial-affairs minister, insists that banks are healthy enough for the guarantee to be lifted completely. 
On July 22nd Junichiro Koizumi, the prime minister, openly challenged the dissenters in his party, by declaring that he did not expect them to delay reform. The signs are that this is the first round of a battle that will only intensify. Other proposals, such as a backdoor injection of public funds through the state loan-collection agency, are regaining popularity within the LDP. Although bank reform has stalled under Mr Koizumi, he has at least not pushed it back. Whether he can prevent others in his party from doing so is quite another matter.","Controversy over proposals to cure Japan 's ailing banks

CUT taxes now and pay later. That was the message coming from Junichiro Koizumi late last week as he continued to push tax-cut plans for Japanese companies. The prime minister was making his case in the final days of the disappointing Diet session that ended on July 31st, just as all eyes began to focus on the autumn session and a looming wrangle over next year's budget. This week, however, as he prepared to outline some of his budget plans on August 2nd, the reality of his weakened position hit home.
Apart from the fiscal battles, Mr Koizumi will also be reshuffling his cabinet (he hinted again this week that he will do so in late September) and trying to contain the damage from his party's efforts to postpone limits on bank-deposit insurance, which are due to take effect in April. The prime minister made yet another huge concession this week, when he agreed to look for ways to water down the deposit-insurance caps, even though they are a crucial means of injecting some discipline into the banking system.
With so many difficulties, the Yen30 trillion ($250 billion) borrowing limit, which at one time formed a major plank in Mr Koizumi's reform platform, now seems the least of his worries. He has already been relying on accounting gimmicks to stay within the limit. After passing the current budget this spring, he also began to hint that future budgets should focus more on spending constraints than the amount of borrowing. Now, with the autumn tax clash approaching, Mr Koizumi would be happy to abandon the pretence of a borrowing limit entirely, if only he can get his way on taxes. 
Even that will be difficult. The tax cuts he wants in exchange hinge on a sharp reduction in the effective tax rates paid by Japanese corporations, along with cuts in the inheritance, gift and property taxes that combine to distort the property market. Mr Koizumi's private-sector advisers think the plans they offered him last week would cut tax by over Yen1 trillion a year. Mr Koizumi is caught, however, between anti-reformers in his own Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the perennially tight-fisted finance ministry.
Though hardly concerned with deficits, Mr Koizumi's LDP rivals are resisting his tax cut because they fear it will lead to even tighter constraints on spending than the prime minister has already wrested from them, including a Yen1.1 trillion cut in general expenditures this year. Yet, though the finance ministry shares some of Mr Koizumi's desire to rein in spending, its ultimate goal is quite different from his. The ministry's bureaucrats worry about Japan's debt, which is approaching 140% of GDP and growing rapidly as the country runs 8% annual deficits in an ageing, deflationary economy. Successive downgrades by international ratings agencies have been giving them fits.
Although Mr Koizumi has had close ties to the finance ministry, upon taking office he was initially more concerned with overhauling expenditures, and their effect on Japanese politics, than with the size of the fiscal balance itself. The LDP old guard continues to use government cash to bolster support and stave off other structural reforms. To overcome that resistance, Mr Koizumi was originally happy to appeal to the finance ministry since his limit on borrowing helped win its support for a lower-spending budget. 
As Mr Koizumi has lost momentum, his LDP opponents have regained confidence. In the Diet session that ended on Wednesday he managed to win approval for only one-and-a-half of the four big initiatives he hoped to pass. 
As he prepares for this autumn's budget deals, therefore, the prime minister will have to disappoint the finance ministry if he hopes to win the battle with his party. Do not count on it. On July 30th the finance minister, Masajuro Shiokawa, said that revenues were projected to fall ""sharply"", even without any tax cuts. If Mr Koizumi is to gain leverage in dealing with his party and the bureaucrats, he will have to score some points through his cabinet reshuffle--either with Japanese voters, or with the people he is negotiating against.
Caption: Much to regret","The deficit may be the least of Junichiro Koizumi's worries 
 CUT taxes now and pay later . That was the message coming from Junichiro Koizumi late last week as Junichiro Koizumi continued to push tax - cut plans for Japanese companies . Junichiro Koizumi was making Junichiro Koizumi's case in the final days of the disappointing Diet session that ended on July 31st , just as all eyes began to focus on the autumn session and a looming wrangle over next year 's budget . This week , however , as Junichiro Koizumi prepared to outline some of Junichiro Koizumi's budget plans on August 2nd , the reality of Junichiro Koizumi's weakened position hit home . 
 Apart from the fiscal battles , Junichiro Koizumi will also be reshuffling Junichiro Koizumi's cabinet ( Junichiro Koizumi hinted again this week that Junichiro Koizumi will do so in late September ) and trying to contain the damage from Junichiro Koizumi's party 's efforts to postpone limits on bank - deposit insurance , which are due to take effect in April . Junichiro Koizumi made yet another huge concession this week , when Junichiro Koizumi agreed to look for ways to water down the deposit - insurance caps , even though they are a crucial means of injecting some discipline into the banking system . 
 With so many difficulties , the Yen30 trillion ( $ 250 billion ) borrowing limit , which at one time formed a major plank in Junichiro Koizumi's reform platform , now seems the least of Junichiro Koizumi's worries . Junichiro Koizumi has already been relying on accounting gimmicks to stay within the limit . After passing the current budget this spring , Junichiro Koizumi also began to hint that future budgets should focus more on spending constraints than the amount of borrowing . Now , with the autumn tax clash approaching , Junichiro Koizumi would be happy to abandon the pretence of a borrowing limit entirely , if only Junichiro Koizumi can get Junichiro Koizumi's way on taxes . 
 Even that will be difficult . The tax cuts Junichiro Koizumi wants in exchange hinge on a sharp reduction in the effective tax rates paid by Japanese corporations , along with cuts in the inheritance , gift and property taxes that combine to distort the property market . Junichiro Koizumi's private - sector advisers think the plans they offered Junichiro Koizumi last week would cut tax by over Yen1 trillion a year . Junichiro Koizumi is caught , however , between anti - reformers in Junichiro Koizumi's own Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) and the perennially tight - fisted finance ministry . 
 Though hardly concerned with deficits , Junichiro Koizumi's LDP rivals are resisting Junichiro Koizumi's tax cut because they fear it will lead to even tighter constraints on spending than Junichiro Koizumi has already wrested from them , including a Yen1.1 trillion cut in general expenditures this year . Yet , though the finance ministry shares some of Junichiro Koizumi's desire to rein in spending , its ultimate goal is quite different from Junichiro Koizumi . The ministry 's bureaucrats worry about Japan 's debt , which is approaching 140 % of GDP and growing rapidly as the country runs 8 % annual deficits in an ageing , deflationary economy .

IN THE late 1970s, nervous residents of Suginami-ku, one of Tokyo's western wards, were battling the municipality's plans to load their personal records into electronic databases, fearing the move would make it easier for the government to invade their privacy. To bypass the protests, local officials simply had the menacing new computers smuggled into the ward's offices--at 3am. A quarter-century later, Suginami-ku's residents are at it again, fighting fiercely to protect their privacy. This time, however, the local government is eagerly taking the residents' side. And to the embarrassment of Japan's national officials, the municipality is keen to wage this campaign in broad daylight.
This week, in an unusual act of defiance, at least by Japanese standards, Suginami-ku and five other municipalities refused to carry out a central-government directive to tie their records into a new national network, which went live on August 5th. The network, known in Japan as Juki Net, will assign each citizen an 11-digit identification number, and then link that electronic marker to the person's name, sex, address and date of birth. The system will then allow any ministry, agency or municipality to tap into such data on any Japanese citizen.
With local government divided among more than 3,300 cities, towns and villages, a half-dozen holdouts might seem easy to dismiss. But given the influence Japan's central government has usually wielded, their dissent has registered loudly. Within a week of announcing on August 1st that it would boycott the new system, Suginami-ku had received over 40 requests from non-residents to establish an address in the ward, as a way to give Juki Net the slip. In a recent poll by the Asahi Shimbun, one of Japan's biggest dailies, 86% said that they expected some personal information to leak from the new computer network, while 76% believe that the project should be postponed. Detractors are especially incensed that the government has pressed ahead without having first passed a privacy bill in the last session of parliament, which they viewed, with some justification, as a prerequisite for the system's being allowed to go online. 
The central government, however, claims that the new registry will promote more efficient electronic government (which only 37% of those polled believe), and will contain only limited, reasonably harmless, information on citizens. Its core argument is that existing laws and procedures already provide perfectly adequate protection and render the national-identity numbers innocuous. 
Although a clause in the 1999 law that set Juki Net up called on the government to submit a broad privacy bill before it could become active, officials point out that the same law placed restrictions on the system it created: the data cannot be shared with (non-governmental) third parties or used for purposes that are not already specified. They also say that since Junichiro Koizumi's government did table a broader privacy bill (which failed to win approval) in the most recent parliament, the original agreement has been honoured. Finally, apart from these legal restrictions, officials at the home-affairs ministry, which oversees Juki Net, place great stock in their procedures for catching abuses.
Wary Japanese citizens find it hard to choose which of these arguments to rubbish first. Just this week, as Juki Net went live, the headlines furnished two examples of how unprotected information can be. Fujitsu, a big electronics firm, announced that blackmailers had got hold of intelligence on a network it designed for the self-defence forces. Then prosecutors building a case against Muneo Suzuki, a scandal-bitten lawmaker, revealed that they had accidentally faxed their secret files to a real-estate company. Meanwhile, the home affairs ministry, the would-be guardian of Juki Net's integrity, revealed only last month that a separate data-sharing network it oversees for local governments was easily vulnerable to hackers. Topping it off, within just two days of Juki Net's launch, personal data on roughly 2,500 people had already been mailed to strangers. 
Even if the new database could be reasonably secured against outsiders, many Japanese are hardly willing to entrust the system to the insiders who will be allowed to use it every day. In May of this year, the defence agencies got caught creating a database on citizens who had requested materials under last year's Freedom of Information law, including information on their political views. After one official tried to delete the evidence, and ruling-party lawmakers attempted to suppress a 40-page report, those responsible were slapped on the wrist by their ministry for turning a measure aimed at promoting open government into a tool for covert surveillance. Their pay was docked.
With such a track record, Juki Net's opponents wonder, what is to prevent the government itself, or single-minded bureaucrats within it, from later using the national-identity numbers to compile alternate databases, with information on citizens' health records, pension benefits, or religious and political affiliations? And if anyone does try it, how often will they be caught? Or punished? Among the safeguards it now places on local records, Suginami-ku's government deliberately tries to prevent such abuses by keeping its databases fragmented, giving each of its half-million residents a different identification number for different purposes, from health, to tax, to residency files. But that is not efficient. Why, the central government wonders, won't the ward's jittery residents hurry up and trust the central bureaucracy again? After all, it has already told them who knows best.","A new national database has sparked a rare outbreak of civil disobedience

BANKERS call it the Hundred Years War. But could the battle to reform Japan's powerful postal savings and insurance system be nearing an end? On August 1st, Junichiro Koizumi, the prime minister, vowed again to privatise the post office, a reform at the top of his agenda. On August 5th, Naoki Tanaka, who heads Mr Koizumi's private advisory panel on postal reform, came up with sweeping proposals that include full privatisation, or even phasing out the post office's savings and insurance operations and shifting them to private institutions. There were other less potent suggestions, such as transferring its operations to a special public corporation.
The panel hopes to finalise plans by the end of August. But reform will not be easy. With Yen240 trillion ($2 trillion) of deposits and another Yen125 trillion in insurance policies, the post office is the world's biggest financial institution, controlling a quarter of Japan's household financial assets. It has enormous political clout. Most of its 271,000 employees spread across 24,700 branches are staunch supporters of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), for which they collect votes. Postal savings and insurance also provide a shadow budget for the government by buying wads of zaito bonds, which fund the finance ministry's fiscal investment and loan programme, used to build empty roads and bridges. 
The Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) calculates that between 1990 and 2001 the assets of private financial institutions increased by Yen84 trillion. By contrast, the combined assets of the postal savings and insurance system and public pensions grew by Yen315 trillion (thanks largely to the post office), of which 80% was invested in government bonds, regional bonds and zaito bonds. 
These investments skew the markets. For example, even though public debt is now 140% of GDP, government bond prices are not falling. Furthermore, only 5% of these funds find their way out of Japan, compared with 50% of funds in the private sector: that keeps the yen too strong and weakens the competitive power of many local industries, says Yoshito Sengoku, a politician in the DPJ. Reform, he argues, would channel more household money into private funds that can invest in foreign securities.
The post office affects policy in other ways. Depositors are flocking to its government-guaranteed non interest-bearing ""settlement"" accounts, which unlike other accounts are not capped at Yen10m. That is because the government is due to lift its guarantee on bank deposits of over Yen10m next April. This has prompted the Financial Services Agency (FSA)to come up with its latest fudge to delay deposit insurance reform. It bears a striking resemblance to the post office's interest-free accounts.
Still, there was progress of a sort last month when the Diet passed a bill that will turn the post office into an ""independent"" public company next April. This, insists Mr Koizumi, is a stepping stone to privatisation. But banks and life insurers, who want to compete with the post office on even terms, are not satisfied.
The post office still enjoys exemptions from taxes or deposit insurance premiums, which saves it Yen400 billion a year. Moreover, although the new postal corporation will be inspected by the FSA from next April, the Ministry of Public Management, Home Affairs, Posts and Telecommunications (MPHPT)--to which the post office currently belongs--will decide what to do with the inspection results. MPHPT says this is natural since the post office, unlike its competitors, is there to provide fair and universal financial services for all.
Privatisation will also take time: postal savings and insurance have to be scaled down first. Even splitting postal savings into 20 pieces would create big institutions that would dwarf many regional banks. The government is meeting resistance from the LDP old guard. Mr Koizumi's advisers are said to be deadlocked. History offers no comfort either. It took the government 33 years to privatise its telecoms company, now called NTT.","Glacial moves in the reform of the postal savings giant

JAPAN'S predicament, as everyone knows, is dismal. A decade of flat or negative growth, record unemployment, a collapse in asset prices: in most countries, these would surely spell political death for the party that had presided over the mess. Yet the leaders of Japan's Democratic Party, the biggest in the opposition, seem poorly equipped to take advantage of what ought to be a highly favourable political setting. Young Democrats such as Shigefumi Matsuzawa, 44, the eupeptic representative for Kanagawa, believe it is time to change that.
At the next election for party president, on September 23rd, Mr Matsuzawa hopes to turn Japanese politics on its head by replacing the Democrats' familiar leaders with one of the four little-known young members--preferably himself--who have recently tossed their hats into the ring. ""We are in a time"", he says plainly, ""when we have to gamble.""
In a healthier democracy, knocking off a ruling party as corrupt and enfeebled as the Liberal Democratic Party would hardly require much of an appetite for risk. The LDP has been battered by a storm of recent scandals. Many of its top people are old. It has no clear plan for ending a decade-long economic slump, and has steered its youthful prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, away from every popular idea he ever endorsed.
For the Democrats, the tantalising fruit of real power is dangling about as closely within reach as it can get. Yet the party still seems to lack the stature to reach up and pluck it. Despite everything, it trails the LDP by 23 percentage points in opinion polls. And its two main leaders, Yukio Hatoyama (its distinctly lacklustre current president and party leader) and Naoto Kan (the secretary-general, and the most popular Democrat among the general public) have no convincing strategy for winning over unaligned voters.
That pitiful opposition showing is the driving force behind the younger MPs' gamble--actually, two gambles. First, the four youngsters, three of whom are in their early 40s, may be risking bright futures by sticking their necks out this time around, rather than simply biding their time. The leadership race will already feature several senior members of the party, including Mr Kan (with 26% national support) and Mr Hatoyama (17%). The four young Democratic hopefuls, by contrast, pull 1-2% support each among the wider public.
The other gamble is less a personal risk than a party one. If any of the young contenders does manage to seize the top post, say the stalwarts, they risk splitting the very party that they hope to ride into office. Formed during the tumultuous realignments of the mid-1990s, the Democrats comprise former factions of several other parties, from the LDP itself to the Socialists. Its rough platform tries to bind these factions together by combining a call for greater competition with plans to extend the safety net under those who lose their balance in the upheaval. When Mr Kan labelled this amalgamation ""the party of Thatcher and Blair"", he appears to have meant it as a good thing.
Most disgruntled young Democrats favour more emphasis on the competition side of the economic-reform ledger. Their current leaders, they complain, are too quick to compromise with labour unions, parts of the bureaucracy and other interest groups that are opposed to bankers and executives but do not necessarily favour freer markets. Because these groups are also content with Japan's corporatist economy, the youngsters argue, the Democrats cannot tear into the LDP's policies as viciously as they should. 
If they are going to take on these leaders, however, the youngsters must first whittle down their list of challengers. After meeting again on August 20th, a group of 50 young Democrats still could not get any of the four to drop out. The two front-runners, Seiji Maehara and Yoshihiko Noda, have locked up the 20 MPs they need to back a leadership bid; but Mr Matsuzawa and Takashi Kawamura (a maverick businessman, and at 53 the oldest of the group) have yet to bow out. A simple vote among young Democrats seems too hard to agree upon. 
Their slowness in whittling down the field to a viable one candidate suggests that, in one crucial sense, the junior Democrats may not be too different from the leaders they aim to supplant. When talking about the current stalemate, they exude less a real sense of urgency than, at best, a theoretical appreciation of the merits of acting urgently. But if they cannot speedily sort out their leadership bid, the young Democrats will surely fall together, and their party will have missed a golden opportunity to renew itself. The same might be said, perhaps, for Japan.","Young reformers hope to whip the opposition into shape

A simple vote among young Democrats seems too hard to agree upon . 
 Their slowness in whittling down the field to a viable one candidate suggests that , in one crucial sense , the junior Democrats may not be too different from the leaders they aim to supplant . When talking about the current stalemate , they exude less a real sense of urgency than , at best , a theoretical appreciation of the merits of acting urgently .

COMING up with fresh ways to fudge deposit-insurance reform is a hobby of Japanese politicians. A previous two-year postponement, supposed to give the government extra time to clean up the banks, left them weaker than before. Now the government is thinking of breaking its promise to lift its guarantee next April on ordinary deposits of over Yen10m ($84,000). On August 19th, Standard & Poor's (S&P), a credit-rating agency, argued that such a setback to reform could send Japan's rating even lower. Weak banks, says Naoko Nemoto of S&P, would stumble on, frustrating a banking recovery.
Not, of course, that the government is officially considering any postponement at all. Banks, it says, are healthy, and reform will go ahead as planned--except, that is, for one small change. 
The change, which a special panel is considering at the request of the prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, would keep fully protected the current accounts used by big firms and local governments for settlement purposes. So that individuals do not feel left out, new accounts for small depositors would be allowed that also receive blanket protection, but yield no interest. That would be tantamount to halting deposit-insurance reform, critics say.
Getting the scheme to work will be hard, not least because most banks oppose it. Creating new types of account takes time, and is costly. Bankers doubt the accounts could be ready by next April.
The government and banks are also split over who will pay the extra deposit-insurance premiums. Banks are reluctant. Since these settlement accounts offer no interest at all, banks cannot pass the costs on to depositors, in the form of lower interest rates. So they will have to ask for high account-management fees. Banks, especially the weak ones, wonder how many depositors would be willing, in effect, to pay banks to use their money. Banks want taxpayers to foot the bill instead, to which the government is unlikely to agree. 
If the aim is to prevent a rash of bank failures--by discouraging depositors from moving their money away from weak banks into safer ones--then it will not work anyway, Brian Waterhouse of HSBC Securities argues. Look no further than Hokkaido Takushoku Bank, which failed in 1997, he says. Although its deposits were fully protected by the government, depositors still fled to bigger banks, or to the postal savings system. This latest scheme is worse, because it will have to require all the banks to act simultaneously. If they did not, then banks offering the special guaranteed accounts would immediately be seen to be desperate--perhaps leading to the runs on deposits that the scheme seeks to avoid in the first place. 
With so many drawbacks to his latest suggestion, Mr Koizumi may wonder whether it is worth damaging his reformist credentials even further. Another idea is to extend protection of ordinary deposits, on the condition that banks lower the interest rates on these to zero (from about 0.001% currently), has similar pitfalls. Still, the fudge helps lessen pressure from the old guard in the Liberal Democratic Party. Mr Waterhouse thinks that the prime minister might use the banks' argument that they are having trouble getting their computer systems ready in time as an excuse to keep the safety net in place for another year--all the while insisting that the reforms are still on track.

JAPAN'S Junichiro Koizumi may be about to discover, like others have before him, that it is easier to make history with prickly North Korea than it is to make progress. On September 17th, he plans to become the first ever Japanese leader to call on its reclusive boss, Kim Jong Il. He has a lot to talk about: the Japanese citizens abducted by North Korean agents over the years, the rockets that now have all of Japan in their firing range, and the nuclear and other ambitions that make North Korea a founder-member of George Bush's ""axis of evil"". His North Korean host, meanwhile, demands $10 billion or more in compensation for Japan's past colonial rule. Might the planned Koizumi-Kim talks nonetheless signal a thaw in the North's frost-bitten relations with Japan, South Korea and America? Or will history repeat itself--as farce, or worse? 
Two years ago, South Korea's President Kim Dae-jung made his own ""historic"" journey north, proffering generous dollops of aid and investment for North Korea's clapped-out economy. He returned with promises that his northern namesake would pay a return visit to the South, that divided families would be allowed to meet, that economic contacts would flourish, allowing the first official breaches (a road and rail-freight link were mooted) in the cold war's final frontier. A few families have been briefly reunited, at a price. But it turned out that the northern Mr Kim wanted only to shore up his own communist-cum-feudal regime. He swiftly retreated behind a wall of hostility, pocketing all the cash and goodies he could. 
Will he behave better this time? There are some encouraging signs. He has launched a round of economic reforms--""perfecting communism"", his officials insist--though it is unclear whether as a prelude to a wider economic opening, or simply in a desperate effort to stave off ruin (the flow of North Korean escapees--another 15 or so sought asylum at diplomatic premises in China this week--steadily increases). Yet it is South Korea, Japan and the United States that Mr Kim has to deal with if he wants to end his pariah status and draw in the investment needed to rebuild decrepit roads and factories. Economic talks with South Korea did resume last month. Hoping to be struck off America's list of states that sponsor terrorism--and thus become eligible for help from the likes of the IMF--North Korea has signed some UN anti-terrorism conventions, and may be about to hand over four ageing Japanese terrorists it had been harbouring. 
In the light of all this, America and South Korea have lent Mr Koizumi their support. But if he is to advance the cause of peace on the peninsula, there are some pitfalls to be avoided.
History in the making
The summit was Mr Koizumi's idea, boosting his sagging ratings at home, so he is under pressure not to return empty-handed. But nothing could be better than something, if the something he is offered is a deal that would breach the common front that Japan, South Korea and America have achieved in facing down the threat from North Korea.
The North has tried wedge-driving before. It attempted to talk South Korea into supplying it with vast amounts of electricity. But that would have enabled it to wriggle out of a deal it struck with America in 1994 to abandon its production of bomb-making plutonium in return for two nuclear-power reactors and supplies of oil. Before the nuclear components of the reactors arrive, North Korea must come clean to international inspectors about its past nuclear activity. Loth to do so, it may yet hope to coax enough aid from Japan to give it the wriggle room it needs to keep the inspectors at bay. 
In fact North Korea already receives food aid for its half-starved people. Mr Koizumi's message should be that more aid and better relations can be had, not just from Japan but from South Korea and America too, but in return for verifiable steps to reduce the danger North Korea poses all round--from its missiles, from its missile sales to unstable parts of the world, from its nuclear-, chemical- and biological-weapons dabbling, and from the array of troops and guns dug in just across the border from the South Korean capital, Seoul. If Mr Koizumi's visit were to kick off wider talks on a deal of that sort, he could indeed claim to be making history--not faking it.","Coaxing North Korea in from the cold

WHICH map is Junichiro Koizumi using? Having wandered a long way from his initial reform pledges, he is now trying to redirect himself by straying overseas, with a trip to North Korea planned for September 17th. The visit, the first by a Japanese prime minister, has given his ratings a boost. But a more reliable route towards enduring popularity exists at home. 
Mr Koizumi needs to tackle the problem of the overbuilt network of roads and bridges that criss-cross Japan, often duplicating existing routes or going where nobody wants to drive. The runaway construction that created this mess is one of Japan's most familiar and expensive headaches, and Mr Koizumi pledged to fix it when he took office last year. Since then, however, numerous compromises have sapped his credibility, and a much-touted panel of advisers, which released its interim report on highways last week, is still ducking the most difficult decisions. 
While sending them off to finish their work, Mr Koizumi might also take a close look at the second glaring feature on the map: Nagano, a rural prefecture lying to the west of Tokyo, where a reformist governor won a thumping re-election victory on September 1st. 
Yasuo Tanaka gained a fresh term by taking precisely the sort of risks that the prime minister has so far avoided. Like Mr Koizumi, Mr Tanaka first got into office by promising a thorough structural overhaul of government, and by distilling these sweeping pledges into specific and pragmatic reforms--most importantly, in Mr Tanaka's case, by vowing to stop the building of new dams. Also like Mr Koizumi, the rural governor has faced a hostile political assembly determined to thwart his reforms. Unlike Mr Koizumi, however, Mr Tanaka has stuck to his pledges despite this, halting construction on two dams and braving a vote of no confidence by the assembly. After refusing to compromise and appealing to the public, he has been rewarded with a convincing re-election. 
Sadly, Mr Koizumi has consistently refused that sort of steadfast and edifying approach. He has backed away from dealing with banks' bad loans, and allowed his own party to gut his plans for privatising the postal service. And now he is failing to show leadership on road construction, even though he has said he wants to cut public-works spending. This failing seems even sadder now that the special advisory panel he appointed has helped to generate public outrage about the four public road and bridge corporations that Mr Koizumi says he wants to privatise. 
One reason for this outrage is the nature of the panel, which holds its hearings in public and includes among its seven members Naoki Inose, an outspoken author who seems to delight in taking potshots at the highway lobby. The hearings have highlighted the huge losses rung up by the government's road corporations. They have detailed the corruption that allows connected private companies to make extortionate profits through roadside concessions. And they have exposed the dishonesty of the public companies' senior management, which lied to the advisory panel when it asked to be allowed to see their financial records. 
As a result, 60-70% of Japanese now say that they would like to see the highway corporations overhauled and the building of new roads scaled back. Yet the details will be tricky--the panel has so far offered little in the way of solutions to the problems it has highlighted--and leave plenty of room for fudge. If highway reform is to matter, Mr Koizumi must recheck his map, grab the wheel of his government and steer it in a clear direction.","Junichiro Koizumi needs to take a new direction

A HANDSHAKE and a pair of apologies are a start. But will this week's controversial trip to Pyongyang by Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, help reshape the history of confrontation between North Korea and the outside world, or merely offer another footnote to disappointment?
Much depends on what North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, is up to: is he genuinely searching for a way out of his bunker, or merely looking for a fresh pocket to tap for the funds he needs to survive? Quite possibly, both. But even assuming that he is ready to start settling at least some of his long-standing differences, not just with Japan, but also with South Korea and the United States, peace on the Korean peninsula can best be won if these three countries stick together as closely in their dealings with the unpredictable Mr Kim in the future as they have in the recent and difficult past. 
Mr Koizumi did not return empty-handed from this first ever Japan-North Korea summit. He brought back news of some Japanese citizens who had been kidnapped over the years by North Korean agents, and he won a pocketful of promises ()see page 65. Mr Kim said he would resume stalled talks about normalising relations with Japan, drop demands for ""reparations"" for Japan's past colonial rule in favour of ""economic aid"", extend his moratorium on missile testing beyond the turn of the year, and keep to his obligations under a 1994 nuclear deal brokered by America that traded a halt to North Korea's production of bomb-usable plutonium for two western-designed nuclear reactors now being built. 
All that is probably as much as Mr Koizumi could have expected--perhaps more, since in return for Japan's (previously proffered) apology for its past colonial behaviour, Mr Kim not only said he was sorry for the kidnappings, but promised not to reoffend. After years of bare-faced denials, such bare-faced contrition seemed something of a breakthrough. Yet it is also a measure of how difficult it will still be for Japan, South Korea and the United States to reduce the threat to regional stability from a regime that has so far made a national virtue out of remaining the last, dangerous relic of the cold war in Asia.
Aside from his hopes of a lift in the opinion polls at home, Mr Koizumi's chief aim this week seemed to be to show that, for all its economic woes, Japan was still a player in resolving the region's security problems. His officials point to Mr Kim's promise to hold off from further missile tests, and his readiness to live up to North Korea's commitments under the 1994 nuclear deal, as evidence of success. But North Korea has promised all these things before. Is there reason to believe they may add up to something this time?
He may run North Korea with an iron rod, but Mr Kim is not entirely immune to domestic pressures. In recent years, famine has killed some 2m North Koreans (out of about 22m), and only foreign food aid has saved many of the rest. But floods and drought have merely compounded a man-made disaster brought on by decades of Stalinism. Alarmed by the increasing outflow across its border of desperate North Koreans, China has long been pressing Mr Kim to change his ways. A revamp of wages and prices two months ago appears to be his attempt to imitate China's Communists, by reviving the economy while keeping a firm grip on power. With Russia and South Korea, Mr Kim has dusted off plans for a rail link that could eventually carry freight all the way to Europe. 
But, as China no doubt reminds him, Mr Kim cannot find the huge sums he needs to rebuild his country's broken infrastructure without help from South Korea, Japan and America. He has tried South Korea: two years ago a summit in Pyongyang with South Korea's president, Kim Dae-jung, ended with promises of large dollops of South Korean aid in return for greater contact across the inter-Korean divide. But the northern Mr Kim kept up the hostility, while pocketing what cash he could. He then tried auctioning off his missile programme to the Clinton administration, which was anxious to see an end to North Korea's proliferation activities in unstable parts of the world, such as South Asia and the Middle East. But the deal was unfinished when George Bush decided to put an end to the practice of buying off North Korea's bad behaviour, since this seemed only to encourage more of it.
Keeping his attention
For more than a year now, Mr Bush has been offering North Korea an across-the-board improvement in relations, but only if North Korea starts attending just as comprehensively to the security threat it poses. This would mean not just ending its missile programme, but also admitting international inspectors to check on its past plutonium dabbling, as North Korea is obliged to do before the nuclear components for its new reactors are delivered. It would also mean discussing confidence-building measures to reduce the threat to South Korea from North Korean troops and artillery massed across the border. 
Mr Kim, miffed at being included in George Bush's ""axis of evil"", had seemed to turn that offer down flat. But it's a funny thing. Ever since Mr Bush declared his war on terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, Mr Kim has moved, despite the occasional zig-zag, in roughly the right direction: he has signed a series of UN conventions outlawing terrorism; he has moved to start expelling some ageing Japanese terrorists he had been harbouring; and now he has owned up to snatching those Japanese citizens, and sent Mr Koizumi home with a message that he is ready for talks with others, America included.
And not before time. Unless the inspection issue can be resolved soon, the reactor project could start to unravel, pitching the peninsula back towards confrontation and leaving North Korea with no check on its nefarious nuclear activities. Mr Kim had clearly been hoping that South Korea would provide an alternative source of the electricity the reactors are meant to provide, but it has so far refused. If Japan's promised aid flows too quickly, that might be another way he tries to wriggle off the inspections hook. Letting him do that would be sheer folly. Only by standing together and standing firm have America, South Korea and Japan coaxed Mr Kim this far out of his bunker. There is still a lot of careful coaxing to do.","Dealing with North Korea may be getting interesting , but no easier

WHEN its prime minister announced last month that he would make a historic trip to North Korea, Japan was abuzz with talk of a breakthrough on the sorest sticking point between the two countries: the dozen or so Japanese nationals whom North Korea stood accused of abducting in the 1970s and 1980s.
In the event, the revelations emerging from the hermit kingdom on September 17th were more stunning--and more disturbing--than had been imagined. Though there was plenty for the diplomats to get their teeth into, in the shape of a promised extension to North Korea's missile-testing moratorium, and reports of (yet another) promise to re-connect the Koreas by road and rail, it was news of the disappeared that grabbed popular attention in Japan. Junichiro Koizumi's day in Pyongyang--the first visit there by a Japanese prime minister--yielded good tidings for four lucky Japanese families, but relatives of eight other abductees were told, along with a horrified nation, that their loved ones are dead. 
One poll showed Mr Koizumi's ratings had surged 10% overnight, but as the news sinks in, some observers fear a backlash that will complicate efforts to reach out to Kim Jong Il's regime. Something similar happened to South Korea's president, Kim Dae-jung, in his dealings with the North. Though North Korea has always denied it, Mr Kim now admits that elements of his regime did indeed kidnap a number of Japanese nationals, some of them straight from Japan's beaches, and smuggled them back to North Korea. The youngest, Megumi Yokota, who is among the dead but is said to have a surviving daughter born in North Korea, disappeared after badminton practice in 1977, at the age of 13. Mr Kim claims that uncontrollable bits of his regime did this without his knowledge, and used the abductees to teach Japanese language and customs to North Korean spies.
For all the security risks that North Korea poses to its neighbour, the abductions have long been the most emotional and contentious issue in the eyes of most Japanese. Indeed, before this week's visit the worry of many Asian security experts, and especially of Japan's American allies, was that Mr Koizumi might be willing to go soft on Mr Kim in exchange for the public relations coup of bringing a few of the abductees home. Yet even though the four survivors remain in North Korea, and though Mr Kim provided no details about the eight who have died (all, he says, of natural disasters or natural causes, young though they were), Mr Koizumi carried on with the talks before signing a joint statement with Mr Kim that many Japanese may find hard to fathom.
Though Mr Koizumi did not cave in to longstanding demands for war reparations, the statement declares that Japan ""honestly admitted the historical facts that it had inflicted huge damage and sufferings upon the Korean people during its past colonial rule"". It then goes on to mention, ""in the spirit of the declaration"", that Japan will be bestowing some economic aid on its beleaguered neighbour. The statement also mentions that the two sides will ""exert all efforts to establish diplomatic ties at an early date"". They are already planning for talks to begin next month. Though Mr Koizumi strongly denounced the deaths of the abductees, his decision to carry on making history, rather than turning round and heading home, blurred his message.
With no joint statements to sign, lawmakers back in Japan had an easier time finding their voice. Members of Mr Koizumi's coalition will no doubt be hounding him to learn more about the eight deaths and demanding some compensation for the families, even as he negotiates with North Korea on other issues of aid and security. All of this will tend to complicate Mr Koizumi's job in two different ways in the coming months.
First, he will find his simple one-day excursion into foreign affairs has become a bigger distraction than he counted on. Until now, Mr Koizumi has hardly been a foreign policy prime minister. He chose his first foreign minister, Makiko Tanaka, because of her popularity and her willingness to talk tough to bureaucrats, even though she showed little patience or talent for statecraft. His trips to neighbouring countries have gone relatively unnoticed, and his handful of meetings with George Bush have been designed to show off their friendship while avoiding important issues. Though he will no doubt leave the details of North Korean talks to others, Mr Koizumi must now pay attention to how the reporting of those details could affect his image at home.
Restoring that image may also become more difficult. Before his trip to Pyongyang, the betting had been that Mr Koizumi's looming cabinet shuffle will be a mild one, offering few concessions to rival factions in his coalition and leaving him in reasonable control of his team, at least by the standards of Japanese cabinets. But if he carries through with that approach, it will leave him holding more of the blame if a round of by-elections on October 27th goes badly for the party.
He must now hope, therefore, that he can turn the news from North Korea to his advantage, or at least limit any damage, before voters go to the polls. He may yet find a way. He may, for instance, get a boost if and when the four surviving abductees are reunited with their families, though no dates for a reunion have been set. The irony, however, is that Mr Koizumi has already succeeded where his predecessors failed, by returning with precious information about the fate of those who were taken--and yet the truth may hurt him.","Junichiro Koizumi may yet pay a price at home for Junichiro Koizumi's trip to North Korea

TRADITIONAL ryotei, where elegant kimono-clad women serve dainty dishes and fragrant sake, are usually the dining spots of choice for foreign heads of state visiting Tokyo. But when George Bush arrived earlier this year, Junichiro Koizumi, the prime minister, took the American president to Gonpachi, a huge, trendy tavern in Tokyo's hottest night spot. In contrast to the discreet formality of ryotei, the bustling, occasionally raucous Gonpachi, decorated with fat sake kegs and strings of paper lanterns, suited Mr Koizumi's populist image and helped to show off an easy bond with his buddy, Mr Bush.
The visit was a huge feather in the cap of Kozo Hasegawa, the maverick founder of Global Dining, which owns Gonpachi and a string of other popular restaurants, including a couple in California opened as a pilot for a possible global expansion.
Global Dining restaurants offer decent food at a reasonable price and stay open late. The restaurants have funky themes, ranging from the Gothic splendour of Tableaux, which offers Californian cuisine, to its latest venture, the disco-style Dancing Monkey, complete with glittering mirrored balls and zebra-patterned floors.
But Global Dining's greatest strength is its efficient and attentive service, fostered by vigorously defying traditional Japanese business practices. A decade after Global Dining started life as a coffee shop in 1973, Mr Hasegawa concluded that its conventional Japanese seniority system bred complacency, causing his restaurants to lose customers and money. Now the firm, which has annual sales of yen11.7 billion ($98m), boasts a competitive system of carrots and sticks for workers that might shock even ruthless American employers. 
Most of the 1,400 staff are hired first as part-timers, mostly in their 20s and on minimum pay. To get a raise, they must win the backing of a majority of their co-workers at one of the regular staff meetings. A thick skin is essential, as colleagues tend to be blunt in their discussion of strengths and weaknesses. Applicants take criticism--which has been known to address subjects such as overly-strong body odour--in their stride. So much for the traditional Japanese workplace, full of passive workers strenuously avoiding confrontation and personal accountability. 
Life gets no easier higher up the ladder. Increasing sales, a restaurant manager's top priority, is tough given the sagging economy. Poor performance leads to demotion, while the successful are rewarded just as swiftly. Naonobu Takashima, the 25-year-old manager of La Boheme--themed as a medieval European castle--was hired as a part-time waiter in March 2001 on yen850 ($7) an hour. Six months later, he was put in charge of one of Global Dining's leading outlets. He now earns around yen15m a year, a rapid seven-fold increase perhaps unprecedented in Japan.
Global Dining's culture is winning influential admirers. Some senior executives at blue-chip firms are so impressed that they are sending their offspring to be trained at the restaurant chain.
After a TV programme on Mr Takashima's meteoric rise, busloads of restaurateurs from across Japan started visiting La Boheme to watch the young star in action. There have been some typically Japanese side-effects. Some traditional businessmen, who spent decades climbing the corporate ladder, found his rapid success hard to accept and abused him on the firm's website. He was even heckled at work.
Global Dining's meritocracy has forged an army of highly professional workers, trained to make wide-ranging decisions on how a restaurant should be run. They are tempting recruits for rivals. Even Global Dining's drop-outs are mostly considered better than average industry workers and are soon hired elsewhere.
There was a huge exodus after Global Dining went public in 1999. A quarter of its managers cashed in share options and left to start their own restaurants. Not only did it lose some of its stars--some of them also became its fiercest competitors. Global Dining's share price has plunged by 90% since listing its shares. Analysts say the main problem, apart from a market-wide collapse in share prices, is its failure so far to nurture a big batch of new talent. 
Mr Hasegawa agrees and is searching for ways to keep the best of the current workforce. One idea is to let them come up with--and execute--concepts for new restaurants. That way, he says, they can enjoy much of the freedom and excitement of starting a business themselves, but with a financial safety net and a ready-made pool of good staff. Perhaps quite soon, an even bigger prize will be on offer. Unusually in a country that prefers to keep businesses in the family, the 52-year-old Mr Hasegawa says his own job will be up for grabs in an open competition when he retires.","Global Dining is revolutionising Japanese work practices

WHEN central bankers gamble, they usually go about it like pensioners in a low-stakes card game. ""Should we lower interest rates, or stand pat? Let's try a quarter-point and hope for the best."" But that, apparently, is not how it works in Tokyo, where the Bank of Japan has recently decided to go for broke. The central bank is not, as many have long been urging, placing its bet on an all-out monetary stimulus. Rather, as its officials made clear this week, the bank's preferred game of chance is politics. The stakes: all that remains of its credibility.
After its surprise announcement last week that it will begin buying equities from the portfolios of the country's ailing banks, the common reaction was that the Bank of Japan had caved in to political pressure by giving succour to banks and their over-protective regulators. Waves of condemnation followed, including, on September 20th, an unprecedented shortfall of bidders at the Ministry of Finance's auction of ten-year Japanese government bonds. In response to the criticism, officials at the central bank have begun privately pressing their case. Their explanation is even more stunning than their original decision.
By taking such an unorthodox step, says one senior official, the Bank of Japan hopes to act as a ""catalyst"" in order to ""ignite full-fledged efforts among related parties to deal with the [banks' bad-loan] problem."" Although he admitted that there had been political pressure, ""explicit and implicit"", to buy the shares, the official maintains that this was not the reason for the new policy. The Bank of Japan is trying to take the game to the rest of Japan's government, goes his argument, not the other way round. It is an independent decision, he says, ""based on our serious concern about the state of the financial system... We are not 100% sure that this approach will work. It's a big gamble.""
Another senior official was similarly blunt, saying that the timing of the Bank's decision was tied directly to Japan's political cycle. An upcoming reshuffle of Junichiro Koizumi's cabinet; the prime minister's rising poll numbers; and rumours that he was growing fed up with Hakuo Yanagisawa, who heads the Financial Services Agency (FSA), the banks' regulator: all this led some central-bank officials to conclude that the odds of Mr Koizumi taking serious steps to restructure bad loans had gone up, and that its extraordinary new policy might push him in the right direction.
With arguments still going on inside the Bank, it is clear that different officials had different reasons for backing the plan, which it was apparently considering weeks in advance. Some, certainly, were concerned that falling stockmarkets risk destabilising the banks, which hold massive equity portfolios that are riddled with losses. With politicians clamouring for the central bank to buy shares, the scheduled replacement next spring of Masaru Hayami, the Bank's governor, also weighed on a few officials' minds. Their calculation seems to have been that it was better to act now, in a fashion that met politicians' approval, than to have an outsider foisted on them. Mr Koizumi has a penchant for appointing private-sector folk to head up public institutions.
Little to date is sure about the share-buying proposals, other than that they will be small--around yen1 trillion-3 trillion ($8 billion-24 billion). Indeed, when you compare the surprising break from central-bank orthodoxy with the likely limited impact of the scheme, it does seem more geared towards getting people's attention, and thus allowing the central bank to broadcast its argument. And the argument, quite simply, is that the FSA is failing to deal with the banks' bad loans, amounting probably to yen150 trillion.
The FSA, just as vehemently, has said that bad loans will soon be coming down nicely, and that better monetary policy would help. The Bank's new contribution to this debate goes something like this: ""By doing something that any good central banker would consider nuts, we are showing the prime minister how firmly we believe we are right.""
Since they could achieve the same thing by setting their building on fire, why go about it this way? By helping to provide a cushion for banks' share sales, say people at the Bank of Japan, it is providing stability and making it easier for Mr Koizumi to choose decisive action. Unfortunately, the flaw in this argument is that, by the same reasoning, the Bank is also lowering the short-term cost of the government doing nothing about the banks. Every deck in Japan is stacked in favour of muddling through, so the Bank of Japan's gamble thus seems irrationally exuberant. Now that the bet has been taken, the best onlookers can do is hope that it somehow beats the odds.

In his first 18 months as prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi dithered over the banks, whose bad loans are officially reckoned to be yen43 trillion ($345 billion), equivalent to 8% of GDP, though more realistic estimates put them at twice or even three times that figure.

By repeatedly denying that there was anything wrong at the banks that time could not cure, Mr Yanagisawa had himself become one of the biggest obstacles to reform. His replacement, Heizo Takenaka, who continues also as economics minister, is young, reformist and acutely aware of the banks' true condition. Banks' share prices fell after Mr Koizumi's reshuffle. With luck, this signals that real action--in particular, accelerated write-offs of banks' bad loans--will mean real pain.
Certainly, the prime minister is now staking his political capital on such action. Mr Takenaka swiftly announced a task-force for cleaning up the bad-loan mess, and it includes another committed reformer, Takeshi Kimura; it is to report later this month ()see page 89. However, proposals that put companies out of business or close down banks are likely to run up against the near-immovable mass of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The LDP complains that Mr Koizumi's new resolve is prompted more by pressure from outsiders--especially the IMF and the Americans--than by domestic imperatives. LDP politicians note with relish that Mr Takenaka, an academic, is no political heavyweight.
All the same, Mr Koizumi has some momentum. The extraordinary announcement two weeks ago by Masaru Hayami, governor of the Bank of Japan, that the central bank would buy banks' equity holdings, so concerned was it about the health of the banking system, put the focus on the FSA's inaction. The finance minister, Masajuro Shiokawa, seemed to support Mr Hayami when he said in Washington, DC, that bank consolidation and an injection of public funds were perhaps not such bad ideas. That appalled his ministry, always at war with the Bank of Japan.
There are two broad ways to deal with the banks' bad loans. The first, less satisfactory approach is to prop up the banking system by using public funds to buy loans from banks for more than they are worth. The government would then--swiftly, with luck--dispose of the loans by selling some at a discount and writing others off. The managers who got banks into the mess would remain, with taxpayers paying the bill. The risks of moral hazard would abound; but at least banks would be free to lend again.
The second, crunchier approach is to lay down tight rules for evaluating loans, and insist on realistic provisioning for them. That would entail the bankruptcy of many borrowers, particularly in construction and retailing, and big losses at banks. Some would go bust, and many more would need injections of public capital. Some banks would have to be nationalised and their managers kicked out. Once returned to health, they could be privatised again. Encouragingly, Mr Takenaka favours this more radical approach.
Without careful government co-ordination, though, any such action could be positively dangerous. If widespread bankruptcies tipped millions out of work, that would exacerbate the deflation that has, since the mid-1990s, done so much to compound the banks' problems. The same deflation, if left untended, will guarantee that, even if banks became able to lend again, asset markets would still not function: nobody wants to borrow when deflation depresses revenues and increases the real debt burden year after year.
That is why reflation by the Bank of Japan is needed more urgently than ever. Yet Mr Hayami appears to be the only central banker who seems to deny authority over monetary policy. Getting Mr Yanagisawa's head might just have confirmed his belief that the roots of deflation lie anywhere but in monetary policy. The best measure now of the prospects for clearing up the mess in the banking system would be evidence of genuine reflation (notably through buying in government bonds) by the Bank of Japan.","The chances of a resolution to Japan 's bad debts have improved .

IS THIS the start of genuine reform, or a bad-dream repeat of 1998-99, when hopes were also raised only to be dashed? The prime minister's dismissal on September 30th of Hakuo Yanagisawa, the minister who was supposed to be sorting out Japan's rotten banks, surprised many. The move, the main feature of Junichiro Koizumi's first cabinet reshuffle since he took office last year, seems to offer a chance to speed up bank reform.
The new man, Heizo Takenaka, an academic who adds the financial-affairs post to his existing job of economy minister, has long been critical of his predecessor, insisting that the banks were in worse shape than Mr Yanagisawa claimed, and in need of more drastic reform. To that end, he suggests, unlike Mr Yanagisawa, that he is willing to use public funds to help banks offload their bad loans, which may amount to as much as yen150 trillion ($1.2 trillion). Presumably, some banks would also temporarily be nationalised. Ironically, that is pretty much what Mr Yanagisawa did during a first stint as financial-affairs minister: in 1998 he won praise for overseeing the nationalisation of two big banks and injecting public money into another 16. Four years on, though, the banks are in worse shape than ever.
How can Mr Takenaka avoid the same fate, while helping Mr Koizumi to deliver on his new promise to make banks healthy by March 2005? Two paths for bank reform are under discussion. The first is to strengthen the Resolution and Collection Corporation (RCC), the state's loan-collection agency, as a way to provide a backdoor injection of public money. Proponents hope that getting the RCC to make more attractive bids for bad assets, through some sort of loss-sharing scheme between taxpayers and banks, will speed up the disposal of bad loans.
The second, more transparent approach requires regulators to use stricter rules to reclassify banks' non-performing loans. This will almost certainly reveal that banks are badly under-provisioned--and under-capitalised--and in need of public funds to fill the holes. 
Before his appointment, Mr Takenaka was a loud critic of the first scheme, arguing that it would create considerable moral hazard. Banks would not be forced to change their ways, because they would not have to stop making fresh loans, or forgive old ones, for dud borrowers. That the new minister also wants first to figure out how weak the banks actually are suggests he will prefer the second approach.
He faces battles ahead. Morgan Stanley's chief economist in Japan, Robert Feldman, believes that banks need two or three times their current loan-loss reserves, or an extra yen25 trillion, to be adequately provisioned. Koyo Ozeki, a credit analyst at Merrill Lynch, puts the hole at closer to yen40 trillion-50 trillion.
Either way, banks will need a lot of public money. Deferred taxes, which will not materialise unless banks start making profits, make up about half of big banks' yen17 trillion of tier-one capital. On September 30th, banks had unrealised equity losses of about yen3 trillion-4 trillion. Subtract these and public funds that they must repay, and banks have little capital left. 
Admitting that banks need help is one thing; acting swiftly to restore confidence in them quite another. The prospect of funds being taken from the public purse could quickly push down government-bond prices, damaging banks' big bond portfolios. Stockmarkets might also fall, denting banks' equity holdings further. On October 2nd news that Takeshi Kimura, the head of KPMG Financial in Japan and a keen reformer, was being asked to serve on a special task-force on bank reform helped to send shares to fresh 19-year lows. The fear was of lots of bankruptcies in weak industries. 
That prospect, and the threat of rising unemployment, frightens politicians. For every non-performing loan, there is a non-performing borrower--many of whom are big supporters of politicians in the ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP). Yet Mr Takenaka will need political support to get reforms implemented.
Mr Takenaka, who has little experience with bureaucrats, is bound to face tussles with the Financial Services Agency (FSA) that he now heads. He will need its support to deal with the practical aspects of reform. Take public funds. According to the FSA, the government may no longer forcibly inject the yen15 trillion of emergency public funds now available into banks that are not yet insolvent. But a voluntary scheme is unlikely to work either, says Brian Waterhouse, a bank analyst at HSBC Securities in Tokyo. Banks do not want to be branded as weak. To force banks to accept tough conditions in return for money, Mr Takenaka would need to revise current laws, a process that is bound to be both complex and lengthy.
Temporarily nationalising even a handful of banks, and cleaning them up, would be no easier. Since banks lend, more-or-less, to the same borrowers, forcing dud companies into bankruptcy as part of a clean-up of bad loans would probably tip other banks into insolvency as well. This knock-on effect could mean that most of the big banks end up nationalised. 
This is probably what bank reform should actually entail. Yet there are doubts that Mr Koizumi and Mr Takenaka will be prepared to go that far. Even if they are, they may not be able to persuade politicians, bureaucrats and the public to support them. That Mr Takenaka is already considering delaying deposit-insurance reform has delighted the LDP's old guard.
If Mr Takenaka settles for half-measures, he will repeat the mistakes made in 1998-99. Only this time, warns Mr Ozeki, stockmarkets are lower, companies are weaker, public debt is bigger and the world economy is in worse shape. Not only might that mean a waste of more money; but things would also get much worse, quicker.
Caption: What's Takenaka going to pull out?","A new regulator , but will he wield a new broom ? 
 IS THIS the start of genuine reform , or a bad - dream repeat of 1998 - 99 , when hopes were also raised only to be dashed ? Junichiro Koizumi's dismissal on September 30th of Hakuo Yanagisawa , the minister who was supposed to be sorting out Japan 's rotten banks , surprised many . The move , the main feature of Junichiro Koizumi's first cabinet reshuffle since Junichiro Koizumi took office last year , seems to offer a chance to speed up bank reform . 
 The new man , Heizo Takenaka , an academic who adds the financial - affairs post to his existing job of economy minister , has long been critical of his predecessor , insisting that the banks were in worse shape than Mr Yanagisawa claimed , and in need of more drastic reform . To that end , he suggests , unlike Mr Yanagisawa , that he is willing to use public funds to help banks offload their bad loans , which may amount to as much as yen150 trillion ( $ 1.2 trillion ) . Presumably , some banks would also temporarily be nationalised . Ironically , that is pretty much what Mr Yanagisawa did during a first stint as financial - affairs minister : in 1998 he won praise for overseeing the nationalisation of two big banks and injecting public money into another 16 . Four years on , though , the banks are in worse shape than ever . 
 How can Mr Takenaka avoid the same fate , while helping Junichiro Koizumi to deliver on Junichiro Koizumi's new promise to make banks healthy by March 2005 ? Two paths for bank reform are under discussion . The first is to strengthen the Resolution and Collection Corporation ( RCC ) , the state 's loan - collection agency , as a way to provide a backdoor injection of public money . Proponents hope that getting the RCC to make more attractive bids for bad assets , through some sort of loss - sharing scheme between taxpayers and banks , will speed up the disposal of bad loans . 
 The second , more transparent approach requires regulators to use stricter rules to reclassify banks ' non - performing loans . This will almost certainly reveal that banks are badly under - provisioned -- and under - capitalised -- and in need of public funds to fill the holes . 
 Before his appointment , Mr Takenaka was a loud critic of the first scheme , arguing that it would create considerable moral hazard . Banks would not be forced to change their ways , because they would not have to stop making fresh loans , or forgive old ones , for dud borrowers . That the new minister also wants first to figure out how weak the banks actually are suggests he will prefer the second approach . 
 He faces battles ahead . Morgan Stanley 's chief economist in Japan , Robert Feldman , believes that banks need two or three times their current loan - loss reserves , or an extra yen25 trillion , to be adequately provisioned . Koyo Ozeki , a credit analyst at Merrill Lynch , puts the hole at closer to yen40 trillion-50 trillion . 
 Either way , banks will need a lot of public money . Deferred taxes , which will not materialise unless banks start making profits , make up about half of big banks ' yen17 trillion of tier - one capital . On September 30th , banks had unrealised equity losses of about yen3 trillion-4 trillion . Subtract these and public funds that they must repay , and banks have little capital left . 
 Admitting that banks need help is one thing ; acting swiftly to restore confidence in them quite another . The prospect of funds being taken from the public purse could quickly push down government - bond prices , damaging banks ' big bond portfolios . Stockmarkets might also fall , denting banks ' equity holdings further . On October 2nd news that Takeshi Kimura , the head of KPMG Financial in Japan and a keen reformer , was being asked to serve on a special task - force on bank reform helped to send shares to fresh 19 - year lows . The fear was of lots of bankruptcies in weak industries . 
 That prospect , and the threat of rising unemployment , frightens politicians . For every non - performing loan , there is a non - performing borrower -- many of whom are big supporters of politicians in the ruling Liberal Democratic party ( LDP ) . Yet Mr Takenaka will need political support to get reforms implemented . 
 Mr Takenaka , who has little experience with bureaucrats , is bound to face tussles with the Financial Services Agency ( FSA ) that he now heads . He will need its support to deal with the practical aspects of reform . Take public funds . According to the FSA , the government may no longer forcibly inject the yen15 trillion of emergency public funds now available into banks that are not yet insolvent .

North Korea is miffed at being kept on America's list of evil-doers.

Any hopes that the resumption of ministerial contacts with South Korea and talk of eventual Japanese aid and diplomatic relations in the wake of Mr Koizumi's surprise visit to Pyongyang last month might soften America's demands were dashed. North Korea was this week lambasting America's ""unilateral hardline policy""--a clear attempt to drive wedges between America and its two best allies in the region. 
But Mr Kelly also had other audiences, one of them watching sceptically from home. Though no date for more talks was agreed, he insists the administration is committed to dialogue with the North. But he could offer little more than a list of America's known demands because the administration is divided on where to go from here. Pressure on North Korea to cut back its troops, for example, could add to pressure for America to trim its Korea-based forces too.
Similarly, some senior American officials think America should reconsider a 1994 deal, which would provide North Korea with two western-designed nuclear-power reactors in return for a verified end to its suspected plutonium production. Mr Koizumi had returned from his trip to Pyongyang with a promise that North Korea would keep to its side of the bargain, yet the International Atomic Energy Agency, whose job it would be to check that no secret bomb-building had been going on, has not heard a peep out of the regime there. The deal's critics would anyway rather terminate it than see even civilian nuclear technology and expertise transferred to such a hostile regime.","An undiplomatic opening

SINCE September 30th, when he added control over bank reform to his duties as economics minister, Heizo Takenaka has spoken clearly about the root of Japan's economic mess. He has promised to produce quickly his plans to restructure bad loans, repair banks' balance sheets and inject some sense into the way the banks are run. In case any of this was obscure he commented in a magazine interview that no bank in Japan is ""too big to fail"". Sadly, that left confusion about other economic policies that might accompany a bank clean-up. What is going on?
Cleaning up bad loans risks dealing a hammer-blow to an economy that is already dormant and deflating. New figures show that machinery orders fell by a seasonally adjusted 13.6% in August, to a 15-year low. That is another sign that investment is sagging, and that the economy may be heading for another contraction. Such weakness makes it more crucial that any clean-up is backed by other economic policies--monetary, fiscal and structural--to keep confidence, consumption and capital spending from collapsing. 
Although there is no lack of ideas for economic reform, there is a dearth of plans to overcome vested interests. Even as Mr Takenaka and his prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, consider policies to coincide with bank reform, politicians in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) want spending and tax breaks without reform.
As parliament prepares for the start of its next session on October 18th, politicians are clamouring for another ""supplemental budget"", an annual ritual, to tide the economy over in the second half of the fiscal year, which ends in March. Mr Koizumi has equivocated as usual. The two worries are the public debt (140% of GDP) and his pledge to limit fresh borrowing to yen30 trillion ($250 billion) a year.
The prime minister and his new ""tsar"" must find a way to spend money that benefits the whole economy, not just the public-works lobby. That will help to offset the lay-offs and bankruptcies that are likely if the government gets tougher on bad loans. Since there will be stiff political resistance to a bank clean-up no matter what, Mr Koizumi and Mr Takenaka must make certain they win on this point before doling out any public-spending goodies. 
Then there is the central bank. Mr Takenaka hinted that he and his team needed to co-ordinate with the Bank of Japan, since rising prices would be more helpful than falling ones. But the central bank balked, and Mr Takenaka backed off. The Bank of Japan may--independently, of course--come to its senses and open the monetary floodgates. But don't bet on it: through Japan's long recession, the central bank has clung to its stingy ways as tightly as the LDP has to public-works spending. As an economic, not a political, tsar, Mr Takenaka will have to be a lot shrewder than he has been so far.","Can a convincing reform agreement emerge after the recent turmoil ?

THIS week the haggling dragged on at the United Nations Security Council over the precise terms under which Iraq should be told, one last time, to rid itself of its weapons of mass destruction. France and Russia have formed their own axis of awkwardness to delay an American-sponsored resolution, casting doubt on whether forceful action would ensue should Iraq refuse to comply. Meanwhile, though, another proliferation bombshell shows why a failure to deal with Iraq would not only destroy the council's credibility, but threaten the international peace and security it is meant to uphold. North Korea's admission, when presented by America with damning evidence, that it has been enriching uranium for a second illicit nuclear-weapons programme (the first used plutonium) is a chilling reminder of why the thorough frisking of Iraq, however it comes about, will come not a moment too soon.
Both Iraq and North Korea have long flagrantly violated their non-nuclear promises under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and have plenty of other nasty weapons too. One difference between them is that after its 1991 defeat in the Gulf war, Iraq's weapons programmes were partly dismantled by UN inspectors. Saddam Hussein has had four years since he turfed them out to rebuild much of his terrifying arsenal. But it is thought he still does not have a nuclear bomb. North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, has shown what can be done unfettered: he may already have one or two bombs and could quickly make several more.
Unlike Iraq, which insists it has no weapons to give up, North Korea says that it wants to negotiate with America about its latest bomb tinkering. America, too, is keen to find a diplomatic solution. President George Bush will this week meet China's president, Jiang Zemin, at his Texas ranch and then go on to an Asia-Pacific summit in Mexico to compare notes with South Korea's Kim Dae-jung and Japan's Junichiro Koizumi, his two closest allies in the region, and with Russian officials. None of these four countries, North Korea's neighbours, has an interest in leaving its unpredictable regime free to brandish a nuclear weapon. America will need help from all of them if North Korea is to be persuaded out of the weapons of mass destruction business. Can it be done? 
When inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency first fingered North Korea for secretly producing plutonium, America got no help in holding the regime there to its non-nuclear promises: the neighbours deemed even economic pressure too provocative. So in 1994 America was left to negotiate a deal that froze North Korea's plutonium production in return for two western-designed, less proliferation-prone nuclear-power reactors (paid for mostly by South Korea and Japan) and interim deliveries of oil. That capped a nuclear threat that would have grown; and for the reactors to be finished, North Korea would eventually have to come clean about its past nuclear dabbling. Yet putting off the day when it had to submit to proper inspections--Iraq foot-draggers, take note--gave it time to perfect its bombs and to build ever farther-flying missiles to mount them on. Whatever the risks in confronting North Korea in 1994, they are more daunting now. 
Pulling together
North Korea had long been suspected of wanting the economic benefits of the reactor deal, but not inspections. Time for these is now fast approaching. Provocative missile tests might have been tried as one America-trumping possibility; the alternative uranium route to a bomb was no doubt meant to be another. An angry North Korea now says the 1994 deal is ""nullified"". That may be another negotiating ploy. But if diplomatic push does come to undiplomatic shove, and either side walks away from the agreement entirely, North Korea could quickly get its hands on more plutonium in its own mothballed reactor-fuel rods to make more bombs. 
So it must be hoped that North Korea really is ready to trade in its uranium programme, its missile production and other threatening things for aid, trade and better relations. Such a comprehensive deal has been the aim of the Bush administration for more than a year. North Korea has already started to reform its economy, accepting that it needs help from South Korea, Japan and America, as well as China and others to survive.
Yet Kim Jong Il, like Saddam Hussein, is a serial shredder of promises. An essential component of any new deal would have to be intrusive inspections to ensure that it is kept. And if North Korea still refuses? The other essential component, if diplomacy is to work, is for America, South Korea, Japan and China all to deliver the same message: if aid and trade is to flow, North Korea's weapons of mass destruction must go, and verifiably.

IN A series of meetings with Asian leaders at the end of this week, George Bush will be trying to prevent a new security crisis from emerging on the Korean peninsula, following North Korea's admission that, in defiance of its promises, it has been secretly enriching uranium that can be used to make nuclear weapons. China's President Jiang Zemin, now on his farewell visit to America as head of state, will be a crucial interlocutor. But Mr Bush may find it hard to persuade him that the North's misbehaviour is as worrying as it looks. 
Mr Bush's summitry begins on Friday at his ranch in Crawford, Texas, where he is due to have a barbecue lunch (a highly-prized honour, according to the official Chinese media) with Mr Jiang, followed by an hour or so of discussions accompanied only by interpreters. On the following day, the two leaders will join 18 others in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, at an annual meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation forum. In the margins of this gathering, Mr Bush was also due to meet Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, South Korea's president, Kim Dae-jung, and Russian officials--all of whose support he needs in his efforts to resolve the North Korean problem without complicating his strategy for dealing with Iraq.
The importance America attaches to China's role was evident in the decision to make Beijing the first port of call when two senior State Department officials set off last week to consult other countries about the North Korean nuclear issue. China is probably the biggest supplier of aid to North Korea and describes itself as a close friend, despite a few recent spats.
The Chinese are now irritated with North Korea for having complicated what was supposed to be a friendly farewell visit by Mr Jiang to America before his semi-retirement next month. The last thing Mr Jiang wanted was a trip overshadowed by accusations that Chinese technology may have helped the North Korean programme (even though most of the equipment is thought to have come from Pakistan). In an effort to prove they are no longer part of the proliferation problem, China has issued a series of regulations since August tightening restrictions on the export of technologies that could help make weapons of mass destruction.
China, said its foreign ministry spokesman this week, ""consistently supports the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula."" Still, Chinese officials appear less concerned than the Americans are about the possibility that North Korea's nuclear programme could have produced a deliverable nuclear weapon. As the Chinese see it, the real threat emanating from North Korea is a political collapse that could damage stability in the region and prompt American forces to move close to China's border to fill the vacuum. Should Mr Bush call for economic pressure on North Korea, he is unlikely to find China receptive. 
Some experts believe that by admitting to having a uranium programme, North Korea may be trying to engage a standoffish America rather than threatening it. ""North Korea is not in a position to threaten the United States. It's also not in a mood to do so,"" says Jia Qingguo of Beijing University, who sees the confession as an act of contrition similar to its admission to Mr Koizumi in September that North Korea had abducted Japanese citizens. 
Certainly China seems unprepared to condemn its old friend openly for undermining an accord reached in 1994 between the United States and North Korea. This pact, known as the Framework Agreement, required North Korea to abandon its graphite-moderated nuclear reactor programme, based at Yongbyon. A by-product of this type of reactor is plutonium which, like enriched uranium, can be used to make nuclear weapons. In exchange, an American-led consortium would help the North Koreans build two light-water reactors, whose waste is more difficult (though not impossible) to convert into weapons-grade material. Work on the first of these began in August at Kumho.
The Americans appear not to have decided yet what to do with the agreement, which also required North Korea to come clean about its past plutonium work before the nuclear components of the reactors are in place, and to uphold an earlier accord with South Korea banning the enrichment of uranium. Presented with the evidence of their uranium enrichment, North Korean officials reportedly told the Americans that they consider the 1994 reactor deal ""nullified"". But for their part, the Chinese do not want it scrapped. They believe the accord has been effective in cutting off a ready supply of plutonium. 
South Korea has sent a clear signal that it wants the problem to be resolved through dialogue. In an agreement reached in Pyongyang on Wednesday between senior officials from the two Koreas, it was agreed that the two sides would ""actively pursue dialogue"" to resolve the nuclear issue--though the South has not yet persuaded the North to scrap its uranium enrichment programme. President Kim Dae-jung, the architect of South Korea's ""sunshine policy"" towards North Korea, would be unlikely to agree readily to any threat of sanctions or want to see America cut off the 500,000 tons of heavy fuel oil that it has been expected to provide every year under the 1994 agreement until the first of the new reactors is built. A shipment of this oil went ahead last week, without being blocked. But South Korea's policy toward the North may change after presidential elections in December in which a conservative candidate, Lee Hoi-chang, is favourite to win. 
For much of the past decade, North Korea's neighbours have lived with the possibility that some of the country's plutonium might have been turned into bombs. Yet they have generally tried to improve ties with North Korea rather than isolate it. During his meetings with Asian leaders, Mr Bush is likely to find little appetite for confrontation. Yet South Korea and Japan also know they cannot get far in their own relations with North Korea without America's backing, and Mr Bush will be looking for their diplomatic support in persuading North Korea that further aid and investment will not be forthcoming if it continues to cheat on its agreements.","America , China , Japan and South Korea all need to work together to persuade North Korea to scrap its nuclear weapons programme 
 IN A series of meetings with Asian leaders at the end of this week , George Bush will be trying to prevent a new security crisis from emerging on the Korean peninsula , following North Korea 's admission that , in defiance of its promises , it has been secretly enriching uranium that can be used to make nuclear weapons . China 's President Jiang Zemin , now on his farewell visit to America as head of state , will be a crucial interlocutor . But Mr Bush may find it hard to persuade him that the North 's misbehaviour is as worrying as it looks . 
 Mr Bush 's summitry begins on Friday at his ranch in Crawford , Texas , where he is due to have a barbecue lunch ( a highly - prized honour , according to the official Chinese media ) with Mr Jiang , followed by an hour or so of discussions accompanied only by interpreters . On the following day , the two leaders will join 18 others in Cabo San Lucas , Mexico , at an annual meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Co - operation forum . In the margins of this gathering , Mr Bush was also due to meet Junichiro Koizumi's , South Korea 's president , Kim Dae - jung , and Russian officials -- all of whose support he needs in his efforts to resolve the North Korean problem without complicating his strategy for dealing with Iraq . 
 The importance America attaches to China 's role was evident in the decision to make Beijing the first port of call when two senior State Department officials set off last week to consult other countries about the North Korean nuclear issue . China is probably the biggest supplier of aid to North Korea and describes itself as a close friend , despite a few recent spats . 
 The Chinese are now irritated with North Korea for having complicated what was supposed to be a friendly farewell visit by Mr Jiang to America before his semi - retirement next month . The last thing Mr Jiang wanted was a trip overshadowed by accusations that Chinese technology may have helped the North Korean programme ( even though most of the equipment is thought to have come from Pakistan ) . In an effort to prove they are no longer part of the proliferation problem , China has issued a series of regulations since August tightening restrictions on the export of technologies that could help make weapons of mass destruction . 
 China , said its foreign ministry spokesman this week , "" consistently supports the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula . "" Still , Chinese officials appear less concerned than the Americans are about the possibility that North Korea 's nuclear programme could have produced a deliverable nuclear weapon . As the Chinese see it , the real threat emanating from North Korea is a political collapse that could damage stability in the region and prompt American forces to move close to China 's border to fill the vacuum . Should Mr Bush call for economic pressure on North Korea , he is unlikely to find China receptive . 
 Some experts believe that by admitting to having a uranium programme , North Korea may be trying to engage a standoffish America rather than threatening it . "" North Korea is not in a position to threaten the United States . It 's also not in a mood to do so , "" says Jia Qingguo of Beijing University , who sees the confession as an act of contrition similar to its admission to Junichiro Koizumi in September that North Korea had abducted Japanese citizens . 
 Certainly China seems unprepared to condemn its old friend openly for undermining an accord reached in 1994 between the United States and North Korea . This pact , known as the Framework Agreement , required North Korea to abandon its graphite - moderated nuclear reactor programme , based at Yongbyon . A by - product of this type of reactor is plutonium which , like enriched uranium , can be used to make nuclear weapons . In exchange , an American - led consortium would help the North Koreans build two light - water reactors , whose waste is more difficult ( though not impossible ) to convert into weapons - grade material . Work on the first of these began in August at Kumho . 
 The Americans appear not to have decided yet what to do with the agreement , which also required North Korea to come clean about its past plutonium work before the nuclear components of the reactors are in place , and to uphold an earlier accord with South Korea banning the enrichment of uranium . Presented with the evidence of their uranium enrichment , North Korean officials reportedly told the Americans that they consider the 1994 reactor deal "" nullified "" . But for their part , the Chinese do not want it scrapped . They believe the accord has been effective in cutting off a ready supply of plutonium . 
 South Korea has sent a clear signal that it wants the problem to be resolved through dialogue . In an agreement reached in Pyongyang on Wednesday between senior officials from the two Koreas , it was agreed that the two sides would "" actively pursue dialogue "" to resolve the nuclear issue -- though the South has not yet persuaded the North to scrap its uranium enrichment programme . President Kim Dae - jung , the architect of South Korea 's "" sunshine policy "" towards North Korea , would be unlikely to agree readily to any threat of sanctions or want to see America cut off the 500,000 tons of heavy fuel oil that it has been expected to provide every year under the 1994 agreement until the first of the new reactors is built . A shipment of this oil went ahead last week , without being blocked . But South Korea 's policy toward the North may change after presidential elections in December in which a conservative candidate , Lee Hoi - chang , is favourite to win . 
 For much of the past decade , North Korea 's neighbours have lived with the possibility that some of the country 's plutonium might have been turned into bombs .

BEFORE the nuclear news broke, Japan and North Korea seemed to be on the way to a reconciliation. Last month Junichiro Koizumi made a visit to Pyongyang, the first by a Japanese prime minister. While he was there, Kim Jong Il confessed that his regime had abducted many Japanese over the years, and that only five of them were still alive a quarter-century later. The two then signed a joint declaration in which Japan apologised for ""the huge damage and sufferings"" it had inflicted on Koreans during its colonial occupation, and which expressed the two governments' desire to work towards normal diplomatic relations. But last week, while they were preparing to hold talks (which will start in Kuala Lumpur on October 29th), the Japanese public learned of North Korea's latest nuclear shenanigans. As Mr Kim's team prepares to sit down with Japan's government, it should now expect 123m uninvited guests.
The Japanese public's awakening has come gradually, spurred by occasional jolts such as the latest nuclear revelations. North Korea's missile programme, for example, went largely unnoticed by laymen until four years ago, when Mr Kim's regime decided to launch a rocket unannounced over Japan. By last December, when a North Korean spy ship sank with Japan's coastguard in pursuit, ordinary Japanese were paying closer attention. 
Even before Mr Koizumi announced his trip to Pyongyang, 64% of Japanese were telling pollsters that they dislike North Korea. That compares with only 28% or so for Russia (respondents to the poll could name as many unlovable countries as they wished), and only 15-21% who dislike China, which many Japanese assume is about to devour their economy. Just because they fear and dislike their neighbour does not mean that Japanese would prefer to stay hostile indefinitely. But it serves as a warning to Japan's leaders not to get too far out in front of their voters.
Mr Koizumi's trip gave him an immediate boost in the polls; but soon afterwards, as the fate of some of the abductees became known, 76% of Japanese were saying that Japan should be in no hurry to normalise relations, and should ""negotiate in a tenacious manner"". They are unlikely to have been better pleased, in the only country to have been bombed with atomic weapons, by news that Mr Kim is still toying with nukes. An unseemly struggle over the future of the surviving abductees has also developed.
Besides their outlook on North Korea, Japanese attitudes towards any talks will also be coloured by a growing distrust of their own officials. In the past year alone they have heard tales of incessant corruption and insubordination in the foreign ministry, learned how a politician manipulated foreign policy for profit, and watched a newsreel which showed officials in their Chinese consulate allowing Chinese police to haul off would-be defectors from what they know is a vile North Korean regime. Since they now distrust both sides at the negotiating table, ordinary Japanese and their media would look askance at any agreement that does not ensure their safety.","The Japanese public will not take kindly to cosying up to the North

THE Liberal Democratic Party, the head of Japan's ruling coalition, has been reeling this year from scandals that forced some of its most prominent members of parliament to resign. Partly as a result, voters turned against LDP-backed candidates in several local contests earlier this year, electing or nearly electing outsiders as mayors and governors. These upstarts tapped into voters' disgust by running without party ties or as members of the small but independent-minded Communists. Yet as Japan prepares for a series of parliamentary by-elections on October 27th, the ruling coalition has done little to clean up its act. 
Nowhere is this more evident than in Yamagata, a rural prefecture on the Japan Sea coast that lost one of its MPs, Koichi Kato, to financial scandals this year. Mr Kato was the head of an LDP faction before he resigned his seat after one of his aides was involved in a tax evasion case and there were accusations of misused political funds. In the contest to replace him as MP for Yamagata's fourth district, a feud has developed between a group of local LDP members and the national party. 
This battle makes it especially hard to gauge an election already marked by splits within the LDP leadership. One such became public when the prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, shuffled his cabinet on September 30th. He angered LDP officials by refusing their advice on appointments. On October 22nd the man he had named as the new bank regulator, Heizo Takenaka, duly ran into LDP opposition over his ideas for dealing with bad loans, and had to delay publication of his blueprint. 
Such confusion partly explains why Mr Koizumi's rebounding popularity has not given the LDP a clear edge in polls predicting the result of the seven coming by-elections. According to Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's biggest daily, the prime minister himself is well supported in all the districts where the by-elections are taking place, with approval ratings of 53-65%. Yet in a number of these districts the LDP's candidates are not doing nearly so well.
In Yamagata's fourth district, only 30% of Mr Koizumi's supporters say they will back the LDP's new candidate, Takayoshi Sagae. He is a 57-year-old lawyer in Tokyo, specialising in intellectual property. He ran as a candidate in Yamagata for the now-defunct New Frontier Party in 1996, and for the Democratic Party in 2000. Both times he lost heavily to the LDP's Mr Kato. Unfortunately for Mr Sagae, it appears that attacks he made on the LDP when he was a Democratic Party candidate are now being held against him. 
Critics of Mr Sagae in the local LDP caucus are mainly supporters of Mr Kato. They are hoping Mr Kato will eventually stand again for parliament, and think that Mr Sagae is getting in the way. Having toured the district making apologies for the financial scandals he has been linked to, Mr Kato is now lying low. ""We don't care much about who will win this election,"" says a local prominent supporter of Mr Kato, ""because we are already focusing on the next.""","Seven by - elections pose a problem for Junichiro Koizumi

FRESH attempts to sort out Japan's rotten banks were never going to be easy. Still, few expected that Heizo Takenaka, the new financial-affairs minister, would stumble so quickly. Just three weeks after taking on the job of overseeing the banks, and before he could even lay out his reform plan, Mr Takenaka was in trouble. His intention to propose broad measures on October 22nd for cleaning up the banks was stymied at the last minute by angry politicians in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). They said that his proposals, which included better provisions against dud loans and tighter restrictions on bank capital, were too harsh.
The prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, rushed to his minister's defence the following day, demanding--and getting--his cabinet's full support for Mr Takenaka. Mr Koizumi nonetheless faces battles with his party and his coalition partners. They do not like the idea of bankruptcies among banks and dud borrowers, a big source of political support. Politicians blame Mr Takenaka for rattling stockmarkets, which have fallen by over 10% since his appointment, to fresh 19-year lows. They are bitter that Mr Takenaka, a mere academic, has promised drastic reform without considering its political consequences. They also resent the private-sector folk that Mr Takenaka has chosen as his advisers.
Mr Takenaka, in fact, faces resistance from all sides. Not only do opposition parties in parliament want to censure him. People inside the Financial Services Agency, which he heads, are also trying to soften his reform proposals. The Ministry of Finance is steering clear of the whole furore, perhaps waiting for a chance to take control of the banking agenda. Even some parts of the prime minister's office are said to be working against Mr Takenaka. His proposals, after all, will greatly weaken the banks, presumably to the point where they would need injections of public money.
Critics are irritated that fresh measures to boost demand and offer better unemployment benefits and retraining have yet to materialise, even though serious bank reform would entail sweeping job losses. The government is due to announce yet another anti-deflation package, though few believe it will be any more potent than earlier ones. So far, Mr Koizumi is resisting calls for another supplementary budget to prop up the weakened economy. 
Others argue, with no great difficulty, that the government's policies lack coherence. Even as the government was promising to get tough on banks and their borrowers, the Development Bank of Japan, owned by the government, was pumping yet more money into Daiei, a retailer that has come to symbolise all that is awful about those companies to whom the banks have lent.
Other bits of Mr Takenaka's reforms are also under attack. One proposal aims to introduce stricter rules to cap the amount of deferred-tax assets banks may include as tier-one capital--currently deferred tax makes up about half of such capital at big banks. Imposing a cap would send many banks' capital-adequacy ratios below the 8% level that international rules require. That would make it easier for the government to step in and inject public money into the banks. But it has raised howls from bank executives who fear that, with public money injected, they may be forced to take responsibility and resign.
Critics warn this all risks causing a severe credit crunch, as banks start reducing risk assets to raise their capital-adequacy ratios. Banks may start shrinking their loan portfolios radically as the implementation of the cap draws near, warns David Atkinson, bank analyst at Goldman Sachs. Other proposals, say to tighten provisioning requirements, lack key details.
In sum, says Eisuke Sakakibara, a professor at Keio University and former heavyweight at the finance ministry, Mr Takenaka's measures do not constitute real reform, because they fail to address the basic problem of banks' non-performing loans or their non-performing borrowers. The minister, says Mr Sakakibara, is a political amateur attempting to force through half-measures. With so many people against him, the main question seems to be by how much more Mr Takenaka's reforms will be watered down before they are acceptable.

NO ONE relishes the prospect of a nuclear-armed North Korea. But no one has worked out what to do about the prospect. On October 30th, Japanese diplomats emerged from their first proper talks with the North Koreans for two years to say they had asked them to scrap a nuclear weapons programme they owned up to last month in talks with America--but were turned down flat.
After their meeting at an Asia-Pacific summit in Mexico at the weekend, America's president, George Bush, Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, and South Korea's president, Kim Dae-jung, all called on North Korea to ""dismantle this programme in a prompt and verifiable manner"". North Korea's counter-demand is that America sign a treaty of non-aggression. Only then, said North Korea, somewhat vaguely, would it ""be ready to clear the United States of its security concerns.""
North Korea knows that the weekend's publicly united front between America, Japan and South Korea barely conceals real tensions. South Korea's Mr Kim, with only a few months left in office, is desperate to pursue his ""sunshine"" policy with the lately less recalcitrant North Korea. Some of his officials have even cast doubt on America's version of what the North Koreans said in admitting to a previously hidden uranium-enrichment programme. The Japanese, for their part, want to press North Korea on the fate of some of the Japanese it now admits to kidnapping over the years, and to let the survivors and their children settle in Japan. However, Mr Koizumi has been firmer than Mr Kim in saying that relations with North Korea cannot be normalised and aid cannot flow until the nuclear issue is cleared up. 
But a more pressing problem is what to do about a 1994 deal that until now has frozen North Korea's production of plutonium, from which bombs can also be made. After inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) had accused North Korea of illicit plutonium dabbling, America got no help from South Korea and Japan in confronting the regime. Instead America was left to negotiate a ""framework agreement"" that in return for the plutonium freeze offered North Korea two western-designed, less proliferation-prone power reactors (mostly paid for by South Korea and Japan) and interim supplies of oil (mostly paid for by America). The two reactors are now under construction. But for how much longer?
By secretly enriching uranium, North Korea has broken a denuclearisation agreement with South Korea and offended against the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the IAEA's safeguards, and in doing all these things has breached the 1994 agreement too. While some opponents of the deal have long argued that it should be torn up, the Bush administration is still allowing the oil to flow. Sensible enough, while it consults its allies about how best to wean North Korea from its nuclear ambitions. But Congress is unlikely to vote more oil money without some nuclear give from North Korea.
Yet if America walks away from the 1994 deal by halting oil supplies, North Korea not only gets to keep its uranium, it also gets its hands on its ""frozen"" plutonium too. It thinks it has America over a barrel--and no doubt hopes it can still pick up aid from South Korea, if not Japan. Mr Bush has said he wants a negotiated outcome. But it is going to be tough keeping on speaking terms with everyone.

HIROKO MIZUSHIMA broke into national politics two years ago after the opposition Democrat Party held a contest to find promising parliamentary candidates. Ms Mizushima, who was then a psychiatrist at Keio University hospital, wrote an essay about the need for change in Japan, with an emphasis on making life better for women. After impressing party members in face-to-face interviews, Ms Mizushima was chosen to stand for a seat in the Diet (parliament), and won. Lately, 34-year-old Ms Mizushima has been vetting candidates herself, seeking those who might improve the Democrats' sorry standing at the polls.
She has something that appears to be lacking among her fellow Democrats: a will to win. Her determination helped to give the Democrats their only victory on October 27th, when seven by-elections were held. The party's most promising candidate for a seat in Yamagata prefecture, Jun Saito, was under pressure from his family not to run. Ms Mizushima had a chat with Mr Saito's wife, who was pregnant, and persuaded her to back her husband. The Democrats were spared a humiliating shut-out at the polls. The ruling Liberal Democrat Party (LDP) won five seats, in a much-needed fillip for the prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi; an independent took the other.
Heartfelt appeals to spouses, however, are hardly Ms Mizushima's main or only strength. The success of her campaign two years ago was due to her strategy of wooing a wide range of voters, not only women. A young female candidate, she reckoned, risked alienating older male voters in her rural district with a direct approach. Instead, she took her campaign to the leaders of unions and other social groups. In the end, she won equal support from male and female voters.
The notion that candidates should seek votes beyond the party's core supporters is rare in Democratic circles. When Ms Mizushima interviews potential male candidates, she gets them to talk about the good things they plan to do for Japanese women. Her favourite question for female candidates is more blunt: How will you get middle-aged men to vote for you? 
Ms Mizushima is trying to persuade the party's leaders that they need to do more to publicise the Democrats' policies, many of which favour women. The Democrats want a single, standard tax exemption for married couples, to replace an existing regime that dissuades many women from working full-time. The party also wants to reform pensions, to give women a greater sense of independence. Despite all this, polls by Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's biggest daily, show that only half as many women as men back the Democrats. 
One problem, says Katsuya Okada, who until recently headed the Democrats' policy committee, is that policies which appeal to career women tend to alienate those who stay at home. But Ms Mizushima argues that Japanese women do not fit into a simple dichotomy between serious professionals and traditional housewives. Women in rural districts such as hers have far more varied concerns than the party's leaders seem to grasp. Internal party polls taken earlier this year, which show that women of many backgrounds are unenthusiastic about the Democrats, seem to back her up. 
So what should the Democrats do to win more seats? Ms Mizushima concedes that the party has to offer a compelling economic platform that will appeal to voters in general. But she is also urging her party to devote more energy to issues that appeal to specific groups of women. In pushing her ideas, Ms Mizushima has a big advantage. She knows how to win.

2002-10-26,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224041934/fulltext/5669514E5B584DDBPQ/63?accountid=14657,"Japan's occasional attempts at economic reform are a gruesome sight. This week's is no exception
FOR over a decade, Japan's distressed economy has stumbled from one brief upturn to another. After taking over as prime minister in April 2001, Junichiro Koizumi inspired hope that the stumbling would stop. The tough-talking politician promised that he would be firm with drowning banks and bloated public corporations. Painful structural reforms are the only sensible way to restore strong and lasting growth, he proclaimed. And then he stalled for 18 months. 
Recently, however, he had rekindled hopes that Japan was finally about to tackle its problems head on. Then this week he dashed them again, with what could be his most dangerous disappointment to date. On October 30th, Mr Koizumi and Heizo Takenaka, his minister for economic and fiscal policy, celebrated Halloween a day early by wrapping yet another flimsy financial package in a costume that they labelled ""reform"". 
Something far more substantial had been expected. Only a month earlier, the prime minister had reaffirmed that his government would resolve the banks' big bad-debt problem--which lies at the heart of the economy's woes--by early 2005. And he put Mr Takenaka, an academic, at the head of the Financial Services Agency (which regulates the banks). He seemed a promising choice to replace Hakuo Yanagisawa, who had done little but drag his feet as the nation's top bank regulator.
Hope deferred
As often as they have been disappointed by Japan's inability to keep its promises, onlookers nevertheless find it hard to ignore such loud talk of reform in what is still the world's second-biggest economy, and one of America's most important allies. North Korea's recent admission that it is toying with nuclear weapons serves as a reminder that Japan is still a crucial ally in volatile East Asia. 
With deflation looming over Germany and the United States, there was even wider interest than usual in this particular promise of economic reform. This was partly because Japan's past mistakes could hold lessons for policymakers in deflationary environments elsewhere. But it was also because what was flagged as the best chance of Japanese reform in years raised hopes that it might counter persistent weakness in the world's other big economies, as well as in Japan itself. 
Hope faded, however, as Mr Takenaka was seen to be running into fierce opposition from the bankers, bureaucrats and politicians who invariably conspire to resist reform in Japan. Last week, politicians in Mr Koizumi's Liberal Democratic Party consigned Mr Takenaka's initial bad-debt plan to the cemetery, before he even had a chance to announce it. Disappointment pushed down the value of the yen against the dollar to a four-month low. 
Not only was his plan unfair to Japan's bankers, argued the politicians, but it would bury the zombie companies (in such sectors as retailing and construction) that continue to haunt both the banks' balance sheets and their healthy competitors. It is these companies that bankroll the conservative politicians who sit at the heart of Mr Koizumi's party.
Since laying some of the zombies to rest is one of the main points of reform, this was a worrying reversal. Mr Koizumi's response was to do his best impersonation of a ghost. For a full week his leadership was all but absent as Mr Takenaka was left to fend for himself. It was not surprising, therefore, that on October 30th the new bank regulator released a mere skeleton of his original ideas. 
Mr Koizumi insisted that his plan to solve the bad-debt problem was still on track. ""We will use various methods so that companies can focus on their business and the public can live comfortably during the two-and-a-half years while the non-performing loan problem is resolved,"" he said, sounding much like a man trying to avoid inflicting any pain. 
Although the plan contained the usual platitudes about changing the way in which banks evaluate the quality of their loan portfolios, Mr Takenaka surrendered on the main issue that was intended to give him leverage over the banks. Instead of relying heavily on bankers and bureaucrats to evaluate the loans, he had planned to move more quickly and authoritatively by tinkering with the other side of the banks' balance sheets. 
The idea was to change the rules by which banks calculate their capital--in particular, by limiting the amount of deferred tax that they can use for the purpose. If Mr Takenaka had succeeded in this, he might have been able to force under-capitalised banks to accept the more substantial changes that really matter. 
Of these, there are two, and debate rages over which is the more important. One is the cleaning up of the banks themselves. This means removing loans that will never be repaid from their balance sheets, injecting enough public money to allow those that stay in business to emerge in good health, and, ideally, ensuring that executives at the most mismanaged banks are replaced with people who know something about modern business. The other requirement of reform is that the weakest companies to which the banks have lent money--the zombies--be restructured, rehabilitated or put out of their misery. 
The land of the loophole
There was, in fact, some genuine cause for concern about Mr Takenaka's deferred-tax plan, not least that it risked penalising the few banks that have actually tried to clean up their mess. The minister's new plan, however, and the way in which he was bullied into it, leaves him and other would-be reformers with little hope that the current Japanese prime minister can carry their cause.
This grim conclusion makes it hard to get excited about the long list of other economic measures that were unveiled in the middle of the week. These included a fresh move by the central bank to loosen monetary policy a little further; some new ideas for taxes and spending; and the announcement that a new entity will be set up to help rehabilitate some borrowers once their loans have been taken off the banks' books. 
Kathy Matsui, the chief equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, had warned that the question would be whether government ""policy is used as a narcotic to hide the underlying disease"" or ""as anaesthesia to ease the pain of radical surgery"". This week there was no sign of a scalpel.
The basic concern about the package is that it will not lead to much fiscal expansion; it will probably not prod the Bank of Japan into a sufficiently bold monetary stimulus; it will not take the pressure off well-run companies; and it will not repair the broken banks. ""This kind of vaguely worded, lots of loopholes, watered-down programme is not much help,"" said Takahira Ogawa, the director of Asian sovereign ratings at Standard & Poor's, a credit-rating agency. 
Taking the problems with the package in reverse: Mr Takenaka's proposal to write off the banks' bad loans now relies on timetables and promises which the bankers and bureaucrats must follow--a proven Japanese formula for doing nothing. The government has already delayed plans to roll back deposit insurance, which were intended to come into effect next April as a way to impose market discipline on the banks' deposit-taking. So there is little reason to count on the delayed action that the government is now promising. 
As the past month of debate makes plain, there will be no support for dealing with bad loans when the economy is weak, which it is likely to remain for at least as long as the bad-loan problem is unresolved. Moreover, at no time is it ever permissible for a Japanese minister to suggest that this is the bankers' or the politicians' fault. Any solution to the banks' problems, therefore, must somehow be arrived at without reference to reality.
This go-slow approach may not, however, be the worst news to have emerged this week. The government's plans, still vague, to set up a new entity for rehabilitating troubled borrowers give considerable cause for alarm. The effect will be to ensure that, even as a trickle of bad loans are being written off by the banks, officials will be looking for ways to put fresh public money into companies that they deem worthy of propping up. 
There would be a case for giving limited credit to some firms if the government were indeed going to prod banks into rapid loan write-offs. This would be a way to cushion the blow on the economy of a severe shock to the financial system, and it could potentially lead to a more orderly closure of small firms. 
But since it is now unlikely that there will be any fresh loan write-offs, this plan simply provides another lifeline for firms that are already undercutting healthier rivals. In fairness, the government has bailed out plenty of unworthy firms in the past without needing such an entity. In October, for example, it announced yet another attempt to revive Daiei, a troubled retailer that has had more lives than a bewitched cat. So the incremental damage from this new bad idea might be limited. 
In a deflationary trap
Since bad loans and bad companies will continue to survive, the prospects for bolder monetary policy also grew gloomier this week. That may seem an odd claim, given that the Bank of Japan announced some measures to make money even looser. First, it will increase its purchases of Japanese government bonds by 20%, to yen1.2 trillion ($9.8 billion) a month. And the central bank will expand its ""quantitative easing"" by increasing its target for excess liquidity in the banking system by yen5 trillion, to a range of yen15 trillion-20 trillion.
The trouble with these moves is that, in Japan's current predicament, such narrow approaches to combating deflation do little good. Because the Bank of Japan was consistently behind the curve in easing monetary policy, the economy was already mired in a deflationary bog by the time interest rates hit zero. Consumer prices have been falling on an annual basis for three years now (see chart 2). Despite low inflation rates elsewhere, Japan is still the only rich economy where prices are actually falling. 
The only hope for reversing this would be for the country's central bank to announce a bold new initiative, with a specified inflation target to get prices rising and a willingness to buy whatever assets were necessary--from property to bonds to equity funds--in order to achieve it. 
Bank of Japan officials have always resisted such ideas. But when Mr Takenaka was put in charge of bank regulation, they began putting out clear signals of their willingness to do a deal. In September, the Bank of Japan announced that it would buy yen2 trillion-worth of shares from the banks' equity portfolios--not enough in itself to make much difference, but a symbolically important step. Now that Messrs Koizumi and Takenaka have failed to deliver, the bank may continue to announce looser money, but it is unlikely to take the more radical steps that Japan needs. 
Finally, with the Bank of Japan sticking to traditional monetary tools, with weak banks preventing those tools from doing any good, and with zombie companies still floundering about, any fiscal stimulus that Japan tries will have little effect--especially given the tired old tax-cut measures announced this week. 
Japan has spent lavishly on public works throughout the past decade, which has helped its gross public debt to reach 140% of GDP. Jesper Koll, chief economist for Merrill Lynch in Tokyo, reckons that the government would have to cut spending and raise taxes by a combined 8% of GDP every year just to stabilise its finances. 
The tendency to blanket the countryside with roads, dams and bridges is often cited as one of the main indictments of Japan's political system. Whether spending on more productive items would have made a difference is debatable; but the government has to some extent undermined its own spending efforts through ill-considered changes in tax policy. A decent recovery was under way in the late 1990s, for example. But it was snuffed out at least partly by a poorly-timed rise in consumption tax.
It is true that matters might have been worse without some of this spending, and that a determined fiscal push would indeed be a part of any sensible reform package. Nevertheless, if Japan does not deal with its monetary, financial and structural problems first, it is hard to imagine any fiscal push breaking the economy free of its deflationary trap. In a nutshell, argues Richard Jerram, chief economist at ING Barings in Tokyo, this week's package is ""unlikely to end deflation"".
Where next?
So what happens now to Japan's economy? Even if Messrs Koizumi and Takenaka had been tougher, genuine reform was always going to be a difficult fight. Japan's economic problems have grown progressively bigger and harder to solve through years of inaction. And two of the most worrying components of the slump--falling prices and zero interest rates--have the nasty political side-effect of making it easy, in the short term, to ignore the severity of the problem, even as they conspire to make it worse. 
Most Japanese households have, in reality, grown steadily worse off during the past decade. Government debts have mounted (increasing future taxes) and they have earned pitiful returns on their savings. Falling prices throughout the economy have, however, softened the impact of the long slump on their standards of living.
Moreover, with interest rates close to zero, even the most irredeemably indebted companies have been able to continue making payments on their loans, scraping the money together by cutting their workforces and forgoing investments. Those weak companies, in turn, undermine revenues at stronger companies and push more of them to the wall. Deflationary pressure also discourages healthier firms from investing, so few of them wish to borrow even at near-zero interest rates. With no strong borrowers to lend to, the banks find it even harder to earn profits with which to write off their bad loans.
To some extent, therefore, Japan's economy is trapped, as the symptoms of its long slide have become self-reinforcing. Unlike countries such as neighbouring South Korea, which responded to its crisis five years ago by promptly cleaning up its banks, Japan's massive trade surpluses and domestic savings allow it to continue to postpone action, even as it stores up trouble for the future. 
While onlookers in other wealthy countries ponder the prospect of deflation, it becomes clear that this sort of slow, inexorable slide is worth avoiding at almost any cost. Even if deflationary pressures elsewhere mount, however, Japan's twisted politics offer some comfort that America's and Europe's different ways of doing things can avert such a fate.
As this week's disappointment makes plain, Japan's policymakers are caught in a trap that is every bit as vicious as the economic one that has gripped the country. Although politicians in the Liberal Democratic Party are eager to spend money, tight and ineffective monetary policy has kept the fiscal stimulus from doing much good. 
Monetary policy, in turn, does not work as well as it should because the bad-debt mess makes banks hesitant to extend fresh loans. Yet efforts to clean up those bad debts are then thwarted by politicians in the LDP, men who would love to re-inflate the economy but who do not want to put weak borrowers out of business. And rather than pressing plans to solve the impasse, Japan's bureaucrats try to spin it to their advantage, so that they can gain an edge over rival ministries. 
When confronted with this dismal display, the politicians, bureaucrats and bankers all blame each other, and bystanders blame the lot of them. The only realistic way to change this is for someone in Japan to exercise some real leadership and get all of these groups working together. That is why Mr Koizumi's election 18 months ago, and the recent signs that he was reasserting himself, inspired such widespread hope.
For, despite the size of the problem, and the failure of isolated policies to reverse it, there is every reason to believe that a concerted effort involving co-ordinated policies could turn things around for Japan. Mr Koizumi has had a golden opportunity to do this during the past month. The Bank of Japan got things rolling by signalling its willingness to consider new ideas for monetary policy. After handing Mr Takenaka control of bank regulation, it became clear that he faced a simple ""either-or"" choice. Take the bad loans seriously, or ignore them.
In the end, despite a recent rebound in his popularity and some success for his party in by-elections held on October 27th, Mr Koizumi chose to revive the same half-measures that have persistently failed to help Japan's economy regain its high potential. It was a curious way to greet Halloween. The man who has spent the last 18 months disguised as a courageous leader finally took off his mask.","Japan 's occasional attempts at economic reform are a gruesome sight .

The other requirement of reform is that the weakest companies to which the banks have lent money -- the zombies -- be restructured , rehabilitated or put out of their misery . 
 The land of the loophole 
 There was , in fact , some genuine cause for concern about Mr Takenaka 's deferred - tax plan , not least that it risked penalising the few banks that have actually tried to clean up their mess . The minister 's new plan , however , and the way in which he was bullied into it , leaves him and other would - be reformers with little hope that the current Japanese prime minister can carry their cause . 
 This grim conclusion makes it hard to get excited about the long list of other economic measures that were unveiled in the middle of the week . These included a fresh move by the central bank to loosen monetary policy a little further ; some new ideas for taxes and spending ; and the announcement that a new entity will be set up to help rehabilitate some borrowers once their loans have been taken off the banks ' books . 
 Kathy Matsui , the chief equity strategist at Goldman Sachs , had warned that the question would be whether government "" policy is used as a narcotic to hide the underlying disease "" or "" as anaesthesia to ease the pain of radical surgery "" . This week there was no sign of a scalpel . 
 The basic concern about the package is that it will not lead to much fiscal expansion ; it will probably not prod the Bank of Japan into a sufficiently bold monetary stimulus ; it will not take the pressure off well - run companies ; and it will not repair the broken banks . "" This kind of vaguely worded , lots of loopholes , watered - down programme is not much help , "" said Takahira Ogawa , the director of Asian sovereign ratings at Standard & Poor 's , a credit - rating agency . 
 Taking the problems with the package in reverse : Mr Takenaka 's proposal to write off the banks ' bad loans now relies on timetables and promises which the bankers and bureaucrats must follow -- a proven Japanese formula for doing nothing . The government has already delayed plans to roll back deposit insurance , which were intended to come into effect next April as a way to impose market discipline on the banks ' deposit - taking . So there is little reason to count on the delayed action that the government is now promising . 
 As the past month of debate makes plain , there will be no support for dealing with bad loans when the economy is weak , which it is likely to remain for at least as long as the bad - loan problem is unresolved . Moreover , at no time is it ever permissible for a Japanese minister to suggest that this is the bankers ' or the politicians ' fault . Any solution to the banks ' problems , therefore , must somehow be arrived at without reference to reality . 
 This go - slow approach may not , however , be the worst news to have emerged this week . The government 's plans , still vague , to set up a new entity for rehabilitating troubled borrowers give considerable cause for alarm . The effect will be to ensure that , even as a trickle of bad loans are being written off by the banks , officials will be looking for ways to put fresh public money into companies that they deem worthy of propping up . 
 There would be a case for giving limited credit to some firms if the government were indeed going to prod banks into rapid loan write - offs . This would be a way to cushion the blow on the economy of a severe shock to the financial system , and it could potentially lead to a more orderly closure of small firms . 
 But since it is now unlikely that there will be any fresh loan write - offs , this plan simply provides another lifeline for firms that are already undercutting healthier rivals . In fairness , the government has bailed out plenty of unworthy firms in the past without needing such an entity . In October , for example , it announced yet another attempt to revive Daiei , a troubled retailer that has had more lives than a bewitched cat . So the incremental damage from this new bad idea might be limited . 
 In a deflationary trap 
 Since bad loans and bad companies will continue to survive , the prospects for bolder monetary policy also grew gloomier this week . That may seem an odd claim , given that the Bank of Japan announced some measures to make money even looser . First , it will increase its purchases of Japanese government bonds by 20 % , to yen1.2 trillion ( $ 9.8 billion ) a month . And the central bank will expand its "" quantitative easing "" by increasing its target for excess liquidity in the banking system by yen5 trillion , to a range of yen15 trillion-20 trillion . 
 The trouble with these moves is that , in Japan 's current predicament , such narrow approaches to combating deflation do little good . Because the Bank of Japan was consistently behind the curve in easing monetary policy , the economy was already mired in a deflationary bog by the time interest rates hit zero . Consumer prices have been falling on an annual basis for three years now ( see chart 2 ) . Despite low inflation rates elsewhere , Japan is still the only rich economy where prices are actually falling . 
 The only hope for reversing this would be for the country 's central bank to announce a bold new initiative , with a specified inflation target to get prices rising and a willingness to buy whatever assets were necessary -- from property to bonds to equity funds -- in order to achieve it . 
 Bank of Japan officials have always resisted such ideas . But when Mr Takenaka was put in charge of bank regulation , they began putting out clear signals of their willingness to do a deal . In September , the Bank of Japan announced that it would buy yen2 trillion - worth of shares from the banks ' equity portfolios -- not enough in itself to make much difference , but a symbolically important step . Now that Messrs Junichiro Koizumi and Takenaka have failed to deliver , the bank may continue to announce looser money , but it is unlikely to take the more radical steps that Japan needs . 
 Finally , with the Bank of Japan sticking to traditional monetary tools , with weak banks preventing those tools from doing any good , and with zombie companies still floundering about , any fiscal stimulus that Japan tries will have little effect -- especially given the tired old tax - cut measures announced this week . 
 Japan has spent lavishly on public works throughout the past decade , which has helped its gross public debt to reach 140 % of GDP . Jesper Koll , chief economist for Merrill Lynch in Tokyo , reckons that the government would have to cut spending and raise taxes by a combined 8 % of GDP every year just to stabilise its finances . 
 The tendency to blanket the countryside with roads , dams and bridges is often cited as one of the main indictments of Japan 's political system . Whether spending on more productive items would have made a difference is debatable ; but the government has to some extent undermined its own spending efforts through ill - considered changes in tax policy . A decent recovery was under way in the late 1990s , for example . But it was snuffed out at least partly by a poorly - timed rise in consumption tax . 
 It is true that matters might have been worse without some of this spending , and that a determined fiscal push would indeed be a part of any sensible reform package . Nevertheless , if Japan does not deal with its monetary , financial and structural problems first , it is hard to imagine any fiscal push breaking the economy free of its deflationary trap . In a nutshell , argues Richard Jerram , chief economist at ING Barings in Tokyo , this week 's package is "" unlikely to end deflation "" . 
 Where next ? 
 So what happens now to Japan 's economy ? Even if Messrs Junichiro Koizumi and Takenaka had been tougher , genuine reform was always going to be a difficult fight . Japan 's economic problems have grown progressively bigger and harder to solve through years of inaction . And two of the most worrying components of the slump -- falling prices and zero interest rates -- have the nasty political side - effect of making it easy , in the short term , to ignore the severity of the problem , even as they conspire to make it worse . 
 Most Japanese households have , in reality , grown steadily worse off during the past decade . Government debts have mounted ( increasing future taxes ) and they have earned pitiful returns on their savings . Falling prices throughout the economy have , however , softened the impact of the long slump on their standards of living . 
 Moreover , with interest rates close to zero , even the most irredeemably indebted companies have been able to continue making payments on their loans , scraping the money together by cutting their workforces and forgoing investments . Those weak companies , in turn , undermine revenues at stronger companies and push more of them to the wall . Deflationary pressure also discourages healthier firms from investing , so few of them wish to borrow even at near - zero interest rates . With no strong borrowers to lend to , the banks find it even harder to earn profits with which to write off their bad loans . 
 To some extent , therefore , Japan 's economy is trapped , as the symptoms of its long slide have become self - reinforcing . Unlike countries such as neighbouring South Korea , which responded to its crisis five years ago by promptly cleaning up its banks , Japan 's massive trade surpluses and domestic savings allow it to continue to postpone action , even as it stores up trouble for the future . 
 While onlookers in other wealthy countries ponder the prospect of deflation , it becomes clear that this sort of slow , inexorable slide is worth avoiding at almost any cost . Even if deflationary pressures elsewhere mount , however , Japan 's twisted politics offer some comfort that America 's and Europe 's different ways of doing things can avert such a fate . 
 As this week 's disappointment makes plain , Japan 's policymakers are caught in a trap that is every bit as vicious as the economic one that has gripped the country . Although politicians in the Liberal Democratic Party are eager to spend money , tight and ineffective monetary policy has kept the fiscal stimulus from doing much good . 
 Monetary policy , in turn , does not work as well as it should because the bad - debt mess makes banks hesitant to extend fresh loans . Yet efforts to clean up those bad debts are then thwarted by politicians in the LDP , men who would love to re - inflate the economy but who do not want to put weak borrowers out of business . And rather than pressing plans to solve the impasse , Japan 's bureaucrats try to spin it to their advantage , so that they can gain an edge over rival ministries . 
 When confronted with this dismal display , the politicians , bureaucrats and bankers all blame each other , and bystanders blame the lot of them . The only realistic way to change this is for someone in Japan to exercise some real leadership and get all of these groups working together . That is why Junichiro Koizumi's election 18 months ago , and the recent signs that Junichiro Koizumi was reasserting Junichiro Koizumi , inspired such widespread hope . 
 For , despite the size of the problem , and the failure of isolated policies to reverse it , there is every reason to believe that a concerted effort involving co - ordinated policies could turn things around for Japan . Junichiro Koizumi has had a golden opportunity to do this during the past month . The Bank of Japan got things rolling by signalling its willingness to consider new ideas for monetary policy . After handing Mr Takenaka control of bank regulation , it became clear that Junichiro Koizumi faced a simple "" either - or "" choice . Take the bad loans seriously , or ignore them . 
 In the end , despite a recent rebound in Junichiro Koizumi's popularity and some success for Junichiro Koizumi's party in by - elections held on October 27th , Junichiro Koizumi chose to revive the same half - measures that have persistently failed to help Japan 's economy regain its high potential . It was a curious way to greet Halloween . Junichiro Koizumi finally took off Junichiro Koizumi's mask .",740,Japan,A29-8209,IN TERM,True,prime minister,36,True

HOW bad is it? Judging by the political rhetoric and a recent slide in bank shares, Japan's economy risks another dive like the one it took in 2001. In reality, the short-term outlook for demand is not so alarming. Exports to America and elsewhere are slowing. Rather than tumbling, however, the economy seems to be settling comfortably into the state in which it has spent most of the past decade: flat on its back and half asleep.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which released its latest survey of Japan's economy on November 19th, is forecasting virtually flat growth--but no real recession--until after the end of 2004. That assessment may reassure some of Japan's leaders, who fear short-term pain above all. But it offers little solace to those, like the OECD itself, who worry about Japan's medium- and long-term problems and the steady erosion of its national finances. When it gave warning in its report that ""there is no more time to be wasted"", the OECD was calling for a much more thorough plan than the sorts of fiscal measures being debated this week by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).
Though he was still jostling with his fellow LDP members over the budget this week, Junichiro Koizumi, the prime minister, has already conceded that Japan will need to borrow more than the yen30 trillion ($250 billion) to which he had pledged himself. Tax shortfalls alone have made it hard to stay beneath the cap. This week, an additional yen3 trillion in public works and tax breaks was allocated to a planned supplementary budget. 
Along with Mr Koizumi's recent stumbles over bank reform, the slowing economy has strengthened the hand of the LDP traditionalists. Although GDP grew at an annualised 3% in the third quarter, exports stopped contributing to growth the way they had in the first half of the year. With demand from America and elsewhere likely to remain weak for at least the immediate future, that will leave Japan dependent on its feeble domestic economy. Since confidence is shot, business investment seems especially unlikely to help on the home front. The most reliable gauge of investment trends, reckons Richard Jerram, chief economist at ING Barings in Tokyo, is firms' machinery orders. These fell 1.7% (6.5%, annualised) in the third quarter. 
Regardless of what the party screws out of Mr Koizumi, however, another fiscal stimulus is unlikely to do much for the economy's bigger problems. Since the next fiscal year begins in April, the LDP and its coalition partners were pushing for a supplementary stimulus in the meantime of up to yen5 trillion (1% of GDP), not counting falling tax revenues. Mr Jerram points out, however, that even if the government spends yen1.5 trillion more than planned on public works, spending on such projects will still fall overall because of the cuts already enacted. 
As the OECD argues, however, a radically reflationary monetary policy, which the Bank of Japan still resists, would probably have more impact than fiscal measures. So even as he spars with his party over taxes and spending, Mr Koizumi's most important struggle--apart from minding those embattled banks--will be over whom to appoint as the central bank's next governor in March.","The export fillip behind it , Japan 's economy looks set for another snooze

WITH prices still falling and the economy on the brink of its fourth downturn in a decade, it is hard to summon up much optimism about Japan. Yet change creates opportunities, if nothing else, and a new boss is about to take over a crucial institution: the Bank of Japan. On March 19th Masaru Hayami's five-year term as the central bank's governor will end. In the next few weeks Junichiro Koizumi, the prime minister, is expected to name his replacement, along with two new deputy governors.
Mr Koizumi has said that he will pick somebody ""who will actively work to end deflation"", a task that many accuse the central bank of having taken far too lightly. Weary optimists are hoping that the prime minister means what he says and will appoint a determined deflation-fighter, that Japan's parliament will approve his choice, and that in 2003 Japan will finally start to climb out of its downward spiral.
Naturally this is easier said than done. Sceptics, including many within the Bank of Japan, argue that Japan's problems are structural, so that the bank can do little to combat deflation. They point out that, however lax it may have been in the years after the bubble burst, the Bank of Japan has been furiously pumping money into the economy for nearly two years now. With interest rates already at zero, it has done this through what it calls ""quantitative easing"". It has boosted the balances that banks hold at the central bank to nearly yen20 trillion ($167 billion) and is buying yen1.2 trillion a month of government bonds, more than 40% of new issues.
These actions have boosted the amount of ""base money""--currency plus demand deposits--sloshing around the system by 37% since March 2001 (see chart). Yet this has not translated into faster growth in broader forms of liquidity--such as time deposits and certificates of deposit--that reflect credit creation and higher demand. Companies, already deeply indebted, are reluctant to borrow when prices are falling. Banks, already laden with bad loans, are in no hurry to lend. The only way to change this, say many in the central bank, is to write off bad loans and pursue structural reforms.
The Bank of Japan's detractors argue that the central bank should be doing more. It could pump in still more liquidity, for example by buying an even bigger share of new government-bond issues and then gobbling up part of the much bigger pile of bonds already in circulation: private investors hold roughly yen300 trillion-worth. Moreover, say the central bank's critics, it could boost import prices, thus raising overall prices, by purchasing foreign bonds, in a determined effort to drive down the yen. 
Robert Feldman, chief economist at Morgan Stanley in Tokyo, sums up the impasse as a debate over ""whether the arteries are clogged, or the heart just isn't pumping hard enough."" Mr Koizumi says that he wants to end the stalemate, by combining bolder monetary policy to get the heart pumping with structural reforms to unclog the arteries. He promised just such a combined effort in a speech this week, saying that his government will work ""jointly with the Bank of Japan in order to rein in deflation by all policy means available."" But whereas his proposed structural reforms are a continuing battle, the appointment of a new governor will probably be a one-off chance to overhaul monetary policy. He will face several obstacles if he chooses to take it.
The first is finding candidates, for both the top job and the two deputies' seats, even though a bewildering array of names is being bandied about, from company heads to academics to central bankers past and present. Mr Koizumi likes to pick executives for government jobs and there is much to be said for an outsider; but few bosses have the technical skills needed. A professor might have intellectual clout and an outsider's freshness, but would lack political weight--as Mr Koizumi found after he made Heizo Takenaka his financial-affairs minister last year. The odd exception apart, few central bankers--or officials from its rival, the Ministry of Finance--seem keen on radical measures.
A second problem is that any attempt to redirect monetary policy may become bogged down in debates over technicalities or over the precise responsibilities of the central bank. In such a deep crisis, there would seem to be little harm in Mr Koizumi appointing somebody charged, explicitly or implicitly, with generating inflation or driving down the value of the yen. Although the Bank of Japan is independent, the limits on its authority are set by politicians; and independence should be no excuse for bad policy. However, there is sure to be dogged resistance to change. In Japan, no debating point is too trivial if it favours the status quo. 
Perhaps the biggest doubts surround Mr Koizumi's determination to do what is needed. Granted, in his nearly two years in office he has tried to reform how the government makes decisions, giving more authority to the prime minister and cabinet so that policies are more co-ordinated. Appointing a Bank of Japan governor who will co-operate with broader economic plans, and being explicit about why he is doing so, would help these efforts. 
Yet the prime minister has also shied away from bold steps on several occasions, and many are asking whether he will do so again this time. If he really wants to revive the economy, he can choose central bankers who seem determined to get prices rising again, and make his case to Parliament. If he compromises, he will have nobody to blame but himself--and Japan's overdue revival will be delayed even longer.","Can a new central - bank governor drag Japan out of its economic rut ?

President George Bush said that he was ""sick and tired of games and deceptions"" and Saddam Hussein should get rid of his weapons of mass destruction. The UN inspectors said they would not complete their search by January 27th. Hans Blix, their leader, revealed the discovery of illegally imported material. He gave warning that the situation was ""very dangerous"" and that Iraq must co-operate more fully to avoid war.
Spain said a new UN resolution authorising an attack on Iraq would not be necessary; Britain's Tony Blair, fighting off anti-war feeling in his own party and country, said it would be preferable; the Canadian government said it would be necessary. The United States formally asked NATO allies for at least indirect assistance if war comes. 
Mr Bush appeared to soften his line on North Korea: if the rogue regime agreed not to continue developing nuclear weapons, he would consider starting a ""bold initiative"" of food aid. North Korea spurned the advance, insisting on a non-aggression pact. 
Just good friends
Brazil, the United States and several other countries formed a group of ""friends of Venezuela"" to support the search for a negotiated end to the confrontation between President Hugo Chvez and his opponents. A six-week opposition strike, aimed at forcing an early election, has almost completely shut down Venezuela's oil industry, pushing up the price of oil. But there were some signs the strike might be weakening.
Lucio Gutierrez, a populist former army colonel who led a failed coup in 2000, was sworn in as Ecuador's elected president.

Palestinian delegates, banned from travel by Israel, joined a London conference on Palestinian reform by video link. They condemned Palestinian suicide bombings in Israel, and Israeli military action in the occupied territories, and promised to provide the draft of a new constitution by the end of the month.
Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah launched another big initiative, to be considered by the Arabs at their summit in March. Unlike last year's initiative, which laid down the basis for a full Middle Eastern peace, this one is inward-looking, calling for Arab reform based on greater political participation.

EAST ASIA'S financial crisis of 1997-98 is gradually being re-evaluated. Many analysts now argue that, however cataclysmic it seemed at the time, it was also the best thing that could have happened to the region. As Nicholas Kristof puts it in ""Thunder from the East"", co-written with Sheryl WuDunn, his wife and fellow New York Times journalist:""
It entailed a terrible human cost, but it is also helping to destroy much of the cronyism, protectionism and government regulation that had burdened Asian business. The crisis helped launch a political, social and economic revolution that is still incomplete but that ultimately will reshape Asia as greatly as the fall of the Berlin wall reshaped Europe.""
Mr Kristof, indeed, thinks that this revolution is going to wrench economic, diplomatic and military power from an American-led West.
The belief that the crisis was a good thing for Asia is now taking hold at the region's brokerage houses and investment banks. They clearly have an interest in spreading the message, but it is not without substance. After all, the demographics that underpinned so much of the Asia-Pacific region's economic success for the past three decades or so still have some way to run. Since 1965, the ratio of the region's dependants--those 15 and under or 65 and over--to its working-age population has fallen from 80% (including lots of kids) to 55%. For the region as a whole it will reach its lowest point around 2015, at 49%. Yet in many of its constituent countries the ratio will be very much lower. By contrast, in the West the ratio is set to rise fast as the population ages (see chart 1, next page).
This is what people mean by Asia's demographic dividend. Christopher Wood, equity strategist at CLSA Emerging Markets, compares the swelling cohort of working-age Asians (including India but excluding developed Japan) with America's post-war generation of baby-boomers. As that generation passed like a large animal through the digestive tract of the American economy (Mr Wood's herpetological metaphor), its numbers and sheer exuberance did much to drive America's consumption patterns and even its equity markets--at least until the bust at the end of the 1990s. Mr Wood predicts a similar effect on consumption and regional share prices from Asia's new baby-boomers.
There is nothing far-fetched about this. MasterCard's chief Asian economist, Yuwa Hedrick-Wong, says that, as a general rule, when an Asian's income passes $5,000 a year before tax, he has money in his pocket to burn. Very roughly, for every extra dollar earned over the $5,000 income threshold, 60 cents go on discretionary spending. How many discretionary spenders does that make? About 225m Asians outside Japan, Mr Wood reckons, using figures for GDP per head and adjusting them for the distribution of income. 
Now for a bit of idle speculation. If Asia's annual average growth in per-head income between 2000 and 2020 were to equal the rate between 1980 and 2000 (that is, including the period of financial turmoil, when GDP in the crisis-hit economies plummeted), then the number of high spenders would rise to 340m in 2010 and 682m in 2020. But if income grew at the average rate in the ten years immediately before the crisis, the number would rise to 541m and 1.1 billion respectively. 
A billion boomers
Nor is that all. CLSA's regional economist, Jim Walker, has long argued persuasively that Asia's unofficial or black-market economy is as much as half the size of the official economy--and that it is a better engine of consumption because it is not taxed at source. After allowing for the black economy, the number of discretionary consumers in 2020 may have risen to as much as 1.4 billion. ""Asia's billion boomers"", as CLSA puts it, no longer seems outlandish. It could lead to a virtuous circle as the high savings which hitherto have fuelled much of Asia's export-driven growth are drawn into domestic consumption. That, in turn, would encourage a more balanced regional development, less dependent upon exports and, above all, upon the increasingly unreliable-looking health of the American economy. 
Not outlandish, and certainly desirable. Yet this survey will argue that post-crisis Asia is still very far from realising its economic potential; and that rickety and hugely inefficient financial systems remain the biggest economic constraint. The radical transformation of the region's financial systems needed to underwrite optimistic assumptions about future growth has, by and large, yet to take place.
Certainly, an economic recovery in the region has begun. In 2002, East Asian growth probably averaged nearly 5%, after 7% and 3% respectively in 2000 and 2001--a little wobbly, perhaps, but a vast improvement on the late 1990s. However, as Joan Zheng at J.P. Morgan Chase in Hong Kong points out, in dollar terms only two economies, China's and Hong Kong's, are now at higher levels than before the financial crisis--and these two economies were not directly hit by it. China escaped because its currency is only partially convertible (which meant that its technically insolvent banking system was not exposed), Hong Kong because of its first-world banking system and abundant foreign-exchange reserves. As for the rest of the region, most economies have not even clawed their way back to pre-crisis levels once steep falls in their exchange rates are taken into account.
For much of the region, the crisis destroyed wealth on a massive scale and sent absolute poverty shooting up. In the banking system alone, corporate loans equivalent to around half of one year's GDP went bad--a destruction of savings on a scale more usually associated with a full-scale war. In a number of countries, governments have helped to take these loans off banks' books, in the hope of cleaning up the banking system and encouraging banks to start lending again. Yet, notably in Indonesia and Thailand, they have often dithered over dealing with the bad loans and with the companies responsible for them--even though they know that putting off the problem ensures that the eventual cost will be very much higher.
Meanwhile, several economies are turning a blind eye towards banks that continue to lend to the politically well-connected, or that tolerate companies not keeping up with repayments, a nod-and-a-wink known in the trade as forbearance. Such practices prevent capital being allocated in the most efficient way. They stop the region from drawing a line under the past and looking to the future.
To be fair, in some quarters the lessons of the crisis have been swiftly learnt. South Korea--a country that by the mid-1990s appeared to have graduated permanently to the ranks of the developed world, only to find itself on the brink of bankruptcy in late 1997--is the clearest example of how quickly reforms can produce results if the initiative is seized. The government took many bad loans away from the banks and sold them to all comers, even foreigners, if necessary at knock-down prices. It drastically slimmed down the banking sector (again inviting in foreigners) and liquidated some of the most heavily indebted and least profitable Korean companies. As a result, the Korean economy has been transformed. Not only are today's export-oriented conglomerates, the chaebol, in far better health, but new sources of growth, notably domestic demand and consumer credit, have appeared, and foreign direct investment (FDI) has soared. Since the crisis, over 1m new jobs have been created, and the country appears to be climbing back towards a growth rate of 5-7% a year. 
Some South Koreans compare the magnitude of the economic shock of 1997-98 to the Korean war. Women lined up to donate their wedding rings to saving the country's finances. It took a national crisis for South Korea to turn from an inward-looking nation to one that embraced foreign capital, change and competition. The country's economic transformation required radical political change, led by Kim Dae-jung, once an imprisoned dissident. Whatever the later mis-steps in Mr Kim's presidency, in his early days he helped to make Koreans face up to their economy's shortcomings. Still, South Korea is the exception, and questions remain even there--particularly about the continued high indebtedness of many companies, and about the adequacy of the banks' experience in dishing out credit to consumers.
An incomplete revolution
In Indonesia, the crisis fostered a political revolution that unseated the long-standing dictator, Suharto, and ushered in democracy. Since then, no profound economic revolution has followed the political one. Instead, reforms have been introduced incrementally, amid much muddle and corruption, and have often appeared to make little progress.
The government, having taken over most of the banking sector's non-performing loans, now controls great swathes of the Indonesian economy, from telecoms to plantations, and has nationalised nearly all the banks as well. Yet it has done far too little to get these assets swiftly off its books. As a result, foreign investment continues to leave the country, Indonesian Chinese businessmen keep their flight capital in Switzerland or Singapore, banks refuse to lend money to those that have a use for it, and the fiscal situation, though better than it was, still looks difficult. ""This is a country that was never ready for reform, but was asked to undertake multiple reforms at once,"" says a senior Indonesian banker. Without political will and a national consensus, as in South Korea, that was bound to cause trouble.
Not all the time in the world
Progress in financial reform matters, not least because the demographic window of a growing working-age population will not be open for long. It is not necessarily a bad thing for Asia's traditionally high savings rates to fall as consumption rises, but it does mean that savings will need to be allocated far more efficiently than in the past--at a time when rapidly ageing populations will be putting fresh demands upon financial resources. Smaller households and more working women mean that the traditional, extended Asian family, where the old move in with their children and expect to be cared for, is on its way out. Increasingly, people want to push the costs of caring for the elderly on to the state. For instance, by 2025, China's population, now 1.3 billion, will have risen to 1.5 billion, and will contain the same proportion of elderly people (one-fifth of the total) as the OECD economies have today. But whereas North America and Europe have had the best part of a century to organise their pension systems (and have yet to resolve huge problems), China has only a quarter of that time to get ready. As it is, the state faces a $100 billion-200 billion unfunded pension liability for its urban residents alone. What will happen when countryside folk dare to demand equal treatment?
The challenge, then, is to develop regional banking and capital markets that are efficient, deep and well-regulated, so that savings can be channelled to where they get the highest returns. Today, Asia's financial sectors are fragmented, parochial, illiquid and poorly policed; they misprice capital. In addition, capital markets are under-represented, because banks are unhealthily dominant. Although Asia (including Japan) accounts for over half of mankind, one-third of the world's GDP and one-quarter of its exports, the region's share of worldwide equity-market capitalisation is only 16%--or merely 5% without developed Japan. To the optimists at Asia's investment banks, that is just one more reason to forecast a secular bull market in Asian equities, as we shall see later. But it is also a measure of how much emerging Asia still has to do in the financial area.
Defining Asia is the stuff of many debates. Lumping together a region where annual income per head ranges from $280 (Laos) to $31,000 (Japan) is bound to be problematic. For the rest of this survey, Asia generally means East and South-East Asia, and in particular the economies of South Korea, the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia that were hit hard by the crisis of 1997-98.
There is no need to worry too much about Singapore and Hong Kong. True, Singapore is finding itself in the wrong place at the wrong time, surrounded by struggling economies when its own specialities, high technology and electronics, are also being knocked by a slump in American demand; and Hong Kong is agonising loudly about its role in the Chinese economy. Yet the prosperity of the two city-states is pretty much secure, however much they like to fret about financial competition--from each other, or even Shanghai. By the same token, both offer useful examples for their poorer neighbours about how to develop financial markets, and how to think about their future challenges, even if they sometimes fall short in political imagination or public participation.
Japan, so overwhelmingly the region's biggest economy, enters this survey's calculations when it has lessons to teach the rest of Asia. Regrettably, the biggest lesson is the baneful effect on economic growth of not tackling bad debts in the banking system. The consulting arm of Ernst & Young estimates that Asia has $2 trillion of non-performing loans, of which $1.2 trillion reside in Japan--and that is over a decade after the country's asset bubble burst. What is more, the aggregate figure has not shrunk even though banks have got rid of around $300 billion of bad loans since 1997, so fast are other loans souring. The prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, has now launched a last-ditch attempt to sort out the banks. It will fail, unless the country's deflation is cured at the same time.
Japan's domestic shortcomings also affect the region more directly, in that for most of the past decade, and particularly since 1997, stricken Japanese banks have withdrawn from the region, and their absence is now almost complete. Asians, in other words, have had to rebuild their financial systems without any private-sector help from their richest neighbour, at a time when foreign private investment is crucial for their transformation. 
India, though a huge country, is not covered by this survey, partly because the line has to be drawn somewhere, and partly because it is still an inward-looking economy that attracts relatively little foreign investment, was scarcely affected by the regional crisis of 1997-98 and plays a very much smaller role in world trade today than it once did. For instance, despite its importance in software programming, India has no part in the production chains that are an increasingly striking aspect of regional trade patterns in East Asia. Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Vietnam and benighted North Korea, because of their isolation and socialist backwardness, are regrettably also left out of the calculations. 
The giant stirs
China, by contrast, plays a large and growing part in world trade and now accounts for nearly 5% of world exports, seven times as much as India. It is by far the biggest link in the East Asian production chain. China is the dominant recipient of foreign direct investment ($55 billion in 2002) going to developing countries, and last year may have surpassed even America as the world's biggest recipient. Its $600 billion of non-performing loans equal those of the rest of emerging Asia put together. The success or otherwise of China's financial reforms will have a bearing on the whole region. Although the country did not itself suffer a crisis in those dark days of 1997-98, it first acknowledged the huge shortcomings in its own financial system when it saw its neighbours' systems laid bare. It is emphatically included in this survey.","Asia is now recovering from its financial crisis five years ago, but with bad debts of $2 trillion, it is still crying out for financial reform, says Dominic Ziegler

Not only are today's export-oriented conglomerates, the chaebol, in far better health, but new sources of growth, notably domestic demand and consumer credit, have appeared, and foreign direct investment (FDI) has soared. Since the crisis, over 1m new jobs have been created, and the country appears to be climbing back towards a growth rate of 5-7% a year. 
Some South Koreans compare the magnitude of the economic shock of 1997-98 to the Korean war. Women lined up to donate their wedding rings to saving the country's finances. It took a national crisis for South Korea to turn from an inward-looking nation to one that embraced foreign capital, change and competition. The country's economic transformation required radical political change, led by Kim Dae-jung, once an imprisoned dissident. Whatever the later mis-steps in Mr Kim's presidency, in his early days he helped to make Koreans face up to their economy's shortcomings. Still, South Korea is the exception, and questions remain even there--particularly about the continued high indebtedness of many companies, and about the adequacy of the banks' experience in dishing out credit to consumers.
An incomplete revolution
In Indonesia, the crisis fostered a political revolution that unseated the long-standing dictator, Suharto, and ushered in democracy. Since then, no profound economic revolution has followed the political one. Instead, reforms have been introduced incrementally, amid much muddle and corruption, and have often appeared to make little progress.
The government, having taken over most of the banking sector's non-performing loans, now controls great swathes of the Indonesian economy, from telecoms to plantations, and has nationalised nearly all the banks as well. Yet it has done far too little to get these assets swiftly off its books. As a result, foreign investment continues to leave the country, Indonesian Chinese businessmen keep their flight capital in Switzerland or Singapore, banks refuse to lend money to those that have a use for it, and the fiscal situation, though better than it was, still looks difficult. ""This is a country that was never ready for reform, but was asked to undertake multiple reforms at once,"" says a senior Indonesian banker. Without political will and a national consensus, as in South Korea, that was bound to cause trouble.
Not all the time in the world
Progress in financial reform matters, not least because the demographic window of a growing working-age population will not be open for long. It is not necessarily a bad thing for Asia's traditionally high savings rates to fall as consumption rises, but it does mean that savings will need to be allocated far more efficiently than in the past--at a time when rapidly ageing populations will be putting fresh demands upon financial resources. Smaller households and more working women mean that the traditional, extended Asian family, where the old move in with their children and expect to be cared for, is on its way out. Increasingly, people want to push the costs of caring for the elderly on to the state. For instance, by 2025, China's population, now 1.3 billion, will have risen to 1.5 billion, and will contain the same proportion of elderly people (one-fifth of the total) as the OECD economies have today. But whereas North America and Europe have had the best part of a century to organise their pension systems (and have yet to resolve huge problems), China has only a quarter of that time to get ready. As it is, the state faces a $100 billion-200 billion unfunded pension liability for its urban residents alone. What will happen when countryside folk dare to demand equal treatment?
The challenge, then, is to develop regional banking and capital markets that are efficient, deep and well-regulated, so that savings can be channelled to where they get the highest returns. Today, Asia's financial sectors are fragmented, parochial, illiquid and poorly policed; they misprice capital. In addition, capital markets are under-represented, because banks are unhealthily dominant. Although Asia (including Japan) accounts for over half of mankind, one-third of the world's GDP and one-quarter of its exports, the region's share of worldwide equity-market capitalisation is only 16%--or merely 5% without developed Japan. To the optimists at Asia's investment banks, that is just one more reason to forecast a secular bull market in Asian equities, as we shall see later. But it is also a measure of how much emerging Asia still has to do in the financial area.
Defining Asia is the stuff of many debates. Lumping together a region where annual income per head ranges from $280 (Laos) to $31,000 (Japan) is bound to be problematic. For the rest of this survey, Asia generally means East and South-East Asia, and in particular the economies of South Korea, the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia that were hit hard by the crisis of 1997-98.
There is no need to worry too much about Singapore and Hong Kong. True, Singapore is finding itself in the wrong place at the wrong time, surrounded by struggling economies when its own specialities, high technology and electronics, are also being knocked by a slump in American demand; and Hong Kong is agonising loudly about its role in the Chinese economy. Yet the prosperity of the two city-states is pretty much secure, however much they like to fret about financial competition--from each other, or even Shanghai. By the same token, both offer useful examples for their poorer neighbours about how to develop financial markets, and how to think about their future challenges, even if they sometimes fall short in political imagination or public participation.
Japan, so overwhelmingly the region's biggest economy, enters this survey's calculations when it has lessons to teach the rest of Asia. Regrettably, the biggest lesson is the baneful effect on economic growth of not tackling bad debts in the banking system. The consulting arm of Ernst & Young estimates that Asia has $2 trillion of non-performing loans, of which $1.2 trillion reside in Japan--and that is over a decade after the country's asset bubble burst. What is more, the aggregate figure has not shrunk even though banks have got rid of around $300 billion of bad loans since 1997, so fast are other loans souring. The prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, has now launched a last-ditch attempt to sort out the banks. It will fail, unless the country's deflation is cured at the same time.
Japan's domestic shortcomings also affect the region more directly, in that for most of the past decade, and particularly since 1997, stricken Japanese banks have withdrawn from the region, and their absence is now almost complete. Asians, in other words, have had to rebuild their financial systems without any private-sector help from their richest neighbour, at a time when foreign private investment is crucial for their transformation. 
India, though a huge country, is not covered by this survey, partly because the line has to be drawn somewhere, and partly because it is still an inward-looking economy that attracts relatively little foreign investment, was scarcely affected by the regional crisis of 1997-98 and plays a very much smaller role in world trade today than it once did. For instance, despite its importance in software programming, India has no part in the production chains that are an increasingly striking aspect of regional trade patterns in East Asia. Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Vietnam and benighted North Korea, because of their isolation and socialist backwardness, are regrettably also left out of the calculations. 
The giant stirs
China, by contrast, plays a large and growing part in world trade and now accounts for nearly 5% of world exports, seven times as much as India. It is by far the biggest link in the East Asian production chain. China is the dominant recipient of foreign direct investment ($55 billion in 2002) going to developing countries, and last year may have surpassed even America as the world's biggest recipient. Its $600 billion of non-performing loans equal those of the rest of emerging Asia put together. The success or otherwise of China's financial reforms will have a bearing on the whole region. Although the country did not itself suffer a crisis in those dark days of 1997-98, it first acknowledged the huge shortcomings in its own financial system when it saw its neighbours' systems laid bare. It is emphatically included in this survey.",740,Japan,A29-8209,,False,,0,True

A SHOOT-OUT between gangsters in Maebashi, a city north-west of Tokyo, on January 25th left four people dead, three of them customers in a bar caught in the crossfire. Shootings may be commonplace in yakuza (gangster) films, but in real life they are unusual. Guns are rarely used in Japan, even by the police. And the yakuza have an unwritten understanding with the authorities not to involve innocent bystanders in their disputes. Worried police chiefs quickly instructed local forces to step up their monitoring of yakuza activities. Four days after the shootings, a gangster turned himself in. 
Japan's streets are thought to be the safest in the world. But although the crime rate remains well below that of other rich countries, it has been rising over the past seven years. The National Police Agency (NPA) says that 2.8m crimes were committed in 2002, 40% more than four years ago. The prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, is worried by the figures. ""We have to consider what we have to do to restore our reputation for safety,"" he said. 
Japan's prolonged economic slump is partly to blame for the rise in crime, but in a curiously indirect way. Crime syndicates have seen a decline in some of their traditional sources of income, such as protection rackets. As a result there has been an increase in petty theft to make up for the losses. 
Akira Fukushima, a professor at Sophia University in Tokyo, says Japan tends to be less tough on crime than most other countries. Decades of low crime levels have also lulled people into a false sense of security, making them easy victims. Japanese courts, quick to hand out probation, do little to deter criminals, adds Susumu Oda, professor of forensic psychiatry at Tezukayama Gakuin University. Juvenile courts are particularly easy-going, contributing to a big increase in young offenders.
As the crime figures have soared, so has Japan's prison population. The country has 74 prisons, built to house up to 65,000 inmates. The Ministry of Justice reckons the number of prisoners could reach 80,000 by 2005. Two new prisons are to be built--the first additions to Japan's jail world in half a century.","And the prisons fill up

THE war of words between bits of Europe and America, and of Europe with itself, has become so all-involving that farther-flung interested parties are often forgotten. Yet America has other allies in this debate who are struggling to decide what best to do. We consider the chief three, Australia, Canada and Japan: none of which, as it happens, has a seat on the UN Security Council.
So far, Australia is the only significant country, besides Britain, to have sent forces to the Gulf in support of a possible American attack. In a place so far away from Iraq, with a small defence force already stretched by regional commitments, the deployment has caused great controversy. A recent poll showed 60% of Australians opposed to sending their troops, with only 35% in favour; 76% were against Australian involvement in an attack on Iraq without United Nations approval; and a less-than-overwhelming 57% supported a strike sanctioned by a second resolution. 
This rebuff has shaken John Howard, the prime minister, who has backed George Bush and Tony Blair unquestioningly. Traditionally, Australians have tended to trust their leaders over when, and whether, to commit forces abroad. Australia has sent troops to back Britain and America in almost every conflict from the first world war to the 1991 Gulf war, mostly with public support. The Howard government announced the deployment of aircraft, ships and 2,000 troops to the Gulf in late January, when Australians were distracted by summer holidays and bushfires. Simon Crean, the Labor Party opposition leader, promptly told the departing troops they should not be going. 
But opposition to Mr Howard is coming equally from his own conservative Liberal Party. John Valder, a former party president, recently wrote to a Sydney newspaper suggesting that ""Washington needs a regime change as much as Baghdad."" Since then, Mr Valder says he has had an ""avalanche"" of conservative support, much of it ""quite ferocious"".
Mr Howard, usually one of Australia's most wily political operators, is now caught between his desire to bolster support for his government and his commitment to friendship with America, the cornerstone of Australia's foreign policy. His government, he says, has not yet made a decision to commit the deployed forces and could still withdraw them. Few believe him. On February 10th, during a visit to Washington that seemed to confirm Mr Howard, to his detractors, as a man marching to America's tune, Mr Bush made it even harder for him to back out when he said he regarded Australia as a member of the ""coalition of the willing"". Mr Howard is hoping desperately for a second Security Council resolution to save him. 
In Canada--America's biggest trading partner, but also a country viscerally unwilling to be seen as a mere adjunct to its neighbour--roughly the same divisions occur. An Ipsos-Reid poll of February 7th shows that only 28% of the public would support action against Iraq without a second UN resolution, while 67% would disapprove of it. On the other hand, 60% accept that Canada should provide military assistance if the UN sanctions action. 
The government of Jean Chretien, having long insisted that a second resolution was needed, now seems to be shifting to America's side in any event. Canadian forces are hovering already. Two frigates are patrolling the Gulf of Oman as a residual part of the Afghanistan operation, and two others are on their way to relieve them. A Canadian commodore has been put in charge of ""coalition"" naval forces in the Persian Gulf, and 25 senior Canadian officers have been installed to help the Americans in Qatar. Senior army officers are keen to send a 3,000-strong brigade under Canadian command, or Canada might sneak a compromise by sending more troops to Afghanistan, thus freeing American soldiers for Iraq. 
A decision to back America without a second resolution would probably split Mr Chretien's own Liberal majority. As a lame duck, who has already laid out the road-map to his retirement, he cannot hope to hold his troops in line, especially with the public so opposed to unilateral action. His likeliest successor, Paul Martin, has cleverly avoided committing himself. Nonetheless, Canada seems unlikely to do as it did in the Vietnam war, when it abstained from giving America a hand.
Compared with Canada and Australia, Japan has faced few tough questions over Iraq. Its pacifist constitution ensures that its military role in any intervention will be indirect and limited. (In the Gulf war, it did nothing.) Japan need not help America plan ahead for war. Given that, the prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, and his team have been surprisingly supportive of the United States. They would like a second resolution, but they also keep hinting that Iraq's actions warrant an American attack. 
Mr Koizumi will face harder choices, however, if and when the United States uses force. Should he help by sending ships? He might. After September 11th 2001, Japan's parliament passed laws that allowed several supply ships and escorts to go to the Indian Ocean to support, indirectly, the campaign in Afghanistan. It recently replaced one of those escorts with one of Japan's four Aegis-class destroyers, an even bolder move. 
Sending more ships to the Indian Ocean, technically as part of the Afghanistan effort (what might be called the Canadian option), would free American and other vessels for a military campaign in Iraq. It would also be a tangible endorsement of any American-led attack. Security experts in Tokyo reckon that Mr Koizumi could do this simply by getting the cabinet to rewrite the existing mission plan for Afghanistan, with no need for new legislation. A new law would meet stiff resistance, and probably could not be passed in time anyway.
How would the Japanese public take that? In a late-January poll by the Asahi Shimbun, a big daily, 62% said they opposed an American attack. But when asked what they would think if the Security Council approved, a majority--52%--said they would back the use of force.
North Korea's threat to go nuclear will also shape the debate. Those who oppose helping America will try to turn the tension to their advantage. Why pull more ships away from home when a greater menace lies just across the Sea of Japan? But precisely because of that fearsome neighbour, Mr Koizumi may find it easier to win public support for Japan's closest ally--and its only real line of defence.","Three friends of America try to get their act together

DID anyone still think that Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, the self-styled ""lionheart"" who promised to ""change Japan"" when he first grabbed the job in April 2001, was really a brave reformer? If so, then the choice he announced this week as the new governor of the Bank of Japan, Toshihiko Fukui, ought to have been the final disillusionment. Even though Mr Koizumi declared little more than a month ago that he wanted to pick a tough ""deflation-fighter"", this appointment of a former Bank veteran who is close to the current, much-criticised governor, Masaru Hayami, was a cautious move, bang in line with Japanese bureaucratic and political tradition. If Mr Koizumi still thinks he is a lion, he plainly has in mind the creature from ""The Wizard of Oz"" who asked Dorothy to help him find his courage.
Choosing Mr Fukui was not necessarily a bad move: he is a respectable and highly capable man ()see page 77. It is always possible that an insider, who is trusted both in the central bank and in the finance ministry, could prove more able to implement adventurous monetary policies than would an outsider whose declared radicalism might make the establishment gang up against him. That is possible; but if it were to happen it would certainly be a novelty. What Mr Koizumi lost by this appointment was the chance to show that he really does want novelty, that he truly wants to change Japan.
But does Japan actually want to be changed? After a decade of stagnant economic growth, gradually rising unemployment, highly indebted companies, a massively indebted government and seemingly remorseless deflation that may seem a strange question to ask. Yet, although Japanese officials, politicians and commentators talk constantly about the need for reform, their actions--or, rather, inaction--suggests that they don't believe what they are saying. In Japanese culture, the tatemae, or appearance, is often far removed from the honne, or reality. So it is with reform. Everyone says it is urgent. The honne is that slow change, in a spirit of muddling through, feels much more comfortable, including to Mr Koizumi.
It might work, up to a point. A bit of further monetary expansion, in line with Mr Hayami's policies, may restrain or even halt deflation. A bit more public spending might add to demand. A bit of banking reform might help revive lending and restore investors' confidence. Cheaper oil and a recovering world economy after a successful war in Iraq might boost Japanese exports and allow the yen to resume its helpful fall that was recently halted by the weakness of the dollar. 
Such muddling through would not cure Japan's fundamental ills--its huge surplus of savings, relative to demand, and the political and economic paralysis created by powerful interest groups--but it could buy time until a slightly stronger economy and a weaker yen make a cure easier to impose and easier to take. But what if it doesn't? Those ills are so profound that they will require an immense effort to cure. And meanwhile the combination of high public and private debts and steady deflation is making Japan vulnerable not just to a debilitating illness, as for the past decade, but to a cardiac arrest.
Like many political leaders, Mr Koizumi has proved to be much braver in his foreign policy than at home. By breaking so many of his promises of domestic reform, he has not necessarily destined Japan for economic decline or disaster. But he is taking the risk that a shock caused at home or abroad might eventually produce just that. It is courageous, in a way.","Junichiro Koizumi's timidity may prove to be a gamble

ON FEBRUARY 24th, after much dithering, Junichiro Koizumi, Japan's prime minister, nominated Toshihiko Fukui as the new governor of the Bank of Japan. Subject to parliamentary approval, Mr Fukui, a central banker with 40 years' service, will succeed Masaru Hayami, whose term ends on March 19th. Mr Fukui's nomination, when it finally came, was no surprise. More intriguing were the nominations of Toshiro Muto, a heavyweight from the Ministry of Finance, and Kazumasa Iwata, an economist from the Cabinet Office, to fill the two deputy-governor slots that will also become vacant.
Mr Fukui and his colleagues face the monumental task of trying to halt Japan's deflationary spiral. Retail prices have been sliding for five years; wages are falling by around 1% a year. In nominal terms, GDP is smaller than in 1997; the real economy has grown by a mere 1% a year in the past decade. Since the bubble burst in 1990, commercial-property prices have fallen by 80% and the stockmarket by three-quarters. The government's efforts to stem the decline have so far been futile, and have left it with a debt mountain that is half as big again as Japan's GDP.
For its part, the Bank of Japan has lowered interest rates to almost zero. For the past two years, it has also been pumping money into the economy by increasing its monthly purchases of Japanese government bonds (JGBs). It now buys yen1.2 trillion-worth ($10.3 billion) a month, equivalent to more than 40% of new issues (see chart). Yet although Japan's monetary base has expanded by over 40% since March 2001, the broad-money supply has grown by less than 6%. All the central bank's pumping has done little to get credit, and nominal demand, flowing again.
The bank, which gained its independence five years ago, has often fought with the government over policy. Its many critics believe that, by choosing the conservative Mr Fukui, Mr Koizumi has wasted a rare chance of changing a hidebound institution, in particular by failing to choose a governor committed to pursuing an inflation target above zero.
The central bank enjoys fairly broad discretion. It sets its own goals--currently, to eliminate deflation. Although the prime minister picks the members of the bank's nine-man policy board, they cannot be fired until their five-year terms are up. Representatives from the government can speak at board meetings, but may not vote. As with the Bank of England and America's Federal Reserve (and in contrast to the European Central Bank), board members' votes and the minutes of policy meetings are published. However, unanimity in policy votes is very much the rule.
At first blush, little seems likely to change on Mr Fukui's watch. Like many in the Bank of Japan, he believes that Japan's problems are mainly structural, not monetary. Working the money pump even harder would therefore do little good. Deeply indebted companies do not want to borrow; weak banks, already saddled with enormous bad debts, are just as reluctant to lend. The way forward is to force banks to clean up their books.
It is possible that Mr Muto could pull the bank in a different direction. He spent 37 years at the Ministry of Finance, with which the Bank of Japan has crossed swords many times. He retains great influence in Japan's mightiest ministry and also has Mr Koizumi's ear. Some see him as the ministry's man inside the central bank, who might push the Bank of Japan, should the government decide to spend and borrow even more than it already does, into swallowing more JGBs, thereby holding down long-term interest rates.
Mr Iwata is more radical than either Mr Fukui or Mr Muto. He has not ruled out unlimited purchases of government bonds to combat deflation. Unlike the other two, he seems to support fiscal expansion as well as structural reform. He also has a powerful sponsor, Heizo Takenaka, the economics and financial-services minister.
All of this has the potential to upset the Bank of Japan's usual harmony. There is a chance of a stand-off, or at any rate an uneasy compromise between Mr Fukui and the central bank's traditionalists on the one hand, and Mr Muto and Mr Iwata on the other. Against that, optimists such as Paul Sheard, an economist at Lehman Brothers, believe that the new team might produce further monetary expansion, plus support for easier fiscal policy should the government choose to pursue it.
Especially with a finance-ministry minder next to him, Mr Fukui may now have his work cut out to preserve the central bank's independence. The bank is not only under pressure to lift its self-set cap on purchases of JGBs. Mr Takenaka also wants it to buy less conventional assets such as exchange-traded funds (index-linked equity funds).
Buying masses of exchange-traded funds would expose the central bank directly to the stockmarket, and so put its balance sheet at risk. Increased purchases of JGBs are also far from risk-free. Taken far enough, such purchases might help to create inflation. All well and good, but what if, one distant day, the central bank decides to tighten monetary policy again by selling some of those bonds? Inflation would surely mean higher bond yields--ie, lower bond prices--and a capital loss for the central bank.
Mr Fukui may have better luck with the Bank of Japan's other policy goal: keeping the financial system from collapse. Over the past five years, the Bank of Japan has done better at this than at fighting deflation. It stepped in several times as lender of last resort during the banking crisis in 1997, and it has since deluged weak banks that were unable to get funds in the call market with money.
Perhaps frustrated by eternal crisis management, the Bank of Japan has for years prodded the government to sort out the banks, through stricter inspections of bad loans. The need for bank reform, even if it involves injecting banks with public funds, is one point on which the three nominees seem to agree. They could even use their collective clout to push the government into cleaning up the banks. Now that would be a victory.","Will the Bank of Japan 's new governor , Toshihiko Fukui ( above ) , do what is needed to resuscitate Japan 's sick economy ?

WHEN its economy was booming, cars and electronics were not the only industries in which Japan battled the West. Japanese authors also competed with their gaijin counterparts to churn out treatises about Japanese ways of doing things. On one point almost everyone agreed: the Japanese way of organising society was better, as its juggernaut economy proved. 
Needless to say, outside Japan, demand for such books is modest at the moment. But what about in Japan? After a decade of economic torpor, how do Japanese writers see their country now? The swagger that marked books such as ""The Japan that Can Say No"", in which Akio Morita (Sony's co-founder) and Shintaro Ishihara (a novelist and nationalist politician who is now governor of Tokyo) trumpeted Japan's rise to world prominence just before the bubble popped, has certainly faded. But Naoki Inose, a popular history writer who gained headlines last year serving on a committee for highway reform, says that many Japanese were never as confident as the bestselling titles of the bubble years encouraged them to be. 
For all the affluence that Japan achieved in the 1980s, he argues, many Japanese still felt an underlying anxiety, and were never really convinced that their success reflected fundamental strengths in their society. Even as western and Japanese authors were praising the bureaucratic and business structures that Japan had developed over the previous century, Mr Inose argues, ordinary Japanese remained unsure of where those overweening institutions were taking them. Even if anxieties were lurking all along, however, the events of the past decade have driven them to the surface, and Japan's economic weakness has clearly played a role. 
A quick glance at the bestseller lists highlights the change in tone. Tohan, which publishes the most prominent list, compiles separate tables for business books and other sorts of non-fiction. In 1989, one of the few economic worries on the minds of Japanese readers was taxes: four of the top ten business books aimed to help them cope with a new consumption tax. Two other popular business books that year took a stab at forecasting the 1990s, and both of their authors were optimistic. ""Nihon no Jidai"" (Japan's Era), by Keitaro Hasegawa, took the prize with its bold forecasts about how Japan would soon be managing the flow of money, people and goods around the world. 
It may be unfair to single out Mr Hasegawa just because his book sold more copies than the dozens of others that made similar extrapolations. ""It is considered bad form to ask what most of these guys were writing ten years ago,"" says Peter Tasker, a consultant and writer in Tokyo. Still, it is worth comparing Mr Hasegawa's outlook with that of the top-selling business book now. ""Tomorrow's Economics"", published recently by Heizo Takenaka--the economics and banking minister in Junichiro Koizumi's cabinet--also tries to envisage a bright future for Japan; but his optimism hangs on Japan's making a string of tough choices that authors in the bubble years did not predict. 
Japan's economy has not been the only source of worry and confusion, however. One of the country's best-known authors, Haruki Murakami, points out that two of the most significant events in Japan during the 1990s were not economic: the Kobe earthquake and the poison gas attacks by the Aum Shinrikyo cult in the Tokyo metro system, both of which took place in 1995. Though one was a natural disaster and the other man-made, Mr Murakami argues, both shook the faith of many Japanese in their society's underpinning. 
In ""Underground"", which recounts his interviews with the metro attackers and their victims, Mr Murakami tried to examine broadly the cruelty with which Japanese society can treat those who are different. After reading about a victim of the gas attacks who had subsequently been shunned by his fellow workers, Mr Murakami writes, he decided to find out ""how Japanese society could perpetrate such a double violence"". 
It is hard to say whether this sense of economic and social drift explains the slew of self-help books, several imported, which now line Tohan's non-business list of bestselling non-fiction. In 1989, the list was stocked with home-grown biographies and photograph albums of prominent Japanese, from actresses and divas to Hirohito, who died at the beginning of that year. Such lists can be misleading, however. Books known as nihonjinron, a class of pop-anthropology books that revelled in the uniqueness of the Japanese, were cranked out so frequently, and resembled each other so closely, that they rarely topped the charts of bestsellers. But many Japanese could not get enough of them in the 1980s, paying to read again and again about how their long history as island rice-cultivators had set them apart from the rest of humanity. 
A decade of gloom has led some Japanese to give this implicit belief a different twist. ""We may be cultivators,"" a few reformists say, ""but it might not be so bad if we acted a little more like hunters."" Although their sense of uniqueness remains, however, the Japanese seem to share at least one trait with readers everywhere: when times are tough, it helps to laugh at someone else. One of the most popular books in Japan now is ""Stupid White Men"", by Michael Moore, an American author and film-maker. It dwells on corruption, injustice and electoral shenanigans in the United States.","Triumphalist books about Japan have given way to gloomier tomes

WHEN Junichiro Koizumi was first noticed in Japanese politics, among his wilder ideas was the privatisation of his country's post office. As prime minister, Mr Koizumi has not gone quite that far. But on April 1st, the post office will be reborn as Japan Post, still a public entity but no longer controlled by the Ministry of Public Management, Home Affairs, Posts and Telecommunications (MPHPT). The mammoth institution, which sells three main products--postal services, savings and insurance--is supposed to become a leaner, profit-seeking operation.
For Japan's beleaguered banks and life insurers, this is scary. The post office is the world's largest financial institution. In its savings accounts, Japanese households have yen235 trillion ($2 trillion), one-third of such deposits. Its life-insurance funds are worth yen125 trillion, giving it a market share of 40% (see chart on next page). The post office has political clout to match: most of the 271,000 workers in its 24,700 branches are strong supporters of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
In its new incarnation, the post office will lose only a few of the perks that it currently enjoys. Japan Post will remain exempt from nearly all taxes. Like bank deposits, postal savings are fully protected by the government; unlike the banks, however, Japan Post will not have to pay any deposit-insurance premiums. This, complains the Japanese Bankers Association, has saved the post office around yen4.5 trillion in the past decade.
Life insurers are miffed too. Japan Post will not have to pay into the industry's policyholder-protection fund. Its policies, unlike the private sector's, are guaranteed by the government. The private industry has not recovered from the 1980s, when the post office, which did not have to worry about profitability, started raising rates of return on its policies. Prodded in part by the finance ministry, private life insurers followed suit. The burden of these high payout rates has pushed six life insurers into collapse in the past four years, and has left others struggling to survive.
Critics have long complained that the post office receives lenient regulatory treatment, having been overseen by the ministry to which it belongs. This will change only a little. Japan Post's savings and insurance operations will be inspected by the Financial Services Agency, regulator of financial institutions. However, the MPHPT will retain the final say over what to do with the inspection results.

Despite all these advantages, the post office may think it has some holes to fill, especially now that it is expected to chase a profit. For a start, it has suffered as stockmarkets have fallen, albeit less than its private-sector rivals, thanks to stricter government investment guidelines. Furthermore, it predicts that as products mature, its outstanding balance of deposits will fall by yen27 trillion over the next four years, and its insurance assets by yen10 trillion.
For a giant, Japan Post looks as if it might be surprisingly nimble. One of the post office's bigger branches has already enlisted the help of Toyota, Japan's biggest carmaker, to help streamline its operations. Bankers admit that their efforts to use information technology more efficiently pale in comparison with the strides the post office has made.
Japan Post is also mulling a move into new products, such as mortgages. The banks are horrified. They have only just celebrated the news that the government-run (and subsidised) Housing Loan Corporation, which has undercut them for decades, would be wound up by 2005. Now they could be hurt by Japan Post, because the post office, unlike banks, is exempt from stamp duty. Japan Post is also considering selling investment trusts at its branches, something banks were allowed to do only in 1998. Although Japan Post will need parliamentary approval, it surely has enough political friends to secure it. Indeed, politicians, keen to prop up Japan's falling stockmarkets, are already trying to persuade postal depositors to switch into equity investment trusts.
Turning the post office into an independent public corporation is supposed to be a stepping-stone towards privatisation. If that is achieved, the post office and its private-sector rivals might one day compete on equal terms. This first stage, however, has merely made the post office stronger. And privatisation might never happen. As in so many areas, Mr Koizumi's idealism has foundered on the opposition of more conservative politicians, and the privatisation plans are on ice.","A new name -- and new freedom -- for Japan 's giant post office 
 WHEN Junichiro Koizumi was first noticed in Japanese politics , among Junichiro Koizumi's wilder ideas was the privatisation of his country 's post office . As prime minister , Junichiro Koizumi has not gone quite that far . But on April 1st , the post office will be reborn as Japan Post , still a public entity but no longer controlled by the Ministry of Public Management , Home Affairs , Posts and Telecommunications ( MPHPT ) . The mammoth institution , which sells three main products -- postal services , savings and insurance -- is supposed to become a leaner , profit - seeking operation . 
 For Japan 's beleaguered banks and life insurers , this is scary . The post office is the world 's largest financial institution . In its savings accounts , Japanese households have yen235 trillion ( $ 2 trillion ) , one - third of such deposits . Its life - insurance funds are worth yen125 trillion , giving it a market share of 40 % ( see chart on next page ) . The post office has political clout to match : most of the 271,000 workers in its 24,700 branches are strong supporters of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party . 
 In its new incarnation , the post office will lose only a few of the perks that it currently enjoys . Japan Post will remain exempt from nearly all taxes . Like bank deposits , postal savings are fully protected by the government ; unlike the banks , however , Japan Post will not have to pay any deposit - insurance premiums . This , complains the Japanese Bankers Association , has saved the post office around yen4.5 trillion in the past decade . 
 Life insurers are miffed too . Japan Post will not have to pay into the industry 's policyholder - protection fund . Its policies , unlike the private sector 's , are guaranteed by the government . The private industry has not recovered from the 1980s , when the post office , which did not have to worry about profitability , started raising rates of return on its policies . Prodded in part by the finance ministry , private life insurers followed suit . The burden of these high payout rates has pushed six life insurers into collapse in the past four years , and has left others struggling to survive . 
 Critics have long complained that the post office receives lenient regulatory treatment , having been overseen by the ministry to which it belongs . This will change only a little . Japan Post 's savings and insurance operations will be inspected by the Financial Services Agency , regulator of financial institutions . However , the MPHPT will retain the final say over what to do with the inspection results .

IT WAS fitting that Junichiro Koizumi, who was touring European capitals this week, should start by visiting Tony Blair in London. The challenges raised by Iraq and North Korea, the two countries they discussed on April 26th, have revealed just how much Britain's and Japan's prime ministers have in common these days. Each man has loudly echoed George Bush's warnings about weapons of mass destruction and rogue regimes. In doing so, the two men have followed a geographical division of roles. In Iraq, Mr Blair was indispensable in dealing with Saddam Hussein's regime, whereas Mr Koizumi played a supporting role. Now, as attention swings towards North Korea, it is Mr Koizumi's chance to carry the torch. 
Mr Blair is clearly a tough act to follow, but comparisons between the two are not hard to make. Like Britain in Europe, Japan is often torn between its alliance with America and its desire to please its neighbours. Since America's presence benefits Asia in many ways, this alliance does not always cause conflict. But Japanese diplomats live in constant fear that a deep rift among Pacific countries might force them to choose, much as the recent transatlantic split has done, temporarily at least, in London and other European capitals. 
For a host of reasons--some peculiar to Japan, others reflecting Asian sensitivities and a lack of strong regional bodies--Japan manages this risk less eventfully than Britain does. Its basic foreign policy is to dole out aid and avoid clear stands on tough issues. During the 1991 Gulf war, Japan was irrelevant. Yet by these standards, Mr Koizumi's vocal support for Mr Bush in recent months has been especially bold. America's ambassador in Tokyo, Howard Baker, who reportedly told the secretaries-general of Japan's three ruling parties recently that Messrs Blair, Koizumi and Bush were the world's three great active leaders, was no doubt buttering up his hosts. But given his emphasis on weapons of mass destruction, it was not ridiculous. 
Consider: Japan has no seat on the UN Security Council, and so could easily have ducked the Iraq question. Yet even though 70% of Japanese were opposed to the use of force in Iraq, Mr Koizumi spoke out clearly in favour of it. He even telephoned wavering council members to lobby on America's behalf. Mr Koizumi has also supported America's firm line on North Korea since October, when the regime's attempt to enrich uranium for use in nuclear weapons became public. 
Most importantly, Mr Koizumi has consistently linked the two cases in principle, on the basis that dangerous regimes cannot be allowed to possess such weapons and that such regimes have to be confronted with a united diplomatic front. Compare that with South Korea's new president, Roh Moo-hyun, who has been much more ambivalent about how to deal with the North.
Still, there is a big difference between sharing America's concerns and actually being able to help deal with them. Can Mr Koizumi really matter as much in the North Korean stand-off as Mr Blair did in sorting out Iraq? 
Despite a few basic similarities, Mr Koizumi and Mr Blair are different sorts of leaders, functioning in very different political systems. Perhaps Mr Blair's most valuable contribution on Iraq was persistently and persuasively to make the case for intervention in a debate that the Bush administration often seemed happy to lose. By contrast, Mr Koizumi, though plain-spoken by the standards of Japanese politics, is not the sort of leader to win public debates on a global stage. 
That shortcoming might not matter much, however, in a region where governments are inclined to fudge their public statements and let bureaucrats work things out behind the scenes. Given Japan's desire to avoid conflict, and its preference for quiet diplomacy, Mr Koizumi's stance on North Korea's antics has registered as loudly and clearly as Mr Blair's message on Iraq did. Just as Mr Blair's support for America convinced some doubters who were inclined to distrust the Bush administration, Mr Koizumi--the leader of an officially pacifist country--might be able to play a similar role in Asia, even without laying out detailed arguments. 
Of course, the North Korean impasse could turn into a long, difficult, diplomatic slog, and fresh tensions may emerge between Mr Koizumi's government and the Bush administration. North Korea's long-running practice of abducting Japanese nationals, which it admitted to during Mr Koizumi's historic visit to Pyongyang last September, could become a sticking-point if talks ever get anywhere. In negotiating with North Korea, Mr Koizumi said in a recent interview, ""the past, present and future need to be settled together."" 
However relations with America and the region go, Mr Koizumi would be wise to consider another comparison with Mr Blair. At the moment, foreign policy is the one area where Mr Koizumi is taking a clear stand. Meanwhile, he has continued to compromise and stall on domestic economic reforms, and the popularity of his cabinet has been sliding. Some pundits have warned Mr Blair that neglecting domestic issues could be his undoing, however successful he is on the international stage. When Mr Koizumi returns home, he may want to heed that advice.","Junichiro Koizumi is the closest Asia can come right now to a leader like Tony Blair . But is that close enough ?

AT FIRST, his message sounds familiar. Nobuteru Ishihara starts to describe some of the rules that Japan has relaxed during his two years as deregulation minister in Junichiro Koizumi's cabinet. Since Japan's achievement lists are always dwarved by what is yet to be done, the listener could be forgiven for being underwhelmed. But Mr Ishihara, a former journalist (and the son of Tokyo's outspoken mayor, Shintaro Ishihara), imparts a clever spin. As he lists each example, the minister stops in each case to marvel at how the previous rules were allowing Japanese technology to go to waste. 
Mr Ishihara's favourite example is the spread of a smart card that deducts the fares of railway passengers as they pass through ticket-gates without their needing to insert the card physically into any device. These are now being adapted to many other uses. The regulation that once made them impractical was exactly the sort of outdated rule that infuriates reformists. If railways wanted to use the technology, they had to register every single railway station as a radio-broadcasting station. To Mr Ishihara, the inane thing about this rule was that ""90% of the technology is Japanese"". Commuters in Hong Kong, Singapore and elsewhere had been using the passes for years. Japan had been denying itself a potentially huge market for its own companies' technology. 
Not all of Japan's regulatory problems fit this pattern. But many do. When Mr Ishihara visited Singapore's massive container port, he was struck not only by its efficiency but by the Japanese technology that enabled it to operate with so few people. Last month, Japan's government granted a port in Kita-Kyushu special permission to operate around the clock. It now makes economic sense for the port to overhaul its technology. PSA, a Singapore company, will be the lead investor, but much of the technology will be supplied by Japanese firms. Mr Ishihara is also keen on the tiny chips that hold far more information than bar codes and can be attached to products in the retail pipeline. After a few rules changes, he says, a huge new market in these is beginning to evolve--in this case, exploiting Japanese technology at home without waiting for other countries to do it first.
Examples such as these give Mr Ishihara a powerful selling point for deregulation, which is often portrayed in Japan as a ""foreign"" idea. Western--especially American--advocacy of Japanese deregulation has strengthened the idea that deregulation is part and parcel of Japan's need to give up its own ways for foreign ones. Voters who might otherwise welcome reform in health care, farming, construction, work practices and countless other aspects of Japanese life are less keen on changes that look invented abroad. 
The promotion of technology, by contrast, is definitely an authentic Japanese value. Voters are happy to agree that speed counts in high-tech industries. One way Japan acquired its technological prowess was by letting its companies exploit a captive domestic market of gadget-crazy consumers and then rapidly develop better and cheaper models to export. To a Japanese technophile schooled in such thinking, the idea of passing up a domestic market for smart cards because it takes time to change a silly regulation seems perverse. 
Of course, an over-emphasis on technology holds its dangers. Many things Japan needs to deregulate have little to do with high-tech, not least the tangled web of rules that bind the economy as a whole. A poorly regulated banking system, twisted tax rules, powerful government-backed companies and a host of other practices conspire to make it harder for dynamic new companies and sectors to thrive. Yoshihiko Miyauchi, who runs a leasing company and heads a panel of private businesspeople advising Mr Koizumi on deregulation, argues that many previous deregulation drives have foundered for failing to cut this Gordian knot. 
Over-emphasising technology under-emphasises the many other good reasons to deregulate. Less red tape would help consumers and savers--and Japan has plenty of both. For now, however, Mr Ishihara's emphasis on high-tech may help him win converts for deregulation. The next rule he wants to axe is one requiring those fare-paying smart cards to carry a 250-character warning. Without the requirement for the warning, he says, firms could fit the cards into wristwatches. And what self-respecting Japanese commuter could resist that?","Can their love of gadgets persuade the Japanese to liberate their economy ?

ON MAY 17th, Resona, Japan's fifth-largest bank, admitted that its capital-adequacy ratio (ie, its capital divided by its assets, weighted by risk) had fallen to around 2%, half the required minimum for domestic banks. That evening, Junichiro Koizumi, the prime minister, agreed to inject public money into the bank in order to prevent its collapse. Resona, which by early July will receive some yen2 trillion ($17 billion) in return for new shares, will in effect be nationalised: the government will own more than half of its equity.
Resona--created only in March by the merger of Asahi Bank and Daiwa Bank, troubled recipients of yen1 trillion of public cash between them a few years ago--was known to be in a bad way, even by Japanese standards. Nevertheless, its cry for help caught the government off guard. A few weeks earlier, the bank had reported a capital-adequacy ratio of 6%.
So what went wrong? Remarkably for Japan, where accountants are notoriously chummy with their clients, the bank's auditors were not convinced by its figures. Like many Japanese banks, Resona counted a large lump of ""deferred tax assets"" in its capital base. These assets--created when a bank makes losses, for example by writing off bad loans--materialise only if a bank makes enough taxable profit within the next five years to recoup the losses. In late April, one of Resona's two auditors, Asahi & Co, disputed the bank's rosy profit forecasts and quit. The forecasts would have enabled Resona to include yen700 billion of deferred tax assets in its tier-one capital, making up 70% of the total, in its accounts for the year to March 31st. The other auditor, Shin Nihon, Japan's largest accounting firm, got cold feet shortly afterwards, and refused to put its name to the accounts unless Resona cut its deferred tax assets by 40%.
Japan's financial regulator, the Financial Services Agency (FSA), insists that no other big bank has had similar trouble with its accountants. This should be borne out when the banks publish their results on May 26th. Nonetheless, Resona's troubles sent bank shares tumbling, and with good reason. Resona is not the only bank whose deferred tax assets account for a large proportion of its capital base and which is making big losses (see chart). As long as the outlook for profits remains weak, there is a risk that others' reliance on deferred tax assets could be called into question in future--say at the end of September, the next time the banks draw up their accounts. With the economy in recession, and with deflation showing no signs of abating, more and more borrowers are getting into trouble. Other lenders may yet have to beg for public money.
The Resona episode has also raised questions about the FSA. What is the point, asks Yasuhisa Shiozaki, a politician in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, of a banking regulator that has to rely on private auditors to check banks' measurement of their capital? The FSA has been promising reforms, but so far to little effect. Its boss, Heizo Takenaka, the financial-affairs minister, tried to introduce a cap on the amount of deferred tax assets banks can count as capital when he was appointed last September; but he was beaten back by politicians, bankers and even bureaucrats within his own ministry. The FSA says a committee is discussing stricter rules--but admits that it does not know when or if they will be implemented.
Reviving Resona
Having been taken by surprise, the FSA is now trying to explain how it will ""revive"" Resona. It says it will send a 13-strong team to monitor the bank's management. Although the bank has already announced a 30% wage reduction, among other cost-cutting measures, it is not clear how much it will be forced to change.
The FSA says it will take a ""hands-off"" approach. It will not even re-evaluate Resona's assets--which might reveal a yet worse capital position--before pouring in public money. Like other banks, Resona not only faces the mammoth task of getting rid of existing bad loans, which the FSA has been allowing to build up for years, but also has to tackle masses of fresh ones as the economy remains feeble.
The FSA says that Resona will first separate its bad loans from the good. This is similar to what the government tried to do in 1998 when it nationalised Long-Term Credit Bank and Nippon Credit Bank. In the event, both banks, which were later sold to private investors, were left with plenty of duds on their books. Cleaning up will be no easier this time around. Many of Resona's borrowers are small and medium-sized companies that the government has pledged to support. Politicians are likely to face a public outcry if many of these are sent, as has been suggested, to the Resolution and Collection Corporation, the state agency for collecting bad loans. Tackling Resona's bigger troubled borrowers will hurt other banks, which also hold big chunks of their debt.
Resona may have particular trouble dealing with the many quasi-governmental projects that it helps to finance in Osaka in the west of Japan, its home patch. These include big waterfront schemes, which already have huge capital deficits and continue to make big losses. Foreclosing on these will hurt local governments, which are struggling to balance their books themselves, as well as generate huge losses for other big banks.
That is why there is a risk that Resona, under pressure from politicians, might use its public money to forgive a portion of its bad debts--and keep undeserving borrowers alive. A change of management should help: but although five of Resona's directors, including its president, have resigned, their duties have been taken over by four other executives, including two existing board members. Shareholders have little reason to put pressure on management. Beyond some dilution of their shares, they have suffered little in the latest debacle--perhaps because the government knows that some of them, such as Asahi Mutual, an insurer in deep trouble, have problems of their own. The rescue of Resona is ""clearly a transfer from taxpayers to shareholders,"" says Chris Walker of Credit Suisse First Boston in Tokyo.
Resona's bail-out, adds Mr Walker, appears to be a strenuous effort by the government to preserve the status quo. As such, it does little to solve the problem of over-capacity in the banking industry, which has seven big banks and hundreds of smaller ones. Instead, it hurts those banks that are trying to strengthen their operations without government help. There may be worse to come.","The rescue of Japan's fifth-biggest bank may be a sign of even worse trouble ahead

The other auditor, Shin Nihon, Japan's largest accounting firm, got cold feet shortly afterwards, and refused to put its name to the accounts unless Resona cut its deferred tax assets by 40%.
Japan's financial regulator, the Financial Services Agency (FSA), insists that no other big bank has had similar trouble with its accountants. This should be borne out when the banks publish their results on May 26th. Nonetheless, Resona's troubles sent bank shares tumbling, and with good reason. Resona is not the only bank whose deferred tax assets account for a large proportion of its capital base and which is making big losses (see chart). As long as the outlook for profits remains weak, there is a risk that others' reliance on deferred tax assets could be called into question in future--say at the end of September, the next time the banks draw up their accounts. With the economy in recession, and with deflation showing no signs of abating, more and more borrowers are getting into trouble. Other lenders may yet have to beg for public money.
The Resona episode has also raised questions about the FSA. What is the point, asks Yasuhisa Shiozaki, a politician in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, of a banking regulator that has to rely on private auditors to check banks' measurement of their capital? The FSA has been promising reforms, but so far to little effect. Its boss, Heizo Takenaka, the financial-affairs minister, tried to introduce a cap on the amount of deferred tax assets banks can count as capital when he was appointed last September; but he was beaten back by politicians, bankers and even bureaucrats within his own ministry. The FSA says a committee is discussing stricter rules--but admits that it does not know when or if they will be implemented.
Reviving Resona
Having been taken by surprise, the FSA is now trying to explain how it will ""revive"" Resona. It says it will send a 13-strong team to monitor the bank's management. Although the bank has already announced a 30% wage reduction, among other cost-cutting measures, it is not clear how much it will be forced to change.
The FSA says it will take a ""hands-off"" approach. It will not even re-evaluate Resona's assets--which might reveal a yet worse capital position--before pouring in public money. Like other banks, Resona not only faces the mammoth task of getting rid of existing bad loans, which the FSA has been allowing to build up for years, but also has to tackle masses of fresh ones as the economy remains feeble.
The FSA says that Resona will first separate its bad loans from the good. This is similar to what the government tried to do in 1998 when it nationalised Long-Term Credit Bank and Nippon Credit Bank. In the event, both banks, which were later sold to private investors, were left with plenty of duds on their books. Cleaning up will be no easier this time around. Many of Resona's borrowers are small and medium-sized companies that the government has pledged to support. Politicians are likely to face a public outcry if many of these are sent, as has been suggested, to the Resolution and Collection Corporation, the state agency for collecting bad loans. Tackling Resona's bigger troubled borrowers will hurt other banks, which also hold big chunks of their debt.
Resona may have particular trouble dealing with the many quasi-governmental projects that it helps to finance in Osaka in the west of Japan, its home patch. These include big waterfront schemes, which already have huge capital deficits and continue to make big losses. Foreclosing on these will hurt local governments, which are struggling to balance their books themselves, as well as generate huge losses for other big banks.
That is why there is a risk that Resona, under pressure from politicians, might use its public money to forgive a portion of its bad debts--and keep undeserving borrowers alive. A change of management should help: but although five of Resona's directors, including its president, have resigned, their duties have been taken over by four other executives, including two existing board members. Shareholders have little reason to put pressure on management. Beyond some dilution of their shares, they have suffered little in the latest debacle--perhaps because the government knows that some of them, such as Asahi Mutual, an insurer in deep trouble, have problems of their own. The rescue of Resona is ""clearly a transfer from taxpayers to shareholders,"" says Chris Walker of Credit Suisse First Boston in Tokyo.
Resona's bail-out, adds Mr Walker, appears to be a strenuous effort by the government to preserve the status quo. As such, it does little to solve the problem of over-capacity in the banking industry, which has seven big banks and hundreds of smaller ones. Instead, it hurts those banks that are trying to strengthen their operations without government help. There may be worse to come.",740,Japan,A29-8209,,False,,0,True

SHOULD he pause to enjoy the view, or try to march Japan's defence policy up the next hill? That was the question facing Junichiro Koizumi this week, as he and his cabinet pondered sending the self-defence forces (SDF) to help rebuild Iraq. Getting approval for the mission would be a tough climb in the legislature, and Mr Koizumi is keen to wrap up the current Diet session as scheduled on June 18th. But the prime minister has built up momentum with a string of successes on security issues. As of May 29th he was still thinking it over.
Mr Koizumi's most recent victory was the lower house's passage of a set of security bills in mid-May. The bills, which the upper house is expected to approve in early June, will streamline the rules for responding to attacks and other emergencies. Although Japan's war-renouncing constitution allows self-defence, the mere thought of using force is so unsettling to many Japanese that successive governments have found even small procedural changes hard to get passed. The bills just approved deal with unaddressed emergency contingencies--such as a need to use private land, evacuate areas, or bypass local red tape--that the Fukuda government first highlighted in the 1970s. Yet even last year, a quarter-century later, the public was still not ready, and Mr Koizumi then failed to get the bills through.
This time, however, Mr Koizumi not only succeeded, but did so with support from the biggest opposition party, the Democratic Party of Japan, along with one of its coalition partners, Ichiro Ozawa's Liberal Party. Another bill delineating civilians' rights in an emergency will have to be enacted within 12 months for the package to take effect. 
Seiji Maehara, a Democrat who helped craft this compromise, hinted in a talk to foreign journalists this week that a change of his party's leadership--Yukio Hatoyama resigned late last year and was replaced by Naoto Kan--resulted in a greater willingness to co-operate. The public's heightened fears of North Korea, and their apparent support for Mr Koizumi's handling of foreign policy, no doubt helped as well. Whatever the reasons, and however innocuous the legislation's details, it is a big step for Japan. Taku Yamasaki, the secretary-general of Mr Koizumi's Liberal Democratic Party, praised the lower house's ""supra-partisan"" support and hailed the bill as ""epoch making"".
The next challenge facing Japan's security planners and foreign-policy makers will be to clarify some of the links between Japan's defence of its homeland and the activities that the SDF undertakes outside Japanese territory, especially in co-operation with its American allies. 
A law in 1992, following Japan's relative inaction in the first Gulf war, set out rules for taking part in distant UN peacekeeping operations. Then Japan began thinking more clearly about its co-ordination with American forces in Japan's immediate neighbourhood. That legislation passed in 1999, a year after North Korea launched a missile over Japan. Now, at last, Japan has cleared up some of the rules for handling an actual attack. More important, Mr Koizumi's recent victories suggest that Japanese are growing more comfortable about debating their security.","Japan continues to clarify the rules governing its troops

A WEAKENING dollar is perhaps the last thing that the Bank of Japan wants. With domestic demand anaemic, Japan perennially relies on exports and overseas production, especially of cars and electronics, to keep its economy going. So throughout May, even as the yen fell sharply against the euro, the central bank was intervening furiously to keep it from rising too far against the dollar.
Since May 15th, when the yen closed at yen116 (see chart), having hit a 27-month high, the pressure has eased. By this week it was back to yen119, near the yen120 with which the Bank of Japan seems comfortable. In trade-weighted terms, thanks to the strengthening of the euro, the yen is now weaker than it was when the Iraq war ended in April. Even so, the prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, said on June 3rd at the G8 summit in Evian that the yen was still too strong against the dollar. 
The Bank of Japan may have helped Japan's carmakers, but it is offering little solace to the rest of the economy. With short-term interest rates at zero, the central bank has relied on non-traditional measures to inject liquidity into the financial system. For example, it has boosted banks' current-account balances with the central bank. Since Toshihiko Fukui took over as governor in March, the Bank of Japan has raised its ceiling for these balances by 50%, to yen30 trillion ($250 billion). This week, however, Mr Fukui mused aloud about whether the policy was doing any good.
The Bank of Japan also continues to buy new government bond issues at a rate of yen1.2 trillion per month. This has helped drive the yield on ten-year bonds down by four-tenths of a percentage point since the start of the year, to below 0.5%. But the central bank is loth to be more aggressive--by, say, buying some of the outstanding stock of bonds, rather than just a portion of new issues, or by buying foreign assets.
If the Bank of Japan is to conquer deflation, it will have to do more. However, this does not really seem to be the central bank's goal. Its main concern is to avoid being blamed for any large-scale financial collapse. So its officials step in from time to time to reassure markets, but do little more. Recently, its officials have been considering a plan to buy asset-backed securities in an effort to prop up ailing small firms.
The Bank of Japan is not short of helpful advice from visitors to Tokyo.

He also stressed the importance of using monetary and fiscal policy in concert. 
Japan's central bankers have heard such arguments before, and ignored them.

HE MAY not get invited to many summits, but Kim Jong Il usually finds a way to ruin the party. On June 9th North Korea's official news agency upstaged the final day of a meeting in Tokyo between South Korea's recently elected president, Roh Moo-hyun, and Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi. A statement said that North Korea had a right to seek ""nuclear deterrence"" against ""hostile"" American policies. It was one of the North's clearest public declarations yet--though worse things have been said privately--that it is intent on developing a nuclear capability.
For all the bluster, however, Mr Kim had reason to worry about the summit in Tokyo. Messrs Roh and Koizumi had many bilateral issues to discuss, from efforts to put their countries' awkward history behind them to plans for boosting trade and investment. Top of the agenda, though, was their joint effort, in concert with America, to get North Korea to back away from its previous nuclear threats. 
The two leaders issued a statement on June 7th which repeated what Mr Roh had said previously: that any move by North Korea to develop nuclear weapons would not be tolerated. And although Mr Roh said that he would prefer not to talk much about the potential consequences of bad behaviour--he hopes to help Mr Kim save face--he did concede that ""we should carry out dialogue and pressure side by side"". 
This is precisely the united message that America and Japan have been trying to send North Korea. George Bush won support for this approach in his own meetings with Mr Roh and Mr Koizumi last month. America's two main allies in Asia have now affirmed it in a meeting of their own. Moreover, Mr Roh's handling of several other events in the past week suggests that the North's Mr Kim is having a hard time splitting South Korea away from the powerful countries arrayed against him.
Start with Japan. The Japanese public's fear of North Korean ballistic missiles and weapons programmes, and outrage over last September's revelations about its abducting of Japanese nationals, have made it much easier for Mr Koizumi to take a strong line on security issues--issues that his predecessors would have fudged. On the day that Mr Roh arrived in Tokyo, for example, Japan's parliament passed new ""contingency"" laws making it easier for the country's armed forces, hitherto severely constrained by Japan's pacifist constitution, to respond quickly to attacks at home. 
This was a step towards normality for Japan, and the sort of thing that prickly neighbours might pounce on, even though the moves are purely defensive in scope. Yet Mr Roh took the laws' passage in his stride, enduring the inevitable abuse from politicians at home. Lee Sang-bae, chief policymaker of the opposition Grand National Party, dismissed Mr Roh's entire trip as ""idiotic diplomacy"", saying that he could not understand why the president ""toasted the Japanese emperor on Memorial Day and made a visit to Japan on the day when contingency bills were passed.""
Nor did Mr Roh balk when a North Korean ferry, the Man Gyong Bong, had to cancel a port call in Japan over the weekend after Japanese authorities threatened to search her. The ferry has been named by Japan's government as a frequent courier of dual-use technology and illicit money to North Korea. Clamping down on such shipments--Japan is looking closely at other ferries too--certainly seems more like pressure than dialogue. And just to drive home the point, Mr Roh confirmed, while in Japan, that he would not meet his North Korean counterpart bilaterally until the current nuclear impasse is resolved. Mr Kim could not have taken much cheer from the Roh-Koizumi summit.
He could not have been pleased, either, by America's announcement, just before it, that it would be pressing ahead with plans to restructure its forces in South Korea. Paul Wolfowitz, the deputy Pentagon chief, confirmed that the 2nd Infantry Division, which accounts for 14,000 of America's 37,000 troops in South Korea, would eventually be moved back from the front lines, to south of Seoul.
The Pentagon has been talking about such a move for months, as part of its overall plans to make its 100,000 troops in Asia more nimble and less vulnerable to attack. It has raised hackles in South Korea, though. Some Koreans accuse the United States of abandoning it, others of setting the stage for an attack on the North. Yet Mr Roh, who drew a large chunk of his electoral support from young anti-American voters, has reluctantly accepted the shift. His only request was for America to wait until after the current nuclear tensions subside before making the move. 
So what happens next? Senior officials from America, Japan and South Korea will meet in Hawaii on June 12th and 13th, and are expected to call for multilateral talks. North Korea has tried to insist on bilateral talks with the Americans, while American officials insist that the nuclear problem must be solved by including all of North Korea's regional neighbours.
What America is not prepared to do, whatever the format, is to give commitments to North Korea that will make it easier for the regime to avoid collapse. This approach is what Mr Kim deems ""hostile"", and he still hopes to bully South Korea into breaking ranks with its allies. This week, he looked like failing.","It has not been a good week for North Korea 's Kim Jong Il

WITH a masterful flick of his wand, our bespectacled hero vanquishes the evil forces that threaten the world. Not Harry Potter, but Alan Greenspan, the owlish chairman of America's Federal Reserve, whom many on Wall Street believe to be an even more powerful wizard. On June 25th the Fed, seeking to ward off deflation, cut interest rates by a quarter-point to 1.0%, their lowest level in 45 years. In anticipation of such wizardry, investors had already pushed American share prices up by more than 20% above their mid-March lows. Share prices dipped after the rate cut as some investors, hoping for a half-point cut, were disappointed. But the markets still seem to believe that the Fed can not only see off deflation, but also return America to a path of robust economic growth. Unfortunately, this hope is more hogwash than Hogwarts. 
The market rally is built on fragile foundations. Indeed, the price/earnings ratio for the S&P 500 is now 33 (based on past profits), higher than at the market's peak in March 2000. Over the past three years America's economy has received perhaps its biggest monetary and fiscal stimulus in history. A budget surplus of 1.4% of GDP in 2000 has turned into an estimated deficit of 4.6% of GDP this year. Short-term interest rates have been cut 13 times, from 6.5% at the start of 2001. Long-term bond yields have also tumbled. Given all this, the economy's below-trend growth for the third year running suggests that policy weapons may have lost some of their power. Will this week's rate cut make a difference? 
In the first half of 2003, America's GDP grew at an annual average rate of about 1.5%. Many economists predict that growth will rebound to 3.5-4% in the second half. The Fed's latest cut is simply insurance against the risk of deflation. America's core inflation rate (excluding food and energy) has fallen from 2.6% in January 2002 to 1.6% in May. On the surface, May's figures suggested that the risk of deflation was fading: core inflation edged up. But the proportion of individual prices in the consumer-price index that fell over the past 12 months rose to a new high. According to Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, the 12-month rise in the underlying consumer-price index, excluding non-discretionary housing and health-care costs, fell to an all-time low of under 0.4%. A similar measure gave early warning of deflation in Japan. 
Some economists argue that America is sure to escape deflation so long as it avoids another recession. They may be wrong. Inflation depends not on the rate of growth but on the level of output relative to potential, ie, the output gap. Historically there has been a close relationship between the output gap and the direction of change in inflation. If, as now, the output gap is negative (ie, actual output is below potential) inflation falls; if the gap is positive, inflation rises (see chart 1 on next page). Even if America's growth returns to its trend rate of just over 3% a year, the output gap (now about 2% of GDP) will remain large for a couple more years; so inflation will keep falling. To be sure of preventing deflation, America needs to grow faster than trend. 
Forecasters have been consistently overoptimistic. In March 2002 The Economist's poll of forecasters offered an average prediction for America's GDP growth this year of 3.6%; that has since been trimmed to 2.2%. That shortfall is popularly blamed on the war in Iraq, which dented business and consumer confidence. The Conference Board's index of consumer confidence has improved since the war ended in April, albeit by less than had been hoped. Consumers are fretful about other things besides war and terrorism, notably the dire state of America's jobs market.
Hubble, bubble
The consensus view that America's growth will now rebound to above trend for a few years is based on the belief that America's economy is fundamentally sound, so that the recent massive monetary and fiscal stimulus will spur it to grow faster. Yet ""sound"" is an odd word to choose to describe an economy with too much debt, too little saving and an unsustainable current-account deficit.
America's bubble in the late 1990s created excesses that still need to be purged before the economy can resume sustained vigorous growth. The best measure of those excesses is the private-sector financial balance (see chart 2). In the 40 years up to 1997 America's private sector was always a net saver, meaning that total income of households and firms was greater than their spending. Net private saving averaged 2.6% of GDP. But the bubble encouraged a massive boom in borrowing and spending, pushing the private sector into a net deficit of 5% of GDP in 2000. That has since been trimmed. Even so, in the first quarter of 2003 the private sector was running a deficit of more than 1% of GDP. That means it still has a long way to go to restore its financial health. 
Households have done much less than firms to repair their balance sheets. The main reason why they could delay this adjustment is that they have been able to borrow against the rising value of their homes. According to Merrill Lynch, over the past six months household debt has increased at its fastest pace for 17 years. The ratio of debt to household income has risen to 111%, up from 102% in 2001.
House prices now look overvalued by past standards. Most economists, including Mr Greenspan, dismiss talk of a housing bubble. But suppose house prices were to stabilise at their current level, rather than actually to fall: even if interest rates stayed low, the scope for further home-equity withdrawal would diminish sharply. So long as interest rates are falling, households can increase debt without any rise in debt service. But once rates hit bottom--and they must be near that in America--the pace of borrowing needs to slow if debt-servicing costs are not to explode. Even with today's historically low interest rates, household debt service is close to a record high as a percentage of disposable income. If new borrowing slows sharply, so will consumer spending, dragging GDP growth back below trend. 
Jan Hatzius, an economist at Goldman Sachs, reckons that the recent decline in short- and long-term interest rates, along with the boost to wealth from rising share prices, will again postpone the necessary adjustment of household balance sheets. But it has to occur eventually. At some point households need to save more and spend less. Mr Hatzius concludes that GDP growth will falter again by around the middle of next year. 
Companies have done more than households to cut costs and reduce new borrowing. But their outstanding debts still loom large, and capacity utilisation remains low, so there is unlikely to be another investment boom in the near future. Weak pricing power is also holding back profits. Total profits across the economy, as measured in the national accounts, rose at an annual rate of only 4% in the first quarter. The recent surge in share prices appears to assume that profits will grow at a strapping double-digit pace over the next year, but that will be hard if inflation continues to slide.
America's escape route
One reason for hoping that America will avoid deflation is a weaker dollar, which will support exports and boost import prices. But devaluation will merely serve to export deflationary pressure to economies that already look vulnerable. Deflation is a global concern. Nominal GDP growth in the G7 rich economies has increased at an annual pace of only 2% over the past two quarters.
Since its bubble burst in 2000, America's real GDP growth has remained faster than that in the euro area and Japan. American consumer spending has outpaced the rest by an even bigger margin, growing at an annual rate of 3%, compared with 0.8% in Germany and 1.3% in Japan. Europe is on the brink of recession. The Economist's poll of forecasters has reduced its GDP growth prediction for the euro area in 2003 to 0.8%, from 2.8% a year ago.
Germany is already back in recession. Its growth over the past three years has been even slower than Japan's, and it is tipped to see virtually no growth this year, compared with 0.9% in Japan. A research paper by the IMF recently warned of a high risk that deflation could soon emerge in Germany. Preliminary figures suggest that Germany's inflation rate rose to 1.0% in June, but its core rate is still falling. 
The problem for Germany is that interest rates are set by the European Central Bank (ECB). Because Germany has lower inflation than the rest of the euro area, real interest rates are higher in Germany, even though it has by far the weakest economy. Indeed, growth in the euro area excluding Germany has been virtually the same as in the United States over the past three years (see chart 3 on next page). Critics of the euro area who focus only on Germany therefore tend to have an overly pessimistic view.
Throughout the euro area, exports are being squeezed by the rise in the euro, which has risen by about 15% in trade-weighted terms since the start of 2002. The euro is now above most estimates of fair value against the dollar, but it could well climb further. To correct America's massive current-account deficit, the dollar needs to become cheaper still; because many of its biggest trading partners, such as Japan and China, are resisting a rise in their currencies, this means it will have to fall further against the euro. Several forecasters now suggest that the euro could hit $1.40 by the end of next year.
A falling dollar need not export deflation to Europe, so long as the ECB offsets the impact of currency appreciation with lower interest rates. Later this year, Jean-Claude Trichet is to take over as the ECB's new president. The Frenchman is a better communicator than the Dutch incumbent, Wim Duisenburg, but it is not obvious that he will push for any broad softening of policy. The ECB likes to argue that nobody worries about deflation in a single state of the United States, so why should deflation matter in Germany? The answer is that Germany accounts for 30% of the euro-area economy, so there is a bigger risk that it could drag the rest down. The other big difference is that there is more labour mobility between states in America, and also larger fiscal transfers from central to state governments, which makes it easier for depressed states to recover. 
Most economists reckon that inflation in the euro area will fall faster than the ECB expects. Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein forecasts that inflation could be below 0.5% in the second half of 2004 (down from 1.9% now). It concludes that interest rates will be cut to 1% (from today's 2%) by early next year. 
Germany is certain again this year to breach the ceiling set by Europe's stability pact for its budget deficit of 3% of GDP. But that is only because the weak economy has depressed tax revenues; German fiscal policy will be acting as a brake on the economy. France and Italy also look likely to overshoot the 3% limit, but not by enough to allow a fiscal easing. Under pressure from weak growth, some governments are leaning to more fiscal loosening in 2004. There is growing political support in Germany for income-tax cuts to be brought forward a year to January 2004. But Hans Eichel, the finance minister, insists that this must be paid for by cuts in spending or tax breaks, which would offset any economic stimulus. 
While Germany stands out, the rest of the euro area is hardly a picture of economic health. New figures this week showed that consumer confidence fell in June in Italy and Belgium to nine- and ten-year lows respectively. In the Netherlands business confidence fell to its lowest level since 1985. This poses a puzzle. Why does the euro area seem weaker than the United States, when its financial imbalances are supposedly more modest? Europeans who had suspected that America's new economy was largely a bubble had longed for the day when they could gloat over America's misfortunes. Instead, they are hurting even more. 
One reason is that Europe, too, suffered its excesses, with massive overinvestment in telecoms. In addition, European investors financed much of America's boom and have since suffered big losses. As the dollar falls, those losses will swell. Europe's failure to push faster with its structural reforms has also meant that a drop in demand causes bigger losses in output and jobs than in America. The ECB and the fiscal stability pact have also prevented the euro area benefiting from anything like the sort of stimulus enjoyed in America. 
Lessons from Japan
Not only has Japan's economy actually outperformed Germany's in recent years, but in the year to the first quarter official figures suggest that it was the fastest-growing of the G7 economies, with GDP up by 2.6%. The snag is that prices, as measured by the GDP deflator, fell by 3.3%. In other words, Japan's economy continues to shrink in nominal terms, making it harder for firms to work off their excessive debts. The rise in the yen over the past year, though a lot smaller than the rise in the euro, may also damage Japan's recovery. 
Since Toshihiko Fukui took over as its new governor in March, the Bank of Japan has shown a bit more flexibility in its policy to try to halt deflation. The central bank has further increased the monetary base and, in an unprecedented move for a central bank, has announced that it will buy corporate debt with the aim of helping smaller firms to obtain loans. However, the bank continues to reject more radical measures to defeat deflation. Worse, the Koizumi government remains set on reducing the budget deficit, which risks snuffing out the recovery and worsening deflation. The best way to restore fiscal health is to end deflation. Faster growth in nominal GDP would help to boost tax revenues and reduce the deficit.
What lessons does Japan hold for America and Europe? The most important was spelled out in a research paper last year by a team of Fed economists. They concluded that Japan's monetary policy in the early 1990s looked appropriate, given forecasts at the time for growth and inflation. In other words, it is wrong to blame the central bank's incompetence for all of Japan's woes; nobody inside or outside the bank had forecast deflation. By the time it arrived it was too late. The lesson is that, when inflation is low and there is the slightest risk of deflation, policymakers should take out insurance by cutting interest rates more than they otherwise would. 
The Fed now seems to be following this advice, but it is running out of ammunition. There is little room to push short-term rates lower. Interest rates below 0.75%, say, could risk destabilising the short-term money market, because banks would have less incentive to hold idle cash in short-term deposits. However, the Fed insists that it still has the tools to fight deflation--even if, as officials insist, it is highly unlikely that they will be needed. These ""unconventional measures"" include large purchases of government bonds to reduce long-term interest rates, intervention to push down the dollar, or buying private securities to push up asset prices.
Nobody knows how effective such measures might be. But at least the Fed is trying to move inflationary expectations in the right direction, by saying that it stands ready to go down this road and publicly sounding confident that it can succeed. In contrast, by saying there is nothing it can do to end deflation, the Bank of Japan merely reinforces the expectation that deflation will persist. The Fed's most effective policy weapon so far has been to reduce bond yields, and thus borrowing costs, simply by airing the possibility of buying government bonds.
The Fed, it seems, will stop at nothing to keep the post-bubble economy afloat. Stephen Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley, worries that the Fed has become a ""serial bubble blower"". After playing a key role in nurturing the equity bubble of the late 1990s by holding down interest rates, it has since propped up the economy by fuelling first a property bubble and now a bond bubble. Recessions are normally periods when the excesses of previous booms are purged. The late 1990s boom created some of the worst excesses ever, yet the recession in 2001 was the mildest in history, so many excesses remain. The Fed is wise to guard against the danger of deflation, but this still leaves big concerns about the unbalanced state of the American economy. Even Mr Greenspan's wizardry may not be enough to ensure a sustained healthy recovery.","This week's American rate cut will not provide a magic cure that revives the ailing world economy 
WITH a masterful flick of his wand, our bespectacled hero vanquishes the evil forces that threaten the world. Not Harry Potter, but Alan Greenspan, the owlish chairman of America's Federal Reserve, whom many on Wall Street believe to be an even more powerful wizard. On June 25th the Fed, seeking to ward off deflation, cut interest rates by a quarter-point to 1.0%, their lowest level in 45 years. In anticipation of such wizardry, investors had already pushed American share prices up by more than 20% above their mid-March lows. Share prices dipped after the rate cut as some investors, hoping for a half-point cut, were disappointed. But the markets still seem to believe that the Fed can not only see off deflation, but also return America to a path of robust economic growth. Unfortunately, this hope is more hogwash than Hogwarts. 
The market rally is built on fragile foundations. Indeed, the price/earnings ratio for the S&P 500 is now 33 (based on past profits), higher than at the market's peak in March 2000. Over the past three years America's economy has received perhaps its biggest monetary and fiscal stimulus in history. A budget surplus of 1.4% of GDP in 2000 has turned into an estimated deficit of 4.6% of GDP this year. Short-term interest rates have been cut 13 times, from 6.5% at the start of 2001. Long-term bond yields have also tumbled. Given all this, the economy's below-trend growth for the third year running suggests that policy weapons may have lost some of their power. Will this week's rate cut make a difference? 
In the first half of 2003, America's GDP grew at an annual average rate of about 1.5%. Many economists predict that growth will rebound to 3.5-4% in the second half. The Fed's latest cut is simply insurance against the risk of deflation. America's core inflation rate (excluding food and energy) has fallen from 2.6% in January 2002 to 1.6% in May. On the surface, May's figures suggested that the risk of deflation was fading: core inflation edged up. But the proportion of individual prices in the consumer-price index that fell over the past 12 months rose to a new high. According to Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, the 12-month rise in the underlying consumer-price index, excluding non-discretionary housing and health-care costs, fell to an all-time low of under 0.4%. A similar measure gave early warning of deflation in Japan. 
Some economists argue that America is sure to escape deflation so long as it avoids another recession. They may be wrong. Inflation depends not on the rate of growth but on the level of output relative to potential, ie, the output gap. Historically there has been a close relationship between the output gap and the direction of change in inflation. If, as now, the output gap is negative (ie, actual output is below potential) inflation falls; if the gap is positive, inflation rises (see chart 1 on next page). Even if America's growth returns to its trend rate of just over 3% a year, the output gap (now about 2% of GDP) will remain large for a couple more years; so inflation will keep falling. To be sure of preventing deflation, America needs to grow faster than trend. 
Forecasters have been consistently overoptimistic. In March 2002 The Economist's poll of forecasters offered an average prediction for America's GDP growth this year of 3.6%; that has since been trimmed to 2.2%. That shortfall is popularly blamed on the war in Iraq, which dented business and consumer confidence. The Conference Board's index of consumer confidence has improved since the war ended in April, albeit by less than had been hoped. Consumers are fretful about other things besides war and terrorism, notably the dire state of America's jobs market.
Hubble, bubble
The consensus view that America's growth will now rebound to above trend for a few years is based on the belief that America's economy is fundamentally sound, so that the recent massive monetary and fiscal stimulus will spur it to grow faster. Yet ""sound"" is an odd word to choose to describe an economy with too much debt, too little saving and an unsustainable current-account deficit.
America's bubble in the late 1990s created excesses that still need to be purged before the economy can resume sustained vigorous growth.

Even so, in the first quarter of 2003 the private sector was running a deficit of more than 1% of GDP. That means it still has a long way to go to restore its financial health.

IT WAS a futile gesture, but Japan's local leaders are desperate. Earlier this month the governor of Tottori prefecture, Yoshihiro Katayama, got angry at a national panel on decentralisation when it advised the government to postpone granting more tax authority to local areas. Mr Katayama threatened to punish the panel's chairman, who is also the chairman of Toshiba, by refusing to buy equipment from the electronics giant. Though Mr Katayama soon recanted his threat, he and other governors will keep pressing the prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, to loosen the centre's grip on local finances.
On June 26th, as The Economist went to press, the prime minister's Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy was preparing to approve a plan that would on its face make local governments more independent of the national treasury. But the most useful reforms have been blocked by a combination of the civil service and politicians of the ruling party. Mr Koizumi's failure once again to take on these vested interests raises doubts about whether this latest plan will genuinely give more autonomy to local governments. 
The case of Osaka, Japan's second-biggest city, illustrates the problem. Demand there has been weak for more than a decade. But on top of this, Osaka has been gutted by what some locals call a ""double hollowing out"". While factories have moved overseas, corporate offices, with fewer factory ties to hold them, have relocated to Tokyo. At 8.4%, the local unemployment rate is three percentage points above the national average. So bleak is the outlook that locals are vesting inordinate hope in the possibility that a summer of continuing triumphs by the local baseball team, the Hanshin Tigers, will spark a championship spending spree. 
All of this has taken a toll on Osaka's prefectural government. Corporate taxes, one of Osaka's main sources of independent revenue, have fallen from yen835 billion ($6.1 billion) in 1989 to a projected yen334 billion this year. Spending, meanwhile, has increased. Some of the local government's financial bind is its own fault--it launched several big infrastructure projects when it thought that demand would recover--but local officials also blame the central government for dictating much of their spending. National health, welfare, and education rules determine much of the government's outlays, for example, and subsidies from the central government come with little discretionary power. 
Elsewhere, many smaller prefectures are in a similar bind. Japan's total prefectural tax revenues are expected to fall to yen13.4 trillion this year, from yen15.3 trillion in fiscal 1998 (see chart). Kunji Okue, an economist at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein in Tokyo, says that because their ability to raise taxes, borrow money and cut national programmes are all limited by Tokyo, many prefectures are forced to make large cuts in their discretionary spending.
Mr Koizumi's initial idea was to give prefectures more autonomy to spend as they choose, while giving them more discretion to set taxes. The latest plan, which calls for largely offsetting cuts in subsidies and tax transfers, merely moves money around while postponing reforms that would give local governments real freedom. Too bad they cannot boycott the central government to voice their dismay.","Wrangling with the national bureaucrats

OPEN up. With that simple demand, Commodore Matthew Perry steamed into Japan's Edo (now Tokyo) Bay with his ""black ships of evil mien"" 150 years ago this week. Before the black ships arrived on July 8th 1853, the Tokugawa shoguns had run Japan for 250 years as a reclusive feudal state. Carrying a letter from America's president, Millard Fillmore, and punctuating his message with cannon fire, Commodore Perry ordered Japan's rulers to drop their barriers and open the country to trade. Over the next century and a half, Japan emerged as one of history's great economic success stories. It is now the largest creditor to the world that it previously shunned. 
Attempts to dissect this economic ""miracle"" often focus intently on the aftermath of the second world war. Japan's occupation by the Americans, who set out to rebuild the country as a pacifist liberal democracy, helped to set the stage for four decades of jaw-dropping growth. 
Yet the origins of the miracle--and of the continual tensions it has created inside Japan and out--stretch further back. When General Douglas MacArthur accepted Japan's surrender in 1945 aboard the battleship Missouri, the Americans made sure to hang Commodore Perry's flag from 1853 over the ship's rear turret. They had not only ended a brutal war and avenged the attack on Pearl Harbour--they had also, they thought, won an argument with Japan that was by then nearly a century old.
America's enduring frustration--in the decades after 1853, in 1945, and even today--has not been so much that Japan is closed, but that it long ago mastered the art of opening up on its own terms. Before and after those black ships steamed into Edo Bay, after all, plenty of other countries were opened to trade by western cannon. What set Japan apart--perhaps aided by America's lack of colonial ambition--was its ability to decide for itself how to make the process of opening suit its own aims.
One consequence of this is that Japan's trading partners, especially America, have never tired of complaining about its economic practices. Japan-bashing reached its most recent peak in the 1980s, when American politicians and businessmen blamed ""unfair"" competition for Japan's large trade surpluses. But similar complaints could be heard within a few decades of Commodore Perry's mission. The attitude was summed up by ""Mr Dooley"", a character created by Peter Finley Dunne, an American satirist, at the close of the 19th century: ""Th' trouble is whin the gallant Commodore kicked opn th' door, we didn't go in. They come out."" 
Nowadays, although poor countries still want Japan (along with America and the European Union) to free up trade in farm goods, most rich-country complaints about Japan are aimed at its approach to macroeconomics and finance, rather than its trade policies. Japan's insistence on protecting bad banks and worthless companies, say its many critics, and its reluctance to let foreign investors help fix the economy, have prevented Japanese demand from recovering for far too long. Once again, the refrain goes, Japan is unfairly taking what it can get from the world economy--exports and overseas profits have been its only source of comfort for years--without giving anything back.
While these complaints have always had some merit, they have all too often been made in a way that misses a crucial point: Japan's economic miracle, though at times paired with policies ranging from protectionist to xenophobic, has nevertheless proved a huge blessing to the rest of the world as well. The ""structural impediments"" that shut out imports in the 1980s did indeed keep Japanese consumers and foreign exporters from enjoying some of the fruits of that miracle; but its export prowess allowed western consumers to enjoy better and cheaper cars and electronics even as Japanese households grew richer. 
Similarly, Japan's resistance to inward investment is indefensible, not least because it allows salvageable Japanese companies to wither; but its outward investment has helped to transform much of East Asia into a thriving economic region, putting a huge dent in global poverty. Indeed, one of the most impressive aspects of Japan's economic miracle is that, even while reaping only half the potential gains from free trade and investment, it has still managed to do the world so much good over the past half-century.
Setting an example
Arguably, however, Japan's other big effect on the world has been even more important. It has shown clearly that you do not have to embrace ""western"" culture in order to modernise your economy and prosper. From the very beginning, Japan set out to have one without the other, an approach encapsulated by the saying ""Japanese spirit, western things"". 
How did Japan pull it off? In part, because the historical combination of having once been wide open, and then rapidly slamming shut, taught Japan how to control the aperture through which new ideas and practices streamed in. After eagerly absorbing Chinese culture, philosophy, writing and technology for roughly a millennium, Japan followed this with 250 years of near-total isolation. Christianity was outlawed, and overseas travel was punishable by death. 
Although some Japanese scholars were aware of developments in Europe--which went under the broad heading of ""Dutch studies""--the shoguns strictly limited their ability to put any of that knowledge to use. They confined all economic and other exchanges with Europeans to a tiny man-made island in the south-western port of Nagasaki. When the Americans arrived in 1853, the Japanese told them to go to Nagasaki and obey the rules. Commodore Perry refused, and Japan concluded that the only way to ""expel the barbarians"" in future would be to embrace their technology and grow stronger.
But once the door was ajar, the Japanese appetite for ""western things"" grew unbounded. A modern guidebook entry on the port city of Yokohama, near Tokyo, notes that within two decades of the black ships' arrival it boasted the country's first bakery (1860), photo shop (1862), telephone (1869), beer brewery (1869), cinema (1870), daily newspaper (1870), and public lavatory (1871). 
Yet, at the same time, Japan's rulers also managed to frustrate many of the westerners' wishes. The constant tension between Japan's desire to measure up to the West--economically, diplomatically, socially and, until 1945, militarily--and its resistance to cultural change has played out in countless ways, good and bad, to this day. 
Much of it has reflected a healthy wish to hang on to local traditions. This is far more than just a matter of bowing and sleeping on futons and tatami, or of old women continuing to wear kimonos. The Japanese have also clung to distinct ways of speaking, interacting in the workplace, and showing each other respect, all of which have helped people to maintain harmony in many aspects of everyday life. 
Unfortunately, however, ever since they first opened to the West, anti-liberal Japanese leaders have preferred another interpretation of ""Japanese spirit, western things"". Instead of simply trying to preserve small cultural traditions, Japan's power-brokers tried to absorb western technology in a way that would shield them from political competition and protect their interests. Imitators still abound in Japan and elsewhere. 
In East Asia alone, Malaysia's Mahathir Mohamad, Thailand's Thaksin Shinawatra, and even the Chinese Communist Party all see Japan as proof that there is a way to join the rich-country club without making national leaders or their friends accountable. These disciples of Japan's brand of modernisation often use talk of local culture to resist economic and political threats to their power. But they are careful to find ways to do this without undermining all trade and investment, since growth is the only thing propping them up.
Japan's first attempt to pursue this strategy, it must never be forgotten, grew increasingly horrific as its inconsistencies mounted. In 1868, while western writers were admiring those bakeries and cinemas, Japan's nationalist leaders were ""restoring"" the emperor's significance to that of an imaginary golden age. The trouble, as Ian Buruma describes in his new book, ""Inventing Japan"" ()see page 79, is that the ""Japanese spirit"" they valued was a concoction that mixed in several bad western ideas: German theories on racial purity, European excuses for colonialism, and the observation from Christianity that a single overarching deity (in Japan's case the newly restored emperor) could motivate soldiers better than a loose contingent of Shinto gods. This combination would eventually whip countless young Japanese into a murderous xenophobic frenzy and foster rapacious colonial aggression.
It also led Japan into a head-on collision with the United States, since colonialism directly contradicted America's reasons for sending Commodore Perry. In ""The Clash"", a 1998 book on the history of American-Japanese relations, Walter LaFeber argues that America's main goal in opening Japan was not so much to trade bilaterally, as to enlist Japan's support in creating a global marketplace including, in particular, China. 
At first, the United States opened Japan because it was on the way to China and had coal for American steamships. Later, as Japan gained industrial and military might, America sought to use it as a counterweight to European colonial powers that wanted to divide China among their empires. America grew steadily more furious, therefore, as Japan turned to colonialism and tried to carve up China on its own. The irony for America was that at its very moment of triumph, after nearly a century of struggling with European powers and then Japan to keep China united and open, it ended up losing it to communism.
A half-century later, however, and with a great deal of help from Japan, America has achieved almost exactly what it set out to do as a brash young power in the 1850s, when it had barely tamed its own continent and was less than a decade away from civil war. Mainland China is whole. It has joined the World Trade Organisation and is rapidly integrating itself into the global economy. It is part of a vast East Asian trade network that nevertheless carries out more than half of its trade outside the region. And this is all backed up by an array of American security guarantees in the Pacific. The resemblance to what America set out to do in 1853 is striking.
For both Japan and America, therefore, the difficult 150-year relationship has brought impressive results. They are now the world's two biggest economies, and have driven most of the world's technological advances over the past half-century. America has helped Japan by opening it up, destroying its militarists and rebuilding the country afterwards, and, for the last 50 years, providing security and market access while Japan became an advanced export dynamo. Japan has helped America by improving on many of its technologies, teaching it new manufacturing techniques, spurring on American firms with its competition, and venturing into East Asia to trade and invest.
And now?
What, then, will the continuing tension between Japanese spirit and western things bring in the decades ahead? 
For America, though it will no doubt keep complaining, Japan's resistance to change is not the real worry. Instead, the same two Asian challenges that America has taken on ever since Commodore Perry sailed in will remain the most worrying risks: potential rivalries, and the desire by some leaders to form exclusive regional economic blocks. America still needs Japan, its chief Asian ally, to combat these dangers. Japan's failure to reform, however, could slowly sap its usefulness.
For Japan, the challenges are far more daunting. Many of them stem from the increasing toll that Japan's old ways are taking on the economy. Chief among these is Japan's hostility towards competition in many aspects of economic life. Although competitive private firms have driven much of its innovation and growth, especially in export-intensive industries, Japan's political system continues to hobble competition and private enterprise in many domestic sectors.
In farming, health care and education, for example, recent efforts to allow private companies a role have been swatted down by co-operatives, workers, politicians and civil servants. In other inefficient sectors, such as construction and distribution, would-be losers continue to be propped up by government policy. Now that Japan is no longer growing rapidly, it is harder for competitive forces to function without allowing some of those losers to fail.
Japan's foreign critics are correct, moreover, that its macroeconomic and financial policies are a disgrace. The central bank, the finance ministry, the bank regulators, the prime minister and the ruling-party politicians all blame each other for failing to deal with the problems. All the while, Japan continues to limp along, growing far below its potential as its liabilities mount. Its public-sector debt, for instance, is a terrifying 140% of GDP.
Lately, there has been much talk about employing more western things to help lift Japan out of its mess. The prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, talks about deregulatory measures that have been tried in North America, Europe and elsewhere. Western auditing and corporate governance techniques--applied in a Japanese way, of course--are also lauded as potential fixes. Even inward foreign direct investment is held out by Mr Koizumi as part of the solution: he has pledged to double it over the next five years. 
The trouble with all of these ideas, however, is that nobody in Japan is accountable for implementing them. Moreover, most of the politicians and bureaucrats who prevent competitive pressures from driving change are themselves protected from political competition. It is undeniable that real change in Japan would bring unwelcome pain for many workers and small-business owners. 
Still, Japan's leaders continue to use these cultural excuses, as they have for 150 years, to mask their own efforts to cling to power and prestige. The ugly, undemocratic and illiberal aspects of Japanese traditionalism continue to lurk behind its admirable elements. 
One reason they can do so is because Japan's nationalists have succeeded completely in one of their original goals: financial independence. The desire to avoid relying on foreign capital has underlain Japan's economic policies from the time it opened up to trade. Those policies have worked. More than 90% of government bonds are in the hands of domestic investors, and savings accounts run by the postal service play a huge role in propping up the system.
Paradoxically, financial self-reliance has thus become Japan's curse. There are worse curses to have, of course: compare Japan with the countless countries that have wrecked their economies by overexposing themselves to volatile international capital markets. Nevertheless, Japan's financial insularity further protects its politicians, who do not have to compete with other countries to get funding.
Theories abound as to how all of this might change. Its history ought to remind anyone that, however long it takes, Japan usually moves rapidly once a consensus takes shape. Potential pressures for change could come from the reversal of its trade surpluses, an erosion of support from all those placid postal savers, or the unwinding of ties that allow bad banks and bad companies to protect each other from investors. The current political stalemate could also give way to a coherent plan, either because one political or bureaucratic faction defeats the others or because a strong leader emerges who can force them to co-operate. 
The past 150 years suggest, however, that one important question is impossible to answer in advance: will it be liberalism or its enemies who turn such changes to their advantage? Too often, Japan's conservative and nationalist leaders have managed to spot the forces of change more quickly than their liberal domestic counterparts, and have used those changes to seize the advantage and preserve their power. Just as in the past, East Asia's fortunes still greatly depend on the outcome of the struggle between these perennial Japanese contenders.

AFTER more than a decade of stagnation, a little good news goes a long way in Japan. Some encouraging economic signs over the past few weeks, therefore, have made many people in Tokyo giddy with optimism. The stockmarket has been rallying, companies' profits are up, wage income is increasing, and business investment looks set to enjoy a healthy rise. This does not add up to a solution for Japan's structural problems; as the past has shown, a small cyclical rebound is not enough to pull the economy out of its rut. Yet it does seem that this year is shaping up to be less gloomy than the previous two. 
Stockmarket investors certainly like what they see. After hitting a 20-year low in late April, the Nikkei 225 index has risen by 30%. On June 8th, it briefly topped the 10,000 mark for the first time since last August. This rally is being driven partly by looser monetary policy in rich economies, which has helped equity markets worldwide. In America, Europe and elsewhere shares have risen sharply since the war in Iraq more-or-less ended. Japan lagged behind, by several weeks. But even struggling along after the rest of the world is a small triumph for Japan these days. 
Besides, some happy developments at home have given spirits a lift. For one, the painful but cost-trimming job cuts of the past couple of years seem at last to be producing results. In the fiscal year that ended in March, a collection of 1,600 non-financial companies tracked by the Nikon Keizai, a business daily, earned roughly Y5.23 trillion ($44.4 billion) in combined net profit, after losing money the year before. 
Although those job cuts were necessary, it is hard to reverse a deflationary spiral just by trimming costs. If most firms are sacking workers, incomes and therefore sales and new investment are all liable to suffer. So it is cheering that in fact domestic demand and incomes seem to be rising as well. Real GDP grew by 2.6% in the first quarter of 2003. A 2.5% monthly rise in industrial output in May suggests the second quarter will also turn in decent growth.
Both employment and wages have risen lately, and large firms are planning to increase summer bonuses by an average of 4.3%. Best of all, they are confident enough to make reasonably optimistic investment plans.

AFTER more than a decade of stagnation, a little good news goes a long way in Japan. Some encouraging economic signs over the past few weeks, therefore, have made many people in Tokyo giddy with optimism. The stockmarket has been rallying, companies' profits are up, wage income is increasing, and business investment looks set to enjoy a healthy rise. This does not add up to a solution for Japan's structural problems; as the past has shown, a small cyclical rebound is not enough to pull the economy out of its rut. Yet it does seem that this year is shaping up to be less gloomy than the previous two. 
Stockmarket investors certainly like what they see. After hitting a 20-year low in late April, the Nikkei 225 index has risen by 30%. On June 8th, it briefly topped the 10,000 mark for the first time since last August. This rally is being driven partly by looser monetary policy in rich economies, which has helped equity markets worldwide. In America, Europe and elsewhere shares have risen sharply since the war in Iraq more-or-less ended. Japan lagged behind, by several weeks. But even struggling along after the rest of the world is a small triumph for Japan these days. 
Besides, some happy developments at home have given spirits a lift. For one, the painful but cost-trimming job cuts of the past couple of years seem at last to be producing results. In the fiscal year that ended in March, a collection of 1,600 non-financial companies tracked by the Nikon Keizai, a business daily, earned roughly Y5.23 trillion ($44.4 billion) in combined net profit, after losing money the year before. 
Although those job cuts were necessary, it is hard to reverse a deflationary spiral just by trimming costs. If most firms are sacking workers, incomes and therefore sales and new investment are all liable to suffer. So it is cheering that in fact domestic demand and incomes seem to be rising as well. Real GDP grew by 2.6% in the first quarter of 2003. A 2.5% monthly rise in industrial output in May suggests the second quarter will also turn in decent growth.
Both employment and wages have risen lately, and large firms are planning to increase summer bonuses by an average of 4.3%. Best of all, they are confident enough to make reasonably optimistic investment plans. The most recent quarterly Tankan survey of business sentiment, taken in June, forecast a 4.9% recovery in large firms' capital expenditures. 
All this suggests that, for the time being at least, the pace of deflation may be about to slow a bit. There are signs that prices of durable goods are falling less rapidly, and consumers seem to expect deflationary pressures to ease.

JAPAN'S constitution forbids it to maintain an army: but it has 240,000 men under arms. They are not soldiers, you understand, but members of the land, sea and air ""self-defence forces"". Japan does not have tanks--those would sound too much like the sort of thing an army might have. But it does have ""speciality vehicles"", which look remarkably like, well, tanks. It does not have bombers, for much the same reason: bombers are primarily offensive rather than defensive weapons. But it does have ""support fighters"" that carry bombs. Japan is the second-largest contributor to the United Nations peacekeeping budget, and the only country that is certain to get a permanent seat on the Security Council if it is ever reformed. Yet it plays only a negligible part in UN peacekeeping operations. During the 1991 Gulf war, its contribution was financial and logistical, but not military; during the war on terror, it has been purely verbal: valuable in both cases, but not nearly enough. This is the strange world of Japanese security policy, almost 60 years after the end of the second world war.
Bluntly put, Japan's position in the world now requires it to shoulder a bigger burden, and do so more straightforwardly. Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, has always understood this well enough. But, despite unprecedented personal popularity, he has moved slowly and with caution. His main achievement in the area of security to date has been the passage of a bill that would make it easier for the Japanese government to act swiftly in the event of an attack on Japanese territory: that is, in a purely defensive context.
Now this is changing. By the end of this month, and quite possibly by the time these words are published, he looks likely to have secured a much bigger objective: parliamentary approval to send about 1,000 troops to Iraq, to help the British and American occupation forces there. It will be the largest overseas deployment by Japan since the second world war, and, significantly, is not underwritten by a Security Council resolution (though one may yet come). The limitations of Japan's role are still clear: the soldiers will go only to areas that are nominally free of combat, and will only be used in non-combat roles, such as the transport of troops and ammunition. But they will be allowed to fire warning shots, as well as to return fire if fired upon. And this is only a first step. Reformers within Mr Koizumi's administration next want to see Japan award itself the right of collective self-defence, which means that its forces would be able to defend not just Japan and themselves, but their allies as well. At the moment, in the event of, say, an American spat with China, or a conflict with North Korea, Japan could do nothing to help its closest ally.
Many in Asia will see this as a bad thing. Japan's relations with its neighbours, and with China in particular, remain prickly even so long after the end of the war. Mr Koizumi's habit of visiting the Yasukuni shrine, where the souls of war criminals, as well as of millions of ordinary soldiers, are enshrined has not helped, though some of the blame also has belonged to China's geriatric leadership, only now giving way to a generation with less personal bitterness. But change is becoming inevitable. America's decision to pull back its troops in South Korea from their forward deployment, and probably to reduce their overall numbers too, is forcing hard thinking in Tokyo. The daily barrage of nuclear intimidation from North Korea is exerting a profound effect on the opinions of people who were once committed to pacifism. Many in Japan still argue that significant changes to Japan's security stance require a revision of Japan's constitution--though it has shown itself capable of considerable flexibility in the past. But a revision, 60 years on, is nothing to fear.","Japan is starting to take its security responsibilities seriously . High time too

SO FAR, Junichiro Koizumi's efforts to expand the role of Japan's armed forces have been carefully controlled political exercises. Shortly after September 11th 2001, Mr Koizumi's government passed a law to help America indirectly in Afghanistan by sending support ships to the Indian Ocean. Then, this June, it passed long-overdue ""emergency"" laws that will make it easier to respond to any attack on Japan's territory. Now parliament's upper house is preparing to approve yet another law, deploying troops to Iraq. Once this succeeds, however, Mr Koizumi and his fellows must brace themselves to lose control of the process they have set in motion. For the next big step in the evolution of Japan's armed forces could well occur far away from the predictable world of Japanese politics--when shooting starts in Iraq.
Of course, Mr Koizumi and his team will try to control and limit those risks. That is why even if the law clears the upper house, as expected, before the current Diet session ends on July 28th, Japan is unlikely to send troops to Iraq before this autumn. Before doing so, the government will take more time to study its options and co-ordinate with American and other forces. Although it will look for ways to do what coalition partners ask--mostly helping with logistics--the government will also try to confine its troops to relatively safe parts of Iraq, such as the area around Baghdad airport. It knows that if and when members of Japan's ""self-defence forces"" (SDF) do get caught up in skirmishes, Japanese voters will suddenly take much more notice of just how much defence policy has been changing. 
The SDF have been sent on peacekeeping missions before, such as to Cambodia in 1992 and East Timor in 2002. A deployment to Iraq, however, will be a far different undertaking if it goes ahead. Partly, that is because it will be more dangerous than those earlier operations. SDF personnel will be more heavily armed than on previous missions, and will be more prepared this time to have to use their weapons against potential threats to themselves and others. An even more important difference, however, is that this SDF operation will be the first that Japanese ground troops have embarked upon without wearing the blue helmets of the UN. 
If something goes wrong, therefore, it could prove a huge setback, not just for Mr Koizumi domestically, but also for proponents of a weightier Japanese role in world affairs. So far, Japan's public has largely supported Mr Koizumi's efforts. North Korea's nuclear threats, combined with last year's admission that the regime had long been abducting Japanese nationals, have left many Japanese feeling vulnerable. Although many opposed the war in Iraq, they have largely supported Mr Koizumi's decision to back the United States, since Japan needs America as an ally. 
Debate about the proper defence posture has also grown more normal. The laws clarifying Japan's response to a direct attack had been needed since the 1970s, but have only become discussible in the past year or so. Japanese are also talking more openly about the risks and merits of Japan acquiring nuclear weapons at some point in the future. Although this remains a very unlikely step, the current low-key debate seems more sensible than the previous taboo. People are also talking openly about whether Japan should strike first in the event of an imminent missile attack from North Korea. The defence agency has recently launched two spy satellites, Japan's first, to keep an eye on the dangerous neighbour. 
In short, Japan's defence policy has been slowly turning into a legitimate topic of calm democratic debate. Might a mishap in Iraq reverse these recent gains? The main opposition party, the Democratic Party of Japan, will certainly be in a position to point fingers. Although it helped to craft a compromise on the emergency laws passed in June, the Democrats have opposed the sending of SDF troops to Iraq. Having lost to the ruling coalition in the lower house, Naoto Kan, the Democrats' leader, gave up this week on attempts to broker a compromise in an upper-house committee. As The Economist went to press, the Democrats were planning a series of no-confidence motions against members of Mr Koizumi's government, in an effort to slow down--but with little hope of preventing--the bill's passage. 
If shooting continues in Iraq this autumn, however, Japanese voters could rally behind the Democrats. In recent weeks, their attitudes towards an Iraq deployment have cooled, as American and British casualties have continued to mount. One newspaper poll this week found that 55% of respondents are now opposed to sending in SDF troops. That figure will almost certainly rise sharply in the face of casualties, whether borne by Japanese troops or inflicted by them on bystanders. Mr Koizumi has made some impressive progress. But the next step will be the most perilous, and Japan's armed forces will have to take it on their own.","Is Japan really ready to send troops to Iraq ?

Armed with a recently announced merger with Ichiro Ozawa's Liberal Party, and plans for a new campaign manifesto, the 56-year-old Mr Kan says that he is ready to fight for power.
The merger--in effect, it will be more like an acquisition--will happen in September. Mr Kan's Democrats will absorb Japan's second-biggest opposition party and its 22 lower-house MPs. The Democrats will keep their name and take control of the merged party. The new party will still hold only 137 of 480 lower-house seats, but Mr Kan believes that the union will make it more competitive in the next general election because it will be easier for voters in many constituencies to unite behind a single opposition candidate. He also says he is pursuing an electoral pact with Japan's Social Democratic Party, another opposition outfit, at least in some places.
Mr Kan's cause may seem hopeless. His Democrats consistently get less than 10% support in opinion surveys (and the Liberals only another 2%), compared with over 30% support for the LDP. But Mr Kan points out that half of Japanese voters are not loyal to any political party, and that opposition parties have won a large share of those floating votes in recent elections. 
In 1998, for example, shortly after the DPJ was created through a merger of other parties, it stunned the LDP in upper-house elections despite having only 6% support in opinion polls a month before the vote. The prime minister at the time, Ryutaro Hashimoto, who had to scramble to maintain a majority coalition, resigned. Similarly, before the most recent lower-house elections, in June 2000, the Democrats were getting less than 10% support in newspaper polls. Yet it and the other three opposition parties astonished Japan by winning 20 more seats than the ruling coalition in the contest for 180 proportional-representation seats. It was only in the 300 first-past-the-post constituencies (where rural voters, who typically support the LDP, are grossly over-represented) that the ruling coalition cleaned up, not least because in many races the divided opposition fielded rival candidates. 
The Democrats still face problems, though. In 2000, the LDP prime minister was the unpopular Yoshiro Mori. By contrast, Japan's present prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, has a 45% popularity rating, even after a recent slide. So even with better arithmetic in the constituencies, the Democrats will have to run a much better campaign to succeed this time around.
Mr Kan thinks that a detailed campaign manifesto will help. The idea is to lay out specific policies with numerical targets, timetables and concrete plans for achieving them, so that voters can gauge whether parties' promises make sense. Such plans, a commonplace in western election campaigns, are a novelty in Japan, where vague commitments are the rule. Mr Koizumi took office promising to hold public borrowing to yen30 trillion ($240 billion) a year, for example, but with no blueprint for doing so. It was not long before he broke the pledge. 
The strangely radical idea of using manifestos first came from the country's local politicians. A handful of maverick governors have won elections in the past few years after laying out clear plans to reduce classroom sizes, change police deployments and meet other local concerns. These commitments, and the voters' support for their plans, have given such governors leverage in their battles with the central bureaucracy. The manifesto idea has thus gained popularity among many Japanese. More attention to specifics might also make for crisper debate and clearer choices in national elections.
Mr Kan has seized upon the idea, and the party is now mulling several dozen ideas--from overhauling the tax code, to pensions reform to deregulation initiatives--that it wants to include in its manifesto. The difficulty will be that the Democrats are hardly a coherent group. Mr Ozawa and his fellow Liberals have promised to go along with whatever manifesto the pre-merger Democrats decide upon. But even without the Liberals the party is divided on economics between socialists, social democrats, economic liberals and opportunists who fled the LDP and other parties in the 1990s. On security policy, some Democrats want to change the constitution to allow a broader interpretation of self-defence and make it easier to deploy peacekeeping troops. Others just as staunchly oppose any change.
Still, in spite of these divisions, Mr Kan's manifesto idea has the potential to cause more problems for the LDP than for his own party. Whereas Democrats on the whole support many of Mr Koizumi's reform ideas, but fault him for not delivering, much of the prime minister's own party wants him to call off the reforms altogether. Though he is thought likely to prevail, he may face a tough fight to win the LDP's presidential election on September 20th. It is assumed that he will then call for general elections in November. But he has upset his party's anti-reformers by saying that if he wins another term as leader the party should adopt his reform plans as its manifesto. To keep his job in September, he may have to compromise on this.
Until recently, one of the Democrats' handicaps has been that they share much the same desire for reform and deregulation as Mr Koizumi, but have less experience than his party. What might happen if the prime minister and the opposition run on similar manifestos, but most of the ruling-party candidates oppose both? Optimists might hope that this combination will at last break the jam in Japanese politics. In theory, Mr Koizumi could shatter the LDP from within while the Democrats take seats from its anti-reformers. But it has been a long time since the optimists were right about Japan.","The two biggest opposition parties are merging in readiness for a possible snap election this autumn .

THIS week, 25 years ago, China and Japan normalised relations. It was assumed that the two countries would note the anniversary by firming up plans for a summit between the Chinese leader, Hu Jintao, and the Japanese prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi. No doubt that will go ahead, but meanwhile the two countries have been wrestling with what China calls ""problems left over from history"". 
The Chinese were angered that, once again, Tokyo's Yasukuni shrine was being honoured. On August 15th four Japanese government ministers and 55 parliamentarians visited the shrine, a memorial to the country's war dead but also, controversially, to some of its war criminals. China regards such visits as proof of Japan's failure to abjure its militarist past. Chinese websites are once again filling up with anti-Japanese material. Even China's foreign ministry used its website to urge Japan to face up to its past. This, it said, ponderously, ""is conducive to the healthy and steady development of friendly and neighbourly bilateral relations"".
There had been earlier outrage over the discovery on August 4th of a dump of mustard gas containers in the north-eastern city of Qiqihar, left behind by the Japanese at the end of the second world war. Construction workers at the site broke open the containers. More than 40 people were said to have been taken ill. China's state-run media have carried photos of the victims and their injuries. Two are said to be in critical condition. 
The incident rekindled long-festering indignation over Japan's harsh occupation of China and its experiments with chemical and biological weapons. Japan has accepted blame, expressed ""deep regret"" over the incident, sent medical teams to treat the victims, and promised to keep looking for other discarded weapons. 
But for some critics that is not enough. They are urging China to punish Japan by barring it from a $16 billion project to build a high-speed rail link between Beijing and Shanghai. While the Japanese know a great deal about building bullet trains, the Chinese government is aware that a hard line towards Japan plays well with the Chinese public. Given the low-level reception afforded to Japan's transport minister, Chikage Ogi, during her visit this month, there seems a fair chance that French or German companies may get the business instead.","Grumbles mar an anniversary

BUILDING roads is a costly business, particularly in Japan. Endless projects keep thousands of construction companies alive, while large donations to politicians in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) ensure taxes keep flowing into new, mostly unprofitable, highways. This has led Japan's four state-road corporations at the centre of this chummy group to rack up some yen40 trillion ($342 billion) of debts between them.
Privatising the road corporations by 2005 and stopping the waste is one of Junichiro Koizumi's core reforms, and one the prime minister is likely to stress in his re-election campaign (for his party's leadership election, due on September 20th, and in a probable general election later in the year). But, like many others, it has run into deep hostility from within his own party and from bureaucrats. An independent committee was set up by Mr Koizumi to lead the charge last year, but has made painfully little progress so far. For many people, the roads symbolise Mr Koizumi's hamstrung attempts at reform.
These days road reform is back in the spotlight, thanks to a scandal involving the Japan Highway Public Corporation (JH), the biggest of the road corporations. In June, JH said it had a capital surplus of yen5.7 trillion. Shortly afterwards, a senior executive revealed a separate set of unofficial accounts, which showed a yen617 billion capital deficit instead, with horrifying implications for the corporation.
Haruho Fukui, the president of JH, quickly denied such accounts existed. But several weeks later, JH ""found"" the secret accounts in a computer file in its accounting division, though these, it insisted, were drawn up by a handful of rank-and-file members, and were not seen by senior executives. An angry Mr Fukui demoted the whistle-blower. On August 22nd, JH said it was considering filing a criminal complaint against him as well.
Yet members of the privatisation committee, and other experts, continue to question JH's official figures. Not surprising perhaps, since it curiously counts interest payments on loans used to build new roads as assets. Mr Fukui also claimed the corporation did not have a full set of records to show how much it paid for earlier projects, though these too seem to have since turned up. Add to this a long list of unprofitable projects, such as a tunnel underneath Tokyo Bay, which loses some yen100m a day. According to Kozo Ogata, head of the Japan Toll Road Research Centre, who worked at JH for 30 years, the entity has built highways that see so little traffic that they do not get enough tolls to cover the cost of collection.
Though under public pressure to fire Mr Fukui, both Mr Koizumi and Chikage Ogi, the construction minister, have stuck by him, raising doubts over their commitment to reform. True, Ms Ogi did promise to get a big accounting firm to audit JH's official accounts. Unfortunately, they all refused, so the corporation is making do with a less rigorous review instead.","A symbol of reform turns sour

THE opposition is bracing for a general election, perhaps later this year, but a potentially more pivotal contest will take place inside Japan's ruling party on September 20th. That is when members of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) will vote on whether to grant Junichiro Koizumi another term as their party's president, and thus as Japan's prime minister. This week, several rivals announced that they will challenge Mr Koizumi, including Shizuka Kamei, who once chaired the LDP's powerful Policy Research Council and who jointly commands one of the LDP's biggest factions. Although Mr Koizumi's opponents are attacking his economic policies, they are also fighting another, less public battle: over starkly different visions of how Japan's perennially ruling party should run the country.
In one corner is Mr Koizumi, who champions an approach more like that of a western parliamentary democracy. He wants the prime minister to have much more scope to set policy, to choose cabinet ministers, and to let them stay together long enough to get things done. Although Mr Koizumi advocates painful economic measures, his message in April 2001 to the local LDP members who made him prime minister was that economic reforms would not be possible without an overhaul of the ruling party's gridlocked political structure. One of his best slogans was ""Change the LDP, change Japan"".
A cabinet-centered system would be a radical change for Japan, where the LDP's leaders have usually ruled as a group from behind closed doors. Before Mr Koizumi took office, prime ministers reshuffled cabinets frequently, as part of a revolving-door promotion scheme to keep the LDP's seniority system running smoothly.
Since Japanese politicians, including Mr Koizumi, nearly always compromise, the LDP may yet avert a decisive showdown over these issues, with Mr Koizumi winning a new term by making concessions. This week, however, he seemed to be doing a good job of using his popularity to prevent the LDP's biggest factions from uniting against him. Not only are candidates from several factions running, but, even within those, MPs have split into pro- and anti-Koizumi camps.
This week the biggest faction, led by Ryutaro Hashimoto, gave up trying to unite behind a single candidate. Takao Fujii, a former transport minister, will be the faction's only challenger, but he did not win its undivided support. Following the LDP's leader in the upper house, Mikio Aoki, a large group of Hashimoto-faction MPs say they will back Mr Koizumi instead. Mr Koizumi has similarly managed to divide another big faction led by Mitsuo Horiuchi, who said this week that he, and much of his faction, will back the prime minister. That left dissenting members scrambling this week for an alternative candidate. 
Mr Koizumi has not won yet, however. Along with Mr Fujii and Mr Kamei, he already faces at least one other challenger, even if the Horiuchi faction does not produce one: Masahiko Komura, a former foreign minister with a small faction of his own. Against three or more challengers Mr Koizumi may struggle to win a majority in the first round of voting. In a second-round run-off, local LDP members, who were key to Mr Koizumi's victory in 2001, would have no say. Left on their own, the MPs might unite behind a single rival.
Many of them fear, however, that the LDP would lose many of its seats, and perhaps even power altogther, if it were to fight a general election without the popular Mr Koizumi. If he can exploit this fear to win through, he may yet strike an important blow for political reform.

CAN Japan spend its way out of trouble? Many members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), undaunted by public debt of more than one-and-a-half times national income, want the government to try. They are therefore furious with Junichiro Koizumi, who, they say, has been too tight-fisted since taking over as the LDP's president, and Japan's prime minister, in April 2001. On September 20th, when the LDP elects its leader for the next three years, Mr Koizumi's rivals will try to tap that fury and force him from office. All three of his challengers have centred their attacks on his fiscal policies. 
They fault Mr Koizumi, who memorably pledged to hold fresh borrowing below yen30 trillion (around $250 billion) a year when he took office, for pushing painful reforms harder than efforts to stimulate demand. In fact, Mr Koizumi broke his fiscal pledge last year, and the IMF reckons that Japan will run a whopping fiscal deficit of 7.7% of GDP, or yen38.2 trillion, in 2003. Even borrowing on this heroic scale, however, is not nearly enough to satisfy many of the LDP's staunchest backers, who tend to hail from the construction industry, small rural districts, and other heavily-subsidised segments of the economy. 
Two of Mr Koizumi's rivals--Takao Fujii and Shizuka Kamei--have accordingly said they will dole out another yen10 trillion of stimulus spending if they are elected, just for starters. Then they get serious. Mr Kamei would next like to spend an additional yen30 trillion-50 trillion this fiscal year, which ends in March, on infrastructure projects and other demand boosters. He says he would then increase spending by yet another 5-10% a year for the following three years. Because Mr Koizumi's third challenger, Masahiko Komura, comes from a tiny faction--Mr Fujii is from the largest, led by Ryutaro Hashimoto, and Mr Kamei's faction is also big--he poses no threat to Mr Koizumi; but rather than try to distinguish himself with a fresh economic message, he, too, has championed a hefty fiscal solution to Japan's woes. 
In their haste to spend more money, the challengers make two broad points about the numbers. One is that the public sector holds social-security and other assets which partly offset its liabilities. So while the IMF reckons that Japan's gross public debt had reached 158% of GDP by the end of 2002 (an oft-cited figure), it puts net public debt at 72% of GDP. Even the lower figure is not reassuring, however. Besides high annual deficits, which add rapidly to this debt mountain each year, Japan must also worry about its rapidly ageing population and its rickety financial system, each of which poses a threat to public finances.
Mr Koizumi's critics are on to a better argument with their second point: that one reason Japan's debt and deficit ratios look so bad is that the denominator, GDP, has not been growing. Mr Kamei points out further that tax revenues slid sharply last year as the economy slumped, pushing debt levels up another notch. Whatever the long-term risks of continuing to borrow, therefore, the risk of not borrowing may be worse, if the economy remains stagnant as a result. So, far from preserving Japan's fiscal soundness, say Mr Koizumi's opponents, the prime minister's structural reforms and fiscal prudence are making the public finances worse.
The trouble with this argument, however, is that it assumes fiscal spending alone can get the economy growing again. It may be part of the solution: although Japan has been slumping since 1991, the deflationary spiral might well have been worse without large dollops of spending. But fiscal stimulus would go further if the budget were overhauled to spur demand, rather than buy off LDP supporters--and even then, only if paired with reform ideas such as Mr Koizumi's. These aim to remove many of the obstacles which appear to be holding the economy back. These ideas include efforts to clean up the banks' bad loans so that credit can begin flowing and confidence can return; to privatise the postal system, including its pool of misallocated savings and life-insurance funds; to deregulate the economy and devolve power, so that new firms and industries can gain a foothold; and to reform taxes with an eye towards promoting growth. 
Although Mr Koizumi's LDP rivals say that these reforms have not worked, they have not really been tried--because the LDP has stymied them at every turn. Some party members say that they support structural reform, but that fiscal stimulus must come first. Others say that the reforms are misguided, whatever the timing. And some even say both. Mr Kamei, at a press conference last week, said that he agreed with Mr Koizumi about the need for structural reform, but then argued that the prime minister placed too much emphasis on competition, and was promoting a vision of Japan in which ""the strong gnaw on the bones of the weak"". 
In fact, Japan's food chain runs in the opposite direction: its weak and uncompetitive companies, aided by the LDP, continue to suck the life blood from the few Japanese companies worth saving. Winning the LDP election will help Mr Koizumi only if it helps him to overcome this resistance to reform. The early indications, as the campaign got under way on September 8th, were that winning would be the easy part. The Mainichi Shimbun, a daily newspaper, reported that the prime minister seemed likely to win in 36 of the 47 prefectures. That would give him many of the 300 votes allocated to local LDP members. 
Mr Koizumi has also managed to divide several big factions that only a month ago were at risk of uniting against him. That should win him a healthy share of the 357 votes allocated to the party's members of parliament. Last week, for example, Mikio Aoki, the LDP's upper-house leader, managed to persuade the Hashimoto faction's 42 upper-house MPs to back Mr Koizumi. On September 9th, Hiromu Nonaka, a Hashimoto-faction heavyweight and fiercely anti-Koizumi MP, announced that he would soon retire from politics. Mr Nonaka said that before leaving he would do all he could to help unseat Mr Koizumi, but his resignation is likely to leave anti-Koizumi MPs even more disheartened.
The question remains, however, whether this will help Mr Koizumi in his reform battles. His ideas are so unpopular in the party that many of those who support him, such as Mr Aoki, do so more for tactical reasons than for ideology. Mr Koizumi seems likely to win, but he will then face strong pressure, as always, to compromise--and spend.","The LDP 's leadership battle pits Junichiro Koizumi against three big spenders

THEY may not be accountable, but in one way, at least, Japan's political parties have been suffering along with the rest of the country. Political donations plummeted in the 1990s, due to a weak economy and a series of scandals that caused corporate donors to shy away. In 2002, according to figures released by the home-affairs ministry last week, donations from businesses and other organisations fell to only yen3.7 billion ($29.5m): down 18.8% from the previous year, and less than a tenth of their level when the bubble collapsed. Now, however, Japan's main business federation, the Nippon Keidanren, is considering ways to restore some of its lost political clout. 
The Keidanren (which expanded its name to Nippon Keidanren after merging with another federation last year) got out of money politics in 1993. After the cold war ended, Japan's political parties fragmented, and big corporations no longer faced a clear choice between the pro-business Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and an anti-business opposition, a stand-off that had dominated Japanese politics since 1955. Keidanren members' political interests diverged, and a scandal-ridden climate made giving money to politicians trickier still. The Keidanren chose to stop pooling campaign donations from its members on behalf of the LDP, and left businesses to make their own decisions.
Those firms increasingly decided to stop investing money in politics, at least by means of donations to parties and political campaigns. Although the home-affairs ministry oddly provides records only back to 1998, the Mainichi daily newspaper says donations peaked at yen44.7 billion in 1990. By 1998 they had fallen by nearly two-thirds, to yen15.3 billion, and they have continued to drop sharply. Lately, however, the Nippon Keidanren has been looking for ways to regain some of its influence.
Its chief, Hiroshi Okuda, who is also the chairman of Toyota, is especially keen for the federation to start giving money again. His own company was Japan's biggest corporate political donor last year, giving yen64m to the LDP. One of the most immediate rewards that Mr Okuda and his fellows hope to gain is a corporate tax cut, an idea the prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, has already backed. The Nippon Keidanren has also urged a cap on pension premiums, half of which are paid by employers.
Besides just trying to raise more money, the Nippon Keidanren also wants to boost research on policy. The big political parties have recently begun experimenting with more detailed political platforms, and hope to use these in the next general election, expected in November. If it can crank out some policy proposals of its own, the business group might gain a greater say in the debate. If things go really well, it might even regain enough influence to spark a scandal or two.","Japan's big-business lobby ponders a return to money politics

FANS of Junichiro Koizumi can sign up to an e-mail service called Lionheart, which provides regular updates from their hero. His shaggy mane of hair apart, though, the name has not proved particularly appropriate since Mr Koizumi took over as prime minister of Japan in April 2001. Though he came into office promising ""reform with no sacred cows"", his record has been modest. Now, however, that could be about to change. On September 20th, Mr Koizumi won a resounding victory to see off a leadership challenge in his own party. With Japan's economy showing signs of at least a cyclical revival, he looks well placed to call an early general election, probably in November, and to win his first real mandate for reform. Just as Britain's Margaret Thatcher achieved little early on in her premiership but made her main reforms a few years later, could the same come true for Mr Koizumi?
It certainly needs to. Japan's economic recovery, though welcome and probably assisted by a more expansionary monetary policy instituted by the man Mr Koizumi appointed in March to head the Bank of Japan, Toshihiko Fukui, risks petering out just as previous recoveries have done, especially if this week's rise in the yen proves long-lasting ()see page 95. The country's terrifying stock of bad corporate debt, far from decreasing, has increased further, though at a rate which the government claims is ""stabilising"". Those gigantic barrels of pork, Japan's highway corporations--deployed in the worst aspects of Japan's attempt to spend its way out of recession--remain steadfastly unprivatised. For Mr Koizumi, Japan's postal-savings system, a huge and superlative way of funnelling trillions of people's yen into all the wrong kinds of things, has for many years been a symbol of what needs to be changed in Japan. But moves to privatise that, too, have made little headway. The building industry, agriculture, the utilities: all are as sorely in need of a supply-side revolution as ever.
This is not all Mr Koizumi's fault. Since he took over, Mr Koizumi's main enemy has not been the official opposition but his own party, which has systematically hampered his attempts at reform, rightly fearing that these would be bad news for the groups--the farmers, the building industry and so on--that support and fund it. Mr Koizumi's own faction of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is a modest one, far smaller than the dominant (and archly conservative) Hashimoto faction, which has battled him from the beginning and has mounted (and failed in) what in any other country would be viewed as a back-stabbing attempt to bring down a popular prime minister. Mr Koizumi knew what he faced from the outset. His most acute slogan is ""change the LDP, change Japan"", and the order is important: it recognises that until the party is fixed, the country cannot be. 
Mr Koizumi's achievement in hanging on to his job is therefore considerable. Previous reformers, such as the ill-fated Morihiro Hosokawa, have been done in by their own side far more swiftly. He needed to win big in order to avoid a second-round run-off which could have seen his challengers united around one candidate--and he did. The manner in which he did it was striking, too: he made deals with influential players in the factions that were opposing him, fragmenting their vote.
For the moment, his opponents are humiliated, and should stay that way until after the general election. He says that the party's manifesto for that poll will be the platform on which he has just fought, and won, the LDP leadership battle. This is revolutionary for Japan, where the platform would normally be decided by the party machinery: that is, by the people who have been trying to unseat their own leader. Mr Koizumi has so far only had a limited test of his vote-winning skills, fighting an election for half of Japan's upper house, in July 2001. But already Japan looks a bit more like a normal country. The next election will now be fought by a well-known politician, with clear-cut policies backed up by a cabinet of his own choosing, not an amorphous jelly.
The new new team
For the cabinet marks the second of Mr Koizumi's successes. Two days after his re-election, Mr Koizumi shuffled his cabinet, and in doing so offered none of the concessions to the old guard that had been feared. Most notably, he retained Heizo Takenaka, an unpopular economist who is seen as the symbol of Mr Koizumi's reforms, in the twin roles of bank reform and overall economic policymaking. Mr Takenaka had been regarded as near-certain to lose at least the first of those jobs as the price for averting full-scale rebellion. There are other good things too: Mr Koizumi has promoted the energetic reformer Nobuteru Ishihara to the pork-critical Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. He has replaced Masajuro Shiokawa, the 81-year-old finance minister, with another ally, Sadakazu Tanigaki, a sprightly 58. The new party secretary-general is another young Turk, Shinzo Abe. His old cabinet was a compromise: the new line-up are Mr Koizumi's own men and women, not the LDP hierarchy's.
So all the pieces are in place for a significant change of gear. But will Mr Koizumi grasp the gearstick? Conspiracy theorists will continue to wonder what exactly was the price demanded for the support of Mikio Aoki, who broke ranks with the Hashimoto faction and brought many of its members with him. Without him, Mr Koizumi would probably have been forced into a run-off that he might very well have lost. Probably the most serious thing wrong with Japan--the long hangover caused by the crash of asset prices from 1990 onwards and, in consequence, of wealth and the propensity to consume--is something Mr Koizumi cannot tackle directly (see pages 23-26). The solution, reflation on a heroic scale, lies with the independent Bank of Japan. But even so, there is plenty that Mr Koizumi could be doing. From bank clean-ups to agriculture, his inclination until now has been to compromise with his party and produce watered-down solutions. In a way, having demonstrated his mastery of the LDP's arcane machinery so successfully, Mr Koizumi is in a more difficult position than he was before. Then, he had a ready-made excuse. Now, he has to deliver.","Junichiro Koizumi's has seen off a party challenge . Now Junichiro Koizumi must drive Junichiro Koizumi's advantage home

HOPES are faint, both inside and outside Japan. The patient has been bedbound for well over a decade; the usual remedies have failed, and the doctors are still disputing the diagnosis. Such pessimism may explain why Junichiro Koizumi's victory in last weekend's party elections--in what was billed as a battle between a reformer and the status quo--did little to inspire onlookers.
Indeed, on September 22nd, while the newly reinstated Mr Koizumi named an encouraging new cabinet, the markets busied themselves exploiting a slow change of the guard at the finance ministry, which had long been trying to keep Japan's currency weak, by piling into the yen and making quick gains on its rapid rise article. Such fast and fleeting opportunities to trade shares, bonds and currencies are all Japan seems to offer the world any more. But economic-policy reform is what Mr Koizumi, his policymakers and the electorate will have to focus on for the next few months.
That debate is only just heating up after Mr Koizumi's successful bid, on September 20th, to secure another term as president of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), and hence as Japan's prime minister. His three LDP challengers had attacked his ""structural reform"" agenda, arguing that instead Japan should rapidly expand its fiscal deficit--already pushing 8% of GDP--in order to boost growth. 
Not only did Mr Koizumi win this contest convincingly, but he then stared down those in his party who had supported the man while opposing his policies. Within two days, he had reshuffled both the party's leadership and the cabinet in ways that clearly fitted his own ideas about what must be done. Those ideas are about to come under fire from the main opposition party, the Democratic Party of Japan, which on September 24th completed a merger with the next-biggest opposition group, the Liberals. Mr Koizumi is widely expected to call lower-house parliamentary elections in early November, and the newly emboldened opposition is gearing up to blame the prime minister for doing too little to cope with unemployment and bankruptcies. 
Some of his critics are also trying to draw links between these economic hardships and Japan's rising crime rates. (The most recent white paper showed that violent offences, including robbery and rape, more than doubled between 1997 and 2001.) On this issue, however, Mr Koizumi seems on firmer ground. If any link exists between crime and unemployment, the crucial point is surely to increase the number of jobs available to the young, who make up a disproportionate share of both criminals and the unemployed. And the best way to create more jobs for everyone, he will argue, is through growth. Mr Koizumi must now convince Japanese voters that he can deliver it. 
He must also convince the rest of the world. Although Japan's economy is still the world's second-biggest, outsiders pay little attention to it, since the country contributes so little to global growth. Consider, however, just how much economic output is at stake. Between 1997 and 2002--after half a decade of stagnation had already passed, and long after the stock- and property-market bubble had collapsed--Japan's economy actually shrank in nominal terms, from yen523 trillion ($4.3 trillion) of annual output to yen500 trillion. Even if it had grown an exceptionally modest 2% a year in nominal terms during that period, it would be 16% bigger now. Cumulatively, it would have generated roughly yen78 trillion, or more than $650 billion, of additional output.
That staggering sum is several times the estimated cost of rebuilding Iraq, and more than all the rich countries between them spend on defence. Japan's lost $650 billion or so, moreover, is far more wasteful than money that has merely been spent for one bad purpose (rice subsidies) rather than a better one (alleviating poverty). It is potential output that was never produced, which means that nobody, rich or poor, will ever spend it on anything. 
Many pundits assume that growth can no longer be revived, or not for several more years. They are wrong. To see why, start with a quick look at recent indicators. Over the past couple of quarters, GDP has perked up a bit. From April to June it actually grew at a 3.9% annual rate, after adjusting for falling prices; even nominal GDP grew during the quarter, at a 1.2% annual rate. Cost-cutting by Japanese companies, combined with low profit margins to begin with, has allowed small increases in sales to generate big jumps in earnings. Operating profits at large firms rose by 17.3% in the fiscal year that ended in March, and have continued to look strong since. Japanese companies have, in turn, been investing some of those higher profits in new machinery and other equipment, giving a fillip to domestic demand. 
Pundits either read these signs as evidence that this is a great time to jump into shares (the stockmarket, driven partly by global factors, has risen 38% since April; see chart 1); or they dismiss it as yet another false dawn for Japan's economy, the latest in a series. Yet this debate obscures a simpler observation: that some market forces are still at work in Japan. Price opportunities still lead to bouts of capital spending, and price expectations affect demand. The latest blips on Japan's monitor may be confusing and weak, therefore, but they serve as a reminder that the patient is still alive--and might, with the right treatment, walk again on its own two feet.
First, diagnose
So what exactly ails Japan? Clearly not just the usual sort of business downturn, which can be cured, though painfully, with lay-offs and closures and sometimes with a government shot in the arm. Nor can its chronic weakness be attributed solely to a burst bubble and falling asset prices, though that is clearly part of the problem. Many other countries have been similarly stricken, and have managed to recover. In Japan, the misery has lasted for almost 14 years. 
The Economist would like to suggest its own label for Japan's illness. It is ""dysflation"": a form of deflation in which dysfunctional economic-policy institutions counteract what would otherwise be good medicine for falling prices. The policies, especially with regard to banks, combine in ways that do more harm than good. More important, policymakers themselves are more inclined to avoid problems than address them; would rather win bureaucratic feuds than co-operate; and base most of their decisions on emotion (such as fear of shame) rather than reason. 
It helps to keep all these aspects of dysflation in mind when assessing Japan's problems. Consider, for example, the Bank of Japan. Ordinarily, the best response to deflation--that is, falling prices throughout the economy, and not merely for a few products such as Chinese manufactures--would be lower interest rates and feverish printing of money. Japan has had zero interest rates since 1999, however, and has been boosting the money supply at a rapid clip since early 2001--and prices have continued to fall. According to the most respectable measure, the GDP deflator, they have fallen 7.6% since 1997, and are still dropping fast. Eventually, all the money that the Bank has been printing will be sucked through the financial system and expelled into the economy in the form of higher prices and rising nominal interest rates. But it is taking a perplexingly long time to happen. 
The Bank's explanation is that Japan's deflation is a very rare strain indeed. It points to the large quantity of non-performing loans that have piled up in the banking system. Never in the history of human endeavour have so many owed so much for so long. And as the Bank's officials like to point out, new bad loans, at least until recently, continued to accumulate faster than the banks were writing off old ones, and the Financial Services Agency (FSA), which regulates banks, has done nothing to stop this. Banks are lending mainly to their worst borrowers; and with the credit channel not operating properly, the usual monetary-transmission mechanism cannot work either.
There is probably some truth in this argument. What it ignores, however, is the overarching role that expectations--of firms, workers, consumers and investors--play in transmitting the central bank's policies into rising or falling prices, and the need for the central bank to manage those forecasts. The Bank has not only failed utterly in this role, but has refused to take responsibility for trying. 
Under the previous governor, Masaru Hayami, whose term began in 1998, every constructive policy that the Bank undertook was undermined by a statement that the Bank did not really expect its policy to get prices rising again, at least not quickly. This had a sort of reverse placebo effect. Even as the central bank was administering potent medicine, Mr Hayami said that it was only doling out sugar cubes. A new governor, Toshihiko Fukui, took over in March, and has been an improvement. Conceivably he will do a better job than Mr Hayami of convincing people that all that loose money will not be vacuumed up again at some point by the Bank. But even Mr Fukui has shown traces of his predecessor's dysfunctional approach.
More government spending?
Since the Bank of Japan is independent, there is not much Mr Koizumi can do about this. Having appointed Mr Fukui, monetary policy is now out of his hands, and the best he can do is co-ordinate more effectively with the central bank. Most of Mr Koizumi's efforts should probably be devoted towards the most harmfully dysfunctional bits of economic policy: ie, those that are preventing the Bank's loose money from generating the inflation that Japan so badly needs.
This may shed some light on arguments over fiscal policy. The case against spending more money seems simple. Japan's public debts have risen sharply over the past decade, and its gross debts, as measured by the IMF, reached 158% of GDP at the end of 2002. The main international rating agencies have downgraded Japanese government debt several times over the past few years. The most visible aspect of Japanese fiscal spending, moreover, is the LDP's addiction to public-works projects, which benefit the party's friends in the construction industry and deliver largesse to small rural districts. Such projects--dams, bridges and roads to nowhere--have continued to get media attention. 
Mr Koizumi and his supporters have drawn two conclusions from this. First, they argue, fiscal spending has been tried and has not worked. Second, they say, Japan's debt has now risen to the point where more fiscal spending will merely aggravate the problem by raising the future debt burden, perhaps even harming confidence now. When Mr Koizumi took over as prime minister in April 2001, he pledged to limit new public debt issues to yen30 trillion a year. Even though he has broken that pledge--this year's fiscal deficit is expected to hit yen38 trillion--he is still against more public-works spending. He has pledged to privatise Japan's four public-highway corporations, and arranged public hearings last year on their profligacy and influence-peddling.
On further inspection, however, Mr Koizumi's arguments are not as compelling as they appear. For one, Japan's high debt ratios, taken in isolation, do not shed much light on whether more borrowing is a good idea. The gross government-debt ratio ignores many of the offsetting assets of the social security system, as well as many liabilities held by other public-sector outfits. The IMF reckons that net public debt came to around 72% of GDP at the end of 2002, less than half the gross figure. That is still a high number, of course. And high debt levels should especially worry Japan: since its population is projected to be the world's oldest by 2025, it will soon have to face a massive deficit in its pension system. 
Indeed, Japan's problem is not so much its current debt as its future expected liabilities, many of which are being exacerbated by a looming demographic crunch and poor growth. Low growth is the main reason that Japan's debt ratios have deteriorated so badly over the past few years. In 2000-02, for example, tax revenues fell from yen50.7 trillion a year to yen43.8 trillion, mainly because of weak demand. The best way to look at Japan's budget, therefore, is to ask whether it is promoting or helping growth. On this question, Mr Koizumi is on weak ground.
It is an exaggeration to say that Japan has exhausted the possibility of using fiscal stimulus to solve its problems. It may have borrowed a lot of money, but much of that borrowing goes towards debt-service payments and social-security transfers, which do not stimulate the economy. Studies by Adam Posen, of the International Institute for Economics in Washington, DC, and several others suggest that when Japan has tried a little stimulus over the past decade it has had an effect. And the fiscal contraction caused by a rise in the consumption tax in 1997 was one of the main reasons why a previous budding recovery ended in a bust.
Dealing with the zombies
The question that Japan should be asking, therefore, is not so much whether to spend money, but where. Public-works projects probably help the economy somewhat more than Mr Koizumi and his supporters claim. However, the best use of money would be to tackle the most dysfunctional aspects of dysflation head on. That means doing something about bad loans.
Mr Koizumi is right to focus attention on this problem. So is his main economic-policy minister, Heizo Takenaka, who a year ago was given a second cabinet-level post overseeing the FSA. Mr Takenaka's headline policy, of requiring banks to dispose of their non-performing loans much more quickly, made him the chief target of Mr Koizumi's opponents. Before this week's cabinet reshuffle, onlookers were feverishly speculating whether Mr Koizumi would have to remove Mr Takenaka from at least one of his posts, as part of a compromise to secure re-election as LDP president. That Mr Koizumi did not do so suggests both that he believes he holds a strong hand, and that he is determined to defend his overall approach to the bad-debt problem.
He is right. Bad loans are not just a result of Japan's slump, but a mechanism that is helping to prolong it. Anil Kashyap, an economist at the University of Chicago's business school, reckons that by keeping so-called ""zombie"" companies alive, rather than letting them die a natural death, the banks and their regulators are allowing too great a burden to fall on more productive companies. Otherwise healthy firms face higher real wages, lower prices and other distortions as a result of this warped competition. 
Many of Mr Takenaka's critics complain that writing off more bad loans will lead to more bankruptcies and unemployment. If Mr Kashyap, and many others, are correct about the effects of the zombies, however, then writing off their loans will actually foster the creation of new companies and more productive jobs, as well as boosting output. Since new firms are more likely to hire young workers, there would also be long-run productivity gains. More youngsters would be working in interesting jobs and developing their skills, rather than doing nothing, as too many are now (see chart 3).
So if generating growth is more important than shrinking the budget deficit, and if the mountain of bad loans is hampering growth, why doesn't Mr Koizumi use government money to help the banks write off bad loans faster? That, alas, is not something he has been willing to countenance. In May, the government used some money to rescue a big regional bank, Resona, which suddenly found itself with too little capital on its books. Mr Takenaka's main approach to the banks, however, has been to encourage them to write off loans faster, while presenting them with inconsistent incentives that do not really encourage them to rush. 
The best way to cure the patient would be to spend the money now and do the job properly. More money for a social safety net, as the Democrats advocate, might also help to ease the transition as bankruptcies and lay-offs increase and raise unemployment. Haruo Shimada, an academic economist and informal adviser to Mr Koizumi, has summed it up nicely: ""If you want to do radical surgery, you need to set aside a big enough supply of blood.""","Junichiro Koizumi has won Junichiro Koizumi's party 's leadership battle and chosen Junichiro Koizumi's own team . Now Junichiro Koizumi must try to revive Junichiro Koizumi's country 
 HOPES are faint , both inside and outside Japan . The patient has been bedbound for well over a decade ; the usual remedies have failed , and the doctors are still disputing the diagnosis . Such pessimism may explain why Junichiro Koizumi's victory in last weekend 's party elections -- in what was billed as a battle between a reformer and the status quo -- did little to inspire onlookers . 
 Indeed , on September 22nd , while Junichiro Koizumi named an encouraging new cabinet , the markets busied themselves exploiting a slow change of the guard at the finance ministry , which had long been trying to keep Japan 's currency weak , by piling into the yen and making quick gains on its rapid rise article . Such fast and fleeting opportunities to trade shares , bonds and currencies are all Japan seems to offer the world any more . But economic - policy reform is what Junichiro Koizumi , Junichiro Koizumi's policymakers and the electorate will have to focus on for the next few months . 
 That debate is only just heating up after Junichiro Koizumi's successful bid , on September 20th , to secure another term as president of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) , and hence as Japan 's prime minister . Junichiro Koizumi's three LDP challengers had attacked Junichiro Koizumi's "" structural reform "" agenda , arguing that instead Japan should rapidly expand its fiscal deficit -- already pushing 8 % of GDP -- in order to boost growth . 
 Not only did Junichiro Koizumi win this contest convincingly , but Junichiro Koizumi then stared down those in Junichiro Koizumi's party who had supported Junichiro Koizumi while opposing Junichiro Koizumi's policies . Within two days , Junichiro Koizumi had reshuffled both the party 's leadership and the cabinet in ways that clearly fitted Junichiro Koizumi's own ideas about what must be done . Those ideas are about to come under fire from the main opposition party , the Democratic Party of Japan , which on September 24th completed a merger with the next - biggest opposition group , the Liberals . Junichiro Koizumi is widely expected to call lower - house parliamentary elections in early November , and the newly emboldened opposition is gearing up to blame Junichiro Koizumi for doing too little to cope with unemployment and bankruptcies . 
 Some of Junichiro Koizumi's critics are also trying to draw links between these economic hardships and Japan 's rising crime rates . ( The most recent white paper showed that violent offences , including robbery and rape , more than doubled between 1997 and 2001 . ) On this issue , however , Junichiro Koizumi seems on firmer ground . If any link exists between crime and unemployment , the crucial point is surely to increase the number of jobs available to the young , who make up a disproportionate share of both criminals and the unemployed . And the best way to create more jobs for everyone , Junichiro Koizumi will argue , is through growth . Junichiro Koizumi must now convince Japanese voters that Junichiro Koizumi can deliver it . 
 Junichiro Koizumi must also convince the rest of the world . Although Japan 's economy is still the world 's second - biggest , outsiders pay little attention to it , since the country contributes so little to global growth . Consider , however , just how much economic output is at stake . Between 1997 and 2002 - -after half a decade of stagnation had already passed , and long after the stock- and property - market bubble had collapsed -- Japan 's economy actually shrank in nominal terms , from yen523 trillion ( $ 4.3 trillion ) of annual output to yen500 trillion . Even if it had grown an exceptionally modest 2 % a year in nominal terms during that period , it would be 16 % bigger now . Cumulatively , it would have generated roughly yen78 trillion , or more than $ 650 billion , of additional output . 
 That staggering sum is several times the estimated cost of rebuilding Iraq , and more than all the rich countries between them spend on defence . Japan 's lost $ 650 billion or so , moreover , is far more wasteful than money that has merely been spent for one bad purpose ( rice subsidies ) rather than a better one ( alleviating poverty ) . It is potential output that was never produced , which means that nobody , rich or poor , will ever spend it on anything . 
 Many pundits assume that growth can no longer be revived , or not for several more years . They are wrong . To see why , start with a quick look at recent indicators . Over the past couple of quarters , GDP has perked up a bit . From April to June it actually grew at a 3.9 % annual rate , after adjusting for falling prices ; even nominal GDP grew during the quarter , at a 1.2 % annual rate . Cost - cutting by Japanese companies , combined with low profit margins to begin with , has allowed small increases in sales to generate big jumps in earnings . Operating profits at large firms rose by 17.3 % in the fiscal year that ended in March , and have continued to look strong since . Japanese companies have , in turn , been investing some of those higher profits in new machinery and other equipment , giving a fillip to domestic demand . 
 Pundits either read these signs as evidence that this is a great time to jump into shares ( the stockmarket , driven partly by global factors , has risen 38 % since April ; see chart 1 ) ; or they dismiss it as yet another false dawn for Japan 's economy , the latest in a series . Yet this debate obscures a simpler observation : that some market forces are still at work in Japan . Price opportunities still lead to bouts of capital spending , and price expectations affect demand . The latest blips on Japan 's monitor may be confusing and weak , therefore , but they serve as a reminder that the patient is still alive -- and might , with the right treatment , walk again on its own two feet . 
 First , diagnose 
 So what exactly ails Japan ? Clearly not just the usual sort of business downturn , which can be cured , though painfully , with lay - offs and closures and sometimes with a government shot in the arm . Nor can its chronic weakness be attributed solely to a burst bubble and falling asset prices , though that is clearly part of the problem . Many other countries have been similarly stricken , and have managed to recover . In Japan , the misery has lasted for almost 14 years . 
 The Economist would like to suggest its own label for Japan 's illness . It is "" dysflation "" : a form of deflation in which dysfunctional economic - policy institutions counteract what would otherwise be good medicine for falling prices . The policies , especially with regard to banks , combine in ways that do more harm than good . More important , policymakers themselves are more inclined to avoid problems than address them ; would rather win bureaucratic feuds than co - operate ; and base most of their decisions on emotion ( such as fear of shame ) rather than reason . 
 It helps to keep all these aspects of dysflation in mind when assessing Japan 's problems . Consider , for example , the Bank of Japan . Ordinarily , the best response to deflation -- that is , falling prices throughout the economy , and not merely for a few products such as Chinese manufactures -- would be lower interest rates and feverish printing of money . Japan has had zero interest rates since 1999 , however , and has been boosting the money supply at a rapid clip since early 2001 - -and prices have continued to fall . According to the most respectable measure , the GDP deflator , they have fallen 7.6 % since 1997 , and are still dropping fast . Eventually , all the money that the Bank has been printing will be sucked through the financial system and expelled into the economy in the form of higher prices and rising nominal interest rates . But it is taking a perplexingly long time to happen . 
 The Bank 's explanation is that Japan 's deflation is a very rare strain indeed . It points to the large quantity of non - performing loans that have piled up in the banking system . Never in the history of human endeavour have so many owed so much for so long . And as the Bank 's officials like to point out , new bad loans , at least until recently , continued to accumulate faster than the banks were writing off old ones , and the Financial Services Agency ( FSA ) , which regulates banks , has done nothing to stop this . Banks are lending mainly to their worst borrowers ; and with the credit channel not operating properly , the usual monetary - transmission mechanism can not work either . 
 There is probably some truth in this argument . What it ignores , however , is the overarching role that expectations -- of firms , workers , consumers and investors -- play in transmitting the central bank 's policies into rising or falling prices , and the need for the central bank to manage those forecasts . The Bank has not only failed utterly in this role , but has refused to take responsibility for trying . 
 Under the previous governor , Masaru Hayami , whose term began in 1998 , every constructive policy that the Bank undertook was undermined by a statement that the Bank did not really expect its policy to get prices rising again , at least not quickly . This had a sort of reverse placebo effect . Even as the central bank was administering potent medicine , Mr Hayami said that it was only doling out sugar cubes . A new governor , Toshihiko Fukui , took over in March , and has been an improvement . Conceivably he will do a better job than Mr Hayami of convincing people that all that loose money will not be vacuumed up again at some point by the Bank . But even Mr Fukui has shown traces of his predecessor 's dysfunctional approach . 
 More government spending ? 
 Since the Bank of Japan is independent , there is not much Junichiro Koizumi can do about this . Having appointed Mr Fukui , monetary policy is now out of Junichiro Koizumi's hands , and the best Junichiro Koizumi can do is co - ordinate more effectively with the central bank . Most of Junichiro Koizumi's efforts should probably be devoted towards the most harmfully dysfunctional bits of economic policy : ie , those that are preventing the Bank 's loose money from generating the inflation that Japan so badly needs . 
 This may shed some light on arguments over fiscal policy . The case against spending more money seems simple . Japan 's public debts have risen sharply over the past decade , and its gross debts , as measured by the IMF , reached 158 % of GDP at the end of 2002 . The main international rating agencies have downgraded Japanese government debt several times over the past few years . The most visible aspect of Japanese fiscal spending , moreover , is the LDP 's addiction to public - works projects , which benefit the party 's friends in the construction industry and deliver largesse to small rural districts . Such projects -- dams , bridges and roads to nowhere -- have continued to get media attention . 
 Junichiro Koizumi and Junichiro Koizumi's supporters have drawn two conclusions from this . First , they argue , fiscal spending has been tried and has not worked . Second , they say , Japan 's debt has now risen to the point where more fiscal spending will merely aggravate the problem by raising the future debt burden , perhaps even harming confidence now . When Junichiro Koizumi took over as prime minister in April 2001 , Junichiro Koizumi pledged to limit new public debt issues to yen30 trillion a year . Even though Junichiro Koizumi has broken that pledge -- this year 's fiscal deficit is expected to hit yen38 trillion -- Junichiro Koizumi is still against more public - works spending . Junichiro Koizumi has pledged to privatise Japan 's four public - highway corporations , and arranged public hearings last year on their profligacy and influence - peddling . 
 On further inspection , however , Junichiro Koizumi's arguments are not as compelling as they appear . For one , Japan 's high debt ratios , taken in isolation , do not shed much light on whether more borrowing is a good idea . The gross government - debt ratio ignores many of the offsetting assets of the social security system , as well as many liabilities held by other public - sector outfits . The IMF reckons that net public debt came to around 72 % of GDP at the end of 2002 , less than half the gross figure . That is still a high number , of course . And high debt levels should especially worry Japan : since its population is projected to be the world 's oldest by 2025 , it will soon have to face a massive deficit in its pension system . 
 Indeed , Japan 's problem is not so much its current debt as its future expected liabilities , many of which are being exacerbated by a looming demographic crunch and poor growth . Low growth is the main reason that Japan 's debt ratios have deteriorated so badly over the past few years . In 2000 - 02 , for example , tax revenues fell from yen50.7 trillion a year to yen43.8 trillion , mainly because of weak demand . The best way to look at Japan 's budget , therefore , is to ask whether it is promoting or helping growth . On this question , Junichiro Koizumi is on weak ground . 
 It is an exaggeration to say that Japan has exhausted the possibility of using fiscal stimulus to solve its problems . It may have borrowed a lot of money , but much of that borrowing goes towards debt - service payments and social - security transfers , which do not stimulate the economy . Studies by Adam Posen , of the International Institute for Economics in Washington , DC , and several others suggest that when Japan has tried a little stimulus over the past decade it has had an effect . And the fiscal contraction caused by a rise in the consumption tax in 1997 was one of the main reasons why a previous budding recovery ended in a bust . 
 Dealing with the zombies 
 The question that Japan should be asking , therefore , is not so much whether to spend money , but where . Public - works projects probably help the economy somewhat more than Junichiro Koizumi and Junichiro Koizumi's supporters claim . However , the best use of money would be to tackle the most dysfunctional aspects of dysflation head on . That means doing something about bad loans . 
 Junichiro Koizumi is right to focus attention on this problem . So is Junichiro Koizumi's main economic - policy minister , Heizo Takenaka , who a year ago was given a second cabinet - level post overseeing the FSA . Mr Takenaka 's headline policy , of requiring banks to dispose of their non - performing loans much more quickly , made him the chief target of Junichiro Koizumi's opponents . Before this week 's cabinet reshuffle , onlookers were feverishly speculating whether Junichiro Koizumi would have to remove Mr Takenaka from at least one of his posts , as part of a compromise to secure re - election as LDP president . That Junichiro Koizumi did not do so suggests both that Junichiro Koizumi believes Junichiro Koizumi holds a strong hand , and that Junichiro Koizumi is determined to defend Junichiro Koizumi's overall approach to the bad - debt problem . 
 Junichiro Koizumi is right . Bad loans are not just a result of Japan 's slump , but a mechanism that is helping to prolong it . Anil Kashyap , an economist at the University of Chicago 's business school , reckons that by keeping so - called "" zombie "" companies alive , rather than letting them die a natural death , the banks and their regulators are allowing too great a burden to fall on more productive companies . Otherwise healthy firms face higher real wages , lower prices and other distortions as a result of this warped competition .

HAVING cut its own North American Free-Trade Agreement with the United States and Canada a decade ago, Mexico has been content to play a back-seat role in the Americas trade talks. Its energies have long been devoted to arranging the kind of bilateral deals the Bush administration now favours. As well as NAFTA, Mexico has some 30 other trade agreements, with the European Union, a number of Latin American countries--and soon, it hopes, Japan. 
Vicente Fox, Mexico's president, visited Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, this week. They had hoped to sign a trade deal. But after a year of increasingly frantic negotiations, the two sides are still separated by some tricky details.
The agreement matters for both countries, but for different reasons. Mexico's trade deals have turned it into one of the world's most open trading nations. But it is also struggling to revive a sluggish economy, which is suffering from increasing competition from China. One way of doing so is to get more access to the Japanese market, in which Mexico already has exports worth $1.6 billion a year.
For Japan, by contrast, this treaty would be only its second free-trade agreement, after one with Singapore, and the first to include agriculture. Especially since the setback to the WTO talks at Cancn, Japanese officials worry that they will be at a relative disadvantage without more such deals. But Japan has a habit of protecting its farmers. 
Not surprisingly, farm products, especially pork, are the main obstacle in the talks with Mexico. Pork already accounts for 10% of Mexico's exports to Japan. Remove the tariffs, and some say the Japanese would gobble down six times as much Mexican pork. Japanese officials wince for their pig farmers--and complain, in turn, at Mexico's reluctance to lower its tariffs on steel. 
Jaime Serra, Mexico's chief NAFTA negotiator and now an independent economic consultant, points out that last year Mexico's trade with countries with which it has agreements showed a surplus of $23.2 billion, while it registered a trade deficit of $31.3 billion with other countries (mainly China). Some hard bargaining with Japan remains, but this will spur its negotiators on.","Bilateralism crosses the Pacific

Jaime Serra, Mexico's chief NAFTA negotiator and now an independent economic consultant, points out that last year Mexico's trade with countries with which it has agreements showed a surplus of $23.2 billion, while it registered a trade deficit of $31.3 billion with other countries (mainly China).

CHANGE the government, change Japan. That simple choice, at long last, will be open to Japanese voters as they head to the polls on November 9th. Many of them will try to take it. The party these ambitious voters will be backing, the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), was still an underdog as the campaign moved into its final days. But in its efforts to unseat the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the DPJ has already changed Japanese democracy in two ways, both of which bode well for the country's future.
First, the DPJ has done wonders merely by emerging as a legitimate contender. When Junichiro Koizumi became prime minister in April 2001, by winning an internal LDP contest, his best-known slogan was ""change the LDP, change Japan"". Since the LDP has been the only game in town, the only hope for better government has been for Mr Koizumi to win a battle, which he has fought only intermittently and with mixed results, with his own party. Before he came along, there was little hope at all.
Many Japanese democrats have long wished that a clear two-party system would eventually emerge, offering voters a credible alternative to the LDP coalition. During the cold war, the main alternative was the Japan Socialist Party, which was so anti-business, and so hostile towards the security treaty with America, that it never really had a chance. Things became briefly more interesting in the early 1990s, when the LDP lost power for a bit. But the alternative parties and factions fragmented rather than joining forces; and the LDP has governed ever since. 
Now, after merging in September with the next-biggest opposition party, the Liberals, the seven-year-old DPJ has emerged as the clear choice for disgruntled mainstream voters. Japanese politics is suddenly a lot more fun. 
Thanks to the DPJ's second change, politics may be growing more open as well. Naoto Kan, the DPJ's leader, enlivened the debate by launching, amid great fanfare, a detailed ""manifesto"" describing how the DPJ would govern. Mr Kan copied the idea from a handful of maverick governors, who have won over voters in their prefectures with similarly detailed proposals. Just as Mr Kan predicted, the DPJ manifesto, a novelty in Japanese national elections, has helped to focus more debate on specific issues, such as pensions and the devolution of power to local governments, much to the DPJ's benefit.
The quality of the debate should not be overstated. Japan does not have many independent think-tanks that can analyse the claims of rival parties and act as neutral referees. Nor are the Japanese media very adept at doing so. Nevertheless, the LDP has, to an unprecedented extent, been forced to spar with an opponent over substantive issues during the campaign. 
Equally important, the DPJ manifesto has helped Mr Kan to highlight the divisions within the LDP. Mr Koizumi was forced to release his own manifesto in response. Many LDP candidates, especially in conservative rural districts, then openly denounced the document's reformist proposals, even as the DPJ criticised it as vague. A rival, unofficial, LDP platform began circulating in response, and anti-Koizumi LDP members quickly snatched up copies so that they could show something to voters in their districts.
The result has been a surprisingly clear choice for voters. Both Mr Koizumi and Mr Kan have run on reformist, broadly pro-market, agendas. Both parties, however, are divided internally, with some candidates in each party favouring the government's current anti-competitive policies. Mr Koizumi is far more popular than Mr Kan, commanding 48% support even after a recent slide, and is a master at using the mass media to strengthen his appeal. His message is that he is gradually getting control of his party, and is therefore the best bet for voters who want reform. 
Mr Kan, in contrast, has tried to convince voters that Mr Koizumi cannot really get control of the LDP, and that the vagueness of his reform proposals, after 30 months in office, is proof of that. Over the past few months, Mr Koizumi has, in fact, done a much better job than previously of taking control of his party. For this, a great deal of credit must go to Mr Kan and his fellow Democrats. By presenting the LDP with some real competition, he has spurred Mr Koizumi to act and weakened the resistance within the LDP. However this weekend's voting goes, Japan is starting to look like a normal democracy.

THERE are probably as many explanations for what lies at the root of Japan's prolonged economic stagnation as there are canonical views of Mount Fuji--of which the wood-block artist Hokusai (1760-1849) first found 36 and then 100. Some schools of thought blame the central bank and its failure to tackle deflation speedily after the asset-price crash began in 1990. Others blame the commercial banks for failing to get tough with bad debtors; or the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) for being too cosy with the banks and the debtors both; or rigidities in the labour, employment or pretty much any other market. All these explanations, though, are rooted in a single big one: a lack of competition, in everything from political ideas to the supply of shiitake mushrooms. On November 9th, Japan got a big injection of the competition that does most to drive progress in most other countries. Its general election may for the first time have turned Japan into a genuine two-party state. The consequences, psychological as well as practical, should be momentous.
Since General MacArthur imposed democracy on Japan, elections there have been a yawn. Except for an eight-month period in 1993-94, the LDP has ruled ever since it was created, in 1955. For decades, the battle for power has been conducted not in parliament or on the hustings, but in secretive tussles between obscure rival factions of the party, over which the Japanese voter had little more say than a Chinese factory-worker has over the membership of China's Politburo. There were plenty of opposition parties, to be sure: but they split each other's votes and feuded incessantly. In this atmosphere, unhealthy alliances between politicians, banks, bureaucrats and big business flourished unchallenged, and the lack of competition at the top has filtered down to every level. Hence the rules that make it so hard for foreign firms to buy Japanese ones, and the way newspapers all take their holidays on the same day. Even when the LDP throws up a would-be reformer, such as the current prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, the cosy alliances conspire to frustrate him. Mr Koizumi's two years in office have seen much talk of change, but little progress, largely thanks to obstruction from within his own party. 
It is far too soon to say that this has changed for good, but the signs are encouraging. In the election last weekend ()see pages 25-28, support for the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) surged, taking it from 137 to 177 seats in the 480-member Diet. Interestingly, its gains were more at the expense of smaller opposition parties, such as the unlamented Communists, whose representation was halved, than of the LDP. The Japanese opposition voter, it seems, has at last worked out that a vote for the far left in fact helps the right, and so has voted instead for consolidation. The two big parties between them now control 87% of parliament's seats. Two medium-sized parties, the Liberals and now the New Conservatives, have been absorbed in the past two months.
This sets the stage for genuine competition between two relatively equal, electable parties. To a large extent, it has already started. The DPJ made political history in Japan by putting forward a detailed manifesto for this election, which was countered by a similar, though woollier, document from the prime minister. In lots of heartening ways, the thrust of the DPJ manifesto was reformist--though it had little to say about some of Japan's worst problems, especially its mountain of non-performing loans. But it attacked the granting of lavish subsidies to agriculture, the concreting-over of much of Japan in unproductive public-works schemes that benefit building firms but no one else, and the slanting of aid towards the LDP's friends. In a proposal that would do more for competition than almost anything else could, it pledged to decentralise power--and tax revenues--to Japan's provinces, which might then drive the country through a virtuous cycle of competition about what to deregulate, and when.
Courage, Koizumi
Paradoxically, then, Japan's election, despite being bad for Mr Koizumi personally (his party lost ten seats even though the LDP's previous performance, in 2000, had itself been viewed as a disaster) could on balance be good for reform. Naturally, the party's old guard is already arguing that by boosting rather than cutting spending, a better result could have been achieved. But Mr Koizumi is still an asset to his party, and with the opposition now snapping at its heels the LDP is less likely than ever to replace him, if only he is brave enough to call the old guard's bluff. The main point is that a severe contest in political ideas has been started, and will not easily go away.
Mr Koizumi's task is to harness Japan's new receptiveness to competition and apply it to the economy. He has often spoken of the need for ""reform with no sacred cows"", but he needs to act on that. That means more privatisation, for a start. He has long talked of the need to sell off Japan's ruinous Highway Corporations: now that the DPJ has committed itself to doing the same, he has no more excuse for delay. Likewise with the postal savings system, a tried and tested method of funnelling taxpayers' money to bad causes. ""Zombie"" companies, ones that would long ago have gone under if the banks were compelled to be less indulgent towards non-performing loans, need to be put out of their misery. That will mean job losses, it is true. But the zombies, the beneficiaries of uncompetitive advantages, are starving sprightlier prospects of the resources they need. Shopkeepers, utilities and farmers all need to feel the winds of competition too. Competition will be painful. But at the moment Japan is feeling plenty of pain anyway, without the gain competition would bring.
It might have been better for Japan had the DPJ won on November 9th, though doubts must remain about the cohesiveness of a young party that has only just absorbed the Liberals. As it is, an invigorated opposition will be able to keep the LDP up to the mark in the run-up to elections to Japan's powerful upper house, due in July. If he is brave, and if the opposition is responsible enough to support those policies that it agrees with, Mr Koizumi has a chance to start doing what he has always promised--to change Japan for good.","The country needs a lot more competition , at every level

The DPJ gained 40 seats in the election, winning 177 in all, especially in the cities and suburbs. Left- and right-wing parties alike took heavy losses, with the leaders of both the New Conservative and Social Democratic parties defeated in their own districts. The always feisty Communists had their worst showing in decades, losing 11 of their 20 seats. Thus the DPJ, in only the third lower-house election since the party was formed in 1996, has emerged as a clear and credible choice for disgruntled mainstream voters. Suddenly, Japanese democracy looks alive and kicking. 
The name of the prime minister, however, will not change. Junichiro Koizumi's LDP, despite losing ten seats, still did well enough to hold on to power. After welcoming three independents into the fold, the LDP commands exactly half of parliament's 480 seats. Its planned merger with the devastated New Conservatives should hand the LDP four more seats and a simple majority; the 34 seats of its other partner, New Komeito (the political wing of Japan's largest lay Buddhist organisation), give the coalition a cushion. Everyone is now eager to see how Mr Koizumi and his party will handle their reprieve.
Yet the outlook for the prime minister's ""structural reforms""--a raft of supply-side measures designed to overhaul the economy and spur it back to life--will remain unclear for at least a while longer. One reason for this is Japan's half-century history of one-party dominance, which has long confined the most important battles to within the LDP itself. Indeed, since Mr Koizumi took over in April 2001, the main political contest in Japan has pitted LDP members who back him against LDP members who despise his fiscal discipline and pro-competition policies. A shift towards a two-party system, if that is what the DPJ's strong showing has truly set in motion, will have a big impact on this contest. But the next round of the fight will be within the LDP, as usual.
Will the voice of Japan's voters help to sway the outcome? Perhaps, but it is far from clear what the voters have just said about those reforms. They clearly like the idea of political competition. In a poll after the election, 69% said they welcomed the dawn of two-party politics. But they have yet to embrace fully the economic competition and supply-side reforms that Mr Koizumi, and parts of the rival DPJ, have championed. 
Compare Japan's electoral landscape with those that confronted Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, two foreign leaders to whom Mr Koizumi's supporters often compare him when they appeal for patience. In 1984, when Mr Reagan's re-election campaign declared ""morning in America"" after the dark days of the downturn, the changes he was pushing--more deregulation, riskier labour markets and fewer subsidies--were as scary to many Americans as the prospect of domestic competition and small-business closures are to most Japanese. The same was true in Britain, where in 1983 Mrs Thatcher could point to few rewards after her first term as prime minister, but told voters that more liberalisation was necessary. The two leaders, in effect, asked their citizens: are you brave enough to carry on with what needs to be done? Many voters said Yes, and both won a second term. 
Lionheart and his baiters
In this week's election, however, neither Mr Koizumi nor the DPJ asked voters this question. That may seem odd, since Mr Koizumi, nicknamed ""Lionheart"", seems to talk of nothing else. He took over the LDP two-and-a-half years ago after promising ""reform without sacred cows"". He has battled with his party to hold down spending on public-works projects, which have overrun the country with dams, bridges and roads to nowhere. His own party members now blame his stinginess for keeping the economy sluggish. 
Mr Koizumi has also promised more attacks on government subsidies. He has repeated his pledges to privatise public road corporations and the postal system. And he has stuck to his policy of making banks shed bad loans from their books, despite widespread criticism that bankruptcy rates are already too high.
Even before this election, however, there were signs that the most painful bits of Mr Koizumi's agenda were not especially popular. Polls have shown that voters are more fond of Mr Koizumi than they are of structural reform per se. They like his style and energetic media appeal, as well as his willingness to criticise the LDP's vested interests. Foreign policy has also helped rally support around him. Fear of North Korea's nuclear brinkmanship, and anger over revelations that North Korea had abducted many Japanese citizens in the 1970s and 1980s, have been especially useful to Mr Koizumi.
In some ways, therefore, the DPJ's electoral challenge offered the first good test of voters' appetite for freeing the economy. Many DPJ members believe that Mr Koizumi's reform agenda has only two flaws: it does not go far enough, and he cannot enact it anyway because of resistance from his own party. This message is most appealing to voters in Tokyo, which is not just the seat of government but also the business and media capital, and which is most exposed to foreign ideas. The DPJ has done well in Tokyo in previous elections. It has struggled most in rural districts, where government subsidies are cherished and supply-side reforms are least popular.
The DPJ's chief campaign gimmick, a ""manifesto"" of detailed proposals, accused some of Mr Koizumi's reforms of being too timid. It criticised his half-hearted attempts to grant more autonomy to local governments, vowing to be much tougher on the central bureaucracy. The manifesto was even more averse than Mr Koizumi has been to public-works spending, pledging to slash the budget for such projects by 30%. It promised to cut the cosy links between bureaucrats and the industries they regulate, and even pledged to shrink parliament by 80 seats. 
A frightening landscape
Since the DPJ has done well at the polls by criticising Mr Koizumi for not being reformist enough, is more reform what voters want? On the surface, perhaps. But dig deeper, and there is little evidence that they are truly keen on widespread economic competition. Many big-business leaders certainly want it, at least if they are running companies that have already taken pains to restructure and cut costs. They are tired of seeing uncompetitive firms, propped up by government subsidies and forbearing banks, undercut their prices and tie up resources. Some young and confident Japanese, who have less invested in the current system, are also more willing to try something new. 
Many other people, however, including those who voted for both the mainstream parties, are terrified by the changes they see in society and in the economic landscape. Besides bankruptcy and unemployment rates that seemed unthinkable a decade ago, they are worried by rising crime rates, and are especially uneasy about the role that foreign criminals and disaffected youngsters play in that trend. A looming shortfall in the pension system, combined with the aftermath of Japan's collapsed land bubble, is causing many of them to worry about their own or their parents' retirement.
Along with these other anxieties, Japan's voters harbour an intense fear of economic competition--something many of them have never really experienced. This may seem strange for a country that, not so long ago, terrified western economies with its cheap, high-quality exports of cars and electronics. Much of the country's manufacturing industry remains impressively efficient, having taken steps during the 1990s to stay sharp in the face of growing global competition.
Most of Japan's domestic economy, by contrast, has long behaved very differently. The distribution system, which is stuffed with tiny enterprises, is woefully inefficient. The same is true of many other protected sectors. Construction firms, utilities, telecoms, farmers and the health-care system have fallen well behind America in measures of productivity. When Japan's economy was booming, the problems in these sectors were easily ignored. Huge trade surpluses helped to drive incomes upwards, and egalitarian business practices allowed domestic companies to siphon off much of the wealth. 
After more than a decade of stagnation, the main problem with these sectors now is a socialised financial system that does not encourage weak firms to go out of business. The tax code, the public-works budget and opaque subsidies play a role in propping them up. So does the generosity of many big companies, who face little pressure from banks or shareholders to boost profits, and therefore continue to coddle their long-standing suppliers. The banks themselves have faced too little pressure from regulators to cut off lending to moribund firms.
Shocks to the system
In other words, the ""special interests"" holding Japan back are, in reality, the bulk of the electorate. For a long time, voters did not mind the inefficiency and corruption these practices generated, since the result was a domestic economy that also functioned like a welfare system. Now, however, the mounting hardships and insecurities are starting to take their toll. What voters appear to be doing, therefore, is looking for ways to lash out at the system without actually hitting themselves.
This is not an easy task, but they are getting better at it. Voters in the cities and suburbs, for example, seem increasingly willing to blame rural areas for holding them back. Cutting off explicit spending for construction projects in remote areas is clearly a vote-winner for mainstream politicians, and both Mr Koizumi and the DPJ have championed the idea. 
Anyone with longstanding ties to the political system is also in trouble. During the campaign, the DPJ pointed repeatedly to the prevalence of second- and third-generation politicians in the LDP. Politicians have long been able to use their grass-roots organisations to get children elected. That was harder this time, especially in the cities. Voters even rejected the third son of Tokyo's governor, Shintaro Ishihara, one of Japan's most popular politicians, as well as the son of Mr Kan himself. The DPJ also made gains by running young--and therefore innocent--candidates. It managed to get 43 candidates under 40 elected, four times as many as the LDP.
The DPJ also attacked the other obvious special interest group: bureaucrats. Japan's bureaucracy has been rocked by scandals for years, and the tide of outrage has been rising steadily. Since the last election, the public has put up with revelations involving tainted beef, bad milk, health-and-safety risks at theme parks, cushy contracts for road-related companies, and the revelation that cracks in many nuclear reactors had gone unreported and unrepaired for more than a decade.
In the DPJ manifesto, the most important promises come under the heading of ""showing the bureaucrats who's boss"". The DPJ pledged to stop them working for the companies they regulate after they retire. It vowed to trim their ranks and make them work for the cabinet, rather than the other way round. It also endorsed several reformed ex-bureaucrats as candidates, who turned out to be even more vicious than other candidates in excoriating their former ministries.
The DPJ's most powerful attack on the bureaucracy involved proposals to decentralise spending by granting more autonomy to local governments. The most popular politicians in Japan in recent times have been maverick governors who have promised to get tough on the central bureaucrats. The DPJ helped its cause greatly in this election by championing the locals' cause. Mr Kan told voters that the flamboyant governor of Nagano--who works in a glass office so that everyone can see whom he meets--would join the DPJ cabinet if the party won the election.
Yet attacking narrow special interests is a far cry from embracing economic competition for everyone else. The best example of this is Japan's continuing passion for protecting small- and medium-sized businesses. Mr Kan's main criticism of Mr Koizumi in the campaign was that the prime minister is not spending enough money on them. Mr Kan agrees with Mr Koizumi that depositors' accounts in the postal savings system are misused by the government; but instead of encouraging that money to flow where investment returns are highest, he would prefer to divert the funds towards small-business subsidies. Given the role banks play in propping up inefficient small firms, moreover, the DPJ's recent silence on the issue of non-performing loans speaks volumes.
The battle ahead
In short, both halves of the LDP have good reason to be worried about the election's outcome. For the moment, the old guard is almost pleased that the party did only moderately well at the polls. This is proof, they say, that Mr Koizumi is on the wrong track. Because he failed to lubricate the traditional LDP electoral machinery--including farmers, construction firms and small businesses--the party was unable to grind out enough votes in many hard-fought districts. Moreover, they say, Mr Koizumi's policies of cutting public works and encouraging banks to abandon weak borrowers have hurt the economy.
The trouble with this argument is that the only three things the anti-Koizumi wing can offer--more concrete, old men and a pledge to do nothing--are not going to win over angry and anxious mainstream voters. Yet Mr Koizumi will have to battle to assuage them, too. He needs to convince them that Mr Kan was wrong to label him a compromiser, and therefore he will have to get tougher on his opponents in the LDP. But there are only two ways to do this, each of them risky.
One approach would be to press on strongly with the core of his structural-reform agenda. That means dealing seriously with non-performing loans, and risking many more bankruptcies. But that, in turn, involves challenging Japan's voters to be brave, something Mr Koizumi has so far been reluctant to do. The other option is to focus on the policies and interest groups that voters clearly dislike, and attack them. Mr Koizumi could maintain his tough stance against public-works spending, for example, and forge ahead with plans to privatise the road corporations. Mainstream voters, it appears, will like this. The risk here, however, is that without deeper structural reforms the economy will not improve, and voters will make Mr Koizumi a target of their wrath.
The only policy that seems a clear winner, at this point, is to press for more decentralisation. Mr Koizumi has already done this to some extent, by allowing special economic zones where normal business regulations can be relaxed. Promoting a genuine decentralisation of budgets, however, would require the prime minister to be much tougher on the central bureaucracy than he has been to date. 
If he is willing to take them on, Mr Koizumi can portray himself as the national counterpart to all those maverick governors, removing power from the Tokyo elite even as he brings jobs and growth to the regions. This strategy would be far more likely to end stagnation if it went with a hard new attitude towards small businesses. But even as part of a more modest programme, it would be a good start.

WHO has been the most important financial policymaker in Japan in the past few years? Heizo Takenaka, reappointed two months ago as financial-affairs minister? His boss, Junichiro Koizumi, the prime minister? Arguably, the answer is neither of these, but Hideyuki Aizawa, head of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) powerful committees on anti-deflation and tax and the chief political protector of Japan's sickly banks. Now Mr Aizawa's reign is over. He lost his seat in the general election on November 9th.
In 2000, Mr Aizawa, now 84, was briefly Japan's top financial regulator. He has been particularly influential since that year, shaping policy mainly behind the scenes as leader of the LDP's finance ""tribe"", which lobbies on behalf of banks. Last year, having proposed some mild bank reforms, Mr Takenaka had to beat a swift retreat in the face of Mr Aizawa's opposition. Mr Aizawa also helped persuade Mr Takenaka to push back a weakening of deposit insurance for two years (until March 2005), much to the relief of weak banks who feared the change might prompt a rapid withdrawal of deposits. He also opposed a proposal to restrict the amount of ""deferred tax assets"" which banks are permitted to count as capital. The idea was shelved earlier this year.
Banks have lost powerful allies in election upsets before. Mr Aizawa's fall, however, has left a vacuum. Kazuyoshi Kaneko, a staunch friend of the banks, might have taken over Mr Aizawa's role if he had not recently been appointed minister in charge of administrative and regulatory reform. He will be too busy with his new duties, which include heading a government institution that rescues some of the banks' worst borrowers, to argue the banks' case within the LDP. Yet finding a new political protector is critical, especially for regional banks and credit unions, which face increased regulatory scrutiny. Although rising stockmarkets have given big banks some respite from their problems, they remain riddled with bad loans and will also be looking for new political patrons.
Mr Aizawa was not the only financial specialist to lose his seat or to retire at the election. The LDP is thus short of expertise. Uncomfortably for the banks, perhaps the most prominent of the remaining experts, Yasuhisa Shiozaki, is a radical reformer whose views sit uneasily even with the less conservative parts of the party. In any case, Mr Aizawa's departure should be a marvellous opportunity for Mr Koizumi and Mr Takenaka to press on with reform--if that is really what they want to do. Then again, they may have merely lost their best excuse for not doing so.

 Banks have lost powerful allies in election upsets before . Mr Aizawa 's fall , however , has left a vacuum . Kazuyoshi Kaneko , a staunch friend of the banks , might have taken over Mr Aizawa 's role if he had not recently been appointed minister in charge of administrative and regulatory reform . He will be too busy with his new duties , which include heading a government institution that rescues some of the banks ' worst borrowers , to argue the banks ' case within the LDP . Yet finding a new political protector is critical , especially for regional banks and credit unions , which face increased regulatory scrutiny . Although rising stockmarkets have given big banks some respite from their problems , they remain riddled with bad loans and will also be looking for new political patrons . 
 Mr Aizawa was not the only financial specialist to lose his seat or to retire at the election . The LDP is thus short of expertise . Uncomfortably for the banks , perhaps the most prominent of the remaining experts , Yasuhisa Shiozaki , is a radical reformer whose views sit uneasily even with the less conservative parts of the party . In any case , Mr Aizawa 's departure should be a marvellous opportunity for Junichiro Koizumi to press on with reform -- if that is really what Junichiro Koizumi want to do . Then again , Junichiro Koizumi may have merely lost Junichiro Koizumi's best excuse for not doing so .

NOT long ago, while Japan fretted about imports of tatami mats and shiitake mushrooms, American firms saw China as a land of opportunity. Lately, however, Japanese complaints about Chinese competition have grown more muted, whereas the United States tries to slow Chinese imports of everything from textiles to televisions. Some Japanese are even starting to worry about a different kind of threat--that China's rapid growth may slow.
China's advantages as a fast-growing neighbour are becoming more apparent to Japanese businessmen, who used to complain about its cheap imports. From January to October of this year, Japan's exports to China accounted for nearly two-thirds of its export growth. Besides selling basic consumer goods, Japanese firms have also been exporting to Japanese companies based in China. This has boosted exports of everything from basic inputs such as steel and chemicals to capital equipment.
This gives Japan a broader demand base than it had during its three short-lived rebounds over the past decade. Then, government spending and exports of cars and electronics to America seemed to be the only engines of demand. Now, Asia accounts for 48% of Japan's exports, and America 24%, while optimism and higher profits have also boosted domestic investment by Japanese firms a bit, at least temporarily. But Japan's recent cyclical upturn still looks too weak to withstand much bad news, and one of the biggest concerns in Tokyo these days is that warnings of an overheating Chinese economy will prove well-founded--and that as China begins to cool off, Japan's economy will once again freeze up.
Even so, most Japanese are hardly ready to embrace the idea of an increasingly powerful Chinese economy. One worry is that advances in Chinese technology will make the Middle Kingdom more assertive. When China launched a man into space recently, comparisons with Japan's unimaginative and mismanaged space programme were easy to make. 
Besides this vague security threat, Japan also remains anxious about China's growing economic influence in the region. Its recent wooing of South-East Asian countries, where Japanese companies have long held sway, has raised fears of a new Chinese competitive assault in Japan's backyard. During a mid-December summit with South-East Asian leaders in Tokyo, Junichiro Koizumi, Japan's prime minister, will devote some of his energy to countering China's growing economic clout. The Association of South-East Asian Nations, for example, has long pressured Japan to sign its treaty on non-interference in other countries' affairs, without any success. After China agreed to sign it earlier this year, Japan made noises about doing the same.
Mr Koizumi will also try to get South-East Asian leaders to sign up to a new blueprint for tying their economies more closely to Japan's. Yet, although Japan hopes to negotiate bilateral trade agreements with Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines, those countries want much more freedom to sell farm products to Japan as part of the deal. Alas, hopes that China's growing influence might frighten Japan into abandoning its farm protectionism still seem too much of a stretch.","From threat to opportunity

LIFE has become more complicated for Junichiro Koizumi. Until recently, the prime minister's way of dealing with both the budget deficit (now above 7% of GDP) and political opponents was to slash spending on public works. This made him look tough on deficits but also hurt rivals in his own Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), whose old guard leans on cosy construction ties for political support. But last month's general election has made the budget battle much trickier.
Although the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) is still far short of a majority, it gained 40 seats in the election and has become a legitimate rival. One of its campaign pledges was to give local governments more freedom to tax and spend as they choose. Moreover, the LDP's coalition partner, New Komeito, also gained votes and increased its clout. New Komeito's signature campaign issue, shoring up the pension system, is clearly popular with voters. 
As the finance ministry prepares to release a draft budget this month, it is hoping to hold taxing and spending close to their current levels: roughly yen42 trillion ($390 billion) and yen82 trillion a year, respectively. But it will be hard to do even this, while also pleasing local governments and resolving the pensions impasse.
Start with local finances. Japan's governors and mayors want to keep more locally generated tax revenue, instead of relying heavily on subsidies from the national government. They can spend the former as they choose, whereas subsidies are allocated by central bureaucrats, who also decide how they must be used. The best hope for a solution would be some combination of subsidy cuts and transfers of taxing authority. But Mr Koizumi faces fierce resistance from central-government bureaucrats. They have squealed at his request to find yen1 trillion in subsidy cuts for next year. The finance ministry, meanwhile, is happy to cut subsidies, but does not want to transfer control of tax revenue to local governments.
Forging a consensus on pensions will also require wrenching compromises. First, there is the share paid by the government out of general revenues. The current plan is to raise this tier from one-third to one-half of the total payment over a five-year period. This would cost roughly yen2.7 trillion annually by the fifth year, for which the government would have to find cuts. After the third year or so (and after Mr Koizumi has left office), the extra revenue might come from higher consumption taxes--which the prime minister has promised not to raise during his term.
This week, Mr Koizumi struggled to forge a compromise on the other tier of public pensions, which is funded through premium payments. New Komeito has endorsed a plan to raise premiums paid by workers and employers to a combined 20% of annual income, compared with 13.6% now. This would be paired with benefit cuts from 59.4% of income to 54.7%. Businessmen have balked, calling for a 16% premium and steeper benefits cuts. On December 10th, Mr Koizumi split the difference, telling the labour and welfare ministry to cap premiums at 18%, which would allow benefits payments to stay above the symbolic mark of 50% of salary. While making only a dent in Japan's fiscal problems, the compromises on offer would nonetheless bring a stiff dose of pain.","Last month 's competitive election has spiced up fights over money

IT MAY come as a surprise to French and German officials reforming their crumbling state pension schemes, but Chikara Sakaguchi, Japan's welfare minister, wants one just like theirs. European governments are wondering how to hold down workers' and employers' state-pension contributions and how to encourage their citizens to save more for their old age on their own account. Mr Sakaguchi wants to raise pension payments in Japan to European levels in order to keep the system going for decades. ""We have to come up with a system that in 20 years' time will match state pension schemes in France and Germany,"" he declares.
Not everybody shares his dream. The government's reform proposals, unveiled on December 17th, have horrified business leaders, dismayed finance-ministry officials trying to reduce Japan's huge public debt, and left workers as worried as ever about their old age. The government says that the pension levy on wages, borne equally by workers and employers, should rise from 13.6% now to 18.4% by 2017. It has also promised to increase its share of payments into the basic pensions pot from a third to a half by 2009, though it has not worked out where it will find the extra yen2.7 trillion ($25 billion) a year it will need. The government hopes to keep the ratio of pensioners' benefits to their average salaries above 50%. Now it is around 59%.
This is unlikely to solve a looming pension crisis. Japan has the highest life-expectancy in the world, one of the lowest birth rates and accepts few immigrants, leaving a diminishing workforce paying for a rising number of pensioners. According to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, in 2000 the present value of the public pension system's liabilities exceeded its assets by yen450 trillion, almost a year's GDP. The gap has since grown.
Poor investments have hobbled Japan's public pension funds, which may invest in shares and have often done so simply to prop up the stockmarket. The biggest state-run fund had a shortfall of yen6 trillion at the end of March. The welfare ministry, disastrously, built holiday resorts with pension premiums. Now these must be sold. So far one has been, for 4% of what it cost to build. Not surprisingly, public mistrust is growing, which makes the sums worse. In the national pension scheme covering the self-employed, farmers, fishermen and students, 37% of those supposed to contribute do not bother. Many fear the scheme will collapse before they retire.
The latest reforms do not seem calculated to win those non-payers back. They are based on forecasts that look hard to believe. Officials have assumed that nominal wages (ie, before adjusting for inflation or deflation) will rise, even though they have fallen in four of the past 14 years. They have also assumed nominal investment returns of 3.2% from 2008, even though 20-year government bonds now yield only 1.9%. If any of these assumptions are too optimistic, then either benefits will be below the government target or more money will have to be found.
Japanese business groups are predictably complaining about having to part-finance the reforms. According to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, if the proposals become law, companies will eventually have to pay an extra yen7 trillion in pension premiums each year. This would in effect reverse tax cuts implemented in the past 14 years. ""The holes in the pension system won't go away if the economy doesn't grow,"" says Jeffrey Young, an economist at Nikko Citigroup.
The bill for workers and businesses will in any case be higher than the extra contributions. The government, after all, will surely have to raise taxes in order to pay for its share. Junichiro Koizumi, the prime minister, is adamant that he will not raise consumption tax to cover the bill--a simple method advocated by many in his own party, business groups and trade unions. So he is likely to increase corporate and income taxes instead, making the future for Japan's workers bleaker still.

THERE is no turning back now. Junichiro Koizumi's government took the final decision this week to make history by deploying Japanese ground troops in Iraq. Next week, the main contingent will begin leaving, in stages, for the southern Iraqi town of Samawa. By early March, more than 500 soldiers, along with some air and naval personnel, will be in place in and around Iraq--the first time since the second world war that Japanese troops will be deployed anywhere near a combat zone. Since the troops will set quite a precedent just by showing up, Mr Koizumi--and nearly everyone in Japan--will hope that they do not make even more history by getting shot at. 
The government and the self-defence forces (SDF) have spent months waiting for Iraq to stabilise a bit, all the while trying to devise a reliably uneventful mission. A small advance team of soldiers has checked out Samawa and concluded that it is a relatively safe, stable and manageable part of the country. The mission is to improve the local water supply, distribute medicine, put up buildings and in general help Samawa's people without having to use force. Nevertheless, the troops will live in a well-fortified camp and be authorised to return fire if attacked. 
The deployment is a controversial step at home. Since the mission stretches the notion of self-defence--to cover troops outside Japan, whom the government is knowingly putting in harm's way--it represents a once-unthinkable interpretation of the pacifist constitution. Indeed, the opposition leader, Naoto Kan, has questioned the move's constitutionality. Although his Democratic Party has supported other recent laws to upgrade and clarify Japan's defence guidelines, it opposed the law last July that authorised the mission, and plans to make it an issue in upper-house elections in July.
Mr Koizumi's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) could take some solace this week from a Yomiuri opinion poll, which showed that 53% of Japanese support the troop deployment. And although the LDP's coalition partner, New Komeito, has a pacifist streak (it is backed by Japan's largest lay Buddhist organisation), 69% of Komeito supporters approve too.
Still, the move is clearly risky. Many of its supporters are lukewarm, and would quickly change their minds if it goes wrong. In addition, more than 40% of Japan's voters claim no party affiliation, and only 42% of this swing group backs the sending of troops. 
Japan has much more at stake, moreover, than the outcome of this summer's elections. Since the terrorist attacks on America in September 2001, a long-delayed debate on Japan's defence and diplomacy has gone into full swing. The LDP hopes to enact a law this year that will lay the groundwork for revising Japan's constitution--written under American occupation after the second world war--with debate focusing especially on the document's pacifist restrictions. Public debate and opinion have reached a stage at which such revisions now seem at least possible. But that could change quickly if the mission in Iraq goes wrong, and if Japanese soldiers either get killed or end up shooting the wrong people.","Some odd - looking pacifists en - route to Mesopotamia

Japan is going through a complex national identity crisis. That may be no bad thing, says a new book by an American academic Japanologist
THE economy is stalled, but the society is in motion. That is John Nathan's own summary of his new book, and it fits the bill admirably. Japan is a difficult country to report on and analyse because things do not change in big, noticeable ways, flagged by set-piece events and announcements, as they often do elsewhere. They change in an incremental process, generally of small steps but which, over time, can add up to big movements. And just such a big movement seems to be taking place.
Mr Nathan, a professor of Japanese cultural studies at the University of California at Santa Barbara, has been observingJapan since the 1960s. Whereas mostpeople look at economic data or the comings and goings of prime ministers, he is more interested in schools, novels, manga comic books, and the minds of young entrepreneurs and maverick local politicians. In particular, his focus is on whether Japan's famously cohesive, conformist society may be fracturing under the strain of economic stagnation, and on how such strains have been affecting the country's sense of purpose and of national identity.
Fractures are what he looks for andfractures are what he finds. On balance, they are neither obviously dangerous nor obviously positive, but they are, as he says, signs of motion which could, in time, lead in unpredictable directions. The mostworrying fractures he writes about are in the schools, where violence and truancy have risen remarkably. Old Japan hands shrug wearily at such things, for worries about bullying have long existed but have never really seemed terribly serious. Now, though, Mr Nathan's numbers do make the situation look grave.
Since 1998, youths aged between 14 and 19 have been involved in 50% of all arrests for felonies, including murder. In the first six months of 2000, he says, juveniles (including even younger ones) committed a record 532 killings. In the first 11 months of 2001, juvenile crime increased by 12.5% compared with the previous year, to 920,000 incidents, a post-war high. Truancy is also on the up. A conservative estimate is that 150,000 children between the ages of six and 17 are permanently absent from school; others, says Mr Nathan, assert that the true number is 350,000 children, or 5% of the student population.
Such trends appear to be symptoms of two related phenomena: a widespread feeling of disillusionment, alienation, uncertainty or plain anger, which has spread to children too; and a gradual breakdown of old systems of discipline--part familial, part social, part legal--which appear toprevent schools and parents from dealing effectively with errant children.
Japan is, in short, passing through anational identity crisis. There are plenty of positive aspects to it too, however. One is a considerable increase in the number of actual or budding young entrepreneurs, a trend especially visible in the willingness of high-flyers to leave good, safe jobs inorder to set up their own firms. The numbers remain modest, but are nevertheless surprisingly high given the state of the economy in recent years. Another is a new eagerness among popular writers and maverick politicians to try to define and encourage a new national pride.
Mr Nathan picks three particularly interesting cases, two of which combine the roles of politician and popular writer. What is also notable is that he pays virtually no attention to the man keenest to describe himself as a maverick agent of change, namely the prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi. Deeming Mr Koizumi to be essentially part of the establishment, Mr Nathan instead offers profiles of two contrasting outsiders: the now elderly novelist turned politician, Shintaro Ishihara, who is governor of Tokyo and stands for an old-fashioned sort of hard-edged nationalism; and a much younger writer, Yasuo Tanaka, who is governor of Nagano prefecture and advocates a softer, pacifist and hedonistic sort of national identity.
What these two have in common, though, is that both argue that Japan must shake itself free of the too-close and dependent relationship it has had with the United States for the past half century. They do not argue that Japan should define itself by opposition to America but rather that it should be much more independent of it. Mr Nathan's third case, a bestselling cartoonist called YoshinoriKobayashi, concurs, calling for Japan to stop cringing about its past and about its international status, and to adopt instead what he calls ""arrogant-ism""--ie, a strong sense of national pride. 
It is not clear where all this will lead: will hard-edged nationalism really take hold, or will it be softer hedonism? And will the current close relationship with America endure for fear of dangers such as North Korea? What is clear, however, is that a lively debate is taking place over that relationship and its effect on national identity, one partly stimulated by the war in Iraq, as has occurred elsewhere in the world, but also one arising from longer-term trends, including economic strains as well as the revival of cultural and economic ties with China.
Occasionally, Mr Nathan seems over-stimulated by his own concerns about America. For instance he claims, without offering any citations or evidence, that ""since early in 2003 the United States has been pressuring Japan to arm itself with nuclear weapons and tell the Chinese of its intention as a way of persuading Beijing to get tough with North Korea."" Now that, as we journalists say, would be a story, and if true it is one we have all missed. What is certain is that some mainstream Japanese politicians have become willing to make speeches openly advocating nuclearisation, and perhaps that has been encouraged by their American friends as a way to chivvy the Chinese.
This is a minor cavil, however, in the context of a fascinating book. Japan'ssociety is changing, in complex butseemingly powerful ways, and Mr Nathan brings those ways alive with a wealth of anecdote and insight.","Japan Unbound : A Volatile Nation 's Quest for Pride and Purpose .

THERE have been so many aborted take-offs that Japan's latest economic recovery is bound to be greeted with scepticism. There has also been so little fundamental reform in most of the things radicals have been worried about--banks, life insurance firms, privatisation, and much more--that to many it will seem impossible to accept that things can really be looking brighter. Yet they are. For the first time in a decade, Japan is enjoying an upswing that could actually last.
Figures for real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2003, due out next week, could well show an annualised growth rate of as much as 4%, making the seventh successive quarter of positive growth. Even nominal GDP has stopped falling, as deflation has eased. Alongside that good news, there is less of the bad sort: bankruptcies in 2003 were more than 14% down on 2002, both in terms of the numbers of firms and of their total liabilities; and the burden that bad loans impose on banks is gradually diminishing. 
How can this miracle have happened? Part of the reason is a benign mixture of cycle and happenstance: economic activity tends to revive naturally after a few years of stagnation, once companies invest a bit more and rebuild their stocks; and China's economic boom has helped by sucking in huge quantities of Japanese-made steel, manufactures and capital goods. Another big explanation, though, lies in corporate restructuring, mainly among larger Japanese firms. They have cut costs and repaid trillions of yen worth of debt, with the result that these big firms' profits are rising faster even than those of their American rivals ()see page 83. The final reason, and the best case for optimism that this time the recovery will last, is that the Bank of Japan's monetary policy has now become steadily and credibly expansionary. Although the change towards such an expansionary stance has been claimed to be happening for several years, it has become consistent and believable only since Toshihiko Fukui took over as the central bank's governor 11 months ago ()see page 84.
Many things could come along to make this optimism look misplaced. China's economy could overheat and then collapse, hurting Japanese exports. The yen could climb against the dollar and other currencies, also hurting exports as well as adding to Japan's problem of falling domestic prices (ie, deflation). Stronger economic growth or even investors' overblown fears that monetary expansion might stoke up too much future inflation could cause a crisis in the government-bond market, which would ravage banks that hold lots of bonds and would raise the government's borrowing costs. With general government debt equivalent to 160% of GDP, the public finances remain arguably the darkest cloud hanging over Japan's economy. In 1997 a previous government was so worried about its then-much-smaller debts that it raised consumption tax, succeeding only in snuffing out that period's economic recovery prematurely.
Those are fair worries, all of them, and doubtless others could be added to the list. Japan's economy remains fragile, its financial system especially so. Resources are still misallocated, so-called ""zombie"" companies are being kept alive by banks and harming the prospects of other, stronger firms, and regulatory barriers still inhibit entrepreneurship. Much needs to change, in other words. But the good years of the 1980s took place even though many things were already wrong; similarly, the bad years can come to an end even when not everything--or even most things--have been put right.
Winds of change
If monetary policy continues to be expansionary, and if the current government does not repeat the mistake of raising taxes, there is a good chance that recovery can be sustained. The much bigger question, though, is whether it can be strong enough to raise Japanese living standards once more and to enable the country to overcome the huge problems that confront it: its gigantic public debts and the costs imposed by the ageing of its population.
To overcome those burdens, Japan needs to achieve strong, steady economic growth over many years, not just one or two. And to achieve that, it will need to implement the structural reforms that radicals have been calling for, generally in vain, over the past decade: more privatisation and competition, sounder banks, more deregulation. Quietly, Japanese society has been changing in recent years, with younger people more eager to start companies and to try new ventures. But that change has been mild thanks to a depressed economy and to strong resistance to reform among politicians, bureaucrats and many old-established companies. A new vigour is waiting to be unleashed. The danger is that in the warmth of a new sunrise, reforms will feel less necessary.
That danger is real. But there are reasons to be optimistic even there. The general election last November left the existing coalition government in power, but it revealed a strong desire for reform. The main opposition party became united at last, and now looks a viable alternative government for the first time in years. Fear of that ought to enable the prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, to push through changes in the social-security system and to prepare for the privatisation of the powerful postal savings bank, despite stiff resistance inside his own party. For if reforms do not look like proceeding, the opposition could strengthen its hold over the Upper House of the Diet in elections this summer. That could even tempt part of the governing coalition to defect, especially if things go badly for Mr Koizumi's brave foreign-policy adventure--the dispatch, now under way, of Japanese soldiers to Iraq.
After a decade during which economic stagnation, bankruptcies, bad debts and entrenched political interests produced a vicious circle, Japan now appears to be entering a virtuous one. If it continues, the revival of the world's second biggest economy will be good for the world, both by removing a horrible risk of collapse and by beginning to add to global demand. But most of all it will be good for the Japanese people, for they have suffered for far too long from slow growth, vested interests and incompetent public policy.","This time , the economic recovery looks sustainable

THE diplomats left empty-handed but the lawmakers are getting into the act. On February 14th, a Japanese delegation returned from bilateral meetings in Pyongyang, ahead of a six-nation Beijing summit on North Korea's nuclear-weapons programmes that will begin on February 25th. Although Japan has taken a firm line against North Korea's nukes, the bilateral talks focused on another volatile issue: unresolved questions and demands stemming from North Korea's abduction of Japanese citizens two decades ago. 
The plight of the abductees and their families has been among Japan's most emotional political issues since September 2002, when Junichiro Koizumi, the prime minister, made a historic visit to Pyongyang. During the summit, North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, admitted that his country had kidnapped 13 Japanese citizens in the late 1970s and early 1980s. He claimed that eight of them had died in captivity from an assortment of accidents and natural causes. A month later, Mr Kim allowed the five survivors to visit Japan ""temporarily"", but kept their North Korean spouses and their children behind. The abductees refused to return and have been in Japan, divided from their families, ever since. 
Mr Koizumi has boosted his popularity by pressing North Korea on the issue. Last year he named Shinzo Abe, a young member of parliament hawkish on North Korea, as secretary-general of his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Besides prodding North Korea to let the family members go, the government has also demanded details about the deaths of the eight other abductees, and about the fate of two more Japanese whom it accuses North Korea of kidnapping. Nevertheless, some of the repatriated abductees and their relatives lashed out at Mr Koizumi this week for sending Hitoshi Tanaka, a deputy foreign minister, with last week's delegation. Many Japanese supporting a firm line on the nuclear threats and the adbuctee issue accuse Mr Tanaka, who engineered Mr Koizumi's Pyongyang visit in 2002, of being too soft on Mr Kim's regime. 
Japan's parliament prefers firmness too. Last week it passed a law enabling the government to impose financial and trade sanctions against North Korea. On February 17th, LDP committees approved a second bill--aimed at the ferry North Korea uses to fetch hard currency from Korean groups in Japan--that would let the government turn away ships from threatening countries. Mr Koizumi has said that although he has no immediate plans to deploy any of these sanctions, his government is dealing with North Korea using ""both dialogue and pressure"". That is twice as many diplomatic tools as Japan had in the past.

During the summit , North Korea 's leader , Kim Jong Il , admitted that his country had kidnapped 13 Japanese citizens in the late 1970s and early 1980s . He claimed that eight of them had died in captivity from an assortment of accidents and natural causes . A month later , Mr Kim allowed the five survivors to visit Japan "" temporarily "" , but kept their North Korean spouses and their children behind . The abductees refused to return and have been in Japan , divided from their families , ever since . 
 Junichiro Koizumi has boosted Junichiro Koizumi's popularity by pressing North Korea on the issue . Last year Junichiro Koizumi named Shinzo Abe , a young member of parliament hawkish on North Korea , as secretary - general of Junichiro Koizumi's ruling Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) . Besides prodding North Korea to let the family members go , the government has also demanded details about the deaths of the eight other abductees , and about the fate of two more Japanese whom it accuses North Korea of kidnapping . Nevertheless , some of the repatriated abductees and their relatives lashed out at Junichiro Koizumi this week for sending Hitoshi Tanaka , a deputy foreign minister , with last week 's delegation . Many Japanese supporting a firm line on the nuclear threats and the adbuctee issue accuse Mr Tanaka , who engineered Junichiro Koizumi's Pyongyang visit in 2002 , of being too soft on Mr Kim 's regime . 
 Japan 's parliament prefers firmness too . Last week it passed a law enabling the government to impose financial and trade sanctions against North Korea . On February 17th , LDP committees approved a second bill -- aimed at the ferry North Korea uses to fetch hard currency from Korean groups in Japan -- that would let the government turn away ships from threatening countries . Junichiro Koizumi has said that although Junichiro Koizumi has no immediate plans to deploy any of these sanctions , Junichiro Koizumi's government is dealing with North Korea using "" both dialogue and pressure "" . That is twice as many diplomatic tools as Japan had in the past .

WITH everyone but Mongolia and North Korea doing it, even South Korea's protectionists could not resist any longer. After three failed attempts, the National Assembly finally ratified the country's first-ever free-trade agreement (FTA) last week. Since such agreements are becoming commonplace, and since South Korea chose a modest and distant trading partner, Chile, for its first foray into tariff-free trade, it would be easy to dismiss the treaty's importance to the rest of Asia. Yet it may signal the start of a more aggressive phase in the region's trade policy.
Most of Asia's recent trade deals have been tame agreements, knocking down barriers between countries with little to lose, but also little to gain, from freeing two-way trade in most sectors. Rich and tiny Singapore has been a popular partner for such deals, because it does not threaten the powerful farm lobbies of other countries. Long a member of the ten-nation Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), Singapore has signed bilateral agreements in the past two years with Japan, Australia and America, and is talking to South Korea, India, Canada and Mexico about other FTAs.
However, what might be called the Singapore phase of Asian trade talks may now be giving way to something more substantial. The proliferation of simple FTAs is pushing many Asian countries to make bigger ""concessions"" in a race to secure better access to nearby economies. That even a perennial hold-out such as South Korea now shares some of this urgency is telling. Violent protests had delayed passage of its FTA with Chile for over a year. South Korea's government hopes the deal will pave the way for more valuable agreements with its two giant neighbours, China and Japan. A similar sense of desperation has been gripping Japan's trade bureaucrats, who have launched their own bid to speed up FTA talks.
Last week, with Junichiro Koizumi, Japan's prime minister, urging it on, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) more than doubled the size of its core FTA team. The extra manpower will aid negotiations with Korea, Mexico and several ASEAN economies. It will also make it easier for METI to resist opposition from the rival farm and labour ministries, and to make the case for freer trade directly to Japanese journalists. 
Like South Korea, Japan is making a trial run with a non-Asian country, in its case Mexico. Here, it ought to be able to win domestic support for an FTA. Japanese businessmen, especially in the car and steel industries, want tariff-free access to a country in which they can assemble products cheaply for export to America. Still, a previous round of talks with Mexico, over farm products, collapsed late last year, even though imports of the two most contentious products, orange juice and pork, matter little to Japan's total farm sector. The country's farm lobbies fear that if they give a little, pressure will mount to allow freer imports of rice and other cherished products from countries such as Thailand and the Philippines. 
Why are Japan, South Korea and many other Asian countries pressing for more and meatier FTAs? The most obvious reasons are China's growing economic weight and its willingness to throw it around. In 2002, China's total trade volume with Japan, South Korea, India and the ten ASEAN members topped $200 billion, more than a 20% increase over 2001. Its trade growth appears to have accelerated in 2003: early last year, China's trade with Japan was rising at an annual rate of 36%, and with South-East Asia by 49%. 
China's own appetite for trade deals has grown along with its economy. This has been fuelled partly by its frenetic quest for markets, materials and machinery. Chinese companies are especially keen on Australia, since their economy is chronically short of commodities--crude oil, copper, aluminium, iron ore and natural gas--to fuel its breakneck expansion. The two countries will begin talks on an FTA in March. Since joining the WTO in 2001, China has also grown more sanguine about the potential risks of trade deals. Cheap imports have caused less disruption than many had expected, and even the country's farming sector has not been hit as badly as feared. 
Geopolitics is also driving China into trade talks. Its desire to appear a responsible regional power, and to integrate itself economically with the formerly wary countries of ASEAN in a way that gives them obvious advantages, is a powerful driver of its regional trade strategy. It also hopes for the emergence of an Asian economic block that might negotiate more effectively with America and the EU. If China can overtake Japan along the way, and become Asia's paramount economic voice, so much the better.
ASEAN countries have taken even greater notice of China's ability to suck in foreign direct investment. If they are to have any hope of luring foreign businessmen these days, these countries need to trumpet their growing economic ties with Asia's next giant. Some are also seeking greater ties with the established one, Japan. The Philippines, for instance, wants to send nurses to Japan, which needs cheaper care for its elderly.
In North-East Asia, the trading motives are different. Although South Korea hopes to cut FTAs with both China and Japan, its two big neighbours still watch one another warily. Japanese companies have been pouring investment into China over the past couple of years, and Japan owes much of its recent economic recovery to trade with its fast-growing neighbour. Notably, however, the trade pairing with the most obvious potential impact--a Sino-Japanese FTA--is not even on the table. China has launched a trade offensive to boost its growth and increase its regional influence; Japan is responding by pressing for its own deals with anyone in the region who seems game. Yet Asia's two economic giants are still too distrustful of one another to sit and discuss an FTA. So far.","Why Asian countries are racing to sign bilateral trade deals with each other

A BIT of growth has put a prettier face on many of Japan's economic problems lately. But the government's cavalier way with public money remains as unattractive as ever. On March 9th, the cabinet approved a long-debated plan to ""privatise"" Japan's profligate public road corporations--resulting in little more than a makeover for them. Meanwhile, the state-backed Industrial Revitalisation Corporation was trying in vain this week to justify its planned bail-out of a large cosmetics company--even though another Japanese firm has already offered to rescue it with private money. These unfortunate habits make it hard to be cheery about Japan's public finances, even though, as the budget that cleared parliament's lower house last week suggests, the current upturn may bring mildly good news.
The new budget calls for yen82 trillion ($732 billion) of spending in the year beginning April 1st, roughly the same as this year. The encouraging part is that tax revenues, which slid in 2001-02 as the economy tumbled, will probably stabilise, and perhaps even recover a bit, if the economy keeps expanding. 
The Economist's poll of forecasters predicts 2.6% growth in 2004, highly respectable after the last decade's woes. The government's own calculations show that total tax revenues should remain roughly unchanged in the coming fiscal year. That should bring a halt, at least for now, to the sharp rise in borrowing that has occurred during the first three years of Junichiro Koizumi's term as prime minister. The government now pays for 45% of all new spending with borrowed money (see chart); and total public debt is around 150% of GDP.
A long period of sustained economic growth would help, but the government will still have to take tough measures eventually. So this week's decision on road ""privatisation"" is especially discouraging. This was to be one of Mr Koizumi's signature reforms, along with the privatisation of the postal system. Yet after three years in office, all he has come up with is a plan to alter the way in which the government subsidises pointless new highways.
Japan's existing network of toll roads, along with its yen40 trillion in associated debts, will be rolled into a single entity, which will use toll revenues to repay the debt over the next 45 years. The government will also move the road-building bits of the old public corporations into six new, nominally private, companies. It expects these to borrow fresh money--crucially, with the government's backing--to finance new roads that few onlookers expect to offer commercial value. It is not a pretty sight.","The government still needs to mend its ways

ONE measure of the distrust among Japan, China and South Korea is that they often need other countries to give them an excuse to talk. The three nations' leaders and foreign ministers meet every year as guests of their distant neighbours in the Association of South-East Asian Nations. Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, met China's president, Hu Jintao, twice last year--both times on the sidelines of other international gatherings. So it seems encouraging that they have now decided, as Yoriko Kawaguchi, Japan's foreign minister, announced this week, to start holding their own three-way powwow every year.
The question, of course, is whether they will find anything constructive to talk about. Mrs Kawaguchi's news followed her visit on April 3rd and 4th to China, to meet Wen Jiabao, the premier, and Li Zhaoxing, the foreign minister. It was a familiar stand-off, between a Japan that doesn't regret and a neighbour that won't forget. China's (and South Korea's) diplomats never tire of complaining about Mr Koizumi's regular visits to the Yasukuni shrine, where Japan's war criminals are honoured along with its dead soldiers. On April 7th, a Japanese district court raised constitutional doubts about the visits, though Mr Koizumi promised to keep going. Mrs Kawaguchi, in turn, protested at last month's landing by Chinese nationalists on the Senkakus, a disputed set of islands near Taiwan that Japan seized more than a century ago.
Although history and nationalism grab the headlines, however, there is another way to view all of this bluster. Instead of showing that closer ties are impossible, the mutual accusations and demands for apologies may be more in the nature of ritualistic display, while better relations are quietly constructed. Fast-growing trade and investment links, after all, are rapidly pulling North-East Asia's economies into closer contact ()see pages 65-67. 
Business and economic ventures are already blazing the trail for the diplomats. On April 3rd, the three countries signed an agreement to promote a common Linux-based operating system to rival Microsoft in computer software. They also agreed to work together to look into a common standard for the next generation of mobile phones. More broadly, one hears far fewer complaints in Japan these days about rapid Chinese economic growth, since China is becoming an integral part of Japan's supply chain and is now a big consumer of Japanese wares.
None of this will alter the strategic wariness across the region, of course. China is a fast-rising rival to the United States; Japan is one of America's closest allies. Japan is under pressure to integrate itself into an American missile-defence shield that China opposes. North Korea has long had close ties with China; many Japanese consider it the closest thing they have to an enemy. And Chinese businessmen and political leaders are courting influence in South-East Asia, where Japan once held much greater sway. Despite these conflicts, however, North-East Asia is now one of the world's most exciting economic areas. As growth, trade and investment lower barriers in the region, it is only natural that these neighbours should lean over the fence occasionally to chat.

Junichiro Koizumi's met China 's president , Hu Jintao , twice last year -- both times on the sidelines of other international gatherings . So it seems encouraging that they have now decided , as Yoriko Kawaguchi , Japan 's foreign minister , announced this week , to start holding their own three - way powwow every year . 
 The question , of course , is whether they will find anything constructive to talk about . Mrs Kawaguchi 's news followed her visit on April 3rd and 4th to China , to meet Wen Jiabao , the premier , and Li Zhaoxing , the foreign minister . It was a familiar stand - off , between a Japan that does n't regret and a neighbour that wo n't forget . China 's ( and South Korea 's ) diplomats never tire of complaining about Junichiro Koizumi's regular visits to the Yasukuni shrine , where Japan 's war criminals are honoured along with its dead soldiers . On April 7th , a Japanese district court raised constitutional doubts about the visits , though Junichiro Koizumi promised to keep going . Mrs Kawaguchi , in turn , protested at last month 's landing by Chinese nationalists on the Senkakus , a disputed set of islands near Taiwan that Japan seized more than a century ago . 
 Although history and nationalism grab the headlines , however , there is another way to view all of this bluster . Instead of showing that closer ties are impossible , the mutual accusations and demands for apologies may be more in the nature of ritualistic display , while better relations are quietly constructed . Fast - growing trade and investment links , after all , are rapidly pulling North - East Asia 's economies into closer contact ( ) see pages 65 - 67 . 
 Business and economic ventures are already blazing the trail for the diplomats . On April 3rd , the three countries signed an agreement to promote a common Linux - based operating system to rival Microsoft in computer software . They also agreed to work together to look into a common standard for the next generation of mobile phones . More broadly , one hears far fewer complaints in Japan these days about rapid Chinese economic growth , since China is becoming an integral part of Japan 's supply chain and is now a big consumer of Japanese wares . 
 None of this will alter the strategic wariness across the region , of course . China is a fast - rising rival to the United States ; Japan is one of America 's closest allies . Japan is under pressure to integrate itself into an American missile - defence shield that China opposes . North Korea has long had close ties with China ; many Japanese consider it the closest thing they have to an enemy . And Chinese businessmen and political leaders are courting influence in South - East Asia , where Japan once held much greater sway . Despite these conflicts , however , North - East Asia is now one of the world 's most exciting economic areas . As growth , trade and investment lower barriers in the region , it is only natural that these neighbours should lean over the fence occasionally to chat .

THE decisive test of Junichiro Koizumi's decision to send troops to Iraq was bound to come from events on the ground. But the news, when it arrived, was still a horrible shock. On April 8th, while members of Japan's Self Defence Forces (SDF) huddled safely in their compound in the southern Iraqi town of Samawa, Japan's public learned that three Japanese citizens had been kidnapped elsewhere in the country. A group calling itself the Mujahideen Brigades released disturbing video footage of their blindfolded and frightened captives, and warned that the three would suffer a ghastly death if Japan's prime minister did not withdraw the SDF within three days. Mr Koizumi refused, and a consensus rapidly began to form in Japan: if the captors followed through on their threat, Mr Koizumi's three-year-old government would collapse after the upper house elections this summer, if not sooner. 
Then, just as quickly, that view gave way to confusion. On April 11th, another statement, purportedly from the kidnappers, announced that the three captives would soon be released. Among the reasons, the group cited the intervention of influential clerics in the area and the notion that the three prisoners (an aid volunteer, an anti-war researcher and a photojournalist) all represent a pacifist, anti-Koizumi and anti-American segment of Japan's public. 
Hostages from several other countries were freed early this week, adding to the negotiators' bewilderment and the public's frustration. Things got worse on April 14th, when two more Japanese citizens were reported kidnapped and an Italian hostage was killed. Then, the next day, al-Jazeera reported that three hostages had been released. Whatever has happened, though, the government has been rattled.
Given Japan's pacifist constitution, the mere act of sending an SDF contingent to Iraq--even though they are non-combat troops--was a huge step. So when he took it, Mr Koizumi did his utmost to make the deployment as uneventful as possible. The government waited until early this year to send the troops and chose the relatively quiet and stable town of Samawa in southern Iraq. Troops there have spent their time building and repairing infrastructure, and have rarely been in danger. 
Yet despite the safe conditions and the humanitarian nature of the mission, the deployment is still controversial. The Democrats, Japan's biggest opposition party, were against it, and public opinion was evenly split before the kidnappings. Any significant shift in that balance could profoundly alter the course of Japan's foreign policy. For most of Mr Koizumi's term, beginning with the terrorist attacks on America in September 2001, the Japanese have been debating their security policy with a frankness that would once have been unimaginable. 
There are important questions to settle. Since Japan depends so much on the world to sustain its economy and supply its resources, what more should it do to promote stability in the Middle East and elsewhere? If Japan does expand the role of the SDF, should it be to increase its independence from the United States, to help America, or to do a little of each? How much should Japan overhaul its defence strategy given regional threats such as that from North Korea? These would be tough questions for any country to answer but are especially so in Japan. Its people have lived under America's protection for more than half a century and have difficulty looking clearly on the outside world and its dangers. This week's hostage crisis, however it ends, is likely only to compound the confusion.

ONLY six months ago, the beaming smile of Naoto Kan symbolised a historic achievement for Japan's opposition. Mr Kan's Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) had just put up an impressive fight in a general election against the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which had dominated politics almost continuously since 1955. Although the DPJ failed to win a majority, the close election seemed to usher in a long-awaited era of competitive two-party politics, something Japan has never enjoyed but sorely needs. The DPJ looked far less competitive on May 10th, however, as a chastened Mr Kan resigned in embarrassment after being outflanked by Junichiro Koizumi's government over a pensions scandal. The DPJ fell quickly into disarray, which is no place to be with upper-house elections looming in mid-July.
Mr Kan's original transgression was unremarkable: he failed to pay premiums into the national pension plan during a ten-month stretch in the mid-1990s. Many other political heavyweights, including six members of Mr Koizumi's cabinet, committed similar misdeeds. Mr Kan would probably still be leading the DPJ, therefore, if he had not committed a second, unforgivable, political sin: hurling accusations at his enemies before taking the elementary precaution of confirming that his own record was clean. To spice up the debate over a pensions-reform package, Mr Kan had been attacking non-payers in the Koizumi cabinet before news broke that he, too, had missed payments. When the government's top-ranking pensions offender--the chief cabinet secretary, Yasuo Fukuda--then resigned to take responsibility for his co-partisans, Mr Kan was left with little option but to fall on his own sword in response.
This week the DPJ scrambled to find a successor to Mr Kan. The party's leading lights offered the job to Ichiro Ozawa, who folded his Liberal Party into the DPJ before last year's elections. Mr Ozawa said he would ""seriously consider"" the invitation. But the succession issue raises tricky questions for the DPJ--and not just because the peripatetic Mr Ozawa has made a career of tearing political parties asunder. Former Liberals want to loosen restrictions on Japan's military, something that the DPJ's pacifist wing staunchly opposes. Mr Ozawa's bunch are also at odds with other DPJ members over how to attack the LDP's pension reforms, which will be one of the biggest issues in the upper-house election campaign.
On May 11th most DPJ members voted against the government's reform package, which will gradually raise premiums and cut benefits over more than a decade, but backed an additional government plan to begin looking for ways to merge separate pension schemes for company workers, government officials and the self-employed. Mr Ozawa and other former Liberals, however, opposed the government's plans in full, and failed to show up for either vote. None of this bodes well for the party's future under the possible leadership of a man who many DPJ members always feared would turn out to be a cuckoo in the nest.
Although the DPJ has lost an important battle, Mr Koizumi has arguably been wounded as well, even if he is not forced to jettison any of his cabinet ministers over the scandal. A strong opposition, after all, makes it easier for him to take on enemies within his own party. So after losing both Mr Fukuda (who was his right-hand man) and his highly valuable opponent, Mr Kan, in short order, the prime minister may now find himself having to do a bit of scrambling of his own.

Mr Kan is a relatively popular and even a charismatic figure: he gave the LDP a bloody nose in last November's general election, and he was hoping to follow this up with further gains in the vote, in July, for half the seats in the upper house of parliament. Under his leadership, a genuine two-party system that has proved so elusive in Japan seemed at last a possibility. On May 7th he drew blood, forcing the resignation of the cabinet secretary, Yasuo Fukuda, a close ally of the prime minister.
Sadly, Mr Kan had neglected to take the precaution of ensuring that his own payments were in order. They were not. Now Mr Kan has been forced out. The man tipped to succeed him, Ichiro Ozawa, then pulled out as well, embroiled in the same scandal. After an embarrassing period of casting about, the DPJ now has a new leader, Katsuya Okada. He has the virtue of youth (he is 50, Mr Koizumi 62), but also obscurity.
The DPJ was fighting back late last week, when it was revealed that Mr Koizumi, too, had missed some payments. These, like Mr Ozawa's, dated to before 1986 but, the opposition argued, it was a lawmaker's duty to set a good example, even if payment was not obligatory. And it looked bad that Mr Koizumi had failed to disclose the omissions. But at the weekend, he pulled off a bold counter-strike, by flying to North Korea. It was risky: Kim Jong-il, North Korea's reclusive despot, is nothing if not unpredictable. But Mr Koizumi got what he went for: five North Korean-born offspring of Japanese abducted by North Korea during the cold war. The parents had been freed in 2002, but Mr Koizumi has now reunited them with the relatives they had to leave behind.
Mr Koizumi has been much criticised. He failed to get news of another ten missing people--North Korea says they are dead--despite handing over $10m and 250,000 tonnes of food. He secured no indication that North Korea would prove more tractable in talks about its illicit nuclear programmes. Nonetheless, the wily prime minister emerged the winner. His poll ratings shot up by about ten points, to levels that are stellar for any Japanese prime minister, let alone one who has just completed his third year in office. Before Mr Koizumi, Japan had got through seven prime ministers in eight years.
The biggest worry for Mr Koizumi may in fact be that the opposition is now so weak. He claims to be a reformer, and has always depended on his personal bond with the voters to impose change on his own, reluctant party, which knows it cannot do without him. But now, with the economy perking up and the DPJ in disarray, he may, paradoxically, find the going harder. All his most cherished plans--reform of road-building, post-office privatisation, deregulation of services, a rethink of Japan's outdated security policy, attempts to tackle the huge budget deficit--have been eviscerated by his own side. A good opponent is what Mr Koizumi, and Japan, now need. Everyone must hope Mr Okada is up to the task.","Japan 's prime minister has had another skilful escape . Not so his opponents .

WHAT is Japan's most powerful interest-group? Farmers, postal workers and construction firms are always high on the list. But most people outside Japan underrate the power of two ferocious pressure-groups: its doctors and dentists. A recent bribery scandal--five members of the Japan Dental Association (JDA) were indicted last month--has given the public an X-ray view of these lobbies' efforts to influence medical policy. 
As with Japan's other traditional lobbies, however, dentists and independent doctors are gradually being overpowered by a range of new groups backing broader national interests. The battle over medical fees offers a case study of the forces that are prising open Japan's infamous iron triangle of narrow private interests, politicians and bureaucrats.
Long before the recent bribery scandal, the Japanese were telling opinion pollsters of their unhappiness with the health system. Patients complain most about waiting times and limited information. A study published in 2000 by the McKinsey Global Institute, a think-tank tied to a business consultancy, found pitifully low productivity in Japan's health-care system, compared with America, Britain and Germany. Even after a decade of recession, a 2002 government survey found that voters still worried more about health care than about jobs and incomes. The most popular television drama during the past season was ""Shiroi Kyoto"", a hospital drama in which infighting and corruption run rife among the medical staff. 
Distorted fees are behind many of the problems. The five JDA members who were indicted are charged with bribing two members of the national medical council that sets fees for everything from surgery and specialist visits to routine check-ups with a doctor or dentist. 
Even apart from the bribery scandal, the JDA and its counterpart for doctors, the Japan Medical Association (JMA), have long exerted strong influence over the fees dished out for medical services. The fee-setting council, for example, is made up of doctors and health-insurance associations, without any representation for patients. The health insurers do little to check the doctors' clout. All Japanese are covered under the country's universal insurance scheme, and the health-insurance associations merely administer the claims. Although they care about the system's overall financial cost, they have little incentive to press for sensible relationships between the fees charged for different services. 
The independent doctors' influence, says James Kondo of the University of Tokyo, has resulted in inordinately high fees for regular visits and other simple services, leaving many specialist treatments and other services relatively under-financed. ""Japan is the only country"", says Mr Kondo ""where a general practitioner can earn much more than a heart specialist."" 
Efforts to reform health-care policy have largely ignored this problem. After taking office in 2001, Junichiro Koizumi moved quickly to tweak the other side of the health-care ledger: the share of insurance payments that individuals must make themselves. Although this was useful, it affected only the source of the money. Changing the fee structure, by contrast, would affect which medical areas the money goes into. Mr Kondo thinks that the JMA and the clinic-owning doctors who dominate it are losing their clout. As their influence over fees weakens, more resources will begin flowing into promising areas of modern medicine.
The old system certainly seems under threat, with new groups pulling apart the iron triangle at all three corners. In the medical industry, the JMA must fend off a range of hospital-based doctors and medical-technology companies, all of which want more resources to flow towards new areas of health care. At the second corner of the triangle, politicians now must heed patients' groups, which are doing their best to stoke national awareness. The media are pitching in by highlighting an endless litany of medical scandals, ranging from tragic episodes of malpractice (complete with attempted cover-ups) to the recent bribery allegations. In a trend that has accelerated during Mr Koizumi's three-year tenure, such national electoral issues are weakening lobbies, such as the JMA, which have long used their money and dedicated voting blocks to sway the outcome of elections in individual districts.
The popular Mr Koizumi has also been pressing for change at the third corner of the iron triangle: in the bureaucracy. The prime minister has been trying to wrest policy away from individual ministries, which tend to be beholden to the sectors they regulate, and instead co-ordinate it within his own cabinet office. Many of his advisers on medical policy view health care as a potential growth industry, which can generate jobs, investment, exports and widespread public (and therefore voter) satisfaction. The real scandal is that the narrow interests of Japan's doctors' lobby have so long thwarted these advances.","A health - insurance scandal shows how Japan 's iron triangle is weakening

PACIFISTS can be better than military superpowers at being unilateralist. Junichiro Koizumi is counting on this as he updates, yet again, the role of Japan's Self Defence Force (SDF). Following promises made at the G8 summit in Georgia last week, the prime minister is seeking to redefine the SDF's mission in Iraq, and make it part of a new multinational force that was called for in last week's United Nations resolution.
The trouble with the new multinational outfit is that its members might have to defend people by firing weapons. Agreeing to this knowingly would further stretch, if not snap outright, Japan's self-imposed limits on using force. There is little risk of this in the SDF's current Iraq mission, which involves giving humanitarian help to the quiet southern town of Samawah. So Mr Koizumi announced a simple solution on June 15th. The 550 Japanese troops in Samawah will call themselves part of the multinational force, but carry on as before--operating in ""non-combat"" zones--and will take orders from nobody.
When its troops started venturing overseas more than a decade ago, Japan's goal was to look more like all of the other countries that provide peacekeepers, and thereby to avoid criticism. Yet the 1992 law authorising the SDF to deploy abroad laid down tight restrictions on which sorts of missions it could join, to avoid violating the pacifist restraints in Japan's constitution. As a result, Japanese troops still stand out awkwardly wherever they go. 
SDF troops on peacekeeping missions, for example, must adhere to prohibitions on ""collective self defence"". So if anyone attacks the Japanese troops in Samawah, a nearby Dutch contingent will come to the SDF's aid; but if the Dutch troops should come under attack, they are on their own.
The 1992 law also limited SDF missions to cases in which a ceasefire is in place and Japan has a clear invitation from all local groups. In deploying troops to Samawah, Japan got round this by noting a UN resolution last year that called on willing countries to help rebuild Iraq. With a new interim government formally taking over at the end of this month, however, Japan would have had to negotiate a new and separate deal. Nominally joining the new UN-approved force makes things simpler.","Junichiro Koizumi tweaks the pacifist rules again

IN DECEMBER 2001, with the world still shocked by the September 11th attacks, a North Korean spy ship sailed mischievously close to Japan. Although North Korean vessels did this often, Japan's coastguard had never done much about it. Japan is well known, after all, for its pacifist constitution. But this time was different. Japanese coastguard cutters gave chase, got into a gun battle that left some of their own crewmen wounded, and stuck with the fight until the spy ship exploded and sank in the East China Sea.
Apart from North Korea making trouble, everything about the clash was extraordinary. Although the spy ship was spotted within Japan's ""exclusive"" economic zone, it was outside Japan's more narrowly defined territorial waters. The official Japanese response to ambiguity is usually some sort of fudge. In this case, moreover, Japan had ample time to calibrate its reaction: the ship sank more than 24 hours after it had first been spotted. Nor did Japan offer a hint of regret. Even though the spy ship sank in China's economic zone, Japan's government claimed a right to salvage it, and stood by this decision. When the ship was raised, it was found to be loaded with spy gear and heavy weaponry.
The incident highlighted Japan's changing attitude towards its armed forces, which has gathered pace during Junichiro Koizumi's three-year stint as prime minister. The most visible sign of that shift occurred earlier this year, when Mr Koizumi sent more than 500 troops from its carefully-named Self Defence Forces (SDF), to help rebuild Iraq. Deploying them was a giant step historically, and not just because the force is sizeable and the theatre is dangerous. For the first time since the second world war, Japan has sent its soldiers abroad without the moral comfort of an international mandate.
In other ways, too, Mr Koizumi has sought throughout his tenure to test Japan's pacifist limits. Soon after the 2001 attacks, parliament passed a special law authorising ships from the Maritime SDF to help America's fleet in the Indian Ocean. The law restricted co-operation to refuelling and logistics, but Japan's navy, in effect, provided rear support for the invasion of Afghanistan. Last summer, parliament passed laws spelling out the government's powers in the event of an attack on Japan's territory. These laws had been discussed since the 1970s, but pacifist nervousness had prevented their enactment before last year. The prime minister has also called for changes to the constitution, including the pacifist restrictions in Article 9. 
Land of the rising gun?
All this has delighted the administration of George Bush. America's alliance with Japan helps to shrink the Pacific, much as Anglo-American ties do the Atlantic. And because Asia is less coherent than the European Union, Japan's regional role is in some ways even more important to America than Britain's. In particular, America's 45,000 troops in Japan, and their related air and naval bases, matter more than its bases in any one European country. They not only protect Japan, but allow America to project strength across a region littered with potential hotspots. Many American officials reckon that as Japan gains confidence in its ability to use sailors and soldiers wisely, the alliance will grow more flexible and useful.
Although it pleases Mr Bush, however, Mr Koizumi's efforts to knock the rust off Japan's armed forces have rattled many others. Indeed, some of Mr Koizumi's critics seem unhappy precisely because America likes the idea. Others, both in and around Japan, take notice of Mr Koizumi's visits to the Yasukuni shrine, where more than a dozen war criminals are commemorated along with Japan's fallen soldiers. They detect signs of a resurgent right wing, and fear a return of Japanese militarism.
These criticisms are not convincing. Although Japan has indeed done much of what America wanted in Afghanistan and Iraq, it has hardly been bullied into it. Mr Koizumi has been as keen to lend a hand as Mr Bush has been to receive one. When their interests have diverged, Mr Koizumi has gladly stood up to his chum from Crawford. The Americans squealed last year when Japan ignored their sanctions on Iran and signed a deal to invest in its Azadegan oilfield. 
Nor does Mr Koizumi's eagerness imply a sinister swing to the far right. His foreign policies reflect clear and reasonable national interests and draw support from the broad Japanese public, which shows little desire to remilitarise and start strong-arming neighbours. Mr Koizumi displayed his popular touch in May, for example, by visiting North Korea and trading food aid for the release of five children born to former abductees from Japan. This upset the nationalist right, but mainstream Japanese voters agreed that it was better to be pragmatic than tough. Mr Koizumi's poll ratings shot up by ten percentage points.
Since then, domestic issues, a looming election and other factors have combined to reverse that trend. Indeed, the poll numbers for Mr Koizumi and his cabinet, below 40% in some surveys, have rarely been lower (see chart). This week, as voters prepared to replace half of parliament's upper house in elections on July 11th, his ruling coalition seemed in danger of retaining its majority by an embarrassingly narrow margin. But the recent slide largely reflects a domestic row over pensions policy, combined with a sense that Mr Koizumi's political style has crossed the boundary from confident to cocky. It is not proof of a sudden and broad-based change of heart about foreign policy. 
Voters do seem to have been dismayed by the prime minister's abrupt pledge, at the G8 meeting of rich countries last month, to include Japanese troops in a new multinational force in Iraq that has been endorsed by the United Nations. Since Japan has complex pacifist restrictions, the decision has important legal and democratic implications; but it will have little effect in practice on Japan's current mission, which involves helping to rebuild a quiet Iraqi town. The public reaction does not appear to reflect attitudes towards the deployment, since the mission will not change, so much as a sense that Mr Koizumi is cutting through delicate legal precedents without proper debate. 
Far from being hijacked by a right-wing cabal, therefore, Japan's conduct of foreign policy is arguably growing more democratic. And the recent widening of the SDF's role, although driven by Mr Koizumi and viewed nervously by the public, reflects an interaction between his keen political instincts and broad popular attitudes. Those attitudes suggest that Japan is not so much flexing its muscles as it is stretching them after a long convalescence, to see whether they work and what they can usefully do. 
The experiment began more than a decade ago. Many Japanese were humiliated by the first Gulf war, when western countries chastised Japan for failing to send troops, even though it had paid billions into America's war chest. In 1992, parliament passed a law allowing the SDF to venture abroad as long as its troops were part of a UN mission and met several other criteria. Japan soon sent SDF troops to help UN peacekeepers in Cambodia (1992), Mozambique (1993) and East Timor (1999 and 2002); used them to extend relief to Rwandan refugees in 1994; and has had SDF members in the Golan Heights since 1996, as part of a team of UN observers. 
Self-Respect Forces
Most Japanese are proud of these missions, but this hardly reflects a popular urge to redefine their country as a military power. The prevailing Japanese attitude towards using force is closer, for obvious reasons, to the dominant view in Germany. Whereas many Americans, Australians and Britons look on war as a terrible option, which at times must be weighed against other nasty outcomes, most Germans and Japanese came to a simpler conclusion after the second world war: that war is always wrong. 
That pacifist streak, along with a desire to avoid criticism, is reflected in the limits that the 1992 law placed on Japanese peacekeeping missions. These state that the SDF can be sent only when a ceasefire is in place and when all parties to a conflict agree that Japan can take part. The law also strictly limited the use of weapons to ""the minimum necessary to protect the life or person of the personnel"". 
These rules seemed a reasonable extension of Japan's previous post-war foreign policy, which had used generous aid and tireless self-promotion of Japan's ""peace-loving"" credentials to win friends and influence governments. Yukio Okamoto, a former adviser to Mr Koizumi on foreign affairs, says that the restrictions led his countrymen to view the Japanese troops as ""NGOs in blue helmets"": harmless aid workers with a UN stamp of approval.
Despite these pacifist leanings, however, there are huge differences between Japan on the one hand and Germany on the other. One is obvious: Japan faces clear threats. For Germany, the end of the cold war removed the Soviet threat, and it now faces little risk of a military attack. In Japan, however, the cold war gave way to a new danger: North Korea. 
The discovery in the early 1990s that North Korea was developing plutonium, which could be used to make nuclear warheads, got the public's attention. Those fears grew after North Korea's shocking decision to test a medium-range Taepodong missile in 1998, lobbing it over Japanese airspace into the Pacific Ocean. Even before Mr Koizumi entered office, therefore, Japan had taken steps to deal with the North Korean threat. Further signs of bad behaviour during his term have strengthened the public resolve--not least North Korea's admission (since denied), in 2002, that it had violated a 1994 agreement by trying to enrich uranium. 
Japan has responded stiffly. Last year it launched the first spy satellites in its history to get an independent look at North Korea. It has joined the Proliferation Security Initiative, a multilateral effort to interdict North Korean ships carrying weapons and contraband, and thus to eat into the regime's hard-currency earnings. In February, parliament passed a law allowing the government to impose economic sanctions on North Korea--including banning cash remittances--unilaterally, and without any UN resolution. Another law allowed the government to deny port calls by the North Korean ferry that retrieves hard currency from criminal groups in Japan. And Japan is now in talks to quicken the rollout of a proposed missile-defence system, on which it is co-operating with America. 
The public clearly favours Mr Koizumi's tough stance towards North Korea. When he needed a new secretary-general to run last year's general-election campaign, he chose Shinzo Abe, a youthful politician who had made a name for himself with his hawkish views on Kim Jong Il's regime. The North Korean threat, by highlighting the importance of the alliance with America, partly explains why much of Japan's public supports the sending of the SDF to Iraq, even though that mission stretches the pacifist limits. 
That, however, is only part of the story. Besides having North Korea next door, Japan also differs from Germany, and, indeed, other European countries, in other important respects. For both Germany and France, one of the easiest ways to strut a little taller in the world is occasionally to get up America's nose. France can do this easily, given its permanent seat on the UN Security Council. Working in tandem, moreover, France and Germany together can exert a strong influence on the European Union, sometimes trying to steer it in ways that frustrate American goals.
Japan has no such diplomatic clout--and only three conceivable ways to gain any in the near future. It could get a permanent seat on the Security Council, which it has sought for years and shows few signs of obtaining. It could behave in Asia as France does in the EU, putting its weight behind regional initiatives that exclude non-Asian countries. But even if it could pull this off--which would be highly implausible in the face of regional rivalries--it would damage its own economy, which depends heavily on globalisation. Since these two ideas are non-starters, the most sensible way for Japan to gain influence is to start putting its substantial military resources (see chart on previous page) to work multilaterally, and to make genuine security contributions as often as they are called for.
Many Japanese diplomats and foreign-policy experts argue that Japan already carries weight on the global stage. It has been one of the world's top two official aid donors, along with America, since the 1980s, spending yen500 billion ($4.6 billion) a year. It takes part in every important international gathering, and Japanese diplomats rarely say the wrong thing. Yet it is significant that in ""Plan of Attack"", Bob Woodward's detailed account of the preparations to invade Iraq, Japan's role in the convoluted diplomacy goes more or less unmentioned.

Most Japanese are not so keen for their country to loom large, however, that they are willing to scrap their pacifist principles altogether. Japan's overall foreign policy remains, at root, risk-averse. This is a global economic power that relies heavily on reliable imports of energy and unfettered access to world markets. It wants to stay on good terms with as many countries as possible. Regionally, its main aims are to avoid losing out to China on trade deals and to manage the alliance with America so as to fend off would-be aggressors. 
The echoes from the Gulf war, however, have given that risk-aversion a new twist. Although Japanese voters clearly prefer safe missions with little chance of shooting, they have been so scandalised by foreign criticism that they are willing to back SDF deployments, when reassured that these are legal and proper.
This fear of humiliation was on display in April, when some Japanese do-gooders were kidnapped in Iraq and later released. The psychiatrist who met them on their return told the New York Times that their most stressful moment came not when they were kidnapped or had knives at their throats, but rather when they had to face their countrymen back home. Most Japanese were angry over the trouble and embarrassment the hostages had caused.
As Japan's security policy evolves, these same factors--the North Korean threat, the American alliance, the Japanese public's changing perceptions and Mr Koizumi's popular touch--will remain the ones to watch. The most immediate risk to Mr Koizumi is the fallout if his party does poorly on July 11th, as the polls suggest it will. Over the past three years he has honed his populist approach by strengthening the role of his own office and the cabinet in making policy. This allows him to seize chances as they come along. If his popular aura is dented by a weak showing on election day, he may struggle to regain his foreign-policy footing.
As always for Japan, presidential elections in America will also bear watching. From the Japanese point of view, the most important difference between a President John Kerry and Mr Bush would involve North Korea, with which Mr Kerry has said he will talk bilaterally. But while any easing of tensions with North Korea, or some sort of diplomatic fudge, would affect Japan's posture towards the regime, the public will no doubt remain wary.
A more important change will come, sooner or later, when Mr Koizumi leaves office. Arguably, Japan has never had a prime minister like him, at least in style. Yet he could be replaced by anyone ranging from a dull member of the LDP gerontocracy to his hawkish and popular young protege, Mr Abe; or from a nationalist governor such as Shintaro Ishihara, to a socialist one such as Yasuo Tanaka. Meanwhile, the opposition Democrats, who are keen to distance Japan from America a bit, have at last managed to establish themselves as legitimate contenders for power. 
The best guide to foreign policy in post-Koizumi Japan, therefore, lies in those popular attitudes that he has so skilfully tapped. Where they are clearly threatened, such as by North Korea, Japanese voters have certainly lost their pacifist inhibitions. After salvaging the North Korean spy ship, the government put it on display near Tokyo Bay so that the public could go and marvel at the menace their sailors had confronted. Japan's annual white paper on defence, published on July 6th, suggests that the country also needs to keep a close eye on China, a possibly dangerous rival in areas other than trade. 
Whether the public will keep backing missions outside the region, however, will hinge on events. By choosing a series of safe missions, Mr Koizumi and his predecessors have helped mould the popular mood in favour of more SDF deployments. Should one of the missions turn bloody, however, there is no telling how the Japanese will react.
Caption: Proud to fly the flag","As Japan begins to stretch its long - unused military muscles , how far does it want to go and what can it do ? 
 IN DECEMBER 2001 , with the world still shocked by the September 11th attacks , a North Korean spy ship sailed mischievously close to Japan . Although North Korean vessels did this often , Japan 's coastguard had never done much about it . Japan is well known , after all , for its pacifist constitution . But this time was different . Japanese coastguard cutters gave chase , got into a gun battle that left some of their own crewmen wounded , and stuck with the fight until the spy ship exploded and sank in the East China Sea . 
 Apart from North Korea making trouble , everything about the clash was extraordinary . Although the spy ship was spotted within Japan 's "" exclusive "" economic zone , it was outside Japan 's more narrowly defined territorial waters . The official Japanese response to ambiguity is usually some sort of fudge . In this case , moreover , Japan had ample time to calibrate its reaction : the ship sank more than 24 hours after it had first been spotted . Nor did Japan offer a hint of regret . Even though the spy ship sank in China 's economic zone , Japan 's government claimed a right to salvage it , and stood by this decision . When the ship was raised , it was found to be loaded with spy gear and heavy weaponry . 
 The incident highlighted Junichiro Koizumi's . The most visible sign of Junichiro Koizumi occurred earlier this year , when Mr Koizumi sent more than 500 troops from its carefully - named Self Defence Forces ( SDF ) , to help rebuild Iraq . Deploying them was a giant step historically , and not just because the force is sizeable and the theatre is dangerous . For the first time since the second world war , Japan has sent its soldiers abroad without the moral comfort of an international mandate . 
 In other ways , too , Mr Koizumi has sought throughout his tenure to test Japan 's pacifist limits . Soon after the 2001 attacks , parliament passed a special law authorising ships from the Maritime SDF to help America 's fleet in the Indian Ocean . The law restricted co - operation to refuelling and logistics , but Japan 's navy , in effect , provided rear support for the invasion of Afghanistan . Last summer , parliament passed laws spelling out the government 's powers in the event of an attack on Japan 's territory . These laws had been discussed since the 1970s , but pacifist nervousness had prevented their enactment before last year . The prime minister has also called for changes to the constitution , including the pacifist restrictions in Article 9 . 
 Land of the rising gun ? 
 All this has delighted the administration of George Bush . America 's alliance with Japan helps to shrink the Pacific , much as Anglo - American ties do the Atlantic . And because Asia is less coherent than the European Union , Japan 's regional role is in some ways even more important to America than Britain 's . In particular , America 's 45,000 troops in Japan , and their related air and naval bases , matter more than its bases in any one European country . They not only protect Japan , but allow America to project strength across a region littered with potential hotspots . Many American officials reckon that as Japan gains confidence in its ability to use sailors and soldiers wisely , the alliance will grow more flexible and useful . 
 Although it pleases Mr Bush , however , Mr Koizumi 's efforts to knock the rust off Japan 's armed forces have rattled many others . Indeed , some of Mr Koizumi 's critics seem unhappy precisely because America likes the idea . Others , both in and around Japan , take notice of Mr Koizumi 's visits to the Yasukuni shrine , where more than a dozen war criminals are commemorated along with Japan 's fallen soldiers . They detect signs of a resurgent right wing , and fear a return of Japanese militarism . 
 These criticisms are not convincing . Although Japan has indeed done much of what America wanted in Afghanistan and Iraq , it has hardly been bullied into it . Mr Koizumi has been as keen to lend a hand as Mr Bush has been to receive one . When their interests have diverged , Mr Koizumi has gladly stood up to his chum from Crawford . The Americans squealed last year when Japan ignored their sanctions on Iran and signed a deal to invest in its Azadegan oilfield . 
 Nor does Mr Koizumi 's eagerness imply a sinister swing to the far right . His foreign policies reflect clear and reasonable national interests and draw support from the broad Japanese public , which shows little desire to remilitarise and start strong - arming neighbours . Mr Koizumi displayed his popular touch in May , for example , by visiting North Korea and trading food aid for the release of five children born to former abductees from Japan . This upset the nationalist right , but mainstream Japanese voters agreed that it was better to be pragmatic than tough . Mr Koizumi 's poll ratings shot up by ten percentage points . 
 Since then , domestic issues , a looming election and other factors have combined to reverse Junichiro Koizumi . Indeed , the poll numbers for Mr Koizumi and his cabinet , below 40 % in some surveys , have rarely been lower ( see chart ) . This week , as voters prepared to replace half of parliament 's upper house in elections on July 11th , his ruling coalition seemed in danger of retaining its majority by an embarrassingly narrow margin . But the recent slide largely reflects a domestic row over pensions policy , combined with a sense that Mr Koizumi 's political style has crossed the boundary from confident to cocky . It is not proof of a sudden and broad - based change of heart about foreign policy . 
 Voters do seem to have been dismayed by the prime minister 's abrupt pledge , at the G8 meeting of rich countries last month , to include Japanese troops in a new multinational force in Iraq that has been endorsed by the United Nations . Since Japan has complex pacifist restrictions , the decision has important legal and democratic implications ; but it will have little effect in practice on Japan 's current mission , which involves helping to rebuild a quiet Iraqi town . The public reaction does not appear to reflect attitudes towards the deployment , since the mission will not change , so much as a sense that Mr Koizumi is cutting through delicate legal precedents without proper debate . 
 Far from being hijacked by a right - wing cabal , therefore , Japan 's conduct of foreign policy is arguably growing more democratic . And the recent widening of the SDF 's role , although driven by Mr Koizumi and viewed nervously by the public , reflects an interaction between his keen political instincts and broad popular attitudes . Those attitudes suggest that Japan is not so much flexing its muscles as it is stretching them after a long convalescence , to see whether they work and what they can usefully do . 
 The experiment began more than a decade ago . Many Japanese were humiliated by the first Gulf war , when western countries chastised Japan for failing to send troops , even though it had paid billions into America 's war chest . In 1992 , parliament passed a law allowing the SDF to venture abroad as long as its troops were part of a UN mission and met several other criteria . Japan soon sent SDF troops to help UN peacekeepers in Cambodia ( 1992 ) , Mozambique ( 1993 ) and East Timor ( 1999 and 2002 ) ; used them to extend relief to Rwandan refugees in 1994 ; and has had SDF members in the Golan Heights since 1996 , as part of a team of UN observers . 
 Self - Respect Forces 
 Most Japanese are proud of these missions , but this hardly reflects a popular urge to redefine their country as a military power . The prevailing Japanese attitude towards using force is closer , for obvious reasons , to the dominant view in Germany . Whereas many Americans , Australians and Britons look on war as a terrible option , which at times must be weighed against other nasty outcomes , most Germans and Japanese came to a simpler conclusion after the second world war : that war is always wrong . 
 That pacifist streak , along with a desire to avoid criticism , is reflected in the limits that the 1992 law placed on Japanese peacekeeping missions . These state that the SDF can be sent only when a ceasefire is in place and when all parties to a conflict agree that Japan can take part . The law also strictly limited the use of weapons to "" the minimum necessary to protect the life or person of the personnel "" . 
 These rules seemed a reasonable extension of Japan 's previous post - war foreign policy , which had used generous aid and tireless self - promotion of Japan 's "" peace - loving "" credentials to win friends and influence governments . Yukio Okamoto , a former adviser to Mr Koizumi on foreign affairs , says that the restrictions led his countrymen to view the Japanese troops as "" NGOs in blue helmets "" : harmless aid workers with a UN stamp of approval . 
 Despite these pacifist leanings , however , there are huge differences between Japan on the one hand and Germany on the other . One is obvious : Japan faces clear threats . For Germany , the end of the cold war removed the Soviet threat , and it now faces little risk of a military attack . In Japan , however , the cold war gave way to a new danger : North Korea . 
 The discovery in the early 1990s that North Korea was developing plutonium , which could be used to make nuclear warheads , got the public 's attention . Those fears grew after North Korea 's shocking decision to test a medium - range Taepodong missile in 1998 , lobbing it over Japanese airspace into the Pacific Ocean . Even before Mr Koizumi entered office , therefore , Japan had taken steps to deal with the North Korean threat . Further signs of bad behaviour during his term have strengthened the public resolve -- not least North Korea 's admission ( since denied ) , in 2002 , that it had violated a 1994 agreement by trying to enrich uranium . 
 Japan has responded stiffly . Last year it launched the first spy satellites in its history to get an independent look at North Korea . It has joined the Proliferation Security Initiative , a multilateral effort to interdict North Korean ships carrying weapons and contraband , and thus to eat into the regime 's hard - currency earnings . In February , parliament passed a law allowing the government to impose economic sanctions on North Korea -- including banning cash remittances -- unilaterally , and without any UN resolution . Another law allowed the government to deny port calls by the North Korean ferry that retrieves hard currency from criminal groups in Japan . And Japan is now in talks to quicken the rollout of a proposed missile - defence system , on which it is co - operating with America . 
 The public clearly favours Mr Koizumi 's tough stance towards North Korea . When he needed a new secretary - general to run last year 's general - election campaign , he chose Shinzo Abe , a youthful politician who had made a name for himself with his hawkish views on Kim Jong Il 's regime . The North Korean threat , by highlighting the importance of the alliance with America , partly explains why much of Japan 's public supports the sending of the SDF to Iraq , even though that mission stretches the pacifist limits . 
 That , however , is only part of the story . Besides having North Korea next door , Japan also differs from Germany , and , indeed , other European countries , in other important respects . For both Germany and France , one of the easiest ways to strut a little taller in the world is occasionally to get up America 's nose . France can do this easily , given its permanent seat on the UN Security Council . Working in tandem , moreover , France and Germany together can exert a strong influence on the European Union , sometimes trying to steer it in ways that frustrate American goals . 
 Japan has no such diplomatic clout -- and only three conceivable ways to gain any in the near future . It could get a permanent seat on the Security Council , which it has sought for years and shows few signs of obtaining . It could behave in Asia as France does in the EU , putting its weight behind regional initiatives that exclude non - Asian countries . But even if it could pull this off -- which would be highly implausible in the face of regional rivalries -- it would damage its own economy , which depends heavily on globalisation . Since these two ideas are non - starters , the most sensible way for Japan to gain influence is to start putting its substantial military resources ( see chart on previous page ) to work multilaterally , and to make genuine security contributions as often as they are called for . 
 Many Japanese diplomats and foreign - policy experts argue that Japan already carries weight on the global stage . It has been one of the world 's top two official aid donors , along with America , since the 1980s , spending yen500 billion ( $ 4.6 billion ) a year . It takes part in every important international gathering , and Japanese diplomats rarely say the wrong thing . Yet it is significant that in "" Plan of Attack "" , Bob Woodward 's detailed account of the preparations to invade Iraq , Japan 's role in the convoluted diplomacy goes more or less unmentioned .

HIS coalition went into the election with a lock on power, and did not lose any seats. Yet the outcome of Japan's upper-house election on July 11th embarrassed Junichiro Koizumi. The prime minister's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) won 49 seats: two short of its minimum election target and, more embarrassing, one seat less than the main opposition party, the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ).
The LDP's weak result followed a sharp slide in Mr Koizumi's popularity in recent weeks. He rushed a scandal-tainted pension bill through parliament, and then agreed, without any debate, to affiliate Japan's troops in Iraq with a new multinational force. These decisions reinforced a growing public sense that Mr Koizumi--whose reputation as a tough-talking maverick made him wildly popular three years ago--has grown arrogant and out of touch.
Despite the setback, Mr Koizumi said this week that he will not step down. The LDP and its coalition partner, the Buddhist-backed New Komeito, already control the lower house, which picks the prime minister. And because elections for the upper house replace only half of its MPs every three years, the coalition still retains 139 of that chamber's 242 seats, giving it not only a solid majority but the right to go on controlling all of its committees. The upper house's powers are limited, anyway.
Mr Koizumi says that, as previously planned, he will shuffle his cabinet this September and then stay on as prime minister until September 2006, when LDP rules dictate that his term as the party's leader must come to an end. But even if he can hold on to his job until then, can he accomplish much after this week's unimpressive showing at the polls?
The prime minister has not played the game the way that his predecessors did, building their power firmly upon the LDP's factional politics. Instead, he has relied on his personal popularity to keep detractors within his own party in line. True, his ruling coalition retained its existing number of seats in this week's election. But the results show plainly that Mr Koizumi is not nearly as popular as he was after sweeping into office in April 2001. 
That summer, he led the LDP in an impressive upper-house campaign, picking up 64 of the 121 seats being contested and helping New Komeito to win a further 13 seats. This time, by contrast, the coalition was able to hold its ground--the LDP lost a seat, New Komeito gained one--only because it was competing for seats that had last been contested in 1998, when the LDP put in a dismal showing that forced the prime minister at the time, Ryutaro Hashimoto, to resign.
Mr Koizumi did somewhat better than Mr Hashimoto did in 1998. The LDP won 30% of the vote for proportionally-elected seats (compared with 25% in 1998) and 35% in the district contests (up from 31%). But that victory is outweighed by the fact that Mr Koizumi did poorly when compared with his former self. Opinion polls show that, at around 40%, his popularity is half what it once was.
The oddities of Japan's party system make it hard to predict what this means. The country is making a transition from one-party rule, with the LDP in charge almost continuously since 1955, to a genuine two-party democracy. After merging with the opposition Liberals last year, the DPJ made impressive gains in November's lower-house election, at the expense of the Communists and the Social Democrats. This week's election reinforced that trend. The two left-wing parties were defending 17 seats in the election, but won only six. The DPJ now has 82 seats in the upper house, up from just 59 after the last upper-house election. On its third leader in as many years, the DPJ, with the relatively youthful Katsuya Okada (a mere 51) at its helm, has clearly emerged as the dominant opposition party, with a chance of governing the country one day. But in this week's election, it had no chance of winning, which made the vote more of a referendum than anything else.
In the shorter term at least, this suggests that the election could well result in politics becoming less partisan, not more. Mr Koizumi's real enemies remain the conservatives within his own party, not the formal opposition. By co-operating more with the Democrats--on pension reform, for instance--and standing firm against his own party, he still has a good chance of shoring up his popularity and keeping his LDP opponents at bay.
This is partly a matter of policy. On issues such as decentralisation, bank reform and competition, Mr Koizumi's reformist language is much closer to the Democrats' policies than those of his LDP detractors. Most floating voters do not oppose Mr Koizumi's reform ideas so much as his failure to carry them out. And as a matter of presentation, co-operating more with the Democrats could allow the prime minister to escape from a trap: on the one hand, voters see him as arrogant, but on the other they threaten to turn against him if he makes too many concessions to opponents within his own party. 
When he shuffles his cabinet in September, Mr Koizumi would therefore be wise to show voters that he is not caving in to the LDP's old-guard, much of which he has already infuriated by breaking with tradition on cabinet appointments, choosing people he can work with rather than those who are next in line on the party escalator. He has also shuffled the cabinet far less often than the LDP used to do. Nonetheless, the LDP still contains plenty of old-fashioned anti-reformist politicians.
If Mr Koizumi is able to name a new team more to his and the public's liking, and at the same time demonstrates that he can compromise with the Democrats on issues that voters care about, he could still do a lot to restore his popularity. An uncompromising attitude is not deemed ""arrogant"" if the public agrees with you. A skilled tactician like Mr Koizumi should have little trouble grasping that.","Voters send Junichiro Koizumi a deflating message

DESERTION in the face of the enemy is rightly regarded by every country in the world as a very grave military crime. If it is allowed to go unpunished, it undermines the morale of those in the front line of defence: it directly imperils the security of the state and everyone in it.
So there are powerful reasons why Charles Jenkins, an American soldier who apparently deserted to North Korea while on patrol along Korea's demilitarised zone in 1965, ought to be speedily tried and, if found guilty, treated with the full rigour permitted by the Uniform Code of Military Justice now that he is in Japan and within reach of the American authorities. More than 130,000 American troops are engaged in putting down a bloody insurgency in Iraq; almost another 20,000 are in the line of fire in Afghanistan. In both places, the dangers are vastly greater than they were in the DMZ 12 years after the Korean armistice--and the cause less popular. Lenience in the face of desertion could send a dangerous signal to these men and women. Mr Jenkins (see page 54) has allegedly compounded his sins with other offences, including offering support to the enemy, most notably by appearing in two North Korean films playing stereotypical cigar-chomping officers in the capitalist American armed forces.
All this is true. And yet the American authorities should move with caution. By voluntarily leaving North Korea with his children in order to be reunited with his Japanese wife, who left two years earlier, Mr Jenkins has captured many hearts in Japan--including, it seems, that of the prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, who this week appealed for him to be treated with ""special consideration"". Whether he originally went over voluntarily or not, all those years ago, Mr Jenkins is seen by most people in Japan as a victim, like more than a dozen Japanese who were spirited away to the hermit kingdom in the 1970s and 80s. Mr Koizumi, among only three or four world leaders, has gone far out on a political limb to support America in the war on terror, and deserves a favour in return. America and Japan share a robust view of the perils posed by North Korea, and it would be rash to jeopardise that agreement by the prosecution of an elderly and sick man. 
The music of Gilbert and Sullivan seems apposite here. In ""The Mikado"", the emperor of Japan sings of his ""object all sublime"", which is, he says, ""to let the punishment fit the crime."" Mr Jenkins's reward for deserting to the North Koreans, if that is indeed what he did, has been to live for 39 years in one of the world's poorest and most repressive states, even if he has been a well-treated guest there. For 24 years he has been married to, and shared the anguish of, a Japanese woman who was abducted by North Koreans while she went for a walk by the sea. He has had to bring up his two children in a land with no hope. If ever the punishment fitted the crime, it has already done so in the case of Charles Jenkins.","America should take care before prosecuting an alleged deserter 
 DESERTION in the face of the enemy is rightly regarded by every country in the world as a very grave military crime . If it is allowed to go unpunished , it undermines the morale of those in the front line of defence : it directly imperils the security of the state and everyone in it . 
 So there are powerful reasons why Charles Jenkins , an American soldier who apparently deserted to North Korea while on patrol along Korea 's demilitarised zone in 1965 , ought to be speedily tried and , if found guilty , treated with the full rigour permitted by the Uniform Code of Military Justice now that he is in Japan and within reach of the American authorities .

IT WAS a gripping scene, with Charles Jenkins cast in his toughest role yet: frail husband and father of an unlucky family, whose future happiness is threatened by a cold and merciless superpower. On July 18th, with news cameras rolling at Tokyo's Haneda airport, Mr Jenkins--an American army sergeant who disappeared into North Korea in 1965--emerged from a chartered aeroplane with his two North Korean-born daughters and his Japanese wife, Hitomi Soga. Leaning on a cane, the 64-year-old Mr Jenkins looked much weaker than the American officers he portrayed in North Korean propaganda films. Japanese opinion is convinced that there can be only one proper ending to this drama: America must abandon its plans to prosecute Mr Jenkins for desertion and other alleged crimes, so that Ms Soga and her family can live happily ever after.
Ms Soga is a sympathetic figure. As a young woman, she was abducted in 1978 by North Korean agents and whisked off to the hermit kingdom, where she married Mr Jenkins, had two children, and lived in captivity for 24 years. Although Japan had accused North Korea of committing a string of such kidnappings, Kim Jong Il's regime did not admit to it until 2002, when Junichiro Koizumi, Japan's prime minister, made a trip to Pyongyang. During the visit, Mr Kim admitted that North Korea had abducted 13 Japanese citizens during the cold war. He said eight had died, but allowed the other five--Ms Soga and two couples who married in captivity--to return home shortly after Mr Koizumi's visit. 
Since Mr Kim's admission, the fate of the abductees and their families has been one of Japan's most emotional political issues. Pressure groups want North Korea to provide details about the deaths of the eight other abductees, plus two more Japanese citizens whom North Korea does not admit to kidnapping. All five of the survivors, moreover, had children born in captivity, and had to leave them in North Korea when they returned to Japan in 2002. So in May, Mr Koizumi returned to Pyongyang. He won a bounce in his poll numbers by promising North Korea food aid, in exchange for which Mr Kim allowed the children of the two Japanese couples to join their parents in Japan. Their release, however, focused the public's attention even more intently on the family of Ms Soga, whose husband and two daughters stayed behind in North Korea.
Mr Jenkins was unwilling to join his wife in Japan, for fear of being handed over to the Americans, who claim jurisdiction over him through their military treaty with Japan. He and his daughters finally left North Korea on July 9th, to meet Ms Soga in Indonesia, which has no extradition treaty with the United States. Mr Jenkins then agreed to come to Japan when it became clear that America would, at least temporarily, delay asking for custody on humanitarian grounds. Mr Jenkins, who is in poor health, is now getting medical treatment at a Tokyo hospital.
Mr Koizumi and other Japanese officials have appealed to the American government for leniency. A spokesman for George Bush said this week that America will ask for jurisdiction ""at the appropriate time"". At some point, say American officials, Mr Jenkins will have to sit down and have a chat about his alleged crimes, which they insist are serious. Besides desertion--a charge Mr Jenkins's relatives in North Carolina say is unfair, claiming that he was abducted--he also stands accused of aiding the enemy and encouraging other soldiers to desert. Japanese officials say America's ambassador to Japan, Howard Baker, has suggested that some sort of plea bargain might resolve the impasse--though, in Washington, other American officials take a harder line. If a deal can be worked out, Japan's public might yet see the happy ending they want.

HE INHERITED a mess and turned it into an opportunity. After taking over the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) in May, when his predecessor, Naoto Kan, stepped down over a pension scandal, Katsuya Okada led the party to an impressive showing in last month's upper-house elections. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) remains in power, but no longer looks dominant. And if the 51-year-old Mr Okada can build on his good start, he might have a chance to do what previous opposition leaders could only dream about and become prime minister.
First, however, Mr Okada must keep his grip on his own party, which will hold leadership elections next month. The DPJ's interest in sticking with Mr Okada seems obvious. Because he eschews factional politics, he can work with warring DPJ clans. He is young by Japanese standards, and telegenic. He has also shown that he can deliver on election day. Still, the LDP has ruled almost continuously for the past half-century, partly because Japan's other opposition parties have self-destructed. The DPJ, which retains an awkward mix of refugees from some of those parties, must prove that it is different. ""The most important thing"", Mr Okada told The Economist in an interview, ""is that we have to work together [towards] the same goal of changing the government and gaining power.""
Fortunately for Mr Okada, the DPJ now has many first- and second-term lawmakers who agree. Unlike some of the older lags, they are more interested in winning power, while they are young enough to enjoy it, than in fighting tired factional battles. During the upper-house campaign, Mr Okada showed them that he can deliver by focusing adroitly on two winning issues--one domestic, one foreign.
Domestically, Mr Okada turned a seeming disaster over pensions into a moral victory. Mr Kan had lambasted LDP leaders for missing payments into the national pensions scheme, only to resign when he was found to be guilty of the same delinquency. The DPJ's next choice, Ichiro Ozawa, turned out to have missed payments too. Such hypocrisy and incompetence could have left the party reeling. But Mr Okada, then secretary-general, stepped in as leader and used the pensions scandal to highlight the twin themes of transparency and accountability. He contrasted the DPJ's courageous purge with the LDP's failure to disclose which of its own members had missed payments (including Junichiro Koizumi, the prime minister, who confessed only when a weekly magazine was about to expose him). When the ruling party pressed ahead with a scheme to overhaul pension finances, Mr Okada accused it of ramming through changes without democratic debate.
The claim stuck, partly because it resonated with the DPJ's attacks on Mr Koizumi's foreign policies. In March, the prime minister's decision to send non-combat troops to Iraq earlier in the year was supported by about half the population. But Mr Okada focused on a subsequent decision, taken without a vote, to relabel the troops as part of the new UN-authorised multinational force. This force may have to engage in combat, albeit without Japan being involved. Once again, Mr Okada argued, Mr Koizumi was arrogantly bypassing the democratic process. 
Mr Okada is still cagey about how much he would overhaul security policy. He thinks approval from the UN Security Council should be required for all Japanese peacekeeping missions, although he concedes that ""the UN does not always work as effectively as we would like"". So long as Japan confines itself to UN-sanctioned missions, Mr Okada says, he would relax the self-imposed restrictions that limit its peacekeepers' usefulness. The DPJ is now debating whether this requires mild tweaks to the law or bigger changes to the constitution. 
Although he has internal battles ahead, Mr Okada's early knack of exploiting the LDP's weak spots should be enough to persuade potential young challengers, such as Seiji Maehara (a rising star on foreign policy) and Yoshihiko Noda (a favourite among young lawmakers two years ago), to hold off. Nor do leftish members of the party's old guard have anywhere else to go. Japan's two left-wing parties, the Socialists and Communists, were devastated in lower-house elections last November, and put in another poor showing in the upper-house poll. 
Mr Okada must cast a wary eye to his right, however, where Mr Ozawa heads a group from the Liberal Party, which the DPJ absorbed last summer. Although he missed his chance to succeed Mr Kan, Mr Ozawa is a proven party-wrecker. But instead of finding a proxy to challenge Mr Okada, Mr Ozawa may prefer to back him in exchange for concessions. Mr Ozawa favours deregulation and smaller government, and constitutional changes that would loosen restraints on the military.
All of this could lead to an appealing realignment inside the DPJ. Mr Ozawa may remain influential enough to keep nudging the DPJ towards reform, of both the economy and security policy. But a base of young lawmakers will want Mr Okada to go about this in a pragmatic manner. Many will urge him to stick with his formula. Look for a few chinks in the LDP armour, and strike there. Then wait for the LDP to self-destruct for a change.","Can the youthful Katsuya Okada lead Japan 's Democrats to power ?

IF JAPAN'S impressive rebound really is winding down, Junichiro Koizumi could be in trouble. Not long ago, the economy seemed such a strong point--real GDP grew at a 6.6% annual rate in the first quarter of this year, following 7.4% growth in the previous quarter--that the prime minister asked his politically untested economy minister, Heizo Takenaka, to run in July's upper-house election. Mr Takenaka's victory was practically the only bright spot for Mr Koizumi, whose Liberal Democratic Party did badly at the polls. This week, however, Mr Takenaka was struggling to bolster confidence in an economy that turns out to have slowed sharply in the second quarter: real GDP grew at a mere 1.7% annual rate, the worst showing in five quarters.
One cause for worry is that investment in capital equipment, which has helped to drive Japan's brisk recovery, went flat in the second quarter. On August 24th, however, Mr Takenaka pointed out that machinery orders, which tend to be a leading indicator of fresh capital spending, ""weren't that bad"", rising 10.3% in the second quarter. He conceded that high oil prices bear watching, but Japan so far seems to be taking them in its stride. Of course, rising energy costs could slow the global economy, and hence exports. Japan's manufacturers have low stockpiles of products to sell, however, and should not have to slow production much in response to mildly weaker demand. 
A few quirks in the data also offer grounds for hope. The weak second-quarter figures partly reflect a poor adjustment for the leap-year effect, which made the first quarter look artificially strong relative to the second. ""If you just average the two, you probably get close to something that is useful,"" says Richard Jerram, a Tokyo-based economist at Macquarie Securities, an Australian outfit. First-half growth of 5.5%, at an annual rate, looks pretty good. And since the economy has been slowing less abruptly than the quarterly GDP figures suggest, there is still a chance that the recovery can continue at a decent clip. 
Much depends on household consumption, which over the past couple of years has rebounded less convincingly than exports, profits or business investment. Here, signals have been mixed lately. Retail sales slid in May and June. But Japan's broadly defined services index, which is a good gauge of non-manufacturing strength, rose sharply (see chart). Mr Jerram uses the index to estimate consumer spending on services, which he reckons grew 3.0% in the second quarter, year-on-year. 
An improving jobs outlook seems to be helping. Most economists expected the latest measure of job offers, due out on August 27th, to stay near its recent high level of more than eight job offers for every ten applicants. And the Olympics, in which Japanese athletes are already only one gold medal short of their record at the 1960 Tokyo games, have given a boost to sales of sportswear and home electronics. If Mr Koizumi is lucky, the recovery will show as much stamina as Mizuki Noguchi, who found a late burst this week to win the women's marathon.","Can Japan 's economy regroup after a soft second quarter ?

TERRITORY is grand, but Japan craves energy far more than land. That is why Junichiro Koizumi, who on September 2nd sailed past some disputed Russian-held islands without landing on them, seems unlikely to get too tough over Japan's territorial claim. The islands--which Japan refers to as the Northern Territories, and Russia calls the Southern Kuriles--lie just north of Hokkaido, and were part of Japan until the Soviet Union seized them at the end of the second world war. The disputed claim prevented the two sides from signing a formal peace treaty after the war, and remains an emotive issue. 
Mr Koizumi, who ""inspected"" the islands from a Japanese coast-guard ship, picked an interesting time to highlight the dispute. His Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, will visit Japan early next year. More important, perhaps, Mr Koizumi's party took a beating in upper-house elections in July, and he needs a way to boost his image. Since he took office in 2001, foreign-policy ventures have given Mr Koizumi some of his biggest bounces in the polls: especially a pair of trips to North Korea, in 2002 and earlier this year.
The North Korea issue is losing some of its punch, however. Mr Koizumi has already won the release of all known living Japanese hostages who were abducted by North Korea during the cold war, and their families. In Iraq, where Japanese troops are doing humanitarian work, the best that Mr Koizumi can do now is hope that nothing goes wrong. Unsurprisingly, the populist prime minister has some new ideas up his sleeve. Later this month he will give a speech to the United Nations, and appeal for Japan to be given a permanent seat on its Security Council. Japan has long sought one, but Mr Koizumi hopes that his push to expand its peacekeeping role will help his case. 
Highlighting Japan's quest to reclaim the islands should also go down well domestically. More than 8,000 of the Japanese who fled when the Soviets moved in are still alive. They make a handy backdrop to Mr Koizumi's nationalist pose. Russia has little interest in giving the islands back, however. Its foreign ministry, which was not amused by Mr Koizumi's maritime adventure, growled that it would not introduce ""a constructive element in bilateral Russian-Japanese relations"". 
Japan is the powerhouse of the region, but has little leverage with which to press its claim. Although it is the biggest investor in Russia's Far East, this benefits Japan as much as Russia. Japan relies heavily on imported fossil fuels, and is keen to keep them flowing through as many channels as possible. It is thus investing eagerly in oil and gas projects on Russia's Sakhalin island, and has been pleading with Russia to direct a proposed $10 billion oil pipeline to the nearby port of Nakhodka. 
If Japan really wants that Security Council seat, moreover, it cannot afford to spoil relations with a country that already wields a veto. Mr Koizumi, sometimes known as Lion Heart, may gain popularity by roaring at the Russian bear. But when Mr Putin visits next year, both men will still want to talk oil, gas and money.","Junichiro Koizumi's stokes a territorial spat with Russia

The islands -- which Japan refers to as the Northern Territories , and Russia calls the Southern Kuriles -- lie just north of Hokkaido , and were part of Japan until the Soviet Union seized them at the end of the second world war . The disputed claim prevented the two sides from signing a formal peace treaty after the war , and remains an emotive issue . 
 Junichiro Koizumi , picked an interesting time to highlight the dispute . Junichiro Koizumi's Russian counterpart , Vladimir Putin , will visit Japan early next year . More important , perhaps , Junichiro Koizumi's party took a beating in upper - house elections in July , and Junichiro Koizumi needs a way to boost Junichiro Koizumi's image . Since Junichiro Koizumi took office in 2001 , foreign - policy ventures have given Junichiro Koizumi some of Junichiro Koizumi's biggest bounces in the polls : especially a pair of trips to North Korea , in 2002 and earlier this year . 
 The North Korea issue is losing some of its punch , however . Junichiro Koizumi has already won the release of all known living Japanese hostages who were abducted by North Korea during the cold war , and their families . In Iraq , where Japanese troops are doing humanitarian work , the best that Junichiro Koizumi can do now is hope that nothing goes wrong . Unsurprisingly , Junichiro Koizumi has some new ideas up Junichiro Koizumi's sleeve . Later this month Junichiro Koizumi will give a speech to the United Nations , and appeal for Japan to be given a permanent seat on its Security Council . Japan has long sought one , but Junichiro Koizumi hopes that Junichiro Koizumi's push to expand its peacekeeping role will help Junichiro Koizumi's case . 
 Highlighting Japan 's quest to reclaim the islands should also go down well domestically . More than 8,000 of the Japanese who fled when the Soviets moved in are still alive . They make a handy backdrop to Junichiro Koizumi's nationalist pose . Russia has little interest in giving the islands back , however . Its foreign ministry , which was not amused by Junichiro Koizumi's maritime adventure , growled that it would not introduce "" a constructive element in bilateral Russian - Japanese relations "" . 
 Japan is the powerhouse of the region , but has little leverage with which to press its claim . Although it is the biggest investor in Russia 's Far East , this benefits Japan as much as Russia . Japan relies heavily on imported fossil fuels , and is keen to keep them flowing through as many channels as possible . It is thus investing eagerly in oil and gas projects on Russia 's Sakhalin island , and has been pleading with Russia to direct a proposed $ 10 billion oil pipeline to the nearby port of Nakhodka . 
 If Japan really wants that Security Council seat , moreover , it can not afford to spoil relations with a country that already wields a veto . Junichiro Koizumi may gain popularity by roaring at the Russian bear . But when Mr Putin visits next year , both men will still want to talk oil , gas and money .",740,Japan,A29-8209,IN TERM,True,"Mr Koizumi , who "" inspected "" the islands from a Japanese coast - guard ship",20,True

AT AN experimental sorting centre in Koshigaya, outside Tokyo, employees of Japan Post have been taking tips from Toyota. The civil servants handling Koshigaya's mail have learnt how to break tasks into manageable chunks, track their pace by the quarter-hour and rearrange sorting trays more efficiently. These are essential steps for an organisation that is due to face privatisation and competition in a couple of years. But sorting mail is only part of Japan Post's business and, oddly, not its most important one. For the company is also the world's biggest financial institution, the primary savings bank and provider of insurance to millions of Japanese. 
Japan Post may be trying to learn from Toyota, but there is still a staggering difference between the two organisations. Toyota, like many Japanese exporters, is a globally minded company that innovates continuously to stay competitive. Japan Post, like much of the country's domestic service sector, is slow and has little need to compete. Toyota earned over yen1 trillion ($9 billion) in profit last year; Japan Post received over yen1 trillion in tax breaks and implicit subsidies. 
It is little wonder, then, that Junichiro Koizumi, who became prime minister in 2001 promising ""reform without sacred cows"", has long been keen to privatise Japan's postal system. This month, as he prepares to put the finishing touches to his plans for privatisation (in stages, beginning in April 2007), many proponents of market-based reform are urging him on. Those same enthusiasts, however, are also eyeing warily the conservatives in Mr Koizumi's ruling Liberal Democratic Party. If the LDP old guard succeeds in redrawing a few lines on the blueprint, the long-awaited privatisation could become a terrible missed opportunity.
Japan Post's pervasive influence on the financial system distorts competition and misallocates the country's huge pool of savings. It is sitting on yen227 trillion in individual savings accounts, 30% of all such savings deposits (see chart on next page). Post-office deposits are backed by government guarantee. Japan Post repays the favour by buying government-backed bonds, which finance a range of opaque, state-supported companies. Policies issued by the post office's life-insurance scheme, Kampo, are also guaranteed by the government. Their value, yen122 trillion, amounts to 40% of Japanese households' life-insurance assets. The figure for Kampo's closest rival is about yen36 trillion. Together, Japan Post's savings and insurance schemes contain a quarter of the country's personal financial assets.
While Mr Koizumi and his advisers try to liberate those savings, the LDP conservatives will do all they can to preserve the system's hidden subsidies and cross-guarantees. Many of Japan Post's 271,000 civil servants, who form a crucial block of support for the LDP's old guard, will lose their jobs if Japan Post is broken up and forced to compete. And if the savings and insurance assets are freed to chase the best returns on capital, they are highly unlikely to end up paying for concrete river-beds and other public works in LDP constituencies. Nor are many politicians and postal-ministry bureaucrats eager to give the public a clear view of where all that money has been going over the years.
Masaharu Ikuta, a former shipping executive who became Japan Post's boss last year, has proved very useful to the conservatives even though Mr Koizumi nominated him for the job. Mr Ikuta, who has a collection of toy mail lorries from around the world in his office, is keen to expand and boost efficiency, but wants to avoid breaking up the company. He recently declared that it would take years to separate the computer systems that administer the savings and insurance schemes.
Market-friendly reformists, and Mr Ikuta's future competitors, have a long list of worries. First, they point to the mail delivery business, which still appears woefully inefficient. They have warned Mr Koizumi not to let Japan Post expand into new aspects of delivery, such as international logistics, until it has been fully cut off from the financial accounts. A huge, inefficient and heavily subsidised competitor could wreak havoc on the distribution industry. 
Privatising the savings and insurance schemes is also fraught with peril. They enjoy tax breaks; and because they enjoy government backing are exempt from paying into industry-wide schemes that protect some savings deposits and life policies. At the very least, say rival banks and insurers, these supports must go before Japan Post is allowed to broaden its activities in financial services. Rivals also complain that Japan Post is overseen by the post, telecoms and home affairs ministry, whereas other financial institutions are regulated by the Financial Services Agency. Bankers argue that Japan Post has no expertise in credit assessment or risk management, and will make ill-advised loans as soon as it is given the chance. Insurers do not want poorly trained and lightly regulated civil servants competing with them to sell policies to Japanese housewives.
Foreign insurance companies are especially worried about unfair competition. The brunt of Kampo's subsidies have so far been felt in the domestic life-insurance sector. While Kampo maintained unrealistically high, government-backed rates on its policies, domestic life insurers could not compete. Under the added burden of taxes and payments to the industry-wide insurance scheme, one domestic insurer after another buckled in the 1990s. Now the foreigners fear similar pressure. If Kampo's existing policies, for example, are not hived off into a separate entity, it will be able to use revenues from them to finance an expansion into new insurance lines, such as policies for long-term health care, in which foreigners have done well.
Mr Koizumi and his advisers have been pushing for a scheme to deal with these fears. They want all existing savings and insurance accounts to be separated, with the newly liberalised entities competing from a fresh slate. They also want Japan Post's savings and insurance businesses to pay taxes and deposit insurance on the same basis as rivals, and to remove government guarantees for their products.
Perhaps the thorniest issue is how closely, and for how long, Japan Post's four bits will remain connected to one another. Besides delivery, savings and insurance, there is a network of 24,700 post offices. Should there be a holding company with four subsidiaries at the start of the privatisation process, for example, or should Japan Post carry on for a while as one big integrated firm? 
Whether the prime minister gets his way is an important test of how far reform will go. His idea is that privatised post-office outlets would be free to take mail, offer financial products and provide retail services, but would have to treat the other three Japan Post units as arm's-length suppliers, and would have incentives to sell rival products--such as mutual funds and other accounts from private institutions--over the counter.
Japan Post's defenders are urging the government to continue subsidising the post-office network, so that it can keep serving far-flung bits of the country. Mr Koizumi will surely have to give ground on this issue. But that is all the more reason to ensure that the savings and insurance units do not continue to enjoy subsidies too. It is time they fended for themselves.","If it is done properly , the privatisation of Japan Post could boost competition in the country 's financial markets . Trouble is , it might not be

IT WAS a bad week for American cows, whose lives may soon get a little shorter. On September 6th, a panel of scientists advising the Japanese government ruled that America's trade negotiators have been correct, for the most part, about how risky it is to eat American beef. Their finding should soon offer a way out of a trade row that has raged since America reported a case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) late last year. 
In December, a cow in Washington state, which had entered America from Canada, was found to have BSE. Japan promptly extended its ban on Canadian beef, imposed when an infected cow was reported there the previous May, to imports from America. At first it said the ban would remain in place until the United States adopted Japanese testing standards. Unlike their counterparts in America and Europe, Japanese food inspectors test every single cow for BSE, including those less than 30 months old.
The Americans say that this approach is not ""scientific"". They say that the brain-wasting disease takes time to develop, and that there is therefore no reason to test for BSE in cows under 30 months old. Outside Japan, they point out, no cow below that age has ever been found to be infected. The Americans also say that it is unnecessarily costly to test every animal above that age, because risks can be contained by statistical sampling and proper slaughtering.
Meanwhile, America's beef producers have been shut out of a market to which they exported $1 billion last year. Japanese importers have suffered too. Yoshinoya, a food chain famous for its gyudon (beef bowls), has had a hard time adapting its product to Australian meat. Its sales have slid: it expects to make its first loss in a quarter-century in the year to March.
This week's finding, by an ad hoc panel advising Japan's Food Safety Commission, will make a resolution of the dispute easier. Easier, but not certain. The panel concluded that American officials are right to claim that young cows are safe--but only those aged 20 months or less. Japan says that it has detected 11 cases of BSE since 2001, in cows as young as 21 months. 
There is therefore still likely to be some haggling about the age below which untested beef can be sent to Japan. The Americans are also still trying to persuade the Japanese to accept some statistical sampling instead of insisting that every animal be examined. Another problem is that the two sides disagree about how to establish a cow's age. America does not track birthdays precisely, because a close estimate can be made from a cow's teeth. 
Some Japanese consumer groups have been telling officials to be careful what they agree to. Still, a deal should be struck. Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, will be in America this month and is likely to discuss the issue with George Bush. Trade negotiators are due to meet next month to sort out the details, and the ban could be lifted, if partially, by November. Although complete resolution could take a while yet, American cows may soon be on their way across the Pacific.

CHARITY may begin at home, but Japan's intermittent economic recoveries always start somewhere else. Its latest is no different. Booming demand for exports has powered an impressive rebound over the past couple of years. This time, however, growth is also spreading to the domestic economy. Japan is in its best position since 1989, when a financial crisis plunged its economy into a despond of repeated recessions and slow growth. It now has a real chance of building a lasting recovery of its own, one not overly reliant on exports but supported by domestic growth as well. To achieve that, however, it must overhaul its decrepit service sector. Much of that chore falls to Junichiro Koizumi, the prime minister, who will revamp his cabinet next week. 
Mr Koizumi's critics, the fiercest of whom are in his own Liberal Democratic Party, are calling more loudly than ever for him to ease up on reform. They have been emboldened by the party's poor showing in upper-house elections this summer. Mr Koizumi anyway has at most two years left as prime minister, because his party's rules require him to step down in September 2006. His critics are hoping that he will now become a lame duck. Instead, Mr Koizumi must send a clear signal with next week's reshuffle that he intends to use the rest of his term to carry out the structural reforms that he has promised.
Japan desperately needs these. Its world-beating manufacturers can no longer, by themselves, power the long-term productivity growth that the country requires to cope with the burden of a rapidly ageing population and stiffer competition from across Asia. As in other rich economies, Japan's service sector, which has always been largely sleepy and uncompetitive, must start to pull more of its potential weight. That transition should have begun in the 1990s, but Japan's misguided response to its banking crisis kept many insolvent firms alive, distorting competition and holding down productivity in retailing, wholesale distribution, construction, utilities and a variety of other service industries (see pages 97-99). 
Admittedly, the signs have grown more encouraging lately. This time, the export-led recovery has boosted profits throughout the economy, making it easier to separate winners from losers among service companies. On Mr Koizumi's watch, regulators have pressed the banks, at least the biggest ones, to abandon their remaining deadbeat borrowers. Rising profits and shrinking debts might finally defeat Japan's long bout of price deflation, which has so damaged prospects for growth. 
Mr Koizumi can hardly afford to let up, however. The risk remains that marginal borrowers will slide back into trouble, either because export growth slows sharply or because rising demand pulls up interest rates. More importantly, Japan will not achieve decent long-term growth unless it boosts productivity in services. Mr Koizumi should choose a team that will press on, and make his priorities clear.
Post-structural reforms
He has already placed privatisation of Japan's huge postal system, which doubles as a giant bank and badly distorts the financial system, at the top of his list. But he must fight in parliament to ensure that this is done quickly and properly. Japan Post's banking and insurance arms should be separated from each other, as well as from the postal distribution network, and then regulated on the same terms as private competitors. 
Financial reform should not stop there. Although the biggest banks have improved, many of Japan's regional banks remain saddled with dodgy borrowers and bad business models. The government needs to recapitalise some of them and merge or shut down others. Mr Koizumi should also prod the regulators to ensure that banks reduce bad loans through real restructuring rather than rosy assessments.
Beyond making capital flow where it is needed, Mr Koizumi must foster competition wherever he can. Instead of coddling small firms with tax breaks and subsidies, the government needs to get out of the way and let nimbler firms emerge. Mr Koizumi could also expand one of his best initiatives: letting local areas form special zones that are exempt from stifling national regulations. Why not make all of Japan a deregulation zone? Given the huge benefits that freer global competition has delivered to its now-mighty exporters, Japan would do well to try more competition at home as well.","A new era is within Japan 's reach , if Junichiro Koizumi seizes the chance

He will face crucial choices next week, when he reshuffles his cabinet along with the LDP's leadership posts. The new line-up may help to answer a fundamental question: does Mr Koizumi still have any fight left after an embarrassing showing in this summer's upper-house elections?
Many of Mr Koizumi's most important economic reforms are dear to his heart because they help to reshape the LDP's internal political landscape. Cutting public-works spending has eroded a valued source of patronage and votes for the LDP old guard. His bid to privatise the postal service, which doubles as the world's biggest bank, is worth attempting on its economic merits, but has the added advantage of derailing another LDP gravy train. 
Mr Koizumi has got away with such gambits because, unlike his internal rivals, he has based his power on national appeal. The absence of any clear alternative leader to fend off the opposition Democratic Party of Japan, which now has a realistic shot at power, has also kept the LDP old guard at bay. At times, Mr Koizumi has pressed this advantage. Instead of promoting new MPs to the cabinet frequently, following an LDP conveyor-belt system that rewards long-serving members from big factions, he has mostly chosen ministers who suit his tastes, and has shuffled them infrequently.
His most heralded victories have been over the LDP's biggest political faction, the so-called Hashimoto faction, which lost eight seats in last November's lower-house election and another 11 in this summer's upper-house poll. Although those were LDP seats, the losses were hardly tragic for Mr Koizumi. His own former faction, run by the previous prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, gained as many seats as the Hashimoto faction lost. Mr Koizumi has also managed to split many factions down the middle. During the LDP leadership race a year ago, many members of rival factions backed his bid.
Mr Koizumi's LDP antagonists, however, believe that he is now in a weaker position. Unless he calls a snap election, the LDP does not have to go to the polls again during the rest of his term. His popularity has also slid. Mr Koizumi felt obliged to make a huge concession earlier this month, by agreeing to let the Hashimoto faction's upper-house leader, Mikio Aoki, nominate the two upper-house members who will serve in his next cabinet. For the most part, however, he has vowed to favour ministers who back more reform. Hopefully, he will stick to his guns: let up on the LDP, let down Japan.","Has Junichiro Koizumi grown too weak to complete Junichiro Koizumi's political reforms ?

JUNICHIRO KOIZUMI remains as stubborn as ever. The prime minister, who reshuffled his cabinet on September 27th, once again ignored the wishes of his Liberal Democratic Party's heavyweights, and instead chose cabinet members and party leaders who back his policies. His decision to put Heizo Takenaka, the banking-and-budget tsar, in charge of privatising the yen350 trillion ($3.18 trillion) postal savings-and-insurance system stole the spotlight. Mr Takenaka has been the cabinet's most visible minister, and postal reform has been Mr Koizumi's pet project for decades. But the prime minister's choices also showed the importance of free-trade talks and Japan's evolving diplomacy.
Mr Koizumi replaced the foreign and defence ministers, and plans to keep running a good deal of foreign policy from his own office. He named a close ally, Taku Yamasaki, as a new informal adviser, and appointed Yoshinori Ono, who wants to upgrade Japan's military, as the new minister for defence. Japan and the United States are discussing an extensive review of America's 47,000 troops and numerous bases in Japan, as part of a global American defence overhaul. 
Yoriko Kawaguchi, the outgoing foreign minister, will advise Mr Koizumi on Japan's bid to gain a seat on the UN Security Council. Those special advisers must get along with the new foreign minister, Nobutaka Machimura, who may not be content just to run the bureaucracy and make nice speeches. Mr Machimura's first order of business, however, was to explain his stance on the Yasukuni shrine, which honours war criminals along with Japan's other dead soldiers. Mr Koizumi's annual visits to the shrine have infuriated Japan's neighbours, and Mr Machimura likes to go there too. But, without criticising Mr Koizumi's trips to the shrine, Mr Machimura now says he may stop his own.
On trade, Mr Koizumi is sticking with a clever experiment. He has left Shoichi Nakagawa, who has strong ties to farmers, in charge of the economy, trade and industry ministry, which negotiates trade deals. Although powerful and protectionist farmers have long stymied trade talks, Japan's businessmen are calling loudly for new deals that make it easier to export and invest overseas. Mr Koizumi has backed the businessmen. He appointed Mr Nakagawa last year, hoping that knowledge of farm politics would make it easier to overcome resistance and cut fresh trade deals. Free-traders in the civil service like the idea, which has begun to deliver results. Japan has just signed a bilateral deal with Mexico after agreeing to import more orange juice and pork. 
Although Mr Takenaka has changed roles, reforming the financial system remains a priority. It is hoped that Tatsuya Ito, who had been Mr Takenaka's financial-services deputy, will extend recent banking reforms to regional banks. These must be properly audited, and some of them need to be overhauled. Mr Takenaka, meanwhile, will no doubt stay in the spotlight. Shigenori Okazaki, a political analyst at UBS, reckons that 70% of the LDP's lawmakers oppose the postal reforms that he must now drive through parliament.

THEIR time is coming. The civil servants in Japan's Finance Ministry have watched nervously in recent years as the budget deficit has widened and government debt has risen sharply. Now that Japan's economy is growing again, the ministry is itching to raise taxes and close the gap. But many economists worry that Japan will repeat its mistake of 1997, when a rise in consumption taxes cut off a nascent economic upturn and plunged the economy back into recession. Can Japan get the timing right this time?
Its debt levels are clearly a worry. The most oft-cited measure, gross debt levels approaching 170% of GDP, overstates the problem, since it does not account for financial assets held by the government. But even so, Japan's net public debt has reached 80% of GDP, according to the International Monetary Fund, and is rising rapidly, despite the economic recovery. Moreover, the government's interest payments--now a lowly 1.5% for ten-year bonds--could rise sharply if prices eventually stop falling throughout the economy, something many economists believe could happen next year.
To tame the debt and reassure bond investors, the government has announced a medium-term plan to get deficits under control. It aims to cut the primary deficit, which excludes interest payments, to zero by 2010. But even that will be a tall order. The Finance Ministry expects to record a primary deficit of around yen19 trillion ($173 billion), or 3.8% of GDP, in the year to March 31st. 
Although Junichiro Koizumi, the prime minister, has been cutting Japan's mammoth public-works budget sharply, it will be hard to erase the deficit with spending cuts alone. Japan's greying population will drive up medical and pension payments. At some point, higher tax revenues will clearly be needed. In fact, revenues slid throughout the 1990s, and continued to collapse during a downturn that ended in 2002. Nominal tax revenues are now roughly where they were in 1986, before the 1990s boom inflated them, so taxes are much lower as a share of GDP (see chart). 
The Finance Ministry argues that much of this has to do with tax cuts introduced during the 1990s, which on the whole have far outweighed the 1997 rise in sales tax. Personal cuts enacted in 1999 lowered income taxes. Corporate tax rates were also cut during the 1990s, and companies have recently been allowed to offset profits against losses across their numerous subsidiaries, reducing the burden further. The Finance Ministry's website features cartoon citizens who are amazed how much corporate and individual tax rates have been cut.
The government, which in December will begin working out a tax plan in earnest, will probably eliminate some of the personal income-tax cuts over the next couple of years. The impact is likely to be small, however, increasing revenues by only yen1 trillion or so a year at first. The bigger questions are those surrounding local finances and sales taxes. Mr Koizumi has been backing a plan to grant local governments more autonomy. They will lose tax grants and subsidies, and in exchange will be allowed to keep about yen3 trillion of the tax revenues raised in their towns and prefectures. Local governments fear, however, that the Finance Ministry is planning to use this as a way to shrink the central deficit at their expense.
Eventually, sales tax rates, currently at 5%, will have to go up to help offset the rising cost of social security. The timing, however, will be crucial. Mr Koizumi, who must step down by September 2006 because of his party's six-year term limit, has pledged not to enact sales-tax increases while he is in office. Most onlookers, however, expect the Finance Ministry to press for increases that kick in almost as soon as Mr Koizumi is gone. With luck, the government will be wise enough to phase these in gradually, and the central bank will offset any tax rises by keeping monetary policy loose. But with growth already starting to slow, all this tax talk is making people distinctly nervous.","Can Japan fix its budget without cutting short its recovery ?

HE SAYS he will not change course, but Junichiro Koizumi, Japan's prime minister, must be hoping that public opinion does not turn any further against his troop deployment in Iraq. More than 500 members of Japan's Self Defence Forces (SDF) have been there for nearly a year, serving in the quiet southern backwater of Samawa (not to be confused with much nastier Samarra), and Mr Koizumi must decide by mid-December whether to extend their stay. Japan's public had a mixed reaction this week to the kidnapping and killing of Shosei Koda, a 24-year-old traveller whose body was found on October 30th. Even before Mr Koda's kidnapping last week, opinion had been turning against the SDF mission. In a recent poll by the Asahi Shimbun, Japan's biggest left-of-centre daily, 63% of Japanese said they opposed having troops in Iraq.
Mr Koizumi may not receive much blame for the killing, which the government has pinned on a group loyal to the notorious Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a Jordanian terrorist who has orchestrated other kidnappings and killings in Iraq. Many Japanese believe that Mr Koda should not have ignored government warnings to avoid Iraq, especially after five Japanese journalists and aid workers were kidnapped earlier this year and later released. (The five were given a distinctly frosty welcome when they finally got home, and several ended up apologising for having caused Japan so much trouble.) Nonetheless, reports that Mr Koda's body was found covered by an American flag add to the perception that the prime minister deployed troops largely to please George Bush, and that Japan has become more involved than it should have.
Mr Koizumi needs support from a crucial domestic ally, the New Komeito party. The main opposition party, the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), has gained strength in recent years, prompting pundits to wonder whether New Komeito might abandon the ruling Liberal Democrats and form a new ruling coalition with the DPJ. As New Komeito closed its party conference on October 31st, it was still standing by Mr Koizumi. But the party's re-elected leader, Takenori Kanzaki, is not taking any unnecessary risks. He has urged Mr Koizumi to delay the decision to extend the Iraqi deployment until as close as possible to the December 14th deadline.

IT IS easy to see why Junichiro Koizumi gets on well with George Bush. The prime minister wants to expand the role of Japan's armed forces, which have helped America in Afghanistan and Iraq. His Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), like Mr Bush's Republican party, relies on rural backing and is loathed by many urban voters. And each man owes his power partly to a large, loyal and committed group of religious voters. Yet whereas Mr Bush gets on famously with America's evangelical Christians, Mr Koizumi seems an odd bedfellow for the peace-loving lay Buddhists who back his ruling coalition.
Formally, the LDP's coalition partner, New Komeito, which has 34 lower-house seats in parliament, is separate from Soka Gakkai, a lay Buddhist organisation with more than 10m Japanese members. Soka Gakkai makes no campaign donations to New Komeito, for example. Yet a Soka Gakkai spokesperson concedes that it is New Komeito's ""main supporting organisation"". And that support clearly helps New Komeito and its coalition partner to win elections, especially in urban areas where the LDP is relatively weak. 
Many Japanese attest to the eagerness with which Soka Gakkai members chase them down during election season to bend their ears about New Komeito and its place in government. And ruling-coalition MPs, whether LDP or New Komeito, show deference to Soka Gakkai, convinced that its members help them on polling day.
Such support has become even more important in the past year, as Japan's once fractious political system has coalesced around the LDP and its opponent, the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), leaving New Komeito as the only other party of note. Lower-house elections a year ago decimated the Social Democrats and Communists on the left, and drove the New Conservatives to extinction on the right. Upper-house polls this summer continued the trend, and raised the odds that the DPJ might match or surpass the LDP in the next general election. If it has a chance to put the DPJ in power, will New Komeito--which already holds the balance of power in the upper house--switch sides?
Defence policy is an obvious area to watch. But New Komeito might not achieve much by changing sides. Many DPJ members, like Mr Koizumi, want to bolster Japan's Self-Defence Forces, and either revise the pacifist constitution or re-interpret it less restrictively. 
Nor do the LDP and DPJ differ much in other ways. Either party would have to make painful changes to health-care finances and pensions. ""For now,"" says Hirotsugu Terasaki, a Soka Gakkai vice-president, ""we accept that the LDP is the party best able to govern Japan, and see Komeito's presence in the coalition as an important brake on the LDP's rightist tendencies."" The LDP had better be careful, however. If it lurches too far rightwards, the political karma could be swift.","Could Japan 's Buddhist - backed third party switch sides ?

Marwan Barghouti, a popular Palestinian militia boss currently serving five life terms in an Israeli jail for his role in attacks on Israeli soldiers and civilians, announced that he would stand for the presidency of the Palestinian Authority after all.
Israel's prime minister, Ariel Sharon, who has made it clear he will not free Mr Barghouti, lost a crucial budget vote. His coalition might now collapse, endangering his plan to pull out of Gaza, though he said he would seek a coalition with the Labour Party to save both.
The 35-nation board of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN's nuclear guardian, again resolved not to report Iran's nuclear transgressions to the UN Security Council, in return for a full suspension of its uranium-enrichment work and in the hope that negotiations with Britain, France and Germany that are due to start on December 15th would end the country's dabbling with dangerous nuclear technologies. Iran said it would never give up its right to these technologies, and has been blocking access by inspectors to two military sites.
Congo announced that Rwanda had invaded its eastern border areas. Rwanda refused to confirm or deny it, but said that if it did send troops into its huge, chaotic neighbour, it would only be to hunt down genocidal Rwandan rebels hiding there. A UN patrol saw what it thought were Rwandan troops on the wrong side of the border. 
South Africa's president, Thabo Mbeki, accused Archbishop Desmond Tutu of being an ignorant liar, after the Nobel peace laureate complained that Mr Mbeki's policy of ""black economic empowerment"" was benefiting only a few tycoons with political connections. 
Damaging deadlock
Ukraine's tense stand-off between supporters of two rival presidential candidates, Victor Yushchenko and Victor Yanukovich, continued. A fresh election looked increasingly likely after the parliament dismissed the government, in which Mr Yanukovich serves as prime minister. The supreme court is also hearing claims of fraud in the election. 
Romania's elections were also marred by claims of fraud. The ruling Socialist Party was in the lead, but the presidential poll will now go to a run-off later this month.
Also heading for an early election is Portugal, after President Jorge Sampaio said he had lost confidence in the government of Pedro Santana Lopes. Political turmoil was triggered when Mr Santana Lopes's predecessor, Jose Manuel Barroso, left to become president of the European Commission in Brussels.
The European Union formally took over NATO's peacekeeping mission in Bosnia. This is the EU's biggest-ever military operation.
Nicolas Sarkozy staged a grand party to mark his inauguration as president of France's ruling UMP party. His successor as finance minister is to be Herve Gaymard. 
A French appeal court reduced the ban on Alain Juppe's holding of elective office from ten years to one. Mr Juppe, a former prime minister, was convicted in January of political corruption.
Another term
Colombia's Congress passed constitutional changes allowing lvaro Uribe to run for a second term, a move that will allow the popular president to continue his tough campaign against the country's armed groups. They now await court approval.
Chile's president, Ricardo Lagos, unveiled a report that blames the armed forces for the torture of political prisoners during Augusto Pinochet's rule. He also announced compensation for victims.
George Bush made his first-ever official visit to Canada.
Mexico's president, Vicente Fox, returned the draft budget for 2005 to Congress with over 60 complaints attached, effectively vetoing it. If a budget is not passed by December 31st, the government may cease to function.
Cuba freed five dissidents from a group of 75 convicted in April last year.
Cabinet moves
Tom Ridge, the head of America's homeland security department, resigned. Meanwhile, President Bush nominated Carlos Gutierrez, currently the boss of Kellogg, a cereal-maker, to be his secretary of commerce, replacing Don Evans. 
The Pentagon announced it would increase the number of American troops in Iraq to 150,000--the largest force since the invasion.
The Supreme Court refused to hear a suit brought by conservative groups hoping to overturn Massachusetts's gay-marriage law, but heard a case on medical marijuana.

Aung San Suu Kyi, leader of Myanmar's opposition party, is to be held under house arrest for a further year. The Association of South-East Asian Nations, which includes Myanmar, was holding a summit at the time and declined to comment.
Wen Jiabao and Junichiro Koizumi, the prime ministers respectively of China and Japan, met in Vientiane, Laos, where they were attending the ASEAN summit as observers.

A DEBATE over its pacifist constitution has grabbed the headlines, but you can learn a lot more about Japan's defence strategy by looking at how it plans to spend its military budget over the next five to ten years. In the next week or two, Junichiro Koizumi's cabinet will approve a new National Defence Programme Outline, the first in nearly a decade. The new outline will set out the government's latest thinking on future threats, and guide its investments in arms and defence capabilities. It will probably place a heavy emphasis on the same two threats that America's Pentagon has lately been stressing: potential terrorist attacks, and the danger of rogue states such as North Korea combining ballistic missiles with weapons of mass destruction. Mr Koizumi's team is also debating how much to relax Japan's self-imposed limits on sharing military technology with allies.
The 1995 outline introduced few new ideas, even though the cold war had ended. In marked contrast, the government hopes to spell out clearly this time how Japan's defence needs are changing. Although Japan has been sending peacekeepers abroad since 1992, for example, the new outline is expected to say clearly that these missions are not just good deeds--they are a crucial way of promoting global stability, and therefore help to make Japan safer. 
This commitment should pave the way for investments in new transport aircraft, so that Japanese troops can deploy overseas more quickly, along with weapons and equipment that will help peacekeepers defend themselves better and operate more flexibly. Japan's current peacekeeping force in Iraq, for example, has been holed up in a quiet corner of that country, reliant on Dutch troops for protection.
The government will also highlight the need for commando units and other flexible forces, which can respond to any terrorist threats that arise. Because Japan limits its defence budget to 1% of GDP, these sorts of changes will probably be paid for with cuts in tanks, conventional troops and other assets that were intended to slow down putative Soviet attackers. The 1995 outline called for 160,000 troops, but the number may now be cut by 10% or so.
One costly category that Japan plans to invest in is missile defence. It is already co-operating with America on basic research. But self-imposed restrictions on arms exports make it hard to work more closely. These efforts will hit a wall next year, experts say, unless the restrictions are relaxed a bit. Japanese defence contractors, such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries, are itching to expand co-operation in other military areas as well. As it often does, the government floated this idea publicly a month ago by having a panel of private-sector advisers recommend it in a report. But Mr Koizumi's junior coalition partner, the Buddhist-backed New Komeito, has balked at the idea. 
New Komeito's leaders are willing to back a narrow decision--due during the next couple of months--to let Japanese firms share more technology with America for missile defence. Beyond that, however, they have pressed to remove any mention in the new outline of a general change in principle on arms exports. But Mr Koizumi may ignore their pleas, despite New Komeito's growing clout in the eyes of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
China is also gaining clout, and some Japanese defence experts are urging the government to mention its neighbour explicitly in the new defence outlines. That would certainly grab some headlines.","Japan 's government plans to upgrade and revamp its armed forces

THE people of Hokkaido, a vast northern island of farms, forests and wilderness, are trying to save two endangered species. One is the red-crested crane, some 800 of which live in the island's eastern Kushiro Marsh. The other is the wingless crane that, along with other bits of Hokkaido's construction sector, once thrived in a habitat awash in government subsidies. But much of this money has dried up since Junichiro Koizumi, the prime minister, slashed the country's public-works budget. And after depending for decades on public money, Hokkaido has few competitive firms capable of exploiting the export-led recovery that has buoyed other parts of Japan over the past couple of years.
Falling even further behind is a sad state of affairs for a region that was once considered Japan's rugged frontier. As with many other rural Japanese, however, the people of Hokkaido, including many who settled here after the second world war, have allowed their destiny to be shaped by the gentle tug of government purse strings rather than the unpredictable pull of market forces. Of course, the region, which accounts for less than 5% of Japan's population but nearly a quarter of its landmass, still has some obvious assets to fall back on. It has plenty of forests, national parks and ski slopes to attract tourists, and offers activities ranging from rafting to digging up potatoes.
Hokkaido is also the closest thing Japan has to a farm belt, producing wheat, meat and the bulk of Japan's dairy products. Its rivers and coastal waters supply plenty of seafood. It is also, for many, a pleasant place to live. Ikkei Matsuda, head of Hokkaido Venture Capital in Sapporo, the local capital, once worked for a big securities firm in Tokyo. He likes the laid back lifestyle in Sapporo, and says he can now live in a bigger condominium, for less money, than anything he could have dreamed about in the nation's capital.
But the island has developed few other advantages over the years, and is now paying the price. The subsidy mentality and its aftermath are most evident among Hokkaido's countless small building firms, many of which have either gone bust or are close to it. These firms, many employing 20 or fewer people, grew up feeding off the public-works budget. Some of the subsidies were delivered through the construction ministry, but the farm ministry also played a big role. Much of its budget was intended to help farmers adjust to the loss of jobs and incomes caused by global competition. Instead of thinking up wise ways to invest these funds, officials used construction projects simply to inject money into rural areas with insufficient regard for the probable benefits.
Hokkaido has little to show for all this public investment. Although it can offer cheap land and labour to national employers--factory wages, at yen240,000 ($2,300) a month, are one-third less than the national average--it has not made itself attractive to manufacturers. Only a few factories making car parts and electronics have sprouted on the island over the years. And now that Hokkaido realises it needs more of them, it faces stiff competition from elsewhere--not least nearby China.
Thus, even though Japan as a whole is enjoying an investment boom, most of Hokkaido's manufacturing investments have involved expanding existing facilities, not building big new factories. A few parts of Hokkaido--such as the coast south of Sapporo--have been able to cash in on the export-led boom. The rest of the island is still pretty weak.
Bereft of the old subsidies, the small construction firms are turning themselves into farmers, service providers, anything that will help them survive. Private companies are not allowed to own agricultural land in Japan, but a recent rule change allows them to lease land from existing farmers. So one tactic has been for builders to trade in their jackhammers for tractors. 
Indeed, many of Hokkaido's recovery plans seem to involve replacing uprooted subsidies with new and more promising varieties of government money. The governor, Harumi Takahashi, once headed the Hokkaido branch of the ministry of economy, trade and industry. METI, once famous for directing Japan's statist industrial policy, still directs plenty of subsidies and tax breaks towards new sectors it deems promising. Part of the governor's appeal, says one local academic, is that voters believed her METI connections would help her tap into these subsidies more skilfully. Biotechnology and information technology investments are bandied about as promising candidates.
In the meantime, the island is counting on tourism to pick up the slack. Last year was disappointing, says an official from METI's Hokkaido branch, because there was not enough snow to attract very many skiers. Tourism also suffered because discount air fares to remote parts of the island went up, after a small regional airline, Air Do, went bust in 2002.
Tourism promoters are now trying to attract more visitors from north-east Asia and Australia. Hokkaido also experimented with daylight-saving time in a few areas this past summer. It hopes that the national government will soon let the entire island adopt it, allowing its long summer days to end even later at night, thus giving tourism a further boost.
Unsurprisingly, some plans to attract tourists involve big subsidies. The biggest is a scheme to extend Japan's bullet train all the way to Hokkaido, using the existing tunnel from the northern tip of Honshu to Hakodate, on Hokkaido's south-western peninsula. The cabinet may endorse funds for such a project this month, when it approves the blueprint for next year's budget. In Hokkaido, they are hoping that their beloved subsidies, like migrating birds, will soon find their way home.","Japan's northernmost prefecture is beautiful but economically weak

DARK night gave way, that Jan the first,
To hopes that now the sun would burst
On where Saddam had once been king--
Tsar, caesar, lord--of everything,
And with his acolytes and thugs, 
And poison gas and listening bugs,
Had ground the poor Iraqis down,
In field and dune and marsh and town.
The realisation soon would grow
That in his place was GI Joe,
A decent, fair and honest friend
Who had no wish his life to spend
In any country but his own--
So long as freedom had been grown. 
For GI Joe had but one aim, 
To make Iraq look just the same
As any democratic reach, 
From Oregon to West Palm Beach.
AND yet Iraq was daily rent 
By shots and blasts from men who sent
Crazed bombers out to kill and maim. 
The zealous masses they'd inflame
And stir the clerics to incite 
Their congregations to invite
The ever-conquering Yanks to go, 
And never more their faces show.
MEANWHILE, over to the east, 
Two years had passed since war had ceased,
Yet here as well some hopes were rising, 
The reason was a group comprising
Delegates from far and wide, 
Tajiks, Pushtuns, side by side, 
Aimaqs, Uzbeks, crooks and warlords, 
All agreed to sheath their broadswords,
Then sat down amid the rubble 
To see if they could ease their trouble;
And from this motley institution 
Arose an Afghan constitution.
NEXT door, where grimly clerics reign, 
Weak reformists pled in vain
With a council so hardline 
Few considered it divine.
What they sought was a selection 
To contest the next election
And thus assist th' Iranian nation 
To escape its isolation.
But the steely ayatollahs, 
Caring more for power than dollars-- 
Not that they would close their palms 
To the faithful's proffered alms--
Knew that they would lose control 
If they let reform unroll. 
So no, the critics could not stand: 
Half their candidates were banned.
Guardians of the revolution 
Must resist such vile pollution;
They must brook no opposition, 
Press ahead with plans for fission,
Hone their theocratic praxis--
And languish on the evil axis.
IN OTHER parts the breaking news, 
Of wars and bombs and avian flus,
Was little better, it appeared. 
True, some Italians rose and cheered
To hear a court say Berlusconi 
Must be tried, the law was phoney
That granted him immunity 
And so conferred impunity.
And down in Georgia Saakashvili, 
Young and brave, not touchy-feely,
Took every vote, bar 4%, 
And thus became the president.
ELSEWHERE, however, much was gloom. 
Darfur heard the crack of doom,
As every kind of odious deed 
Was turned to by the janjaweed. 
Oppression reigned from Minsk to Lhasa, 
A bomber killed herself in Gaza,
And men in shades in Pakistan 
Began to question Abdul Khan,
The father of the country's bomb, 
Who'd spread his secrets far from home.
A WORLD away, in cold Des Moines, 
By caucus, poll or well spun coin,
The Democrats began to choose 
A candidate who shared their views
And might do battle, later on--
The race would be a marathon,
Involving grit and shove and push--
With George (the latest) Walker Bush.
All eyes till now had focused been 
On pull-no-punches Howard Dean,
But Dean let out a plangent yell
That sent his ratings straight to hell,
And, with the voters not so sure, 
A new face was the cynosure.
John Forbes Kerry was his name 
And by month's end he'd shot to fame, 
A veteran with gongs galore 
And stinging words about the war.
Which war was that? Vietnam, of course, 
But now once more the use of force
In this new war was looking vain-- 
The war to fell Saddam Hussein.
Could Kerry wow the party hacks, 
And plug the Democratic cracks?
Was he Viagra? Polyfilla? 
An elixir? A dragon-killer?
Or just a boring flip-flop man? 
Political temazepam?
QUITE different questions troubled Tony, 
The aegis-bearing Bush's crony,
Whose faithful loyalty to his friend 
Had brought no favours in the end
And cost him dear within his party, 
Which threatened now to give him hearty
Thanks and hustle him to quit-- 
G. Brown could make a fist of it. 
Two horrors stalked the grinning Blair, 
One a pretty small affair
Involving top-up fees for students, 
Never known for showing prudence.
The other, though, concerned Iraq, 
In truth a matter deep and dark
In which the BBC had stated 
That Tony Blair had overrated--
""Sexed up"" was in fact the term--
A spooks' report about the germ
And ultra-nasty nuclear stuff 
That S. Hussein was braced to puff
In--this was a measure of his power--
Just three-quarters of an hour.
Many Brits disliked the war, 
The spin and lying even more, 
Especially the false deduction 
That the weapons were of mass destruction.
One man who'd told the Beeb his thought--
This was the source for its report--
Had then resorted to a knife 
To cut his wrist and take his life.
Six months had passed and now was due 
An independent full review 
In which a judge would soon proclaim 
If anyone should take the blame. 
Some thought that, having heard from Hutton, 
T. Blair would be as dead as mutton.
How wrong they were: when all was stated, 
It was the Beeb the judge berated.
IN FEB, the shortest month of all,
Iraq was still in Mars's thrall.
The world watched bombs and rockets fall, 
And hopes of peace could only pall,
Notwithstanding Wolfowitz.
DARFUR now was racked by hunger,
Sri Lanka hoped for someone younger
Than its boss, Kumaratunga,
Who, 'midst cries of ""Cowabunga!""
Sacked her colleagues, causing splits.
LIKEWISE Putin purged his team, 
Vowed to mine a richer seam.
Mugabe sank in world esteem--
His special powers made critics scream.
Zimbabwe was the pits.
FRANCE said it would ban the veil,
San Francisco it would hail
Same-sex weddings, male to male.
Gays who'd hoped they would prevail
Were putting on the Ritz.
UGANDAN cultists slaughtered 80,
Things were even worse in Haiti,
Nader said that every state he 
Would contest, thus leaving baity
Democrats in fits.
THE world dismissed th' Iranian poll, 
A bomb in Arbil took its toll,
Kerry's bus began to roll,
And viewers of the Super Bowl
Saw Janet Jackson's tits.
IN EAGERNESS, it now appeared, to live up to its name,
Mad March arrived in crazy style with lots more of the same:
In Karbala, in Quetta, La Paz and Tashkent, too, 
In Gaza and Fallujah--though not in Timbuktu--
Boom followed after bang, alas, bang followed thud,
The air was full of smoke and the streets were full of blood. 
But the worst bangs of all were the ones that shattered Spain,
Three days before a vote was due to put in place again 
The team once led, the Bushies said, by that bright shining star,
The champion of ""new"" Europe's crew, Jose Mara Aznar.
When he had sent Spain's soldiers to do battle in Iraq,
He hadn't given his reasons, but kept all his thinking dark. 
E'en so, the polls predicted that his team would win again,
But the voters didn't like the way that he and all his men
Were quick to blame the bombing on Spain's home-grown ETA camp,
When all the signs suggested that it bore al-Qaeda's stamp.
And so the Spaniards brought to book George Bush's friend and hero,
By opting for Jose Luis Rodrguez Zapatero.
BY CONTRAST, for some others, the votes were trouble-free;
Malaysia and El Salvador had rulers filled with glee.
The Taiwanese returned their boss, though only by a fraction,
While the other 49% demanded satisfaction. 
John Kerry drew more comfort from a Super Tuesday win,
His rivals, though, sustained a blow and saw their ranks grow thin.
Attempted coups would make the news in Congo and Sudan,
And Turkmenbashi banned all beards in Turkmenbashistan. 
THE South Korean president found solace out of reach 
When his parliament chastised him and then voted to impeach.
For North Koreans and Cypriots the talking came to naught, 
But with Muammar Qaddafi it all proved much less fraught.
In Pakistan the Indians had a jolly spiffing tour
Showing cricket could bring friendship to old enemies next door.
Events in Venezuela, though, were doomed to end in fracas--
Too bad that cricket isn't played in soccer-mad Caracas.
Too bad, as well, for Irishmen who liked to have a drag,
That now in every workplace the signs said ""Quench that fag"".
THE father of Muqtada 
Was a better man, they said,
Yet anyone called Sadr
Filled western hearts with dread.
Old Sadr was a scholar,
With a penchant for the book,
But the son was rather different
With a very nasty look. 
He could summon up his forces
From the centre of Najaf,
Or the slums of Sadr City
Where the streets were mean and tough.
Though the Sunnis of Fallujah
Might sometimes call a truce,
Muqtada thought the Shias
Should turn Bush's rednecks puce.
And so the spring was bloody 
In this ""liberated"" land,
Where the lights were intermittent
And the wells were clogged with sand.
THOUGH things were somewhat better
In the kingdom to the south--
You could not say the people here
Were living hand to mouth--
Yet a bomb went off in Riyadh
And re-echoed clear and loud
With a message that was meant to rock
The ruling house of Saud.
IN THE land between the Jordan
And the Mediterranean Sea,
The guardian of the Jewish state
Said Gaza might be free.
He vowed to pull the settlers 
From their Earthly bit of heaven.
The borders, though, would not be those
Of 1967. 
NO MATTER, said the White House;
It's an excellent idea.
A state we'll make in Palestine
With all its exiles there.
They can't go ""home"" to Israel--
That simply isn't on--
We'll leave it to the Likud
And dear Ariel Sharon.
BY CONTRAST, in Ilave,
A town in south Peru, 
Protesters tore the place apart
And lynched the mayor too.
A law in California 
To give workers compensation
Had brought the state to penury
Amid much consternation.
""Don't vorry, frendz, no need to fear
The budget it vill beggar;
Ve'll halve the cost of joblessness,""
Said Arnold Schwarzenegger.
WOULD in Iraq more mayhem come in May?
Yes, shots and rockets fell, and bombs galore.
But worse than this, the world was soon to say,
Worse than the ruin and bile and gore, 
Were pictures on the screen and in the press
Of hapless prisoners held in Abu Ghraib,
Recoiling from the unslipped dogs of war, 
And humbled in their awful nakedness-- 
Yet not by those who'd ruled this jail before,
But leering GI Joe and GI Joan, his babe.
WE TOLD you so, said Muslims far and wide,
""A failure of our leaders"" was th' official phrase.
Don Rumsfeld realised he must now decide
To go, which, pondering the matter for some days,
He did. But 'twas not from the Pentagon he hastened 
But to Iraq, responsible, he said,
For matters of ""enhanced interrogation""--
He did not care for ""torture lite""--and, seemingly unchastened,
Spoke of ""abuse"", but not of resignation:
Bad apples lower down were blamed instead.
A HAPPIER tale by far from India came
Where Sonia Gandhi's Congress from behind
Emerged to form a government and claim
Lok Sabha, though the top job she declined--
A politician bashful, it appeared, 
Despite Nehruvian lineage and lore.
Manmohan Singh the premiership assumed,
A market-friendly face whom no one feared.
The BJP its sorry self had doomed, 
With ""India shining"" calls for five years more.
THE EU welcomed ten more to its ranks.
Iran was going nuclear, folk said.
The rivers in Brazil all burst their banks.
Torrential rain left floods and thousands dead
In Haiti, which was also torn by strife.
Koizumi went to North Korea to find
The children of some Japanese once captured.
Rush Limbaugh said that he'd divorce his wife.
Darfur was looking trashed and badly fractured,
But no one now could bring themselves to mind.
THE bloodshed and violence continued to mount
In the land where Saddam had once reigned.
That the Yanks could breathe easy if they yielded power
Was the hope that they all entertained.
The date had been set for the end of the month,
For the new sovereign state to be born.
The handover came, with a slight hint of shame,
On an early, unadvertised morn.
THINGS weren't going much better for Bush back at home,
The top judges said he was wrong.
Guantnamo's inmates, they forthrightly ruled,
Had had rights to appeal all along.
To make matters worse, in the eyes of the world,
Was some evidence bound to displease,
That G. Bush's own men, with a stroke of the pen,
Had said ""Torture's OK overseas.""
And then from some sages there came a report
Saying no kind of link could be found
Between Saddam Hussein and the troglodyte men
Who had razed the Twin Towers to the ground.
BUT America now for a moment would pause
To reflect on a president late. 
Old antagonists all could agree not to call
Reagan anything other than great.
IN EUROPE, meanwhile, all the big cheeses met
To say yes to a new constitution.
Though for months they'd conferred, some critics demurred 
Amid vows to resist ""revolution"".
Most voters, however, to judge by the poll
For their pan-European talking-shop,
Had preferred to stay home, with a film or a tome,
Than this grandiose plan try to stop.
THE Philippine votes were all counted at last
And Arroyo was once more in power.
But no comeback for Bill, though kid Clinton could still
Pull crowds with a vapid memoir.
AS USUAL, however, the nastiest news
Was to come from the sad Middle East:
While cameras were steadied, two men were beheaded
And the tapes to the media released.
EUROPEANS, some at least, in years divisible by four,
Start July with sporting talk not just of cycling (yes, le tour),
Of Wimbledon (yes, ""Come on, Tim""), of cricket (who's that at the crease?),
But also, quadriennally, of football (no more summer peace--
Nil-nil, foul, expletive, ""Goal!""), a ghastly contest won by--Greece!
IF THAT, however, shook the bookies, no one now expressed surprise
That a senior Senate panel went to lengths to criticise
All the spooks and spies and experts, all of those who once had said
That Iraq was stuffed with weapons fit to fill the strong with dread;
Thanks to them, the panel noted, all the world had been misled.
IN BRITAIN, too, there was tut-tutting, as Lord Butler now laid bare
All the fibs and fabrications in the desperate drive to scare. 
MI6 had bungled badly, God knows how it made its claim
About those horrid, beastly weapons--golly, what a rotten shame!
Still, since the mess was all collective, no one really was to blame.
THAT'S the way New Labour likes it, so it seems, at any rate:
No one fails and all have prizes; simply blame the fourth estate.
Don't let's mention missing weapons, don't be cross, it's quite unfair.
All who acted acted nobly, good intentions everywhere.
Politicians don't say sorry, not Geoff Hoon or Tony Blair.
OTHER leaders had their problems, Europe's struggled to recruit
A chap to run the new commission, not, they hoped, a boring suit.
But half the names were controversial, and half again seemed pretty so-so,
Until they found a man at last, not at all malodoroso,
A Portuguese would fit the bill: Jose Manuel Duro Barroso.
FAR and wide, as voters voted, ruling parties took a hit.
In Canada the Liberals smarted, won but also lost a bit.
The Japanese were likewise vengeful, gave the government some knocks;
Mexico did something similar, taking aim at Mr Fox,
And his missus, so it seemed--all ambitions, airs and frocks.
AT THE HAGUE the World Court uttered, Israel's wall would never do;
We'll build on,"" th' Israelis answered, ""What's it got to do with you?""
Michael Moore was grossing millions, Kerry picked his running-mate.
Uncle Sam restored relations with a former terror state--
Libya was back in favour, Iran was now the place to hate.
FAR away, in Venezuela, 
August saw bold Chvez cheer.
Faces in the West turned paler,
As the poll results grew clear:
Six in ten had backed the colonel,
This would have results external,
For the price of oil was dear.
IN IRAQ the wells were pumping,
But the place was still at war;
In Najaf the joint was jumping,
Chaos reigned as ne'er before,
Till an aged ayatollah,
Who had long been hard to collar,
Sealed a deal to fight no more.
AT HIS trial for war-crimes vile,
Slobodan Milosevic
Was too ill, despite denial,
To conduct his legal pitch.
So two lawyers were appointed--
Perhaps their minds were double-jointed--
To defend the Serb's last ditch.
ANWAR IBRAHIM, a plucky
Prisoner in a Malay jail,
Six years on at last got lucky--
No one even asked for bail.
No such luck for Master Thatcher,
Nabbed inside his Cape Town dacha;
Protests were to no avail.
IN NEW YORK th' United Nations
Told the bloodstained Sudanese
Time was running out for patience:
Would they stop the killing, please?
But veto-wielding Mr Putin
Didn't want the UN boot in,
So Sudan would feel no squeeze.
WINDS swept through the Caribbean,
Olympic athletes strove in hope.
Only efforts Herculean
Could make Afghans give up dope.
Rebels flocked to Katmandu,
Chechens bombed a plane or two;
Could the Russians ever cope?
SEPTEMBER was here, and the winds now blew strong;
The trail of destruction grew horribly long.
East-coast America, Haiti and Cuba
Jamaica, Grenada and once-Dutch Aruba
Were hammered and battered by night and by day,
Their houses were flattened, if not blown away.
IN AFRICA, too, the disasters descended,
As locusts came down it seemed God was offended.
But the worst blows of all, as so often the case,
Were the blows meted out by our own human race.
And of these there were few that could ever compare
With the slaughter that opened the Russian school year.
THREE hundred children, perhaps many more,
When the classrooms were stormed were found dead on the floor.
Chechen guerrillas were plainly to blame,
But many thought Russia shared some of the shame
For badly mishandling the siege of a school
And repressing the Chechens who wanted home rule.
FOR benighted Iraqis things also were bad,
Bombs killed 30 children in central Baghdad.
The place will be peaceful, said Iyad Allawi,
But the script was now written by one al-Zarqawi,
A man often said by the pressmen embedded
To preside over hostages being beheaded.
SHARON'S plan for Gaza now looked like a starter,
A bomb killed eight people in central Jakarta.
In Land after Land German voters made plain
That they didn't care much for the thought of more pain;
But though plenty were ready to stick it to Schroder,
They equally hoped to put Merkel in purdah.
REFORMERS in Turkey now thought it was time
To make sex out of wedlock, if married, a crime.
The EU took umbrage and said, ""Not so fast,
If you want to join Europe this mustn't be passed.""
""OK,"" said the Turks, in the face of such flak,
And their talks for accession were put back on track.
NOW grey October galloped in apace,
Although the sun shone bright enough on some.
John Howard, down in Oz, ran quite a race
And left Mark Latham up a tree of gum.
The Afghans voted, too--it was a first--
And in a poll few thought would safely pass,
Though ballots oft were missing or dispersed,
They Karzai chose and thus escaped a farce.
The folk of Maharashtra, in their poll,
Rebuked the Hindu zealots all about;
The Indonesian voters, on the whole,
Chose cautious Yudhoyono in a rout.
But Serbs and Kosovars would still not mix,
So left their mutual province in a fix.
WHO now would speak for Europe in the world
And harmonise th' affairs of all its nations?
Barroso had his chosen list unfurled,
With faces matching all their future stations.
But one of them, named R. Buttiglione,
To parliament had aired views rather strange;
It said that they were bigoted baloney:
This member of the team he'd better change.
And so he now withdrew the whole commission.
Attention turned instead to hot-air blasts.
The Russians chose to end sins of emission,
And ratified that protocol at last.
This meant the number now reached 55--
Enough to keep Kyoto's dream alive.
GOOD news from France came when arrests were made
Of ETA leaders sought for crimes in Spain.
The word from Pitcairn left the world dismayed:
For years the island's girls had cried in vain
As male descendants of the Bounty's crew
Raped and abused them with no sense of shame.
Th' Iraqi news was sadly far less new,
Samarra was recaptured, but the name
Fallujah, fiercely resonant with awe,
Was now on every lip and trembling tongue.
The White House race towards its close did draw,
Debates were done, the final mud was slung.
With rival's records each played fast and loose;
Bush cut some taxes, Kerry shot a goose.
THE second of November and the morning of the vote,
The candidates seemed neck and neck and not inclined to gloat.
By midnight, though, it all was clear, the prize had gone to Bush,
The hammer of Saddam Hussein, Iran, the Hindu Kush.
A warrior the voters chose, a man to love and dread,
A Christian, a patriot, who'd paint the country red.
AND red indeed it looked next day: both Senate and the House,
Were redder than the day before, the Democrats would grouse.
Moreover, in 11 states the fate of marriage gay
Had fallen foul of prejudice and men like Tom DeLay,
Who'd mashed the map of Texas, despite the protests heard,
With help from one Bush liked to call the Blossom of the Turd.
THE time had come, apparently, to make the good times roll,
The cabinet was winnowed and they said goodbye to Powell.
He'd hardly dared leave Washington for fear that in a trice
Old Rummy would outsmart him, so bring on Condi Rice.
With the CIA in chaos and Bill Rehnquist looking sick,
George Bush could now prepare to cure the body politic.
THE place most sorely wounded, though, was bleeding at the seams;
'Twas time to zap Fallujah and to hell with all the screams.
Iraq was due to hold a vote within just 80 days;
The way to spread democracy was bomb and blast and blaze--
Insurgents, you'll appreciate, not plain Iraqis good.
Too bad if some poor innocents may not have understood.
THE Arab world then drew a breath to praise dead Arafat,
And wonder who might now take o'er the group that he begat.
The Dutch all froze in horror at a murder foul and wild
Of a man who'd made a movie that had many Muslims riled.
West Africans in Cote d'Ivoire were turning on the French
And torture tales of Pinochet made many a Chilean blench.
TO BATTEN down a hatred some thought was quite primordial,
Jacques Chirac came to England and thus kept the entente cordial.
A group of wise reformers tried to mend some UN fences.
A Homo hitherto unknown was named floresiensis:
She lived 12,000 years ago and stood just three feet tall,
Her teeth were worn with munching and her brain was rather small. 
AN ACID memorandum from the Red Cross came to light
Saying techniques in Guantnamo were really far from right.
And meanwhile an election rent the floundering Ukraine,
Whose streets were thronged with people, all clamouring in vain.
And down in Foggy Bottom the man so long ignored
Decided that he now had time to take a trip abroad.
IN PRE-ELECTION Britain there was war on every front;
The Lords and Commons clashed over huntsmen's right to hunt.
Pink coats were sent a-packing, the countryside was cross,
But the Commons was determined to show that it was boss.
If this was freedom's test, then the government would flunk it;
But never mind, all eyes were on the love-lorn Mr Blunkett.
AND so the year was almost out,
December had begun.
Ukraine was going down the spout:
Both Victors thought they'd won.
But then the court said, ""Vote once more,
On Boxing Day."" Was that a bore?
No, more a shaft of sun.
A VOTE took place in Mozambique.
In France old Juppe crowed:
A judge gave him the right to seek
The presidential road.
Sarkozy will be miffed, they thought,
To face this man from Chirac's court,
When Jacques puts down his load.
THE world had changed, 'twas plain to see,
And yet it was the same
For those with AIDS or HIV--
Few comforts for them came.
Five million more were virus-cursed,
And seven times that already nursed
This incubus of shame.
UP NORTH rich folk would now decry
The rising price of oil,
The dollar low or euro high,
And housing off the boil.
Third-worlders, though, were used to pain--
Another year and little gain, 
Another year of toil.
WOULD next year any better be 
Than this year gone before?
Would peace illumine January,
Or would it be more war?
Would sun shine down and flowers bloom?
Or would there be a hecatomb?
We do not know, that's sure.
FOR now we must content ourselves
With Spiderman and Shrek,
With red-nosed deer and little elves,
And hollied halls to deck.
If Father Christmas wishes well,
The world won't just yet go to hell,
Though it may look a wreck.","The world's events we here rehearse--The year that's passed is told in verse
DARK night gave way, that Jan the first,
To hopes that now the sun would burst
On where Saddam had once been king--
Tsar, caesar, lord--of everything,
And with his acolytes and thugs, 
And poison gas and listening bugs,
Had ground the poor Iraqis down,
In field and dune and marsh and town.
The realisation soon would grow
That in his place was GI Joe,
A decent, fair and honest friend
Who had no wish his life to spend
In any country but his own--
So long as freedom had been grown. 
For GI Joe had but one aim, 
To make Iraq look just the same
As any democratic reach, 
From Oregon to West Palm Beach.
AND yet Iraq was daily rent 
By shots and blasts from men who sent
Crazed bombers out to kill and maim. 
The zealous masses they'd inflame
And stir the clerics to incite 
Their congregations to invite
The ever-conquering Yanks to go, 
And never more their faces show.
MEANWHILE, over to the east, 
Two years had passed since war had ceased,
Yet here as well some hopes were rising, 
The reason was a group comprising
Delegates from far and wide, 
Tajiks, Pushtuns, side by side, 
Aimaqs, Uzbeks, crooks and warlords, 
All agreed to sheath their broadswords,
Then sat down amid the rubble 
To see if they could ease their trouble;
And from this motley institution 
Arose an Afghan constitution.
NEXT door, where grimly clerics reign, 
Weak reformists pled in vain
With a council so hardline 
Few considered it divine.
What they sought was a selection 
To contest the next election
And thus assist th' Iranian nation 
To escape its isolation.
But the steely ayatollahs, 
Caring more for power than dollars-- 
Not that they would close their palms 
To the faithful's proffered alms--
Knew that they would lose control 
If they let reform unroll. 
So no, the critics could not stand: 
Half their candidates were banned.
Guardians of the revolution 
Must resist such vile pollution;
They must brook no opposition, 
Press ahead with plans for fission,
Hone their theocratic praxis--
And languish on the evil axis.
IN OTHER parts the breaking news, 
Of wars and bombs and avian flus,
Was little better, it appeared. 
True, some Italians rose and cheered
To hear a court say Berlusconi 
Must be tried, the law was phoney
That granted him immunity 
And so conferred impunity.
And down in Georgia Saakashvili, 
Young and brave, not touchy-feely,
Took every vote, bar 4%, 
And thus became the president.
ELSEWHERE, however, much was gloom. 
Darfur heard the crack of doom,
As every kind of odious deed 
Was turned to by the janjaweed. 
Oppression reigned from Minsk to Lhasa, 
A bomber killed herself in Gaza,
And men in shades in Pakistan 
Began to question Abdul Khan,
The father of the country's bomb, 
Who'd spread his secrets far from home.
A WORLD away, in cold Des Moines, 
By caucus, poll or well spun coin,
The Democrats began to choose 
A candidate who shared their views
And might do battle, later on--
The race would be a marathon,
Involving grit and shove and push--
With George (the latest) Walker Bush.
All eyes till now had focused been 
On pull-no-punches Howard Dean,
But Dean let out a plangent yell
That sent his ratings straight to hell,
And, with the voters not so sure, 
A new face was the cynosure.
John Forbes Kerry was his name 
And by month's end he'd shot to fame, 
A veteran with gongs galore 
And stinging words about the war.
Which war was that? Vietnam, of course, 
But now once more the use of force
In this new war was looking vain-- 
The war to fell Saddam Hussein.
Could Kerry wow the party hacks, 
And plug the Democratic cracks?
Was he Viagra? Polyfilla? 
An elixir? A dragon-killer?
Or just a boring flip-flop man? 
Political temazepam?
QUITE different questions troubled Tony, 
The aegis-bearing Bush's crony,
Whose faithful loyalty to his friend 
Had brought no favours in the end
And cost him dear within his party, 
Which threatened now to give him hearty
Thanks and hustle him to quit-- 
G. Brown could make a fist of it. 
Two horrors stalked the grinning Blair, 
One a pretty small affair
Involving top-up fees for students, 
Never known for showing prudence.
The other, though, concerned Iraq, 
In truth a matter deep and dark
In which the BBC had stated 
That Tony Blair had overrated--
""Sexed up"" was in fact the term--
A spooks' report about the germ
And ultra-nasty nuclear stuff 
That S. Hussein was braced to puff
In--this was a measure of his power--
Just three-quarters of an hour.
Many Brits disliked the war, 
The spin and lying even more, 
Especially the false deduction 
That the weapons were of mass destruction.
One man who'd told the Beeb his thought--
This was the source for its report--
Had then resorted to a knife 
To cut his wrist and take his life.
Six months had passed and now was due 
An independent full review 
In which a judge would soon proclaim 
If anyone should take the blame. 
Some thought that, having heard from Hutton, 
T. Blair would be as dead as mutton.
How wrong they were: when all was stated, 
It was the Beeb the judge berated.
IN FEB, the shortest month of all,
Iraq was still in Mars's thrall.
The world watched bombs and rockets fall, 
And hopes of peace could only pall,
Notwithstanding Wolfowitz.
DARFUR now was racked by hunger,
Sri Lanka hoped for someone younger
Than its boss, Kumaratunga,
Who, 'midst cries of ""Cowabunga!""
Sacked her colleagues, causing splits.
LIKEWISE Putin purged his team, 
Vowed to mine a richer seam.
Mugabe sank in world esteem--
His special powers made critics scream.
Zimbabwe was the pits.
FRANCE said it would ban the veil,
San Francisco it would hail
Same-sex weddings, male to male.
Gays who'd hoped they would prevail
Were putting on the Ritz.
UGANDAN cultists slaughtered 80,
Things were even worse in Haiti,
Nader said that every state he 
Would contest, thus leaving baity
Democrats in fits.
THE world dismissed th' Iranian poll, 
A bomb in Arbil took its toll,
Kerry's bus began to roll,
And viewers of the Super Bowl
Saw Janet Jackson's tits.
IN EAGERNESS, it now appeared, to live up to its name,
Mad March arrived in crazy style with lots more of the same:
In Karbala, in Quetta, La Paz and Tashkent, too, 
In Gaza and Fallujah--though not in Timbuktu--
Boom followed after bang, alas, bang followed thud,
The air was full of smoke and the streets were full of blood. 
But the worst bangs of all were the ones that shattered Spain,
Three days before a vote was due to put in place again 
The team once led, the Bushies said, by that bright shining star,
The champion of ""new"" Europe's crew, Jose Mara Aznar.
When he had sent Spain's soldiers to do battle in Iraq,
He hadn't given his reasons, but kept all his thinking dark. 
E'en so, the polls predicted that his team would win again,
But the voters didn't like the way that he and all his men
Were quick to blame the bombing on Spain's home-grown ETA camp,
When all the signs suggested that it bore al-Qaeda's stamp.
And so the Spaniards brought to book George Bush's friend and hero,
By opting for Jose Luis Rodrguez Zapatero.
BY CONTRAST, for some others, the votes were trouble-free;
Malaysia and El Salvador had rulers filled with glee.
The Taiwanese returned their boss, though only by a fraction,
While the other 49% demanded satisfaction. 
John Kerry drew more comfort from a Super Tuesday win,
His rivals, though, sustained a blow and saw their ranks grow thin.
Attempted coups would make the news in Congo and Sudan,
And Turkmenbashi banned all beards in Turkmenbashistan. 
THE South Korean president found solace out of reach 
When his parliament chastised him and then voted to impeach.
For North Koreans and Cypriots the talking came to naught, 
But with Muammar Qaddafi it all proved much less fraught.
In Pakistan the Indians had a jolly spiffing tour
Showing cricket could bring friendship to old enemies next door.
Events in Venezuela, though, were doomed to end in fracas--
Too bad that cricket isn't played in soccer-mad Caracas.
Too bad, as well, for Irishmen who liked to have a drag,
That now in every workplace the signs said ""Quench that fag"".
THE father of Muqtada 
Was a better man, they said,
Yet anyone called Sadr
Filled western hearts with dread.
Old Sadr was a scholar,
With a penchant for the book,
But the son was rather different
With a very nasty look. 
He could summon up his forces
From the centre of Najaf,
Or the slums of Sadr City
Where the streets were mean and tough.
Though the Sunnis of Fallujah
Might sometimes call a truce,
Muqtada thought the Shias
Should turn Bush's rednecks puce.
And so the spring was bloody 
In this ""liberated"" land,
Where the lights were intermittent
And the wells were clogged with sand.
THOUGH things were somewhat better
In the kingdom to the south--
You could not say the people here
Were living hand to mouth--
Yet a bomb went off in Riyadh
And re-echoed clear and loud
With a message that was meant to rock
The ruling house of Saud.
IN THE land between the Jordan
And the Mediterranean Sea,
The guardian of the Jewish state
Said Gaza might be free.
He vowed to pull the settlers 
From their Earthly bit of heaven.
The borders, though, would not be those
Of 1967. 
NO MATTER, said the White House;
It's an excellent idea.
A state we'll make in Palestine
With all its exiles there.
They can't go ""home"" to Israel--
That simply isn't on--
We'll leave it to the Likud
And dear Ariel Sharon.
BY CONTRAST, in Ilave,
A town in south Peru, 
Protesters tore the place apart
And lynched the mayor too.
A law in California 
To give workers compensation
Had brought the state to penury
Amid much consternation.
""Don't vorry, frendz, no need to fear
The budget it vill beggar;
Ve'll halve the cost of joblessness,""
Said Arnold Schwarzenegger.
WOULD in Iraq more mayhem come in May?
Yes, shots and rockets fell, and bombs galore.
But worse than this, the world was soon to say,
Worse than the ruin and bile and gore, 
Were pictures on the screen and in the press
Of hapless prisoners held in Abu Ghraib,
Recoiling from the unslipped dogs of war, 
And humbled in their awful nakedness-- 
Yet not by those who'd ruled this jail before,
But leering GI Joe and GI Joan, his babe.
WE TOLD you so, said Muslims far and wide,
""A failure of our leaders"" was th' official phrase.
Don Rumsfeld realised he must now decide
To go, which, pondering the matter for some days,
He did. But 'twas not from the Pentagon he hastened 
But to Iraq, responsible, he said,
For matters of ""enhanced interrogation""--
He did not care for ""torture lite""--and, seemingly unchastened,
Spoke of ""abuse"", but not of resignation:
Bad apples lower down were blamed instead.
A HAPPIER tale by far from India came
Where Sonia Gandhi's Congress from behind
Emerged to form a government and claim
Lok Sabha, though the top job she declined--
A politician bashful, it appeared, 
Despite Nehruvian lineage and lore.
Manmohan Singh the premiership assumed,
A market-friendly face whom no one feared.
The BJP its sorry self had doomed, 
With ""India shining"" calls for five years more.
THE EU welcomed ten more to its ranks.
Iran was going nuclear, folk said.
The rivers in Brazil all burst their banks.
Torrential rain left floods and thousands dead
In Haiti, which was also torn by strife.
Koizumi went to North Korea to find
The children of some Japanese once captured.
Rush Limbaugh said that he'd divorce his wife.
Darfur was looking trashed and badly fractured,
But no one now could bring themselves to mind.
THE bloodshed and violence continued to mount
In the land where Saddam had once reigned.
That the Yanks could breathe easy if they yielded power
Was the hope that they all entertained.
The date had been set for the end of the month,
For the new sovereign state to be born.
The handover came, with a slight hint of shame,
On an early, unadvertised morn.
THINGS weren't going much better for Bush back at home,
The top judges said he was wrong.
Guantnamo's inmates, they forthrightly ruled,
Had had rights to appeal all along.
To make matters worse, in the eyes of the world,
Was some evidence bound to displease,
That G. Bush's own men, with a stroke of the pen,
Had said ""Torture's OK overseas.""
And then from some sages there came a report
Saying no kind of link could be found
Between Saddam Hussein and the troglodyte men
Who had razed the Twin Towers to the ground.
BUT America now for a moment would pause
To reflect on a president late. 
Old antagonists all could agree not to call
Reagan anything other than great.
IN EUROPE, meanwhile, all the big cheeses met
To say yes to a new constitution.
Though for months they'd conferred, some critics demurred 
Amid vows to resist ""revolution"".
Most voters, however, to judge by the poll
For their pan-European talking-shop,
Had preferred to stay home, with a film or a tome,
Than this grandiose plan try to stop.
THE Philippine votes were all counted at last
And Arroyo was once more in power.
But no comeback for Bill, though kid Clinton could still
Pull crowds with a vapid memoir.
AS USUAL, however, the nastiest news
Was to come from the sad Middle East:
While cameras were steadied, two men were beheaded
And the tapes to the media released.
EUROPEANS, some at least, in years divisible by four,
Start July with sporting talk not just of cycling (yes, le tour),
Of Wimbledon (yes, ""Come on, Tim""), of cricket (who's that at the crease?),
But also, quadriennally, of football (no more summer peace--
Nil-nil, foul, expletive, ""Goal!""), a ghastly contest won by--Greece!
IF THAT, however, shook the bookies, no one now expressed surprise
That a senior Senate panel went to lengths to criticise
All the spooks and spies and experts, all of those who once had said
That Iraq was stuffed with weapons fit to fill the strong with dread;
Thanks to them, the panel noted, all the world had been misled.
IN BRITAIN, too, there was tut-tutting, as Lord Butler now laid bare
All the fibs and fabrications in the desperate drive to scare. 
MI6 had bungled badly, God knows how it made its claim
About those horrid, beastly weapons--golly, what a rotten shame!
Still, since the mess was all collective, no one really was to blame.
THAT'S the way New Labour likes it, so it seems, at any rate:
No one fails and all have prizes; simply blame the fourth estate.
Don't let's mention missing weapons, don't be cross, it's quite unfair.
All who acted acted nobly, good intentions everywhere.
Politicians don't say sorry, not Geoff Hoon or Tony Blair.
OTHER leaders had their problems, Europe's struggled to recruit
A chap to run the new commission, not, they hoped, a boring suit.
But half the names were controversial, and half again seemed pretty so-so,
Until they found a man at last, not at all malodoroso,
A Portuguese would fit the bill: Jose Manuel Duro Barroso.
FAR and wide, as voters voted, ruling parties took a hit.
In Canada the Liberals smarted, won but also lost a bit.
The Japanese were likewise vengeful, gave the government some knocks;
Mexico did something similar, taking aim at Mr Fox,
And his missus, so it seemed--all ambitions, airs and frocks.
AT THE HAGUE the World Court uttered, Israel's wall would never do;
We'll build on,"" th' Israelis answered, ""What's it got to do with you?""
Michael Moore was grossing millions, Kerry picked his running-mate.
Uncle Sam restored relations with a former terror state--
Libya was back in favour, Iran was now the place to hate.
FAR away, in Venezuela, 
August saw bold Chvez cheer.
Faces in the West turned paler,
As the poll results grew clear:
Six in ten had backed the colonel,
This would have results external,
For the price of oil was dear.
IN IRAQ the wells were pumping,
But the place was still at war;
In Najaf the joint was jumping,
Chaos reigned as ne'er before,
Till an aged ayatollah,
Who had long been hard to collar,
Sealed a deal to fight no more.
AT HIS trial for war-crimes vile,
Slobodan Milosevic
Was too ill, despite denial,
To conduct his legal pitch.
So two lawyers were appointed--
Perhaps their minds were double-jointed--
To defend the Serb's last ditch.
ANWAR IBRAHIM, a plucky
Prisoner in a Malay jail,
Six years on at last got lucky--
No one even asked for bail.
No such luck for Master Thatcher,
Nabbed inside his Cape Town dacha;
Protests were to no avail.
IN NEW YORK th' United Nations
Told the bloodstained Sudanese
Time was running out for patience:
Would they stop the killing, please?
But veto-wielding Mr Putin
Didn't want the UN boot in,
So Sudan would feel no squeeze.
WINDS swept through the Caribbean,
Olympic athletes strove in hope.
Only efforts Herculean
Could make Afghans give up dope.
Rebels flocked to Katmandu,
Chechens bombed a plane or two;
Could the Russians ever cope?
SEPTEMBER was here, and the winds now blew strong;
The trail of destruction grew horribly long.
East-coast America, Haiti and Cuba
Jamaica, Grenada and once-Dutch Aruba
Were hammered and battered by night and by day,
Their houses were flattened, if not blown away.
IN AFRICA, too, the disasters descended,
As locusts came down it seemed God was offended.
But the worst blows of all, as so often the case,
Were the blows meted out by our own human race.
And of these there were few that could ever compare
With the slaughter that opened the Russian school year.
THREE hundred children, perhaps many more,
When the classrooms were stormed were found dead on the floor.
Chechen guerrillas were plainly to blame,
But many thought Russia shared some of the shame
For badly mishandling the siege of a school
And repressing the Chechens who wanted home rule.
FOR benighted Iraqis things also were bad,
Bombs killed 30 children in central Baghdad.
The place will be peaceful, said Iyad Allawi,
But the script was now written by one al-Zarqawi,
A man often said by the pressmen embedded
To preside over hostages being beheaded.
SHARON'S plan for Gaza now looked like a starter,
A bomb killed eight people in central Jakarta.
In Land after Land German voters made plain
That they didn't care much for the thought of more pain;
But though plenty were ready to stick it to Schroder,
They equally hoped to put Merkel in purdah.
REFORMERS in Turkey now thought it was time
To make sex out of wedlock, if married, a crime.
The EU took umbrage and said, ""Not so fast,
If you want to join Europe this mustn't be passed.""
""OK,"" said the Turks, in the face of such flak,
And their talks for accession were put back on track.
NOW grey October galloped in apace,
Although the sun shone bright enough on some.
John Howard, down in Oz, ran quite a race
And left Mark Latham up a tree of gum.
The Afghans voted, too--it was a first--
And in a poll few thought would safely pass,
Though ballots oft were missing or dispersed,
They Karzai chose and thus escaped a farce.
The folk of Maharashtra, in their poll,
Rebuked the Hindu zealots all about;
The Indonesian voters, on the whole,
Chose cautious Yudhoyono in a rout.
But Serbs and Kosovars would still not mix,
So left their mutual province in a fix.
WHO now would speak for Europe in the world
And harmonise th' affairs of all its nations?
Barroso had his chosen list unfurled,
With faces matching all their future stations.
But one of them, named R. Buttiglione,
To parliament had aired views rather strange;
It said that they were bigoted baloney:
This member of the team he'd better change.
And so he now withdrew the whole commission.
Attention turned instead to hot-air blasts.
The Russians chose to end sins of emission,
And ratified that protocol at last.
This meant the number now reached 55--
Enough to keep Kyoto's dream alive.
GOOD news from France came when arrests were made
Of ETA leaders sought for crimes in Spain.
The word from Pitcairn left the world dismayed:
For years the island's girls had cried in vain
As male descendants of the Bounty's crew
Raped and abused them with no sense of shame.
Th' Iraqi news was sadly far less new,
Samarra was recaptured, but the name
Fallujah, fiercely resonant with awe,
Was now on every lip and trembling tongue.
The White House race towards its close did draw,
Debates were done, the final mud was slung.
With rival's records each played fast and loose;
Bush cut some taxes, Kerry shot a goose.
THE second of November and the morning of the vote,
The candidates seemed neck and neck and not inclined to gloat.
By midnight, though, it all was clear, the prize had gone to Bush,
The hammer of Saddam Hussein, Iran, the Hindu Kush.
A warrior the voters chose, a man to love and dread,
A Christian, a patriot, who'd paint the country red.
AND red indeed it looked next day: both Senate and the House,
Were redder than the day before, the Democrats would grouse.
Moreover, in 11 states the fate of marriage gay
Had fallen foul of prejudice and men like Tom DeLay,
Who'd mashed the map of Texas, despite the protests heard,
With help from one Bush liked to call the Blossom of the Turd.
THE time had come, apparently, to make the good times roll,
The cabinet was winnowed and they said goodbye to Powell.
He'd hardly dared leave Washington for fear that in a trice
Old Rummy would outsmart him, so bring on Condi Rice.
With the CIA in chaos and Bill Rehnquist looking sick,
George Bush could now prepare to cure the body politic.
THE place most sorely wounded, though, was bleeding at the seams;
'Twas time to zap Fallujah and to hell with all the screams.
Iraq was due to hold a vote within just 80 days;
The way to spread democracy was bomb and blast and blaze--
Insurgents, you'll appreciate, not plain Iraqis good.
Too bad if some poor innocents may not have understood.
THE Arab world then drew a breath to praise dead Arafat,
And wonder who might now take o'er the group that he begat.
The Dutch all froze in horror at a murder foul and wild
Of a man who'd made a movie that had many Muslims riled.
West Africans in Cote d'Ivoire were turning on the French
And torture tales of Pinochet made many a Chilean blench.
TO BATTEN down a hatred some thought was quite primordial,
Jacques Chirac came to England and thus kept the entente cordial.
A group of wise reformers tried to mend some UN fences.
A Homo hitherto unknown was named floresiensis:
She lived 12,000 years ago and stood just three feet tall,
Her teeth were worn with munching and her brain was rather small. 
AN ACID memorandum from the Red Cross came to light
Saying techniques in Guantnamo were really far from right.
And meanwhile an election rent the floundering Ukraine,
Whose streets were thronged with people, all clamouring in vain.
And down in Foggy Bottom the man so long ignored
Decided that he now had time to take a trip abroad.
IN PRE-ELECTION Britain there was war on every front;
The Lords and Commons clashed over huntsmen's right to hunt.
Pink coats were sent a-packing, the countryside was cross,
But the Commons was determined to show that it was boss.
If this was freedom's test, then the government would flunk it;
But never mind, all eyes were on the love-lorn Mr Blunkett.
AND so the year was almost out,
December had begun.
Ukraine was going down the spout:
Both Victors thought they'd won.
But then the court said, ""Vote once more,
On Boxing Day."" Was that a bore?
No, more a shaft of sun.
A VOTE took place in Mozambique.
In France old Juppe crowed:

A MACABRE cock-up or a calculated insult? Japan's discovery that two sets of remains handed over by North Korean officials were not, as claimed, those of Megumi Yokota and Kaoru Matsuki, two of 13 Japanese citizens that North Korea's boss, Kim Jong Il, has admitted were abducted in the 1970s and 1980s, says a lot about Mr Kim's brutal regime. But what, exactly? And will the public fury in Japan now put paid to a tentative opening with North Korea that has taken Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, on two controversial trips to the capital, Pyongyang?
Mr Kim knows well Japan's sensitivity over the abductees. His readiness to apologise publicly for their kidnapping brought Mr Koizumi to North Korea for a first visit in 2002. Five of the abductees were brought back to Japan. But efforts to prise more information out of the North about eight others who Mr Kim said had died (plus two others not on his list) were getting nowhere. So in May, Mr Koizumi visited Mr Kim a second time. The price for further and better particulars turned out to be 250,000 tonnes of food aid and $10m-worth of medical supplies. Half the food and about a third of the medical aid has yet to be disbursed and is now frozen. Japan's parliament is demanding sanctions.
Why provoke Japan like this? North Korea is notorious in its disregard for human life: perhaps 2m died of famine and related diseases in the 1990s (out of a population of some 22m), and up to 200,000 political prisoners and their families are confined in harsh labour camps. Against such a background, lack of any concern about the remains of the abductees would not be surprising: one of the two sets turned out to be a mixture of ash and bone from four unknown people.
Yet North Korea did not have to hand over these remains. Japan had merely asked for more information about the circumstances of the claimed deaths. Mr Kim, reckoned to rule with an iron fist, twice promised Mr Koizumi personally the correct information: any old bones would not do. Ms Yokota's case has become a symbol. Her parents are prominent among the Japanese families of the abductees. DNA tests showed that their daughter's ""remains"" too were someone else's.
So, a calculated insult? But against whom? Mr Koizumi faced public anger in Japan after his first meeting with Mr Kim because of the enormity of the crimes owned up to. Mr Kim may have hoped the apology would end the matter. It didn't (and anyway Japan has scores of other cases it has not yet even raised with North Korea). Was Mr Kim venting his displeasure? Or were others trying to throw his diplomacy off course? There have been rumours of late of tensions within the ruling regime, including the defection of a number of generals to China. 
Mr Koizumi faces a dilemma. Japan will demand an explanation from North Korea. Depending on what answer it gets, pressure may grow for new sanctions: barring North Korean ships from port, or blocking remittances from Koreans in Japan. Having lost face, North Korea has accused Japan of a ""political plot"" and threatened to kick it out of the stalled six-party talks on the North's nuclear programmes. Sanctions, it says, would be an ""act of war"".

IF ALL politics is local, then 2005 could be a big year politically for Japan. Throughout the year, 136 elections will be held in prefectures and big cities, along with more than 400 local ones in smaller towns. Local politicians have already been gaining prominence in recent years, with independent-minded governors such as Masayasu Kitagawa in Mie, Yasuo Tanaka in Nagano and Shintaro Ishihara in Tokyo grabbing headlines and upstaging national politicians and officials. If these trends continue in 2005, that will be a good indicator of the prospects for reform.
Naturally, there are some big national issues to watch this year. Lawmakers and bureaucrats will do battle over tax increases, rising social-security costs and the post-office privatisation scheme of Junichiro Koizumi, the prime minister. All eyes will also be on the national economy, which has been slowing after an impressive rebound over the past couple of years. And with Mr Koizumi due to reach his term limit in 2006, the jockeying to succeed him will begin this year. Yet the growing competitiveness of local politics, and the increasing tendency of local leaders to start national debates, could give this year's local elections a big role in the battle to form Japan's next government.
For starters, they should allow the main opposition party, the Democratic Party of Japan, to hone its message ahead of the next general elections, due by 2007. The DPJ has gained ground over the past couple of years, ushering in real two-party competition for the first time in decades and moving within striking distance of wresting power away from the dominant Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). As a result, the DPJ has started to abandon the traditional opposition practice of backing the same candidates as the ruling party in local contests. When the LDP was the only game in town, the best opposition parties could hope for at the local level was a share of the spoils. Now, the DPJ sees those local polls as battles in a bigger war. 
The DPJ lacks strong candidates in rural areas, however, especially in conservative LDP strongholds in the south and west. One strategy that might help, says Eisuke Sakakibara--a prominent former official and now a leading Koizumi detractor--is to exploit schisms in the LDP when backing candidates, even those who become independents rather than join the DPJ fold. In Miyakonojo, a city in the southern prefecture of Miyazaki, the 35-year-old son of a senior LDP politician ran as an independent recently and won after his father fell out with the ruling party. The DPJ, says Mr Sakakibara, can find good rural candidates by exploiting such rifts.
If it can turn in more good showings this year, both in the local polls and in a handful of by-elections for seats in parliament, the DPJ might even convince the LDP's coalition partner, New Komeito, that the LDP's days are numbered. New Komeito already holds the balance of power in Japan's upper house, and if its supporters stop backing LDP candidates in the cities, the LDP could quickly lose control of the lower one. The local route has many more stops than the express, but it could be taking Japan in an interesting direction.","This year 's local elections will show how much Japan is really changing

THE timing struck some as particularly unfortunate. This week, ten years after an earthquake killed 6,433 people in Kobe, a worthy international conference there drew lessons from natural disasters in Japan and elsewhere. Meanwhile in Tokyo, a rather less worthy gathering of members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) assembled to ignore the lessons of another terrible disaster--this one man-made, and the cause of far more death and destruction. In the course of approving its policy agenda for 2005, the LDP decided that it would revise the country's basic law on education. The current draft revisions include a plan to make pupils more patriotic. Because patriotic-sounding educational ""reforms""--following the Imperial Rescript on Education in 1890--also preceded Japan's 20th-century descent into militarism, this is an inflammatory idea.
The draft revisions, which include platitudes about modern learning and better teaching, say that Japanese schools should foster a sense of aikokushin among pupils. This word could be translated as ""love of country"", but to most Japanese it has other--and liberals would say darker--connotations. Many Japanese are indeed discovering things to love about their country these days, but aikokushin, say worried liberals, implies devotion to a particular idea of Japan: as a uniquely entitled nation supported by hard-working but unquestioning citizens. And although a return to militarism and rampant chauvinism seems hugely unlikely, the LDP's latest ideological games risk antagonising Japan's neighbours and reopening deep domestic wounds.
Start with the neighbours. Junichiro Koizumi's annual visits to the Yasukuni shrine, where the souls of Japanese war criminals are enshrined along with fallen soldiers, have infuriated many Chinese, South Koreans and other Asians. The prime minister says that he will keep going there, and that neighbouring politicians should calm down. They might find this easier, however, if some Japanese history textbooks did not gloss over Japan's imperialist past. Now the LDP wants to teach patriotism as well as revisionist history.
The LDP's educational revisions could do even more damage at home. During the cold war, many left-wing teachers embraced extremist notions about Japan's government and its alliance with America, and they were fond of using war guilt as an ideological weapon in classrooms. Over the past 15 years, however, those divisions have faded from politics, and from many classrooms as well. Enacting the patriotism clause now could erase that progress and reignite the ideological wars. Many teachers are already upset with the nationalist governor of Tokyo, Shintaro Ishihara, for pushing devotion to the national flag and anthem in the capital's schools.
The proposed patriotism clause also distracts attention from the serious need for real educational reforms in Japan. The quality of teaching varies greatly. Discipline is a huge problem. Unpopular pupils stay at home for fear of being bullied, and many classrooms are unmanageable. Meanwhile, Japan is also trying to transfer more power towards local governments, while trimming its huge national deficit and debt. There is plenty to debate, especially ideas for getting teachers to perform better. Yet if it presses ahead with a controversial law, the LDP will give teachers the perfect excuse to avoid doing so.

 THE timing struck some as particularly unfortunate . This week , ten years after an earthquake killed 6,433 people in Kobe , a worthy international conference there drew lessons from natural disasters in Japan and elsewhere . Meanwhile in Tokyo , a rather less worthy gathering of members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) assembled to ignore the lessons of another terrible disaster -- this one man - made , and the cause of far more death and destruction . In the course of approving its policy agenda for 2005 , the LDP decided that it would revise the country 's basic law on education . The current draft revisions include a plan to make pupils more patriotic . Because patriotic - sounding educational "" reforms""--following the Imperial Rescript on Education in 1890 - -also preceded Japan 's 20th - century descent into militarism , this is an inflammatory idea . 
 The draft revisions , which include platitudes about modern learning and better teaching , say that Japanese schools should foster a sense of aikokushin among pupils . This word could be translated as "" love of country "" , but to most Japanese it has other -- and liberals would say darker -- connotations . Many Japanese are indeed discovering things to love about their country these days , but aikokushin , say worried liberals , implies devotion to a particular idea of Japan : as a uniquely entitled nation supported by hard - working but unquestioning citizens . And although a return to militarism and rampant chauvinism seems hugely unlikely , the LDP 's latest ideological games risk antagonising Japan 's neighbours and reopening deep domestic wounds .

2005-01-22,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224012815/fulltext/800A8A8936B34AB0PQ/58?accountid=14657,"Technology and competition are putting huge pressure on the world's postal systems
TO GET a sense of the future of postal systems around the world, look no further than a bottle of milk. Last year, TNT Mail, the packet-delivery unit of TPG, the Netherlands' national post office, began using a dairy company to carry packages to people's doorsteps. At a time when the milkman already seems a vestige of a bygone era--and the postman is struggling to avoid the same fate--this might seem an unlikely alliance. But what makes the arrangement particularly revealing is that it is not happening in the Dutch hinterland, but in Britain, where TPG and the lactose-logistics specialists, Express Dairies, are vying to compete against Royal Mail.
This is just one symptom of how the post is changing. Few industries are as inherently global (mail goes to every corner of the planet), yet at the same time as tightly national (operators are still mainly state-run monopolies). Michael Critelli, boss of Pitney Bowes, a mail-equipment maker, says, ""The big, all-in-one model works well if you believe that all the mail is about is standardised delivery of a standardised product and high volumes"" with no innovation or customisation. But the market is not like that. Pressured by new technologies and by emerging competition, what were once seamless operations that made it meaningful to talk of a postal sector have increasingly fractured into separate activities--parcels, letters, freight, specialised logistics and so on.
Established operators in rich countries are responding by trying to reshape their businesses. It is not easy. Some operators have long relied on cross-subsidies from activities such as banking to help cover other costs, particularly those of delivering letters six days a week under the aegis of a so-called universal service obligation--a national duty to collect and deliver mail for a uniform price no matter where it is posted. Others with strong monopolies have transferred profits from their protected letters franchises to battle in the more competitive parcels business. Now these complicated economic ties are being broken, sometimes by regulators, but also by competitors, which have been growing ever bolder about challenging post offices' monopoly rights. The accepted goal of most big postal systems is that the letter post should be financially self-sufficient. Increasingly, however, the postal service is being run as a profit-seeking business in which each activity must be economic in its own right.
The postal service that most people come into contact with is only a tiny fraction of the mail, package and freight-delivery operations upon which economies depend. More than 80% of letter mail is from businesses, not individuals (see chart 1 overleaf). Of that, over half is monthly bills and statements. (These are slowly moving away from the physical post towards customers' online accounts, which explains the roughly 2% annual drop in mail volumes since 2000 in many countries.) One-quarter of letter volume is junk mail which, alas, is growing.
Meanwhile, parcels and express delivery services have become more important: e-commerce could not function without them. Globalisation has placed greater emphasis on logistics and freight delivery, as companies manage complex supply chains. In short, although what happens at the high-street post office is important, it will be developments in the less visible areas of business mail and other deliveries that will ultimately shape tomorrow's postal systems. ""Ten years from now, my bet is that the 'post' as a word will disappear,"" says Isabelle Segni, a specialist in postal reform at the World Bank.
That prospect represents a challenge for governments and postal managers alike. The traditional postal operators play an important role in developed economies, representing roughly 1% of the labour force and about 1% of gross domestic product. Where the market is open to some sort of competition, the postal-services sector indirectly plays an even greater role in the economy because business customers tend to make more use of innovative services such as speciality printing, targeted direct mail, or pre-paid return labels for mail-order goods. National postal systems globally account for over $250 billion in revenue and employ 5m people, 1m fewer than in the early 1990s. In some countries, the post is also one of the biggest financial institutions: Japan's, for instance, is the world's biggest financial institution, with around $3.4 trillion in assets.
Postal operators everywhere are facing the same challenges, but they are responding differently and at different speeds. Essentially they are caught in a pincer movement. From below, new technologies are altering long-established industry standards. From above, market liberalisation is opening the way for new competitors who are free of the expensive infrastructure that shackles the incumbents.
Getting it sorted
Among the more important technological changes are advances in automated sorting equipment. Today's state-of-the-art machines can read most addresses and then place the mail in the precise order for the letter carrier to deliver door-to-door. Electronic barcodes on the mail allow operators to ""track-and-trace"" each item, to provide service guarantees of when the mail was sorted and delivered. As this type of cost-saving equipment has become available, new firms have entered postal markets. Andrew Beh of ING Financial Markets estimates that some competitors can operate at half the cost of national posts. New technology improves their work processes, and they also benefit because they lack the strong trade-union culture of incumbents. These are among the reasons why Britain's privately run Business Post Group has been able to compete effectively against Royal Mail.
But perhaps the biggest technological change has been the arrival of ""electronic substitution"". This refers to the shift of what was once sent by physical mail to other media. For instance, bulky financial prospectuses can now be posted on the internet (and downloaded and printed at the reader's expense) rather than sent by mail. Postal operators have long been used to fat profits from deliveries of monthly bills, statements, mail-order catalogues and so on. These have begun a gradual shift towards delivery by internet. And although direct marketing and e-commerce fulfilment with parcels is on the rise, it does not compensate for the drop in letter volume because, to the dismay of national operators, these are the two categories that are generally open to competition in places where the market is partially liberalised. The result is that in the very area where post offices might be able to recoup lost letter revenues--namely, parcel delivery--they face the stiffest competition. 
Alongside new technologies, postal operators must deal with political pressure to reduce financial losses and accept market liberalisation. In America, which accounts for almost half of the world's letter volume and over a quarter of its postal revenue, the post is constrained from engaging in non-core activities such as banking. Aggressive logistics companies such as UPS and Fedex have become powerful competitors in express mail, parcels and freight delivery. Indeed, the rise to global prominence of such firms is the clearest evidence of the struggle facing big operators. ""We have to make money delivering the mail,"" says Jack Potter, Postmaster General, who began his postal career as a mail clerk.
That is demanding wrenching changes, as the US Postal Service, which was in crisis before Mr Potter took the top job in 2001, tries to modernise its operations. With some success Mr Potter has overseen swingeing cost cuts and has lobbied to reduce the postal system's pension burden. He argues that it helps that the system is focused only on post, but accepts that without modernisation the government-run system risks becoming irrelevant. Political oversight is onerous: a presidential commission in 2003 called for ongoing change, including more market liberalisation.
In Japan, Junichiro Koizumi has made reforming the national postal operator a major policy goal. Last year, the prime minister unveiled a plan to privatise the post, starting in 2007 by splitting today's monolith into four distinct units: delivery, post-office branches, savings and insurance. But the government has also proposed meddling with elements of the universal service obligation. That brought opprobrium: the post office itself described the idea of reducing service in rural areas as ""degrading"".
Some of the biggest changes have been happening in Europe. By the end of this decade, if all goes as planned, there will be more than one postal operator per country, at least in the big four markets--France, Britain, the Netherlands and Germany--that account for around 70% of all mail volume in the European Union and 80% of all parcels. The national post, long the daily face of the state, will no longer be run by the government and may well be partially owned by another company or have publicly traded shares (as is already the case in the Netherlands and Germany). There will be fewer post offices, though many of the things that they offer will probably be available at alternative outlets, such as supermarkets and petrol stations. And the much-vaunted six-day mail delivery may well be reduced to five days a week.
These changes are not happening without a fight. The Postal Directive, issued by the European Commission in 1997 and updated in 2002, laid out a (non-binding) timetable for the full liberalisation of the EU's postal market. Most EU countries have modified their laws and changed the status of the national post from a government department to a corporate entity. But few have treated postal liberalisation as a priority. Nearly all have established national postal regulatory agencies, as required by the directive, but the independence of these is sometimes in doubt.
The French exception
Big countries, notably France, have fought doggedly against the commission's efforts to speed up market opening. In 2003, after bitter wrangling, the legally permissible postal monopoly in the EU on letters dropped from 350 grams to 100 grams, which opened up 11% of the letters business in the EU to competition. In 2006, the monopoly on weight is set to drop again, to 50 grams, opening up a further 7% of mail. However, roughly three-quarters of letters weigh less than 50 grams, which explains why incumbents have shed only a small share of the overall letters market.
Under the timetable set by the directive, in 2007 the EU's member countries will discuss opening their markets completely by 2009. Norway, not an EU member, plans to open its market in 2007; Sweden, Finland and Estonia already are open. But few believe that many others will be, or will want to be, ready. Of the countries undergoing liberalisation, only Germany, Britain and the Netherlands have agreed to open their markets fully before 2009.
France stands somewhat apart. La Poste says it will meet the directive's recommended 2009 date. However, analysts think it is more likely that La Poste will try to keep its domestic stranglehold for as long as it can, meanwhile entering markets abroad, as France's other utilities have done in the water and electricity sectors. The company rejects this criticism.
In fact, with the exception of Britain's Royal Mail, which has been preoccupied with domestic restructuring to reverse huge losses, Europe's big postal operators have responded to the threat of market liberalisation by seeking to expand into new businesses and new markets. Between 1998 and June 2004, they have acquired or franchised more than 120 companies, in activities as diverse as mail preparation, express-delivery, freight forwarding and intra-city unaddressed mail delivery. In some instances, the logic has been to take on greater volumes, thereby extracting better value from the sunk costs represented by existing infrastructure, such as staff, sorting equipment and delivery vehicles.
Empires of the mail
The Dutch and Germans have been both the most aggressive and the most global in their strategies. In the Netherlands, TPG acquired the express operator TNT in 1996, and expanded into freight delivery and contract logistics in Europe and Asia. In Germany, Deutsche Post embarked on the most grandiose acquisition drive, purchasing DHL, an express firm, between 1998 and 2002, among numerous other assets, mostly in Europe but also in Asia. Since postal reform began in 1990, the portion of Deutsche Post's earnings made overseas has risen from 2% to 50%.
Both companies were relatively early in their efforts to restructure their core businesses. TPG began in 1993; Deutsche Post in 1991, when it needed to integrate the postal systems inherited from formerly communist East Germany. Both operators have also floated on the stock exchange, which gave them shares that they could use as currency for their acquisitions.
By contrast, France's La Poste says it seeks to be a key European player, but not a global one, although it has acquired some companies and formed an alliance with FedEx, America's second-largest logistics firm after UPS. UPS is thought to want to enter the European market for bulk business mail, taking on the national post offices--but only after the letters market has been further opened to competition. La Poste, along with TPG and Deutsche Post, is considering buying a minority stake in Belgium's La Poste when shares are offered for sale; TPG and Deutsche Post are already vying to acquire a stake in Post Danmark when the Danish government sells 25% later this year.
The shape of domestic deregulation differs in each of the four countries, and has been an area of controversy. Germany has a tariff structure that discourages competitors from consolidating mail volumes (this is currently being challenged before competition authorities). The Netherlands allows companies to place pre-sorted mail into TPG's network and also allows, but does not mandate, discounts for large-volume customers. Britain retains the Royal Mail's monopoly on the last-mile delivery for daily mail volumes under 4,000 items (Express Dairies got its delivery licence because its volume is above the monopoly threshold). Alternatively, rivals may hand over mail to the national operator for final delivery, akin to the last-mile connection that gives new entrants access to existing telecoms infrastructure. France has not yet specified the rules for market deregulation; indeed, just this week the legislature began what will be a lengthy debate on the shape of new laws, which prompted postal workers to go on strike.
Small wonder that there have been complaints that these domestic responses amount to anti-competitive behaviour. There have been some clear infractions. Deutsche Post, for example, was fined by the European Commission in 2001 for abusing its monopoly by allowing its global parcels business to receive big subsidies from its letters franchise. It was forced to ring-fence its parcels business.
There is also a view that the large number of acquisitions made by the big operators has, ironically, caused the postal sector to become more than ever dominated by states. A report prepared for the commission last year by WIK-Consult, a consultancy, warned that there is some risk ""of 'governmentalising' the private sector instead of privatising the public sector."" 
In combination, these changes are challenging the post's identity and legacy in ways that are only just starting to become apparent. One problem is managing labour relations, for with modernisation comes big job losses. In countries that have undergone reform and liberalisation, such as Sweden, as much as 25% of postal jobs have disappeared. Ten years after its post became a corporation in 1987, New Zealand's system had reduced its staff by 40%, but the employees handled 20% more business. Moreover, the price of a letter remained constant in nominal terms, representing a big price reduction in real terms. 
Checks on the post
Also controversial are branch closures. Even before deregulatory reforms were begun, between 1998 and 2002 post-office branches were closed at an average rate of about 2.4% per year across Europe. Historically, branches have acted as the central nervous system of many communities, used to receive social security and pensions, tax forms and the like. People fight to keep their local outlets.
What is clear is that postal operators will have to continue to expand into new services. Some posts have offered certified e-mail using encryption techniques to time-stamp electronic communications, though with little success to date. This might get a boost now that there are plans for the Universal Postal Union, an international treaty organisation more than a century old that co-ordinates global postal activities, to manage a specialised internet address extension, .post. Most posts are looking at expanding direct-mail operations and selling ""hybrid mail"", whereby large mailers such as financial institutions or utilities merely provide data to the post, which takes responsibility for printing the documents and delivering them.
Some plans are more radical. This month, Britain's Royal Mail said it would start to sell telephone services to compete with BT, more than two decades after the post and telecoms were split in preparation for privatisation of the latter. America's postal service is forging new programmes such as allowing customers to book a time for a parcel delivery or pick-up and providing customers with delivery guarantees even for regular first-class mail.
Whether such efforts will succeed remains to be seen. As competition increases so will pressure on incumbent operators to become even leaner and fitter. As broadband internet and mobile phones become ever more ubiquitous, as electronic substitution grows and as demand increases for flexible deliveries and differential pricing, the justification for maintaining the universal service obligation and the monopoly that accompanies it will diminish, and it will come to be seen as an expensive anachronism. But, like other changes in the industry, and with so much employment, national prestige and other interests at stake, this may happen by slow coach rather than post haste. Politics, if nothing else, will probably see to that.","Technology and competition are putting huge pressure on the world 's postal systems

Germany has a tariff structure that discourages competitors from consolidating mail volumes ( this is currently being challenged before competition authorities ) . The Netherlands allows companies to place pre - sorted mail into TPG 's network and also allows , but does not mandate , discounts for large - volume customers . Britain retains the Royal Mail 's monopoly on the last - mile delivery for daily mail volumes under 4,000 items ( Express Dairies got its delivery licence because its volume is above the monopoly threshold ) . Alternatively , rivals may hand over mail to the national operator for final delivery , akin to the last - mile connection that gives new entrants access to existing telecoms infrastructure . France has not yet specified the rules for market deregulation ; indeed , just this week the legislature began what will be a lengthy debate on the shape of new laws , which prompted postal workers to go on strike . 
 Small wonder that there have been complaints that these domestic responses amount to anti - competitive behaviour . There have been some clear infractions . Deutsche Post , for example , was fined by the European Commission in 2001 for abusing its monopoly by allowing its global parcels business to receive big subsidies from its letters franchise . It was forced to ring - fence its parcels business . 
 There is also a view that the large number of acquisitions made by the big operators has , ironically , caused the postal sector to become more than ever dominated by states . A report prepared for the commission last year by WIK - Consult , a consultancy , warned that there is some risk "" of ' governmentalising ' the private sector instead of privatising the public sector . "" 
 In combination , these changes are challenging the post 's identity and legacy in ways that are only just starting to become apparent . One problem is managing labour relations , for with modernisation comes big job losses . In countries that have undergone reform and liberalisation , such as Sweden , as much as 25 % of postal jobs have disappeared . Ten years after its post became a corporation in 1987 , New Zealand 's system had reduced its staff by 40 % , but the employees handled 20 % more business . Moreover , the price of a letter remained constant in nominal terms , representing a big price reduction in real terms . 
 Checks on the post 
 Also controversial are branch closures . Even before deregulatory reforms were begun , between 1998 and 2002 post - office branches were closed at an average rate of about 2.4 % per year across Europe . Historically , branches have acted as the central nervous system of many communities , used to receive social security and pensions , tax forms and the like . People fight to keep their local outlets . 
 What is clear is that postal operators will have to continue to expand into new services . Some posts have offered certified e - mail using encryption techniques to time - stamp electronic communications , though with little success to date . This might get a boost now that there are plans for the Universal Postal Union , an international treaty organisation more than a century old that co - ordinates global postal activities , to manage a specialised internet address extension , .post . Most posts are looking at expanding direct - mail operations and selling "" hybrid mail "" , whereby large mailers such as financial institutions or utilities merely provide data to the post , which takes responsibility for printing the documents and delivering them . 
 Some plans are more radical . This month , Britain 's Royal Mail said it would start to sell telephone services to compete with BT , more than two decades after the post and telecoms were split in preparation for privatisation of the latter . America 's postal service is forging new programmes such as allowing customers to book a time for a parcel delivery or pick - up and providing customers with delivery guarantees even for regular first - class mail . 
 Whether such efforts will succeed remains to be seen . As competition increases so will pressure on incumbent operators to become even leaner and fitter . As broadband internet and mobile phones become ever more ubiquitous , as electronic substitution grows and as demand increases for flexible deliveries and differential pricing , the justification for maintaining the universal service obligation and the monopoly that accompanies it will diminish , and it will come to be seen as an expensive anachronism . But , like other changes in the industry , and with so much employment , national prestige and other interests at stake , this may happen by slow coach rather than post haste . Politics , if nothing else , will probably see to that .",740,Japan,A29-8209,IN TERM,True,Junichiro Koizumi,2,True

IN JAPAN, social progress often comes in baby steps. So it is fitting that a prominent decision about women's equality will involve Japan's most famous baby: three-year-old Princess Aiko. On January 25th, a ten-member government-appointed panel met for the first time to discuss whether women should be made eligible for the imperial throne. If the law is revised, Princess Aiko might one day take a very big step indeed.
Most Japanese like the idea. In a recent poll by the Yomiuri Shimbun, a big daily, 79% said that women should be allowed to take the throne. Less than 4% were opposed. In 1975, only 32% were in favour. Perhaps conservatism and sexism are fading faster in Japan than people thought. But equality is not the only factor. Popular support for female succession also reflects the way the government has sold the issue, as a step to bolster the stability of the Chrysanthemum Throne: something dear to conservatives' hearts as well.
The imperial family will not run out of male heirs for a while yet. Crown Prince Naruhito is only 44, and his brother, Prince Akishino, is five years younger. But because no males have been born since them, and existing law strips women of their royal status when they marry commoners, the imperial family could face a succession crisis one day under current law. That is why so much attention has focused on Princess Aiko, the only child of the crown prince and princess.
Many Japanese feel sympathy for Crown Princess Masako, a 41-year-old, well-educated former diplomat who has had a hard time coping with imperial life. For years after her marriage to the crown prince, single-minded officials of the Imperial Household Agency pressured her to produce a male heir. The birth of her daughter in December 2001 captivated the nation. But that happy announcement has been followed by tough times for the crown princess.
Last summer, the Imperial Household Agency acknowledged that she was being treated for anxiety and depression. A few months earlier, her husband had shocked the public by blaming unnamed people for trying ""to deny her career and personality"". Some Japanese assume that her unhappiness stems from ongoing pressure by imperial-household officials to bear a son. Making Princess Aiko eligible for the throne would remove any doubts over succession, and relieve any pressure on her mother.
The prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, has other reasons for wanting to move quickly. He has already been one of Japan's longest-serving post-war prime ministers, and the economy has turned around impressively since he took office in April 2001. But his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) imposes term limits, and his stint as its leader is due to end in September 2006. Many of the projects Mr Koizumi has pursued to cement his legacy will take much longer to reach fruition. 
Privatising the postal service, his pet project, will take more than a decade. Japan is pressing the United Nations for a permanent seat on the Security Council, but that is no overnight task. And although the LDP will propose some constitutional revisions later this year--perhaps tweaking Japan's pacifist restrictions in the process--enacting any changes will take much longer. That leaves a territorial dispute with Russia and the ""stability"" of the throne as Mr Koizumi's best bets for achieving something popular.
The panel will have much to discuss. It could, for example, choose to make men and women equal in the imperial line, thus giving priority to Princess Aiko over her uncle, Prince Akishino. Or it could opt for a system like Britain's, in which a woman can take the throne, but only if the monarch has no male issue. Hopefully, the panel's deliberations will spark some debate over the broader role of women in Japan. May Princess Aiko grow up in a country with more women as accomplished as her mother.

SOME admired its influence; others decried its interference. But there was a time when nobody doing business in Japan, or with Japan, could ignore the clout of its Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI). Over the past 15 years, however, changes in Japan's economy and political system have been transforming the ministry's role. Since 2001, when broad economic duties were added to the trade and industry bits, it has been known as METI rather than MITI. Yet that nominal expansion of its role has belied a steep depreciation of its currency, relative to the only benchmark that Japanese civil servants care about: the power to tell others what to do.
Some of that slide reflects temporary factors. Junichiro Koizumi, the prime minister, has longstanding ties to the rival finance ministry, for example; and METI's mishandling of Daiei, a failed retailer that was taken over by a state-backed agency in October, has given it a bloody nose in the press. But METI's declining image also reflects deeper changes. 
Even before Japan's bubble popped in 1990, the ministry had been losing sway. Its power was greatest during the first few post-war decades, when rapid growth and financial controls created more demand for scarce resources than the economy could supply. That allowed MITI to ration resources, and thus bend private companies to its will. The ministry had to adapt as Japan's outdated financial controls were removed, and as successful exporters such as Toyota and Sony built global businesses that were harder for MITI to control. The post-bubble collapse, however, was even harder on the ministry. The most important economic themes in the early 1990s were property prices, bank loans and spending on public works, all of them areas in which MITI was forced to be a mere bystander. 
So in the mid-1990s it tried to reinvent itself, with help from a powerful politician: Ryutaro Hashimoto, MITI's minister before he took over as prime minister in 1996. Mr Hashimoto set out to streamline policymaking, giving MITI a new co-ordination role that would let it demand closely-guarded information from other ministries. Although Mr Hashimoto resigned in 1998, MITI continued to reshape itself as Japan's deregulation ministry, in a bid to tell other ministries how their policies should change. Its officials boosted their career prospects in the process. Firms that were once under the sway of other ministries had to consider hiring retirees from MITI as well, if they wanted to gauge future policy changes and cash in. The ministry's transformation seemed complete in 2001, when the overarching ""economy"" label was added to its name.
With hindsight, however, that now looks like its high watermark. As Mr Hashimoto's political reforms evolved, METI ironically ended up losing influence. Japan's economic policy is now co-ordinated more effectively, just as Mr Hashimoto once hoped. But this is now done in the Cabinet Office--led in Mr Koizumi's case by Heizo Takenaka, a former academic--using officials who have been seconded from all over the bureaucracy. A former senior official from METI argues that Japan's freedom-of-information law, passed in 1999, has also made policy formation more entrepreneurial. Now anybody with the right skills can get information from the relevant ministries and draft a reform proposal, eroding the information advantage that the ministry gained under Mr Hashimoto.
METI is not the lead ministry in any of the big policy debates of the day. Mr Koizumi is keen to privatise the post office. Other politicians are worried about pensions and health-care finances. Taxes and local-government finances are also near the top of the agenda, now that the finance ministry has claimed victory over stagnation and is pressing ahead with its long-held goal of shrinking deficits. METI still has some talented officials. But if they want to make a difference, they must now compete in a freer market for ideas.","Economic change and political reform have weakened a dominant ministry

Japanese companies, at least, remain bullish. Their earnings over the past few years have grown impressively, with profits rising strongly in the second and third quarters of 2004, even as the government's GDP figures fell. This has helped reduce bankruptcies, which in January declined for the 25th month on the trot. Japan's big banks also look healthier, now that fewer of their borrowers are in a parlous condition.

Japan's exposure to China's economy--which surpassed America as its biggest trading partner last year--is often overstated.

IF YOU want to think that Asia's two greatest powers are edging closer to one another, you can find plenty of supporting evidence. Last year, China overtook America to become Japan's biggest trading partner. Japan has been China's biggest trading partner in three of the past four years. Trade rows, common in the 1990s as Japanese producers grew afraid of Chinese competition, have virtually disappeared. The two economies are increasingly integrated, with cheap Chinese goods delighting Japanese shoppers and sophisticated Japanese equipment humming away in Chinese factories.
Moreover, China and Japan are taking part in the effort to launch an East Asian Community, bringing together South-East Asia with themselves and South Korea. They share an interest in preventing the dollar from declining rapidly and in keeping the exchange rate between the yuan and the yen fairly stable, and are therefore the two biggest buyers of American Treasury bonds. They also take part in broader regional co-operation between central banks and finance ministries under the so-called Chiang Mai agreement. 
Until quite recently, some speculators and conspiracy theorists were even wondering whether China and Japan might in future make common cause in global affairs. Sure enough, defence ministry officials from the two countries, and even senior soldiers, have held cordial meetings with one another. Until the late 1990s, Chinese leaders often spoke admiringly of Japan as an economic model. And, most important of all, China and Japan have been willing collaborators in the American-led effort to persuade North Korea to relinquish its nuclear-weapons programme, through six-party talks (the other parties are Russia and South Korea). When Condoleezza Rice, America's secretary of state, made her Asian tour last week, she sent essentially the same message to North Korea from both Tokyo and Beijing.
Yet there has recently been a lot more evidence for the opposite view, namely that tensions are rising again between two of the 20th century's bitterest rivals. Last November, a Chinese submarine sailed into Japanese waters near its southern islands in an apparently deliberate attempt to test its detection systems, a tactic reminiscent of the Soviet navy's during the cold war. Japan, noticeably proud that its surveillance did indeed detect the sub, demanded--and got--an apology. 
Last month, Japan deliberately made its position on Taiwan less ambiguous by declaring, in a joint statement with its American ally, that Taiwan is a mutual security concern. This not only meddled in China's internal affairs, in China's view, but also took Japan a symbolic step further past its constitutional restrictions on military action. In December, Japan's National Defence Programme Outline had described China itself as a source of ""concern"" for Japan. That concern was reinforced in early March by China's own announcement of a 12.6% rise in official defence spending to almost 250 billion yuan ($30 billion), a figure believed in Japan to understate true spending by 30-50%.
With community-building under way in East Asia, presumably the two countries' leaders can keep a lid on such tensions? Not really: although many officials, right up to the level of foreign ministers, have taken part in such co-operative efforts, that is as senior as it gets. There has been no official visit to China by the Japanese prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, since October 2001, and none by the Chinese president to Japan since 1998, when Jiang Zemin went. Any top-level meetings have been brief affairs held on the margins of regional or global summits. No visits are currently being planned. It is the longest hiatus since the normalisation of diplomatic relations between China and Japan in 1972. The apparent reason: the events of 70 years ago when Japan invaded China, and Japan's unwillingness to show contrition about them in the manner demanded by China.
The list can go on. China and Japan have long argued over islands at the southern end of Japan's chain, known as the Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China. Japan has recently assumed ownership of a lighthouse built on one by a nationalist group, in order to underline its claim, while China has been sending research and test-drilling ships into what Japan claims as its exclusive economic zone, north-east of the islands, in the hope of getting a share of oil and gas deposits there or, say some Japanese politicians, to map the sea bed for Chinese submariners.
On October 25th last year a meeting was held between Chinese and Japanese officials to try to launch negotiations about those marine resources, but it was a throwback to chillier days: it lasted ten hours, consisted only of prepared statements from both sides, and ended without agreement even on a date for a further meeting. The Japanese ruling party's committee dealing with this issue is now considering a proposal that Japan should send in its own test-drilling vessel. As such a vessel would in turn have to be protected by the Japanese navy and coastguards, that would be both a signal that Japan means business and a risk that a confrontation might follow. 
The rise and rise of great powers
Should outsiders be worried about this increased scratchiness in East Asia, or comforted by the notion that economic integration will in the end restrain political hot-heads? In reality, these competing views are two sides of the same coin. As both countries have become richer, more powerful and more important as trading partners, so they have become natural rivals for primacy within their region.
China and Japan have been rivals for the best part of a millennium. For much of that time, China had the upper hand. But from the mid-19th century until the 1990s it was in decline, both economically and politically, while Japan was in the ascendant, establishing colonies in Taiwan and Korea at the turn of the 20th century and then invading China itself in the 1930s. As Japan grew into an economic giant in the 1960s and 1970s, China was economically weak and preoccupied with the mayhem of its Cultural Revolution. 
For the past three decades, since Deng Xiaoping began to convert China's economy from central planning to market-led capitalism, China has been on the up again. Trade with this rapidly growing and changing place is now ever more important to all countries, but especially to its neighbouring economic giant, Japan, and especially since Japan's stagnation in the wake of its stockmarket crash in 1990. China's rise, however, has also reinforced old worries on two scores: China's hunger for natural resources, including its territorial claims in the seas surrounding it, and its ability to modernise its armed forces, thus altering the strategic balance in the region and producing jitters in Japan.
Most of the world's existing rich countries combine a slavering ambition to profit from China's growing economy with a certain nervousness about competition from Chinese producers. Japan, at least currently, shows little of that commercial nervousness. The two economies are strikingly complementary. The Chinese manufacturers that fill Wal-Mart with their cheap goods and worry rivals in India and Mexico are too low-tech to cause much concern in Japan. That country's firms continue to dominate the higher-technology end of industries such as cars, machine tools and electronics. Kwan Chihung, an economist at the Nomura Institute for Capital Markets Research in Tokyo, has tried to work out how many of China's exports compete with Japanese output, compared with the overlap with other Asian producers. The table shows his conclusions: only a fifth of China's exports are in categories that compete with Japanese ones.
That could change in coming years, as Chinese manufacturers gain in sophistication. But China's ultra-cheap labour is likely for some time to tilt those firms towards labour-intensive processes and away from the more capital- and research-intensive ones favoured in higher-cost Japan. Meanwhile, rising demand in China, both from industry and consumers, is bringing huge benefits to Japanese firms, both in lower, metal-bashing trades and in higher-value businesses. About one-third of the growth in Japanese exports in the past two years has been accounted for by shipments to China and Hong Kong. Japanese firms' direct investment in China has grown too, reaching about $3.3 billion in the year to March 2003, though that was barely 6% of China's total inward foreign direct investment of more than $50 billion.
Yet while the two economies are complementary in terms of output, they are clearly competitors for resources. Last year China overtook Japan to become the world's second-largest importer of oil, after America. Increasingly, the countries are rivals for secure long-term supplies of oil and gas. Last year, for instance, they were at odds over whether Russia should build a new oil pipeline to China's north-east, or to its coast for shipment to Japan. That decision went Japan's way. 
The sea-bed off Asia is home to numerous disputes over the ownership of various rocks and islets, all made potent by the prospect of oil and gas being found beneath the ocean. Japan has a dispute with South Korea over an island that Japan calls Takeshima ()see page 74, and China is mixed up in quarrels with several South-East Asian countries over the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea. All are potentially serious. But the ones between Japan and China risk becoming especially fractious, for they mix greed with fear, or at least national pride: a feeling, widely held on both sides, that what is at issue may be not just a few barrels of oil, but the whole future power balance in Asia.
History's burden
Listen to scholars, pundits and officials on both sides and you get the sense that today's tense relations between Japan and China stem both from the nasty history of the 20th century and from expectations or concerns about the shape of the 21st.
Most simply, this is expressed in mistrust. In both China and Japan these days opinion towards each other is quite varied; China no longer has a single party line and the Japanese debate has always been lively. The extremes on both sides are striking, however. Gao Heng, a scholar at the usually moderate Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, claims that some members of the Japanese government want to recolonise Taiwan; to that end, he says, Taiwanese military personnel are secretly being trained in Japan. Mr Gao, it should be noted, was born in 1939 while his parents were hiding from the Japanese in tunnels.
On the other hand, your correspondent recently heard a senior Japanese businessman give a speech (off the record) at a conference in Nagoya in which he described China's territorial ambitions in East Asia, and particularly its hunger for resources, as being akin to Hitler's Lebensraum policy in the 1930s, stating that it must be resisted at all costs. Had any Chinese been present, they would no doubt have reminded him of Japan's own hunger for resources during that decade.
Such pride and suspicion can also be found in popular protest and populist politics. Last August, a Japanese victory against China in the final of the Asian soccer cup in Beijing culminated in hooliganism by young Chinese supporters in which Japanese flags were burnt and a Japanese diplomatic car was vandalised. Such protests have also occurred whenever Japan's prime minister, Mr Koizumi, has made what have become his annual visits to the Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo, which is where the souls of all Japan's 2.5m war dead since 1853 are symbolically interred, including those of 14 class-A war criminals executed in 1948 after the Tokyo war-crimes trial. A group of top Japanese businessmen pleaded with him last year to stop the visits, claiming that their sales in China were being damaged. He refused angrily, saying that Japan's war dead must be honoured. But there was another implication, too: that Japan must no longer back down in the face of Chinese pressure. Chinese computer hackers have recently disabled Mr Koizumi's website. 
China is not the only one of Japan's former colonies to protest about Mr Koizumi's visits to Yasukuni. South Korea does too, and historical memories still rankle in that country. But neither the protests nor the memories stand in the way of regular top-level summits between Japan and South Korea, as they do between Japan and China. Nor does South Korea continue to demand further and deeper apologies from the Japanese, as China does. In 1998 a visit by President Jiang Zemin to Tokyo was marred by Japan's rejection of Chinese demands for an apology that went beyond language accepted shortly beforehand by President Kim Dae-jung of South Korea. Although Japan certainly has a great deal to apologise for over the conduct of its imperial army in China in the 1930s and 1940s, its prime ministers and the emperor have made official apologies on 17 occasions since diplomatic relations with China were resumed in 1972.
A simple analogy for Japan and China in Asia is, of course, Germany and France in Europe. There has been no scene in Asia equivalent to Helmut Kohl and Francois Mitterrand holding hands at Verdun in 1984, saying ""Never again"". Nor is any such scene likely as long as the countries' leaders refuse to meet. But there has also been no officially sanctioned equivalent of the Franco-German history textbook commission that, soon after 1945, assembled scholars to try to agree on a common account of the two countries' bitter history. 
Japanese textbooks have been subject to a quarter-century of legal and official wrangles, particularly over the words used to describe the invasion of China (just an ""advance"" in some Japanese nationalists' books) and the notorious Rape of Nanjing in 1937 in which thousands, tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands (depending on the historian) of unarmed Chinese were killed by the Japanese army. But Chinese textbooks are controversial too for their stridently anti-Japanese content. The tone was heightened, the Japanese say, in the early 1990s, when the Communist Party wanted to use nationalist fervour to dissipate opposition after their own Tiananmen Square massacre of unarmed Chinese in 1989. Hence the fact that many young Chinese seem just as anti-Japanese as their parents.
Defusing the tension
Tensions between these two great powers, both fully conscious of their economic and political interests and of the weight of history, probably cannot be defused altogether for as long as the two countries' political systems remain so different, with China communist and Japan a democracy. That is also likely to put a strict limit on the East Asian Community's chances of becoming something like the European Union. Such entities require at least some willingness to share sovereignty, which China for the moment will not consider.
Tensions might be defused, though, if both governments agreed to seek ways to make history, and thus nationalism, less of a flashpoint. On the Japanese side, that really means a willingness to address two issues: the status of the Yasukuni shrine, and the question of compensation for the victims of war. On the Chinese side, it would require a willingness to sanction a joint textbook commission in which historians would be genuinely free to examine the two countries' history; a readiness to give up anti-Japanese propaganda; and a willingness to engage in serious negotiations about sea-bed rights.
A solution to the Yasukuni problem must almost certainly await a new Japanese prime minister in 2006, for Mr Koizumi has argued himself into a tight corner. He claims he must, on grounds of national honour, visit Japan's equivalent of America's Arlington National Cemetery. Yet he also claims that as Yasukuni has been, since the 1940s, a private religious institution, the government has no constitutional right to order it to change the status of the war criminals at the shrine. That is true, but it means that the solution should be to establish a genuine, government-run equivalent of Arlington or France's Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, at which prime ministers could pay homage without controversy. 
The nub of the compensation issue is Japan's official contention that all wartime claims were settled in the 1951 San Francisco peace treaty. Yet, just as Germany has in recent years reopened questions of restitution for slave labourers, so Japan is likely to find itself under continued pressure to offer more comprehensive compensation, to forced labourers and wartime sex slaves, among others. Its problem, no doubt, is not only the potential breadth of the class of claimants, but also the current absence of a counterpart in China likely to negotiate in good faith.
Japan's own internal debate about its wartime motives and conduct certainly stands in the way of progress. In its pluralistic society, there are plenty who claim that Japan did little wrong in the 20th century. That minority view, though, gains strength when combined with a larger political feeling that in the face of Chinese growth and bullying Japan needs now to stand firm. Such bullying shows no more sign of easing than does the growth. Only once China stops trying to explore how far it can go, and instead decides to seek a rapprochement with its ancient rival, is the tension likely to ease.","China and Japan are increasingly inter - linked commercially . But their age - old political animus is reviving too 
 IF YOU want to think that Asia 's two greatest powers are edging closer to one another , you can find plenty of supporting evidence . Last year , China overtook America to become Japan 's biggest trading partner . Japan has been China 's biggest trading partner in three of the past four years . Trade rows , common in the 1990s as Japanese producers grew afraid of Chinese competition , have virtually disappeared . The two economies are increasingly integrated , with cheap Chinese goods delighting Japanese shoppers and sophisticated Japanese equipment humming away in Chinese factories . 
 Moreover , China and Japan are taking part in the effort to launch an East Asian Community , bringing together South - East Asia with themselves and South Korea . They share an interest in preventing the dollar from declining rapidly and in keeping the exchange rate between the yuan and the yen fairly stable , and are therefore the two biggest buyers of American Treasury bonds . They also take part in broader regional co - operation between central banks and finance ministries under the so - called Chiang Mai agreement . 
 Until quite recently , some speculators and conspiracy theorists were even wondering whether China and Japan might in future make common cause in global affairs . Sure enough , defence ministry officials from the two countries , and even senior soldiers , have held cordial meetings with one another . Until the late 1990s , Chinese leaders often spoke admiringly of Japan as an economic model . And , most important of all , China and Japan have been willing collaborators in the American - led effort to persuade North Korea to relinquish its nuclear - weapons programme , through six - party talks ( the other parties are Russia and South Korea ) . When Condoleezza Rice , America 's secretary of state , made her Asian tour last week , she sent essentially the same message to North Korea from both Tokyo and Beijing . 
 Yet there has recently been a lot more evidence for the opposite view , namely that tensions are rising again between two of the 20th century 's bitterest rivals . Last November , a Chinese submarine sailed into Japanese waters near its southern islands in an apparently deliberate attempt to test its detection systems , a tactic reminiscent of the Soviet navy 's during the cold war . Japan , noticeably proud that its surveillance did indeed detect the sub , demanded -- and got -- an apology . 
 Last month , Japan deliberately made its position on Taiwan less ambiguous by declaring , in a joint statement with its American ally , that Taiwan is a mutual security concern . This not only meddled in China 's internal affairs , in China 's view , but also took Japan a symbolic step further past its constitutional restrictions on military action . In December , Japan 's National Defence Programme Outline had described China itself as a source of "" concern "" for Japan . That concern was reinforced in early March by China 's own announcement of a 12.6 % rise in official defence spending to almost 250 billion yuan ( $ 30 billion ) , a figure believed in Japan to understate true spending by 30 - 50 % . 
 With community - building under way in East Asia , presumably the two countries ' leaders can keep a lid on such tensions ? Not really : although many officials , right up to the level of foreign ministers , have taken part in such co - operative efforts , that is as senior as it gets . There has been no official visit to China by Junichiro Koizumi , since October 2001 , and none by the Chinese president to Japan since 1998 , when Jiang Zemin went . Any top - level meetings have been brief affairs held on the margins of regional or global summits . No visits are currently being planned . It is the longest hiatus since the normalisation of diplomatic relations between China and Japan in 1972 . The apparent reason : the events of 70 years ago when Japan invaded China , and Japan 's unwillingness to show contrition about them in the manner demanded by China . 
 The list can go on . China and Japan have long argued over islands at the southern end of Japan 's chain , known as the Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China . Japan has recently assumed ownership of a lighthouse built on one by a nationalist group , in order to underline its claim , while China has been sending research and test - drilling ships into what Japan claims as its exclusive economic zone , north - east of the islands , in the hope of getting a share of oil and gas deposits there or , say some Japanese politicians , to map the sea bed for Chinese submariners . 
 On October 25th last year a meeting was held between Chinese and Japanese officials to try to launch negotiations about those marine resources , but it was a throwback to chillier days : it lasted ten hours , consisted only of prepared statements from both sides , and ended without agreement even on a date for a further meeting . The Japanese ruling party 's committee dealing with this issue is now considering a proposal that Japan should send in its own test - drilling vessel . As such a vessel would in turn have to be protected by the Japanese navy and coastguards , that would be both a signal that Japan means business and a risk that a confrontation might follow . 
 The rise and rise of great powers 
 Should outsiders be worried about this increased scratchiness in East Asia , or comforted by the notion that economic integration will in the end restrain political hot - heads ? In reality , these competing views are two sides of the same coin . As both countries have become richer , more powerful and more important as trading partners , so they have become natural rivals for primacy within their region . 
 China and Japan have been rivals for the best part of a millennium . For much of that time , China had the upper hand . But from the mid-19th century until the 1990s it was in decline , both economically and politically , while Japan was in the ascendant , establishing colonies in Taiwan and Korea at the turn of the 20th century and then invading China itself in the 1930s . As Japan grew into an economic giant in the 1960s and 1970s , China was economically weak and preoccupied with the mayhem of its Cultural Revolution . 
 For the past three decades , since Deng Xiaoping began to convert China 's economy from central planning to market - led capitalism , China has been on the up again . Trade with this rapidly growing and changing place is now ever more important to all countries , but especially to its neighbouring economic giant , Japan , and especially since Japan 's stagnation in the wake of its stockmarket crash in 1990 . China 's rise , however , has also reinforced old worries on two scores : China 's hunger for natural resources , including its territorial claims in the seas surrounding it , and its ability to modernise its armed forces , thus altering the strategic balance in the region and producing jitters in Japan . 
 Most of the world 's existing rich countries combine a slavering ambition to profit from China 's growing economy with a certain nervousness about competition from Chinese producers . Japan , at least currently , shows little of that commercial nervousness . The two economies are strikingly complementary . The Chinese manufacturers that fill Wal - Mart with their cheap goods and worry rivals in India and Mexico are too low - tech to cause much concern in Japan . That country 's firms continue to dominate the higher - technology end of industries such as cars , machine tools and electronics . Kwan Chihung , an economist at the Nomura Institute for Capital Markets Research in Tokyo , has tried to work out how many of China 's exports compete with Japanese output , compared with the overlap with other Asian producers . The table shows his conclusions : only a fifth of China 's exports are in categories that compete with Japanese ones . 
 That could change in coming years , as Chinese manufacturers gain in sophistication . But China 's ultra - cheap labour is likely for some time to tilt those firms towards labour - intensive processes and away from the more capital- and research - intensive ones favoured in higher - cost Japan . Meanwhile , rising demand in China , both from industry and consumers , is bringing huge benefits to Japanese firms , both in lower , metal - bashing trades and in higher - value businesses . About one - third of the growth in Japanese exports in the past two years has been accounted for by shipments to China and Hong Kong . Japanese firms ' direct investment in China has grown too , reaching about $ 3.3 billion in the year to March 2003 , though that was barely 6 % of China 's total inward foreign direct investment of more than $ 50 billion .

THERE is nothing like a few rocks to excite national passions, and Asia has plenty of them. The latest lot to hit the headlines, at least in South Korea, are some volcanic islets that lie between Korea, where they are known as Tokdo, and Japan, where they are called Takeshima. A long and tedious disagreement over sovereignty erupted into open anger recently after Shimane, a Japanese prefecture, passed a bill designating February 22nd as ""Takeshima day"", to mark the date in 1905 when Japan first claimed the miserable little outcrop. 
Outraged South Koreans responded with a show of nationalistic fervour. The government fulminated that Japan's claim was tantamount to invasion, and an old woman and her son protested by cutting off their little fingers and threatening to send the severed bits to Japan's prime minister. A like-minded youth set fire to himself, as demonstrators took to the streets.
Despite four decades of ever-closer bilateral ties, and trade now worth almost $70 billion, Japan and South Korea have notoriously prickly relations. Korean resentment is fuelled by memories of Japan's brutal 35-year colonisation of the peninsula, which ended in 1945, and the enduring belief that the Japanese have failed to atone properly for their past. Many South Koreans still harbour bitter memories of being forced to adopt Japanese names and attempts to eradicate Korean culture and identity.
The roots of the conflicting claims to ownership of the islands date from this colonial period. Although the first historical references identify the islands as belonging to an ancient Korean kingdom, after Japan's annexation of the peninsula at the beginning of the 20th century they became part of its imperial territory until the end of the second world war.
Beyond wounded pride, South Korea has some economic reasons for maintaining its claim. The waters around the islands contain lots of fish, and reserves of natural gas and minerals may lie beneath them. South Korea has stationed a number of policemen on the rocks. It rejects any attempts by the Japanese side to represent the issue as a territorial dispute which requires international mediation.

Shipments of cotton trousers alone were up by 1,520% compared with the first quarter of 2004. The European Union said it was monitoring the situation.
The World Bank issued its annual report on global development finance. It warned developing countries to take further measures to insulate themselves from currency-market risks associated with America's ballooning current-account deficit. 
Growing pains
The European Commission cut back its 2005 growth forecast for the euro area to 1.6% (2.0% was forecast last October). Germany, Europe's biggest economy, weighed most heavily in the report; its GDP is now expected to grow at 0.8% this year, down from 1.6% in 2004. The European Union as a whole looks slightly better. For all 25 countries, growth is forecast at 2.0%, with the newly joined Baltic countries racing ahead: Latvia's GDP is forecast to grow by 7.2% this year.","Business

CHINA'S leaders are at last showing some disapproval of the anti-Japanese protesters who have staged large, sometimes violent, demonstrations in a dozen cities over the past three weekends. But the biggest outpouring of xenophobic unrest in China for more than six years looks likely to rumble on. If so, further damage will be done not only to China's relations with Japan, but also to its efforts to convince its neighbours that its economic rise poses no threat to their security.
A visit to China this week by Japan's foreign minister, Nobutaka Machimura, failed to produce any obvious agreement on how to end the unrest. China refused Japan's request for an apology for damage to Japanese property during the protests, even though Chinese police have done little to stop protesters from throwing stones and other projectiles at Japan's diplomatic missions. A meeting between China's president, Hu Jintao, and Junichiro Koizumi, Japan's prime minister, could take place at an Asia-Africa summit in Indonesia this week. But as Mr Hu flew to Jakarta on Wednesday, there was no official word that such a meeting had been planned.
For the first time, however, China has indicated that it wants the demonstrations to stop. On April 19th the foreign minister, Li Zhaoxing, called on citizens to ""express their feelings in a lawful and orderly way"" and not to take part in ""unapproved demonstrations or activities that may affect social stability."" By China's standards, these were mild warnings. There was neither mention of what might happen to violators, nor any threat of action against participants in the unauthorised protests that have already taken place. Other Chinese officials meanwhile continued to blame Japan for the unrest. 
China's leaders are probably uneasy, nonetheless, about the impact the protests are having on their country's image, as well as about the risk that the crowds could turn on the government if their protests are harshly suppressed. The failure of protests to materialise in Beijing last weekend, despite calls for them circulated on the internet, will have been a comfort. This followed a warning from the capital city's police that unauthorised protests would be treated as illegal. 
But a similar warning in Shanghai failed to deter tens of thousands of people from taking to the city's streets on April 16th, chanting ""Japanese pigs get out"" and ""Kill the Japanese"" as they marched on the Japanese consulate and pelted it with stones. The next day, thousands protested in several other cities, including Shenyang in the north-east, Shenzhen on the border with Hong Kong and Hong Kong itself. Nationalists have called for more protests during the coming week-long May Day holiday, especially on May 4th, the anniversary of anti-Japan protests in 1919. 
If this agitation has worried China's leaders, they have shown no inclination to address its cause by instructing the government-controlled media to present Japan's position more objectively. The protests have been inspired mainly by Japan's bid for permanent membership of the UN Security Council, and the Japanese Education Ministry's approval of school textbooks that play down Japan's atrocities in China in the 1930s and 1940s. Chinese media have failed to highlight that only a handful of schools would use the most egregious textbook and that Japan has apologised numerous times for its wartime behaviour. Mr Koizumi's ill-judged visits to the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, where some war criminals are among those honoured, have been highlighted. But there has been little mention of the tens of billions of dollars in aid Japan has given to China in the past two decades. 
The protests could have a significant impact on tourism between Japan and China during the May Day holiday, which coincides with Japan's Golden Week. For Japanese and Chinese, this is a popular time for travel. Thousands of Japanese have cancelled plans to visit China. Bookings by Chinese for trips to Japan (where the protests in China have prompted threats to Chinese diplomatic missions, but otherwise elicited a calm response) are also unusually few for the coming holiday. 
Japanese businesspeople, whose factories in China employ some 1m Chinese, worry about calls by Chinese activists for a boycott of Japanese goods. There has been no indication so far of any major boycott. But at the weekend, hundreds of Chinese workers at factories run by Taiyo Yuden, a Japanese electronic parts company, went on strike in the city of Dongguan, near Shenzhen. Though related to the anti-Japanese protests, the strike was also triggered by complaints over pay. Given that much Japanese manufacturing in China is geared towards markets outside China, such disruption arouses far greater concerns than a possible decline in Chinese demand. Tokyo's Nikkei index fell nearly 4% on April 18th to a four-month low. Although this reflected other economic factors, the protests in China played a part. 
This week a Chinese deputy foreign minister, Wu Dawei, said his country's ties with Japan were at their worst since the rivals established diplomatic relations in 1972. Another Chinese official said that what China considers Japan's meddling in the Taiwan issue was also aggravating tensions, and could be ""very dangerous"".
The Asia-Africa summit in Indonesia is intended to display friendship among Asian and African countries which took part in the Bandung Conference in Indonesia 50 years ago, leading to the non-aligned movement. But between the biggest powers attending, little love will be lost.","Protests against Japan cause official unease in China

CHINA'S well-wired nationalists have been given a choice: carry on using mobile phones and computers to organise anti-Japanese demonstrations and face the wrath of officialdom, or call a halt to the biggest protest movement of recent years.
Both the Chinese and Japanese governments are stepping up efforts to defuse the anti-Japanese unrest that has erupted in several of China's biggest cities since early April. At an Asia-Africa summit in Jakarta last week, Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, reiterated Japan's apology for its wartime behaviour. He also met China's President Hu Jintao on the sidelines of the summit, easing growing concerns that a relationship vital to East Asian stability could enter a freeze. 
Mr Hu repeated China's demands for more solid evidence of remorse (China wants an end to Mr Koizumi's visits to the Yasukuni Shrine where war criminals are among those enshrined). But the photograph on the front pages of China's state-controlled newspapers, which select such images advisedly, was of the two men shaking hands.
Most significantly, the Chinese government has begun to ratchet up pressure on the demonstrators. It has expressed particular concern about the use of mobile phones and the internet to organise unauthorised demonstrations. Most of the protesters have been students and office workers whose ability to mobilise using these tools has clearly unnerved the authorities. After Japan, their next target might, after all, be the Communist Party.
Officials now point out that merely to circulate such messages without permission is illegal. Anti-Japanese websites have dutifully removed them. The Shanghai government this week announced the arrest of more than 40 people, mostly for disorderly behaviour during anti-Japanese protests on April 16th. A newspaper run by the city's party committee said the protests were in fact not patriotic at all but part of a ""behind the scenes plot""--though it didn't explain what the plot was.
The government's tougher tactics may be working. Last weekend was the first this month in which no large anti-Japanese protests were reported (demonstrators have avoided workdays). But the most crucial test of the authorities' ability to quell the unrest will come next week. At least until the government's position began hardening, online activists had been calling for big demonstrations on workers' day, May 1st, and in particular on May 4th, the anniversary of the start of a patriotic movement protesting at concessions to Japan made at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. The police will be out in force.","Meanwhile , the government adjusts the thermostat

MANY Japanese crave more vigorous competition between the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The DPJ did well in upper-house polls last summer and in general elections the year before, but it badly needs to boost that momentum if it is to have any chance of winning the next general elections, due by 2007. So the DPJ had a lot riding on a pair of lower-house by-elections on April 24th, one in the south-western city of Fukuoka, the other in Miyagi, up north. In the event it ran dreary campaigns and lost both, giving back two seats it had won in 2003. This week, as Junichiro Koizumi celebrated his fourth anniversary as prime minister, the opposition was in a sorry state.
The Fukuoka loss was especially bad for the DPJ. It had won the seat in 2003 by beating a close ally of Mr Koizumi, Taku Yamasaki, who had been weakened by a sex scandal and by his ties to the prime minister. But the DPJ candidate, Junichiro Koga, was discovered to have lied about his education and resigned. Mr Yamasaki fought this week's by-election to win back his seat. Although he should have been beatable, he won.
The constituency is split between conservative, long-established residents who tend to back the LDP and newer flat-dwellers who live near an office district and are fed up with the ruling party. The DPJ tapped into this sentiment in 2003, and this time fielded a likeable and accomplished candidate. But his party failed to muster a compelling message or a coherent attack, and people who should have voted for it failed to turn out. This failure, in precisely the sort of mixed district the DPJ will need to win in the next general elections, shows just how far it still is from taking power.
The opposition gained ground last summer by hammering relentlessly on a couple of issues--pensions and Iraq--on which Mr Koizumi was weak, and by tying those two issues into an indictment of his character. Mr Koizumi wanted to delay any debate on long-term pension reform until after last summer's polls, but found it impossible to do so after members of parliament from both parties were found to have missed mandatory premium payments. Katsuya Okada, who took over the DPJ early last year, refused to let up, portraying Mr Koizumi as arrogant and out of touch. He stuck to this theme when Mr Koizumi told foreign leaders that he would change the details of Japan's peacekeeping deployment in Iraq, without having first consulted Japan's parliament.
Since last summer's victory, however, Mr Okada and his DPJ have lost the plot. Voters nowadays are not very keen on Mr Koizumi. They tend to dismiss his one-line slogans as empty talk. But the DPJ is not saying much either--and at least Mr Koizumi says it briskly.","Big by - election losses will weaken the opposition and slow political reform

China's vice-premier, Wu Yi, cut short a visit to Japan, which was to have included a meeting with the prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, in an effort to improve the countries' recently strained relations.

Anatoly Chubais, a liberal politician who heads the Unified Energy System, was summoned by the prosecutor-general for questioning; Vladimir Putin accused the monopoly of neglect.
A veteran Italian journalist, Oriana Fallaci, is to face trial for alleged insults to Islam in her latest book. An investigative judge ordered charges to be brought against her in view of passages in the book that speak of Islam's growing presence in Europe as a threat to the continent.
The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline was officially opened. The pipeline, which runs for 1,770km (1,010 miles) from Azerbaijan to Turkey, is one of the world's biggest construction projects and was built by a consortium led by BP. 
Pulling back from the brink
In the American Senate, a last-minute compromise to avoid the ""nuclear option"" that bans filibustering on judicial nominations was hatched by a group of 14 centrists from both parties. Some of George Bush's candidates to the federal bench will now go through. However, it is unclear whether the pact will withstand future nominations, especially to the Supreme Court. 
The House of Representatives passed a bill that loosens a ban on the federal use of human embryos in stem-cell research. Mr Bush says he will veto the legislation (his first veto) if it reaches his desk. 
The Supreme Court will hear its first abortion case for five years. Although a largely technical case (on New Hampshire's parental-notification law), court-watchers will read the runes for any change in the justices' thinking. 
Court hearings began in Washington state on the validity of last November's election for governor that handed victory to Christine Gregoire, a Democrat, who won by 129 votes. Republicans claim there were errors and fraud in the electoral rolls. 
Mesa holding on
Bolivia's president, Carlos Mesa, vowed not to resign as thousands of mainly Indian demonstrators thronged La Paz, the capital. The protestors want the nationalisation of the oil and gas industry. Two army officers faced a court martial after calling for a coup.
Cuba's communist government allowed an American-backed dissident group to hold a rare two-day meeting. Some foreigners who wanted to attend were turned away. 
In a setback for the government of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Brazil's Supreme Court authorised prosecutors to investigate claims of bank fraud by the social-security minister while the Congress set up a probe into corruption at the state-run post office. 
The hopes of Michelle Bachelet, a Socialist, of becoming Chile's next president got a boost when Soledad Alvear, her only rival for the candidacy of the ruling centre-left alliance, dropped out. Ms Bachelet will face two conservative contenders in an election due in December.
Testing the relationship
Afghanistan's president, Hamid Karzai, travelled to Washington amid controversy over abuses carried out by American soldiers in his country (including the killing of at least eight prisoners) and a leaked American report that accused him of failing to show ""strong leadership"" against soaring opium production. Mr Karzai requested powers over the 20,000 American soldiers stationed in Afghanistan; George Bush amicably refused.
China's vice-premier, Wu Yi, cut short a visit to Japan, which was to have included a meeting with the prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, in an effort to improve the countries' recently strained relations. Mrs Wu's decision was apparently a protest against remarks made by Japanese politicians in support of the Yasukuni shrine, which honours Japan's war dead, including several war criminals. 
Two bombs exploded in cinemas in Delhi, killing one person and injuring scores. India said Islamic extremists were the likely culprits.
India, which has the second- highest number of people infected with HIV, reported a dramatic slowdown in the number of new infections. First estimates showed that only 28,000 people became infected in 2004, compared with 520,000 in 2003. Some activists disputed the figures.
Give peace a chance
More than 1,000 Sunni clergy, politicians and tribal leaders who met in Baghdad said that Iraq's disaffected Sunnis should take part in peaceful politics, in particular to help write the constitution. American troops launched an offensive in the town of Haditha. 
In a message on the internet, a group close to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a Jordanian linked to al-Qaeda who is thought to have committed a series of car-bombings in Iraq, said he had been injured.
The foreign ministers of Britain, France and Germany agreed to present detailed proposals in late July to encourage Iran to give up plans for enriching uranium and making plutonium. Iran had threatened to end a voluntary freeze on these activities. 
Mostafa Moin, the most reform-minded of Iran's serious presidential contenders, was disqualified from standing by the Council of Guardians, a conservative watchdog, then apparently reinstated at the urging of the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Zimbabwe's government sought to tackle inflation, now about 130%, by arresting 9,700 street traders and smashing their stalls. President Robert Mugabe blames such traders for the decline of Zimbabwe's dollar rather than his own over-active printing press.

ANY foreigner who has lived in Japan has listened many times to the lecture about the sublime pleasures of the country's greatest crop: rice. Only a Japanese, you see, can appreciate the way that Japan's unique rice grains cling to each other just so; how ineffably beautiful they look when collected on the end of chopsticks; how the taste seems divinely created to complement Japanese cooking. And in truth, Japanese rice really is pretty good. But it is not five or six times better than foreign rice--whether grown in South-East Asia by poor farmers on cheap land, or more efficiently in America and Australia using similar short-grain strains to those planted in Japan. So the price of domestic rice in Japan is hard to justify. Only tariffs of some 500% keep it competitive.
Rice is only the most obvious reason why Japan remains ill-prepared for the freer sorts of farm trade that the World Trade Organisation (WTO) has been discussing since 2001, when the Doha round of talks began, and which the WTO hopes to agree on by next year. A few other agricultural goods--peanuts, dairy products, some beans--are also heavily protected in Japan. The government showers such crops with generous subsidies and price supports. It uses tariffs and quotas to ward off pesky imports. And to maintain the system, it nourishes the political soil with a homegrown fertiliser, a blend of raw special-interest arithmetic with public sympathy, nationalism and obfuscation. Though its trading partners protest, Japanese voters seem indifferent to the stench. 
One argument that the government likes to spread about is the notion of self-sufficiency. Domestically-produced food, which supplied nearly 80% of Japan's calorie intake in 1960, now accounts for only 40%. Although it seems obvious that Japan's best hope of fending for itself is to trade advanced goods and services for cheap imports such as food, the civil servants in its farm ministry have long used this trend to frighten the public.
Lately, however, the voices of domestic reformists have grown a bit louder, and optimistic liberals hope changes will follow. Businessmen keen to promote bilateral free-trade deals, especially in Asia, have been pressuring the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) for farm concessions that might appease trading partners. Last year they scored a small victory when Japan agreed a deal with Mexico. By allowing freer imports of Mexican pork and orange juice, Japan has gained its carmakers and other manufacturers access to a valuable North American market. But these were small steps; deals with Asian neighbours contain few farm concessions.
Even more important than lobbying by Japan's manufacturers, say some reformists, will be the accumulation of pressures within the farm sector itself. Japan is running out of farmers, only 40% of whom are under 65. Moreover, some 70% of farming households derive most of their income from non-agricultural activities. These part-timers have watched the value of their land fall dramatically since the property bubble burst over a decade ago, and have failed to make investments in their farms. Optimists say that with a growing cadre of elderly part-timers on small and unproductive plots of land, even the civil servants in the farm ministry will see that the system is unsustainable and be forced to act--if only to save the sector on which their influence depends.
Indeed, officials talk about reshaping farm policy to focus more on value and efficiency. The prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, has pointed out that China represents a potentially huge export market for high-priced Japanese farm goods. The government has also been highlighting an alternative measure of ""self-sufficiency"", one showing that 75% of Japan's consumption--by value, rather than calories--is home grown. The overall idea is that Japan should stop wasting resources on crops that are cheaply available elsewhere. ""Once they start thinking like exporters, they become like us,"" says an official from a country that has already liberalised its farm sector.
So far, however, this has amounted to little more than talk. Japan's behaviour in the Doha round of WTO farm-trade negotiations suggests it is hardly about to embrace competition. Its initial approach was to ally itself with the European Union (EU), in a naked effort to create an anti-reform axis. Although most of Japan's protection takes the form of import barriers and domestic price supports, it nevertheless argued in favour of the EU's export subsidies as well. When the EU changed its stance last summer, and agreed that reducing export subsidies should be part of any deal, the protectionist axis fell apart like a blob of cheap imported rice. Japan then hastily formed a loose alliance of anti-reform countries--including South Korea, Switzerland and Norway--known as the Group of Ten. The talks are now being driven by an informal group of five--America, Australia, Brazil, India and the EU--with Japan left out.
The farm ministry seems to be betting that the Doha talks will fail. Although it has put forward ideas for replacing price supports with direct subsidies, its plan would not much change farmers' behaviour. The key to that, as countries such as New Zealand have discovered, is to snap the link between the subsidies farmers receive and the decisions they make about what and how much to grow.

WHEN Japan's economic figures are mixed, as they were this week, it is safer to trust the depressing bits than the cheery ones. However one interprets the latest blips in output or exports, Japan's policymakers are still worryingly error-prone. Recent mis-steps by both politicians and technocrats have highlighted three of the biggest risks to recovery.
One is China, with which Japan's relations hit a new low this week. Exports to that country accounted for much of Japan's rapid growth between early 2002 and last year. Lately, however, the pace has slackened. Figures released on May 25th showed a 7.8% year-on-year increase (in yen terms) in April; but the volume of exports fell, and has been roughly flat in the past three months. And the revival of the long-dormant domestic economy, which made a decent contribution to the first quarter's surprisingly strong GDP figure, does not yet look secure.
Anti-Japanese sentiment in China, which erupted last month over history and other issues, is unlikely to help exporters. Relations were not improved last week when Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, quoted Confucius in an effort to dismiss the two countries' troubled past. China's vice-premier, Wu Yi, cancelled a meeting with Mr Koizumi on May 23rd and returned to China abruptly. Mr Koizumi's blunder and Ms Wu's snub managed to distract attention from the second threat to recovery: the Bank of Japan (BoJ). 
At the end of last week, the BoJ took the first step in what may be an early and ill-advised end to its loose monetary policy. With interest rates already zero and prices still falling, the central bank has been pumping liquidity into the financial system by keeping the balance of banks' current accounts above yen30 trillion ($280 billion). The BoJ's governor, Toshihiko Fukui, has said that it will not raise interest rates until prices have clearly stopped falling. However, the central bank has also let it be known that it wants to start closing the liquidity tap much sooner. Its first step was a subtle one. It said that from now it will allow current accounts to fall below the target temporarily when ""liquidity demand is especially weak"".
Most onlookers reckon that the central bank will let this happen a couple of times before declaring, perhaps later this year, that the high liquidity target is no longer necessary. ""The BoJ can overcome the technical problems if it wants to,"" writes Richard Jerram, an economist at Macquarie Research in Tokyo, so people ""should assume that if current-account balances fall below the target then this is due to a deliberate policy decision.""
The BoJ's hostility towards a little inflation is hard to fathom, given the damage that falling prices have done. It almost seems as if the BoJ is in a hurry to make its mistake before the finance ministry makes its own blunder, by raising taxes. This is the third threat to Japan's recovery.
Japan's public debt has risen sharply since the bubble burst in 1989: by one measure it is now over 150% of GDP, and the annual fiscal deficit is still 6.4% of GDP. So now that banks' bad loans have fallen and the economy is looking less poorly, the finance ministry has been keen to declare victory over stagnation so that it can increase consumption and other taxes.
Arguably, Japan's economy is still too weak to warrant a tightening of either fiscal or monetary policy; certainly, it would be unwise to try both. But Japan's officials perennially place the goals of their own institutions before the needs of the economy. So the markets have been watching for months, while the two sets of officials have jockeyed to be the first to tighten. Will Mr Koizumi's wise words damage exports before the bureaucrats succeed in clobbering domestic demand?","Policymakers seem determined to thwart Japan 's economic recovery

French voters decisively rejected the European Union constitution in a referendum on May 29th, by a 55-45% margin. Three days later, Dutch voters followed suit, voting no by a margin of 62-38%. Europe's political leaders said forlornly that ratification of the constitution should continue anyway, but more realistic analysts declared the constitution dead.
The French president, Jacques Chirac, reacted to his referendum defeat by sacking the prime minister, Jean-Pierre Raffarin. The new prime minister is Dominique de Villepin, a former foreign minister and Chirac acolyte. Mr Chirac also felt obliged to bring back into the government his great rival, Nicolas Sarkozy, boss of the ruling UMP party.
Angela Merkel was formally chosen as the opposition candidate to be chancellor of Germany. Ms Merkel is now the firm favourite to win the snap election sought by Chancellor Gerhard Schroder, which will probably take place in September.
After a painfully drawn-out reading of the verdict, a Russian court found Mikhail Khodorkovsky, former boss of the oil company Yukos, guilty of fraud and tax evasion and sentenced him to nine years in prison.

JUNICHIRO KOIZUMI gets to throw a baseball around and take chummy photos at George Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas.

Japan and South Korea are both close allies of the United States, but only the America-Japan alliance is running smoothly these days. Mr Bush and his pal Junichiro share a common view of North Korea. Mr Roh, by contrast, has upset both countries by consistently excusing the North's behaviour. The quarrel has exacerbated tensions between Japan and South Korea, which are also feuding--again--over history.
South Korea's public has been in an uproar since it learned of private comments by a Japanese deputy foreign minister, Shotaro Yachi. During a meeting with South Korean MPs in mid-May, Mr Yachi told them that Japan is reluctant to share American intelligence about North Korea with the South, because America does not trust South Korea as much as Japan. Whatever truth there is in the intelligence-sharing claim, Mr Yachi's point about trust was clearly on the mark, which is precisely why it enraged so many South Koreans.
Relations between the neighbouring democracies had already been strained lately by rows over history, including a renewed spat over Dokdo: a rocky set of South Korean-controlled islets that Japan claims as part of its territory (calling it Takeshima). Since earlier this year, when Shimane prefecture on Japan's west coast passed an ordinance celebrating Takeshima Day, South Koreans have been defending their right to the rocks. A pair of South Korean telecoms firms have extended mobile-phone service to Dokdo. South Korean T-shirts laying claim to the islets come in small enough sizes to fit a four-year-old.
South Korean tempers have been stoked further by Japan's latest round of government-approved history textbooks, which to varying degrees whitewash the Japanese army's practice of coercing ""comfort women"" from Korea and elsewhere into sex during the second world war.
Many Japanese have been slow to grasp the scale of South Korea's recent flare in anti-Japanese sentiment. That is partly because April's anti-Japanese riots in China dominated the news. But it is also because South Korean food, culture and entertainment have been in fashion in Japan since the two countries co-hosted the World Cup in 2002.
South Koreans feel rather differently about bilateral relations. They tell pollsters that Japan is a bigger threat to peace on their peninsula than either America or North Korea. Yoichi Funabashi, a columnist for Japan's centre-left Asahi Shimbun, points out that the well-known ""Korean Wave"" of pop culture exports means different things in different places. In Japan, it connotes images of Yong-sama, a South Korean drama star beloved by middle-aged Japanese women. But in China, it takes the form of South Korean films about history--including events as long as a century ago--that show a Japanese track record of wickedness towards its neighbours.","Dealing with North Korea has widened the rift between South Korea and Japan

LONG before he became prime minister in 2001, Junichiro Koizumi wanted to privatise Japan Post. This anti-competitive monstrosity not only delivers the mail and offers over-the-counter services in every corner of the archipelago, but also functions as a bank and insurance provider for Japanese households. It is thus sitting on yen386 trillion ($3.6 trillion) in assets, making it the world's biggest financial institution. After battling for decades as an MP, and four years as prime minister, Mr Koizumi is now close to getting a vote on a bill that will--eventually--turn it over to the private sector. The bill is still being bandied about in parliament, but most observers expect it to pass sometime this summer.
Japan Post's massive pool of misallocated savings is an important reason why the economy remains heavily influenced by the state. Privatise it and get out of the way, Mr Koizumi has long argued, and Japan will regain some of its dynamism. Unfortunately, both for Mr Koizumi and for Japan's economy, such a shift would also be a blow to the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Not only are postal workers an important voting block, but the money that Japan Post has funnelled to state-backed and politically connected businesses--such as construction--has helped to keep rural voters sweet on the LDP.
So it is no wonder that the LDP has resisted its leader's primary policy goal for so long. But in the end, Mr Koizumi and his party seem ready to do the three things that Japanese politicians do best: compromise, go slow, and place surface before substance.
Mr Koizumi has approval ratings below 50%, but he is still more popular than his own party. So one trick he has often used is to threaten a general election if the LDP rejects an important reform. Until now, this has always been a weak threat. But given how much of his reputation Mr Koizumi has staked on postal reform, many LDP members are wary of challenging him this time, especially since the opposition Democratic Party of Japan has made inroads in recent elections.
Besides, Mr Koizumi's term in office will end in September 2006. And the watered-down postal plan, which will start to take effect in April 2007, will not lead to real privatisation until 2017. Mr Koizumi will probably get his ""reform""; the LDP will hang on to the status quo.","Junichiro Koizumi may soon achieve Junichiro Koizumi's lifelong ambition -- up to a point

HIS future had looked grim, but Katsuya Okada, Japan's opposition leader, scored two big wins this week--one without even trying. First, his Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) stunned everyone on July 3rd, making huge gains in an election for Tokyo's local assembly. The DPJ sharply increased its representation, from 19 to 35 seats. Two days later, Mr Okada and the DPJ were able to gloat while the Liberal Democrats (LDP) split into warring camps over bills to privatise Japan's post office and related bank and insurance arms. Junichiro Koizumi has staked his career on this reform, but much of the prime minister's party defied him, and the bills squeaked through the lower house by only five votes. Mr Koizumi is braced for an upper-house battle; Mr Okada has fresh clout.
The Tokyo contest was the last big battle between the DPJ and the LDP before the next national election, due by 2007. And although the DPJ did not win a majority (see chart), it impressed Japan's media and gained momentum. ""The DPJ leaps ahead,"" gushed the Tokyo Shimbun, a daily newspaper, on its front page. Japanese politicians take their cues from the media, says Kunji Okue, a political analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, an investment bank, and ""if all the newspapers say it's a win, it's a win."" The question now is whether the DPJ can convert this head of steam into an actual win in the next general elections instead of settling for the media kind yet again.
Mr Okada says that the DPJ is at last ready for this next step: ""We have a common goal now,"" he claims. ""It is to take power, to become [Japan's] ruling party."" Because the LDP has ruled Japan almost continuously since 1955, such a change of power could liven up Japanese democracy and spur many reforms. A closer look at the Tokyo elections, however, suggests that the DPJ still has further to go.
To beat the LDP, the DPJ must not only do better in rural areas, which are over-represented in parliament and where the LDP is strongest, but will also need to crush it in the cities, which means finding an answer to New Komeito, the LDP's coalition partner. New Komeito, backed by a committed block of urbanite Buddhist voters, not only does well in the districts it contests--it won 23 seats in Tokyo this time, as it had in 2001--but also backs LDP candidates for other seats, which eats further into the DPJ's urban strength. This week the LDP won only five fewer seats than in 2001, even though Mr Koizumi had 80% popularity ratings back then.
Moreover, this week's good showing will probably help Mr Okada hang on to his job as party leader, which paradoxically could hold the DPJ back. Many younger MPs do not think he is the man to unite the party and choose clear themes. And even among DPJ voters, he is less popular--by 19% to 24%--than Shinzo Abe, the front-runner to succeed Mr Koizumi as LDP leader in September 2006.
Unless Mr Okada can raise his game, therefore, the DPJ may still need lots of outside help to win power. Short of another economic recession, that means some sort of collapse of the ruling coalition. New Komeito could probably swing the next election to the DPJ, if it wanted to. But its members say they will stick with the LDP for now. Or the LDP itself could disintegrate, perhaps during a leadership contest in 2006, or much sooner if Mr Koizumi loses the post office vote in the upper house this summer.
Most political watchers, however, still reckon that the coalition's upper-house members--despite holding a narrower majority than in the lower house--will find enough party discipline to pass the postal privatisation bills in August. Mr Koizumi has threatened to dissolve parliament if they do not, and the party does not want to face an election in disarray, especially against a reinvigorated DPJ. Another paradox, therefore, for Mr Okada: his victory in Tokyo may be just enough to focus the LDP's attention, and deliver Mr Koizumi his coveted postal reform.","Between Tokyo 's elections and postal reform , the opposition had a great week

THE vote looms so large that it is hard to see beyond it. By mid-August, Japan's upper house must decide whether to privatise Japan Post, which, along with delivering letters, oversees yen331 trillion ($3 trillion) in savings and life insurance accounts. Junichiro Koizumi, the prime minister, has threatened a snap election if the reform bills--which cleared parliament's lower house by only five votes earlier this month--fail in the upper chamber. Chaos could follow for his party. So onlookers expect Mr Koizumi to get his way, though a close vote is predicted. Having championed postal reform for decades, he will no doubt celebrate if he does reach the summit. On the other side of the mountain, however, lies an intimidating range of other reforms that still need tackling.
Some involve the budget. After 15 years of economic torpor, Japan's gross public debts exceed 150% of GDP. Now that the economy is on a slightly better footing, and the risk of a bank-driven downward spiral has fallen sharply, the government is keen to start tackling that debt. If it wants growth to take hold, however, Japan must do more than just fix its finances. It must also deal with all of the barriers that still impede competition and make it hard for dynamic firms to expand. 
Start with those finances. Mr Koizumi has already trimmed spending on public works, a notorious source of largesse for the ruling Liberal Democrats (LDP) and their allies in the construction industry. He has also taken some first steps towards boosting tax revenues. In 2006, income-tax cuts that were enacted in 1999 will be rolled back by half; the other half will probably be eliminated in 2007. 
Mr Koizumi has also begun dealing with pensions. A law passed last year will steadily raise national pension-fund premiums (which are split between workers and their employers), from 13.58% of pay then to 18.3% in 2017. The government has also indexed pensions payouts to a pair of crucial demographic factors: life expectancy and growth of the workforce. So seniors' pensions will fall a bit if people live longer than expected, or if there are fewer workers to support them, cushioning the effect on public finances. 
Two looming budget issues remain, however. One is sales taxes. Mr Koizumi has said these will not increase on his watch. But LDP term limits require him to step down by September 2006, and the finance ministry is itching to raise taxes soon after he is gone. The worry is that this may clobber consumption before economic expansion is assured--a hard risk to ignore, since the government made just this mistake in 1997. The expected pension premium hikes and tax rollbacks will increase taxes by an amount equivalent to nearly 1% of consumption in 2007 (see chart). The burden of new taxes will soar much higher if sales taxes are raised sharply. Yet most analysts expect consumption taxes to rise in 2007 or 2008, from a rate of 5% now to perhaps 7%.
Health-insurance reform will probably prove even more contentious. Because citizens must choose between the national system and private health insurance, the current arrangement discourages people from insuring themselves, thereby limiting market forces, stifling innovation and reducing choice. Some reformists argue that a mixed approach--which gave people an option to supplement government-funded care with private insurance--would inject more competition and modern methods into Japanese medicine, without straining government spending.
Whatever solution it chooses, the LDP will almost certainly be forced to address health care over the next couple of years, whether under Mr Koizumi or his successor. The LDP's coalition partner, New Komeito, is keen on health reform, and its support remains crucial to the LDP's chances in the next general election, due by 2007. If the LDP fails to tackle this issue, it risks driving New Komeito straight into the arms of the opposition.
Medicine is not the only area in which Japan's government distorts competition. Besides Japan Post's savings and insurance arms, for example, there are nine other big financial outfits in the public sector. These lend to a host of borrowers that the market shuns but politicians deem worthy, from farmers, to small firms, to projects in the southern prefecture of Okinawa. Mr Koizumi has reined in one of these, which handles housing loans, but the other eight are still badly in need of reform. 
Heizo Takenaka, the cabinet minister who has co-ordinated most of Mr Koizumi's economic reforms, also wants to trim the state by subjecting more government projects to a ""market test"". Private firms will soon be allowed to bid for a chance to take over some government services, he says. This will not work, however, unless bidders have lots of information about government; so the prime minister's office must show civil servants that it is willing to crack the whip.
That is a big agenda to be getting on with. And it does not include a host of other needed measures to boost competition, such as: detecting and punishing collusion, preventing former civil servants from abusing their public ties when they retire, encouraging foreign investment and promoting economic diversity in Japan's regions. Mr Koizumi will hardly be able to make a dent on these while in office. Before he can even begin, though, he needs to win that upper-house vote.","After privatising the post office and its related bank , which reforms should Japan attempt next ?

This could yet embolden enough LDP dissidents to vote against Mr Koizumi's signature project. The prime minister has indeed been twisting arms to get his way on Japan Post. He has threatened to call a snap election if the bills fail, which could cost the LDP its grip on power. His government sacked four members of parliament from their sub-cabinet posts for voting against the bills in the lower house. And the LDP's ethics committee has demanded written explanations from the 51 party members who dared to defy Mr Koizumi in that lower house vote. However, recent polls have shown that many voters dislike these tactics--even though all of them would be pretty standard fare in most other parliamentary democracies--and Mr Koizumi's support ratings have fallen accordingly.
So by claiming to be a group of underdogs who disdain conformity, the LDP's anti-privatisation wing is making clever use of political judo. But it is also being dishonest. For much of the past half century, the LDP has dominated the political landscape--with the not inconsiderable help of Japan Post's vast assets and political influence--while efficiently stifling public dissent from its wayward members. The LDP's old guard never displayed the slightest qualm about demanding party loyalty until Mr Koizumi, a market-oriented reformist with dangerous (to them) ideas, managed to get his hands on the levers of the LDP machinery.
Just ask Taro Kono. A year before Mr Koizumi took office, the young lawmaker ran into trouble on parliament's commerce committee because he opposed plans to recycle nuclear fuel. Mr Kono never even got a chance to register dissent. When he would not promise in advance to sit quietly without asking questions, his LDP elders simply booted him off the committee. 
By contrast, the Japan Post bills have turned the LDP into a lively forum for clear public debate. Yes, the vote could be close, the battle could get messier and defeat for Mr Koizumi could bring chaos. But Japan, after all, teaches one to spot beauty in unexpected places. Although it can hardly match the cherry blossoms in spring, a genuine fight over a real reform is still a sight to behold.","The hidden beauty in a heated battle

NO WONDER so many Japanese politicians are against privatising mammoth Japan Post. With yen331 trillion ($2.9 trillion) in savings deposits and life-insurance assets, the country's ""post office"" has long allowed politicians to raise funds for favoured projects while hiding the true costs from taxpayers. To break this habit, Junichiro Koizumi, the prime minister, is risking his government on a drive to get a privatisation bill through parliament's upper house by mid-August. 
As exhausting and nerve-racking as that effort has been, however, it is only one step towards unwinding Japan's pervasive system of financial socialism. There are nine other government financial institutions (GFIs), which lend to a wide range of special interests. These GFIs are sitting on yen144 trillion of outstanding loans, and efforts to reform them have barely begun. 
Heizo Takenaka, who has held several cabinet posts in Mr Koizumi's government and oversees most of his economic reforms, says that one of his next big jobs will be to tackle these state-backed lenders. The government has already made progress with one of them, the Government Housing Loan Corporation (GHLC), which once provided Japanese homeowners with cheap mortgages. In 2001 the government ordered it to stop making new home loans and to start securitising ones that were already outstanding. Over the past four years, the GHLC's loans have fallen from yen77 trillion to yen52 trillion. Private banks have increased their mortgage lending by roughly the same amount, so it seems clear that the state-backed lender had been crowding them out before. 
That is also a problem with Japan's other eight GFIs. The tentacles of this financial octopus reach into every corner of economic life. Three of them compete to give cheap financing to millions of small companies. Another, the Development Bank of Japan, finances projects from urban railways to high-tech, and has involved itself in questionable bail-outs of badly-run companies. One GFI lends to municipal governments, utilities and other local projects; yet another to farmer-friendly causes; and the island prefecture of Okinawa, at the south-western end of Japan, has a special GFI of its own.
With Japan's private banks struggling to boost profitability, the last thing they need is a collection of big government lenders--backed by explicit and implicit subsidies--depressing lending rates and competing with them for business. And although, unlike the GHLC, Japan's other eight GFIs are also serving some borrowers which no private bank would touch, much of that subsidised lending is arguably holding back economic growth, by channelling resources to inefficient firms with poor prospects.
Consider Japan's small companies. Throwing good money after bad might have made some sense in the late 1990s, as credit was getting tight and turning off the tap could have hurt the economy. Now Japan has the opposite problem. Its big banks are better capitalised and keen to lend. There are too many banking assets chasing too few borrowers, so corporate lending remains woefully unprofitable. 
Moreover, a growing body of evidence suggests that propping up Japan's weakest firms has made it harder for healthier companies to hold down costs and boost revenues. If the government wants to provide a safety net for the millions of workers employed in small firms, it would do better to focus directly on the workers themselves.
Some of the GFIs' functions are worth keeping. The Japan Bank for International Co-operation (JBIC), for example, helps the government to administer its overseas aid, which most reckon is a useful role. But some of even JBIC's functions, such as export financing, might be usefully spun off. 
Investors' knuckles will no doubt clench whiter over the next couple of weeks, as the vote on Japan Post approaches. But when it is done, either Mr Koizumi or his successor will have still more work to do.","Japan Post is only one state - owned financial outfit that needs reform

THERE are times when following Japan's economy is much like a five-hour traditional tea ceremony. Most of what happens is carefully choreographed; many of the details seem pointless; and although the experience can be enriching, it demands lots of patience. This, though, is not one of those times. 
Output is rising. A tighter jobs market is raising hopes that, this time, the recovery could last. A showdown in parliament, expected early next week over a genuinely crucial decision--whether to privatise Japan Post and its huge savings and insurance assets--has even seasoned Japan hands biting their nails. Although all of this could end in disappointment, it is hardly the usual dull routine.
One reason is jobs. The unemployment rate, which peaked at 5.5% in early 2003, fell to 4.2% in June, down from 4.4% in April and May (see chart on next page). That is the lowest jobless rate in seven years, though still well above Japan's historical rate. A more closely watched sign of labour demand has also improved steadily: in June there were 96 real job offers for every 100 applicants, the highest ratio since 1992. 
The mix is also encouraging. On August 1st the government announced that permanent employment grew by 1% in June. Following milder gains in the first five months of the year, this confirms that hiring patterns are starting to change. In 2003 and 2004, firms were still replacing permanent workers with part-timers and temporary staff, even as the overall jobless rate was falling. Now that more secure jobs are also on offer, confidence could get the boost it has needed.
If that leads consistently to more consumer spending, it will carry the recovery into a new and more reliable phase. Growing exports and business investment helped start the current recovery, but they cannot keep it going on their own. So far, although wages and spending have risen of late, they have not done so as clearly as the job gains, which naturally tend to come first. The only exciting retail trend this summer has been a boost in sales of men's casual clothing, as salarymen have been told to beat the heat by wearing ""cool biz"" fashions in the workplace. 
Confidence will also get a boost whenever property prices finally turn. In Tokyo, at least, that appears to be happening. Land prices in the capital rose for the first time in 13 years, according to figures released on August 1st. Other big cities, such as Osaka and Nagoya, also show signs of nearing the bottom. 
As Japan has shown before, there is many a slip 'twixt cup and lip. Better job and property markets merely hint that consumers could become more confident before long, not that they already are. But Toshihiko Fukui, the central bank governor, is upbeat. He told parliament this week that consumer prices could at last stop falling by late this year or early next. He also reassured investors that the central bank will not forestall a recovery by tightening monetary policy too soon.
At the moment, a more unsettling policy risk is the battle over Japan Post's privatisation, on which the upper house was planning to vote on August 8th. The prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, hopes that privatisation will free up Japan Post's yen331 trillion ($3 trillion) in financial assets. That is a long-term issue, but the outcome of the vote matters now because a defeat might damage or even bring down Mr Koizumi's government, and bring much political uncertainty. Political risk, after all, has never been investors' cup of tea.","Can consumers give the economy the extra push it needs ?

KABUKI plays, at least to the untutored and no doubt philistine eye, seem mostly to have the same plot: a socially impossible relationship that ends with a double love suicide. The four years during which Junichiro Koizumi has been Japan's prime minister have followed a similar pattern. For a fairly market-friendly reformer to have led the conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) which has ruled Japan for all but ten months of the past 50 years, which built its power on big government and which bears much of the blame for the economic mess Japan has been in since 1990, was always a rather improbable affair. Accordingly, it has been accompanied by bouts of wailing and leaping through the air, as well as by magical machinations behind the scenes. On August 8th, however, when he lost a crucial vote in the parliament's upper house, Mr Koizumi decided to jump to the final act by calling a general election for the main, lower house on September 11th, two years ahead of schedule (see page 45). But in his play there is a twist: his is a double hate suicide.
It may not in fact turn out as a double suicide, but that is certainly what Mr Koizumi is risking. By challenging the old guard in his party and by ejecting the 37 LDP parliamentarians who voted in the lower house against his flagship scheme, the privatisation of Japan Post, setting the stage for its upper house defeat, he is deliberately splitting his own party and thereby risks losing power to the main opposition, the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ). By threatening dissolution if he did not get his postal bills through, Mr Koizumi must have thought that his LDP opponents would back down for fear of bringing on their own demise. But they didn't. In Japanese politics, as opposed to Kabuki, this is a rare and unfamiliar drama. Yet it is extremely welcome.
Let reform be the winner
It is possible that Mr Koizumi will win a remarkable victory in the election and lead a new phase of reform himself, at the head of a purged LDP. But even if this double hate suicide does end up being fatal both for him and the LDP, the outcome is likely still to be a good one for Japan and much to Mr Koizumi's credit. For the debate between him and the alternative government, the DPJ, is no longer about whether to reform Japan in a more market-friendly direction but how. Even if the DPJ wins, Mr Koizumi will have succeeded in injecting reform right into the bloodstream of Japanese politics.
He has had a frustrating time trying to do so, and those who sympathise with his goals--which includes The Economist--have often found his prime ministership frustrating too. The Japan he took up the leadership of in 2001 had lain in the doldrums for 11 years, never having had the crisis that might have forced it into reform, but also never achieving a gradual, consistent, consensual reform either, thanks to the power of special-interest groups to obstruct change. Banks were burdened with a huge pile of dud loans, the public-sector deficit was nearing 8% of GDP, companies had too much production capacity and prices were falling in a debilitating deflation. Yet the very solution that had been adopted for Japan's macroeconomic problem after its stock- and property markets crashed in 1990, a big expansion of public-works spending, ended up making reform harder. It provided a luscious flow of cash for LDP politicians to use to buy votes and to enrich their supporters, especially in the construction industry, and gave the bureaucracy even more power to direct the economy, not less.
Faced with this situation, Mr Koizumi was very much the man for the moment. For decades, he had been obsessed with breaking up or privatising Japan's postal system, which sounds a strange obsession but actually lies at the heart of the country's financial and political distortions. For delivering mail is the least of what it does: it is also the world's biggest bank by some measures, with deposits and life-insurance policies worth some yen331 trillion ($3 trillion). These are offered to the public at subsidised rates, thus undercutting commercial banks and insurers, and then shovelled to the government to finance a vast ""second budget"" of subsidised loans and public-works schemes. If you could break that up, and with it the corrupt system of allocating public money for building bridges and roads, you could really set Japan on a better course.
But he couldn't. The opposition from his own party, from the construction industry and postal workers, and from much of the bureaucracy, seemed too great. His effort to break up and privatise the road-building agency, the Japan Public Highway Corporation, had to be heavily watered down. Finally, four years later, he tried to break the postal system into four companies and privatise them, albeit in a slow process due to last until 2017. And this week he failed.
Yet, though Mr Koizumi's few big, headline-grabbing efforts have foundered, leading him to this gamble, he has actually achieved quite a lot in quieter ways. He turned the country's bank regulator from a patsy of the banks (another interest group) into something more powerful and independent. He slashed the flow of money in public works: public investment has fallen from 8% of GDP in the 1990s to 5% now. So although the structure hasn't yet changed, the financial parameters have. And he has strengthened the role and powers of the prime minister, both within government and within his party, making it easier in future for reform to be directed from the centre. Meanwhile, time, corporate restructuring and exports to China have been great healers for the economy, putting the country into stronger shape to accept reform too. All that is without even mentioning his changes to foreign policy, sending troops to Iraq and generally being more assertive.
If Mr Koizumi can win an electoral endorsement for the shrinking of government and the liberalisation of the economy, then that will be all to the good. But if the public decides instead that the LDP as a whole deserves to be kicked out at last, then the DPJ too shows every sign of favouring liberalisation--despite its tactical opposition to the postal bills. It is more tragedy than comedy that it has taken so long for Japan's politics and economic policies to get shaken up. But now there is every prospect of a heart-warming ending.","It deserves , for Japan 's sake , to be rewarded 
 KABUKI plays , at least to the untutored and no doubt philistine eye , seem mostly to have the same plot : a socially impossible relationship that ends with a double love suicide . The four years during which Junichiro Koizumi has been Japan 's prime minister have followed a similar pattern . For a fairly market - friendly reformer to have led the conservative Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) which has ruled Japan for all but ten months of the past 50 years , which built its power on big government and which bears much of the blame for the economic mess Japan has been in since 1990 , was always a rather improbable affair . Accordingly , it has been accompanied by bouts of wailing and leaping through the air , as well as by magical machinations behind the scenes . On August 8th , however , when Junichiro Koizumi lost a crucial vote in the parliament 's upper house , Junichiro Koizumi decided to jump to the final act by calling a general election for the main , lower house on September 11th , two years ahead of schedule ( see page 45 ) . But in Junichiro Koizumi's play there is a twist : Junichiro Koizumi's is a double hate suicide . 
 It may not in fact turn out as a double suicide , but that is certainly what Junichiro Koizumi is risking . By challenging the old guard in Junichiro Koizumi's party and by ejecting the 37 LDP parliamentarians who voted in the lower house against Junichiro Koizumi's flagship scheme , the privatisation of Japan Post , setting the stage for its upper house defeat , Junichiro Koizumi is deliberately splitting Junichiro Koizumi's own party and thereby risks losing power to the main opposition , the Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) . By threatening dissolution if Junichiro Koizumi did not get Junichiro Koizumi's postal bills through , Junichiro Koizumi must have thought that Junichiro Koizumi's LDP opponents would back down for fear of bringing on their own demise . But they did n't . In Japanese politics , as opposed to Kabuki , this is a rare and unfamiliar drama . Yet it is extremely welcome . 
 Let reform be the winner 
 It is possible that Junichiro Koizumi will win a remarkable victory in the election and lead a new phase of reform Junichiro Koizumi , at the head of a purged LDP . But even if this double hate suicide does end up being fatal both for Junichiro Koizumi and the LDP , the outcome is likely still to be a good one for Japan and much to Junichiro Koizumi's credit . For the debate between Junichiro Koizumi and the alternative government , the DPJ , is no longer about whether to reform Japan in a more market - friendly direction but how .

AFTER ruling Japan for most of the past half-century, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) tore itself apart this week over an issue that has come to epitomise the battle between its market-friendly reformists and its conservative old guard: the privatisation of Japan Post. On August 8th, in one of the most keenly watched votes in memory, the LDP's conservative wing mustered enough support in parliament's upper house to defeat the privatisation bills convincingly, by 125 to 108, with help from Japan's opposition parties. Junichiro Koizumi, since 2001 the LDP leader and prime minister, responded by making good his threat to call a snap election for the lower house (he cannot dissolve the upper chamber). Japan will go to the polls on September 11th. 
The risks are huge: for Mr Koizumi, his party and for Japan. Although each of the two biggest contenders--Mr Koizumi's wing of the LDP and the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ)--backs a freer and more flexible Japan, neither may be able to win a clear majority. The immediate outcome could leave anti-reformists in a position of leverage, and perhaps greatly emboldened. For all the dangers, however, this could be just the moment for which many champions of real change have long been hoping. 
Since he took over in 2001, Mr Koizumi has shaken up politics in many ways. Yet he has been unable to transform convincingly a system that routinely rewards caution and informal compromise over clear debate and crisp choices. Japan has thus been stuck in transition: between a one-party state in which LDP factions were the main contestants, and a modern democracy in which different parties compete. Now that the LDP is in turmoil, however, the September election could help to destroy the old system for good. 
The DPJ is itching for a fight. After being formed in 1998 from a collection of splinter parties, it has gained seats and learned the ropes over the past few elections. Its leader, Katsuya Okada, said this week that the September showdown will be ""the most important general election since the end of the second world war"". That is probably true.
The contest should be close. The LDP will withhold support from the 37 lower-house party members who rejected the Japan Post privatisation bills when that chamber voted on them last month. So the LDP and its coalition partner, New Komeito, will be defending only 246 seats in the election, a bare five more than they need for a majority. And although opinion polls gave Mr Koizumi a boost this week, it is far from clear at the outset how the LDP split will affect its traditional strength in rural areas, or the DPJ's edge in the cities.
Foreign policy will be a factor. The DPJ will pledge to get Japanese troops out of Iraq. And many moderates and businessmen will back the DPJ in hopes that it will cool tensions with China and South Korea. Mr Koizumi has infuriated neighbours by going every year to the Yasukuni shrine, an institution widely associated with an unapologetic view of the second world war.
The economy, though, will help Mr Koizumi. He will claim that the latest rebound is due to his previous reforms: privatising road corporations, fixing the banks, cutting public-works spending and freeing up market forces in general. In fact, exports and investment, notably involving China, have played a much bigger role. This has boosted company profits and made it easier for the banks to write off bad loans. Mr Koizumi's government deserves credit for seizing the chance and pressuring the banks, but most of his other economic reforms have been gradual or weak. 
Growth, though, is picking up. Hopefully, this will keep translating into more hiring, and eventually lead to rising wages, higher consumer confidence and an end to deflation. Despite all the political turmoil this week, the stockmarket rose by 5.3% between mid-day Monday (just before the upper house voted) and Thursday afternoon--closing at a four-year high.
The danger for Mr Koizumi is that by stressing one issue--Japan Post, which he has yet to explain clearly--he may fail to connect with many reformist voters. A majority of Japanese seem to agree with him about the need to separate the state from the postal system's yen331 trillion ($3 trillion) stockpile of savings and life-insurance assets. But the DPJ will ask why the prime minister is so fixated on this one reform. By contrast, the DPJ is stressing how much it wants change on a range of fronts. Its members voted against the Japan Post privatisation, but they say they are only opposed to the details, not to privatisation in principle. The party will also hope that voters understand why the long-suffering opposition wanted to defeat the bills and trigger an election. 
Mr Okada thus faces a different challenge: convincing voters that his party can carry out the changes they are promising, when they have never been in power before. The party manifesto pledges to shift power and finance towards regional governments; to unify a balkanised pension system to make it fairer and simpler; to cut back even more than Mr Koizumi has on public works and other sources of corruption; and to shrink the state. It is also offering goodies, such as more police, schools and nursing homes and the scrapping of tolls on public highways.
One criticism of the DPJ is that it is fragmented, just like the LDP. Its members include former liberals and LDP members, as well as former socialists. The manifesto, which all candidates must sign, is its way of promising cohesion. If it does win, the DPJ's internal differences will probably not be as big a problem, at least initially, as will the upper house, in which it will still hold a minority of seats.
Whatever the outcome, the split within the LDP is a huge event. Mr Koizumi took office in 2001 promising to ""change the LDP, change Japan"". He is closer than ever to fulfilling the first half of his pledge.","Junichiro Koizumi's has launched a civil war with Junichiro Koizumi's own party , and called a snap election that could shake the country

MORE as a sort of public service than anything else, The Economist used to devote space every now and then to writing about the Democratic Party of Japan. The DPJ is, after all, Japan's main opposition party. And although the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has dominated politics for half a century, the chance that some other party might actually win one day was worth an occasional thought, no matter how often those tentative hopes were dashed. The DPJ does not need charity anymore, however. With the LDP now deeply split over Junichiro Koizumi's failed bid to privatise Japan's postal-savings system, and a cliff-hanger of an election looming on September 11th, the opposition has a real chance to form Japan's next government. The DPJ has thus earned the world's attention. The new question is: what would the party do if it won?
The short answer, which the DPJ has given consistently since Katsuya Okada took over in early 2004, is that it would try to shrink the national government, shake up the bureaucracy, give more power to Japan's regions, and break free of the narrow conservative interests that have long held the country hostage. On all these issues, Mr Okada and his party are trumpeting change even more eagerly than Mr Koizumi, whose passion for budget cuts and ""structural reform"" has alienated much of his own party. The DPJ has never held power, so it can keep internal divisions on these issues out of the public eye.
Not all of the DPJ's promises involve budget cuts and the economy. The party also criticises Mr Koizumi for angering neighbours. It dislikes, for instance, his annual visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, which makes excuses for the second world war. But it also says that he has cosied up too closely to George Bush. The DPJ pledges to get Japan's (non-combat) troops out of Iraq if it wins. Mr Koizumi countered this week by saying that he does not want Yasukuni to be a campaign issue. Instead of visiting the shrine on August 15th, the 60th anniversary of Japan's surrender, he read out an apology for the war; it followed the lines of the definitive apology offered by the Murayama government a decade ago.
When it released the bulk of its new party platform on August 16th, however, the DPJ made clear that it would stress economic reform during the campaign. There are to be cuts everywhere. Public investment has fallen from 8% of GDP in the 1990s to 5% under Mr Koizumi; but the DPJ wants to slash the central government's public-works spending by another half. It also promises to cut the government's labour costs by 20%. The LDP will feebly try to match this by pledging cuts of 10%.
Overall, the DPJ is promising yen17 trillion ($155 billion) in gross spending cuts over three years, and yen10 trillion in net cuts after boosting spending on education, child care and other programmes. It hopes to reduce government borrowing to less than yen30 trillion a year. The DPJ also backs a rise in sales taxes, which will probably have to be introduced whoever wins. 
Since August 8th, when Mr Koizumi decided to fight a snap election over his failed post-office privatisation plan, the prime minister has enjoyed a clear bounce in the opinion polls (see chart). The DPJ, which does not want to appear weak on Mr Koizumi's signature issue (even though, for tactical reasons, it voted against it in parliament that day), has put forth its own rival plan to cut Japan Post's yen330 trillion of savings and insurance assets by roughly half. It would eventually lower the individual limit on postal savings accounts from yen10m now to yen5m, it says. 
In a close election, the DPJ might need a partner to govern. That might prove awkward. But, even if it did not, would the economy actually respond to sharp spending cuts? It is doing better these days, but will take time to recover its old vigour. Yet, whatever the economic risks, the DPJ's fiscal samurai, having taken out their cost-cutting sword in the public square, may feel compelled to use it if they win.","The DPJ is trying to outdo Junichiro Koizumi on structural reforms

A FEW weeks ago foreign investors were dreading a vote in the upper house of Japan's parliament. If Junichiro Koizumi's post-office privatisation package failed, and if the prime minister then called a snap election, economic reform would suffer a double blow. Both these things duly happened on August 8th. Yet investors don't seem too bothered after all. A string of nice economic figures this summer--like last week's on machinery orders, wholesale prices and domestic demand--has simply been too good to ignore.
The Nikkei stockmarket index, which slid the week before the post-office vote, climbed by 5% the week after. It has gained 14% in three months, to a four-year high (see chart). The yen is perky too, up by 2% in the past fortnight: a dollar now buys around yen110. Falling bond prices in the past two weeks have rounded out the bullish trifecta. (That said, with yields on ten-year government bonds at only 1.4%, it is still not hard to pick the deflationary economy out of a rich-country line-up.)
Japan bulls have been disappointed many times before. Might they be again? One reason for caution is that foreigners have been doing all the buying, while locals have sat on their hands. Another is that the naysayers have sensible arguments as well as history on their side. Take Morgan Stanley's Robert Feldman, who has been among the most bullish observers of Japan in the past couple of years but now calls himself a ""party pooper"". Mr Feldman has been impressed with Mr Koizumi, giving him high marks for economic reform and predicting stellar results if the prime minister pushed more of his plans through. Now that there is a threat of gridlock after the general election on September 11th, says Mr Feldman, all that Mr Koizumi was working for is at risk--and so are the prospects for growth.
Still, investors are scarcely ignorant of the risks: having suffered many wounds in the past decade, Japan bulls no longer charge at the first wave of the red cape. It is just that the steady accumulation of good news has gradually led them to shake off some doubts about the world's most frustrating economy. Last week, for instance, it was reported that GDP grew at an annual rate of only 1.1% in the second quarter, less than expected. The optimists concluded that, on close inspection, the figures were not that bad. Growth was slow, yes, but mainly because inventories fell. That's a good sign, said the bulls, because manufacturers are now burdened with fewer unsold goods. And perhaps more important, the GDP figures seemed to back up other evidence that the recovery is broadening beyond exports and capital investment, to include consumption. 
A tightening job market may help to sustain this trend. In the first stage of its recovery, the Japanese economy created lots of part-time and temporary jobs; since the start of the year, full-time employment has been on the rise. In the year to June, it grew by 1.1%. There are now more job offers per applicant than at any time since 1992; unemployment has fallen to 4.2%, from 5.5% in early 2003. Moreover, since profits are strong and global demand looks fairly healthy, investors are a little less worried that exports and capital investment will stagnate before domestic demand can take up the running.
By Japan's standards, all of this amounts to a pretty scene. In early August, The Economist's poll of forecasters was predicting that real GDP would grow by 1.7% this year and next, and that consumer prices would rise--at long last--by 0.3% next year. Many economists have raised their growth forecasts since then. Yes, Japan has disappointed often, and September's election is important. But the economic climate has not been this sunny in a while. Let the bulls have a little fun.","Despite all the political uncertainty , investors are optimistic about Japan 
 A FEW weeks ago foreign investors were dreading a vote in the upper house of Japan 's parliament . If Junichiro Koizumi's post - office privatisation package failed , and if Junichiro Koizumi then called a snap election , economic reform would suffer a double blow . Both these things duly happened on August 8th . Yet investors do n't seem too bothered after all . A string of nice economic figures this summer -- like last week 's on machinery orders , wholesale prices and domestic demand -- has simply been too good to ignore . 
 The Nikkei stockmarket index , which slid the week before the post - office vote , climbed by 5 % the week after . It has gained 14 % in three months , to a four - year high ( see chart ) . The yen is perky too , up by 2 % in the past fortnight : a dollar now buys around yen110 . Falling bond prices in the past two weeks have rounded out the bullish trifecta . ( That said , with yields on ten - year government bonds at only 1.4 % , it is still not hard to pick the deflationary economy out of a rich - country line - up . ) 
 Japan bulls have been disappointed many times before . Might they be again ? One reason for caution is that foreigners have been doing all the buying , while locals have sat on their hands . Another is that the naysayers have sensible arguments as well as history on their side . Take Morgan Stanley 's Robert Feldman , who has been among the most bullish observers of Japan in the past couple of years but now calls himself a "" party pooper "" . Mr Feldman has been impressed with Junichiro Koizumi , giving Junichiro Koizumi high marks for economic reform and predicting stellar results if Junichiro Koizumi pushed more of Junichiro Koizumi's plans through . Now that there is a threat of gridlock after the general election on September 11th , says Mr Feldman , all that Junichiro Koizumi was working for is at risk -- and so are the prospects for growth .

ONE of the novel things about Japan's looming election is that it is easy to tell many of the candidates apart this time. Nobody in Hiroshima, for example, will confuse Shizuka Kamei with Takafumi Horie. The 68-year-old Mr Kamei is a conservative stalwart who loathes Junichiro Koizumi and voted against the prime minister's plan to privatise the post office and its related financial services. For his defiance, Mr Kamei has been kicked out of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and has formed a tiny group of rejectionists, the People's New Party, to contest the snap election that Mr Koizumi has called for September 11th. By contrast, his opponent, the 32-year-old Mr Horie, is an internet businessman who has promoted himself as an attacker of the status quo.
Style alone helps to set the two apart. Mr Kamei's traditional look--dull suit and huge spectacles--is flexible enough to complement all three of his standard facial expressions: sour, sullen and sombre. The spiky-haired Mr Horie prefers T-shirts, and his favourite accessory is an internet-enabled mobile phone. 
The two candidates also differ on issues. Mr Kamei--a former LDP policy chief, who headed his own party faction and who twice challenged Mr Koizumi for the party's leadership--has repeatedly denounced the prime minister's ""structural reform"" agenda. He argues that cuts in public-works spending and efforts to promote market competition are destroying the country's traditional fabric, and fears a Japan in which ""the strong gnaw on the bones of the weak"". 
Mr Kamei is therefore vehemently opposed to the prime minister's plan to privatise Japan Post over the next 12 years. Japan's 25,000-branch post-office network doubles as a savings bank and life insurer, and holds yen330 trillion ($3 trillion) in assets. Mr Koizumi wants to liberalise Japan Post and shrink the state's influence. Mr Horie agrees with the prime minister.
Indeed, Mr Horie's internet company, Livedoor, is easy to contrast with the venerable economic model that Japan Post represents. The post office champions snail mail; Mr Horie's customers use e-mail. The post office built brick-and-mortar branches to help consolidate the Japanese islands; Livedoor and others are using the internet to decentralise decisions. And whereas the post office's huge state-run bank promotes financial isolationism and conservatism, Livedoor has got help from one of the big foreign investment banks that are changing Japan.
So Mr Koizumi is naturally pleased that Livedoor's boss will run against Mr Kamei in the Hiroshima constituency, even if Mr Horie is officially an independent. The prime minister has made post-office privatisation the main theme of the LDP's campaign. Although he will face a tough fight against the biggest opposition party, the Democratic Party of Japan, he is also keen to defeat members of his own party who voted against the privatisation bills this summer (and from whom the LDP has withdrawn national support). 
Mr Koizumi has assembled a posse of high-profile candidates--including many prominent women--to pursue the 32 LDP rebels in the campaign (four others have retired, and one is running on another splinter party's proportional list). Overall, the LDP and its coalition partner, New Komeito, will run candidates who support postal privatisation in 299 of Japan's 300 single-seat districts. They will leave number 300 to Mr Horie.

THE big event is still a week away, but Junichiro Koizumi is looking cleverer by the day. Less than a month ago, Japan's prime minister divided his fusty old party and called a risky snap election, in a bid to win public backing for his plan to privatise Japan's massive postal-savings scheme. At the time, this looked dangerous. By chasing out the 37 members of his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) who had voted against his plan in parliament's lower house, Mr Koizumi has forced his ruling coalition to defend a razor-thin margin in the election due on September 11th, against an opposition party--the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ)--that has made huge inroads in recent years. 
Mr Koizumi has run a shrewd campaign, however, and surged ahead in opinion polls. He stole the limelight from the DPJ by recruiting a team of high-profile candidates, many of them new to politics (and dubbed ""assassins"" by Japan's media), to take on the LDP rebels in their home districts. Most voters agree that his signature issue--the privatisation of Japan Post, and its yen330 trillion ($3 trillion) of savings and life-insurance assets--is the most important of the campaign. 
The opinion surveys are sketchy, and the LDP split has muddled the arithmetic in many constituencies, so Mr Koizumi's wide lead may turn out to be illusory. This being Japan, however, many reformists are now worried for a different reason. They fear a comfortable victory for Mr Koizumi and the LDP, which, they say, will lead to gradual privatisation of the postal-savings scheme, but few other reforms of substance. Despite its name, after all, the LDP is notorious for being neither liberal nor democratic; and the DPJ is meanwhile promising an impressively wide-ranging panoply of reforms.
One reform or many?
The DPJ, led by Katsuya Okada, has clearly been frustrated by Mr Koizumi's skill at portraying Japan Post as a litmus test for reformists. Mr Okada argues that, unlike the LDP--which he says is incapable of reforming itself after half a century of nearly continuous rule--the DPJ will pursue sweeping changes for the good of ordinary people. While Mr Koizumi is perched on high, hammering away at one issue like a woodpecker and dazzling the media with his plumage, the DPJ is waving a giant axe at the base of the tree, frantically trying to attract voters' attention.
Whereas Mr Koizumi's party could not even agree on a pledge to cut the civil-service payroll by 10%, for example, the DPJ is promoting a plan to slash it by 20%. Whereas the prime minister is vague about other planned spending cuts, the DPJ vows that it will outdo him with cuts of yen10 trillion over the next three years. And although Mr Koizumi is correct to pay some attention to postal savings, says the DPJ, its own postal plan would shrink the state's influence even more than his, by halving the assets of Japan Post before eventually selling it. None of these campaign promises seems any match for Mr Koizumi and his all-star team of assassins.
Still, after the battle that Mr Koizumi has waged within the LDP, a vote for the party hardly looks like a vote for the status quo. To see why, it helps to distinguish between two sorts of change. The first--rapid liberalisation towards something close to a free-market domestic economy--has always seemed implausible. It is hard to imagine any political alignment that could risk moving too fast for Japan's voters, who dread the unpredictable. 
Other long-overdue changes, however, do have majority support, and many young and urban voters are desperate for them. These do not add up to an ideological revolution so much as a big shift in power away from narrow, outdated interest-groups and towards the interests of the majority of Japanese. Instead of allowing central bureaucrats, construction lobbies, doctors and postmasters to hold government policy hostage, most voters would prefer the government to pay attention to the core issues--pensions, health care, schools, police and so on--that they have been worrying about, and which politicians in other democracies do at least pretend to address.
It is this appetite that the DPJ is trying to satisfy in its speeches and its manifesto. The opposition's goal is not so much to shrink the state as to rescue it from outworn special interests. The party wants to take power away from the central bureaucracy, for example, and increase the power of local governments. It wants to cut spending on public works, but raise consumption taxes to fund better pensions. It is keen on small-business subsidies, but wants to dole them out with fewer hassles. And although the DPJ is pledging to reduce deficits overall, to yen30 trillion a year, that is the same target that Mr Koizumi promised when he took office four years ago.
As popular as these changes are, its inexperience, a rural voting bias and the LDP's power of incumbency have made it hard for the DPJ to win office. But now, by shaking up his own party, Mr Koizumi has given the LDP a similar chance to become more responsive to modern voters. If this election founds a system of vibrant two-party competition, Japan will have undergone a monumental change, no matter who wins.","Junichiro Koizumi makes the running , but voters may benefit no matter who wins

IT IS an election without precedent in many ways, so the outcome on September 11th could yet defy the pollsters. But three days before the voting, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) held such a commanding lead in opinion surveys that it was widely expected to retain its grip on power, as it has done for all but ten months of the past half century. If you were to conclude from this, however, that the election has lost its suspense, you would be wrong. 
For Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, is taking on two very different opponents in the election that he decided to call a month ago, when his plan to privatise Japan's postal-savings bank had failed to clear parliament. One opponent is the group of LDP rebels who voted against the privatisation plan in the lower house, and who therefore represent one of the most ferociously anti-reformist wings of the party. Mr Koizumi's other opponent is the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), which has improved the country's democracy greatly over the past few years by giving the LDP some competition. Ideally, Mr Koizumi would destroy the rebels on Sunday without doing too much damage to the DPJ. Neither outcome is assured.
It is clear, though, that many of Japan's voters are energised, and mostly for reform. Mr Koizumi's attack on the rebels has clearly inspired much of the country. He has sharply boosted his standing in the opinion polls, and many young and urban voters who have shunned the ruling party in recent years now say that they support the prime minister and his purged LDP. Opinion surveys suggest that the Japanese are more keen to vote this time than they have been in many years. And normally apolitical onlookers are debating this election much more than previous ones.
Mr Koizumi has appealed to modernist voters in two ways. First, he has chosen a single issue, postal privatisation, as a litmus test of reform. Some may see this as odd, given that his plan for the privatisation of the biggest financial institution in the world is less radical that it sounds. The plan is greatly watered down, after all, and many economists argue that any benefits from freeing capital markets will probably accrue only slowly. Moreover, the DPJ is right in saying that its own agenda is much more reformist, on the whole, than Mr Koizumi's. And the DPJ is talking about issues, such as pensions, that worry most voters much more directly.
Yet many voters seem to understand Mr Koizumi's postal test better than the pundits do. Whether or not it is Japan's most urgent economic matter (Mr Koizumi says it is), it allows him to draw sharp lines within his own vague and cynical party, and to give Japan's voters a clear choice between two LDPs: the old one that he wants to destroy and a new one that he promises will be better. 
Mr Koizumi says little about this new LDP, which will, if he wins, retain many of the familiar old members and connections. But his implicit message is that if the voters give him a resounding show of support, and help him to defeat the worst elements of the party, then it will embolden the modernisers who want to prise the LDP away from the grip of special interests. In the past it has proved difficult for voters to send that message to a faceless and unprincipled party. So Mr Koizumi has used the postal test to put names and faces to the problem.
He has also boosted the chances of his ploy working by adopting a second strategy: the ""assassins"". Across the country, Mr Koizumi has enlisted popular and unforgettable candidates to challenge the old-guard LDP recalcitrants in their well-defended home districts. Many of them are women, including an economist at a foreign bank, a celebrity chef, a former Miss Tokyo University and a well-regarded cabinet member whom the media have even touted as an ideal bride for the divorced prime minister. All of them back postal privatisation.
Much of this smacks of gimmickry. But it has created a clear distinction in the public mind between the rebels, who want to cling to the old Japan, and Mr Koizumi's team, who represent many varieties of a new Japan. The tactic has also allowed Mr Koizumi to play the cool maverick, thus boosting his popularity in the way that his Lion Heart e-mail magazine and a CD of his favourite Elvis songs did after he first took office in 2001. 
There is a big difference between now and then, however. In 2001, pundits worried that Mr Koizumi's popularity would wane once the media spotlight went off, and once voters started to shy away from his calls for reform. Now the worry is that he is still popular, but will not carry out as much reform as the voters want. Mr Koizumi has not changed all that much. The voters, though, have come a long way.","Junichiro Koizumi tries for another victory this weekend 
 IT IS an election without precedent in many ways , so the outcome on September 11th could yet defy the pollsters . But three days before the voting , the Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) held such a commanding lead in opinion surveys that it was widely expected to retain its grip on power , as it has done for all but ten months of the past half century . If you were to conclude from this , however , that the election has lost its suspense , you would be wrong . 
 For Junichiro Koizumi's , is taking on two very different opponents in the election that Junichiro Koizumi decided to call a month ago , when Junichiro Koizumi's plan to privatise Japan 's postal - savings bank had failed to clear parliament . One opponent is the group of LDP rebels who voted against the privatisation plan in the lower house , and who therefore represent one of the most ferociously anti - reformist wings of the party . Junichiro Koizumi's other opponent is the Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) , which has improved the country 's democracy greatly over the past few years by giving the LDP some competition . Ideally , Junichiro Koizumi would destroy the rebels on Sunday without doing too much damage to the DPJ . Neither outcome is assured . 
 It is clear , though , that many of Japan 's voters are energised , and mostly for reform . Junichiro Koizumi's attack on the rebels has clearly inspired much of the country . Junichiro Koizumi has sharply boosted Junichiro Koizumi's standing in the opinion polls , and many young and urban voters who have shunned the ruling party in recent years now say that they support Junichiro Koizumi and Junichiro Koizumi's purged LDP . Opinion surveys suggest that the Japanese are more keen to vote this time than they have been in many years . And normally apolitical onlookers are debating this election much more than previous ones . 
 Junichiro Koizumi has appealed to modernist voters in two ways . First , Junichiro Koizumi has chosen a single issue , postal privatisation , as a litmus test of reform . Some may see this as odd , given that Junichiro Koizumi's plan for the privatisation of the biggest financial institution in the world is less radical that it sounds . The plan is greatly watered down , after all , and many economists argue that any benefits from freeing capital markets will probably accrue only slowly . Moreover , the DPJ is right in saying that its own agenda is much more reformist , on the whole , than Junichiro Koizumi's . And the DPJ is talking about issues , such as pensions , that worry most voters much more directly . 
 Yet many voters seem to understand Junichiro Koizumi's postal test better than the pundits do . Whether or not it is Japan 's most urgent economic matter ( Junichiro Koizumi says it is ) , it allows Junichiro Koizumi to draw sharp lines within Junichiro Koizumi's own vague and cynical party , and to give Japan 's voters a clear choice between two LDPs : the old one that Junichiro Koizumi wants to destroy and a new one that Junichiro Koizumi promises will be better . 
 Junichiro Koizumi says little about this new LDP , which will , if Junichiro Koizumi wins , retain many of the familiar old members and connections . But Junichiro Koizumi's implicit message is that if the voters give Junichiro Koizumi a resounding show of support , and help Junichiro Koizumi to defeat the worst elements of the party , then it will embolden the modernisers who want to prise the LDP away from the grip of special interests . In the past it has proved difficult for voters to send that message to a faceless and unprincipled party . So Junichiro Koizumi has used the postal test to put names and faces to the problem . 
 Junichiro Koizumi has also boosted the chances of Junichiro Koizumi's ploy working by adopting a second strategy : the "" assassins "" . Across the country , Junichiro Koizumi has enlisted popular and unforgettable candidates to challenge the old - guard LDP recalcitrants in their well - defended home districts .

Japan's Liberal Democratic Party was returned to power with a sharply increased majority. Junichiro Koizumi, the prime minister, had called a snap election and purged his party after his plans to privatise Japan Post were blocked by rebels. The leader of the opposition Democratic Party of Japan resigned.
A fresh round of six-country talks on North Korea's nuclear weapons opened in Beijing. America's lead negotiator complained of little progress. 
In Afghanistan, the Taliban were blamed for the killing of seven people delivering voter registration papers in the central province of Uruzgan, just days ahead of parliamentary and provincial elections on September 18th. 
Manmohan Singh and Pervez Musharraf, respectively the prime minister of India and the president of Pakistan, met in New York. Hopes of a breakthrough were dashed but Mr Singh did promise to visit Pakistan. 
Bailing out
More than two weeks after Hurricane Katrina, the clear- up in New Orleans began in earnest. As authorities scaled back their estimate of the region's death toll, George Bush paid two visits to the deluged city (he had previously visited the Gulf coast region) to view the operations. Michael Brown resigned as head of the much criticised Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
The Senate held its confirmation hearings for John Roberts to be chief justice of the Supreme Court. Following the script, Democrats quizzed him on his attitude towards abortion and civil rights.
The Massachusetts legislature voted against a proposed state constitutional amendment that would ban gay marriage, which is legal in the state because of a court ruling. The measure now looks unlikely to be put to the electorate next year. 
Fernando Ferrer won the Democratic primary in New York's mayoral election, after the second-placed candidate withdrew to avoid a divisive run-off. Mr Ferrer could become the city's first Latino mayor if he beats Michael Bloomberg in November.
World leaders meeting in New York were due to endorse a 35-page declaration on overhauling the United Nations and progress towards tackling world poverty. Although greatly watered down in comparison with earlier drafts, the final document was described by both Kofi Annan, the UN secretary-general, and Mr Bush as an important ""first step"" along the road to reform. Others were more dubious.
Paying the bill
In Brazil, opposition parties began proceedings to expel Severino Cavalcanti, the leader of the lower house of Congress. He is accused of extorting payments from a concessionaire who ran restaurants in the Congress building. An unrelated campaign-finance scandal involving the Workers' Party continues to erode the popularity of the government. 
Suez, a French utility, said it would withdraw from Argentina, where it held 46% of a large water company, after failing to reach agreement with the government over an increase in tariffs, which have been frozen since 2002. 
In Canada, Ontario's government said that it would not allow Muslims to use sharia law to settle family disputes; instead, it will move to outlaw religious tribunals used by Christians and Jews. 
Chile's Supreme Court ruled that General Augusto Pinochet can face a third set of human-rights charges, though he is likely to escape trial on health grounds. The Guardian, a British newspaper, claimed that BAE Systems paid the former dictator more than pounds 1m ($1.6m) from 1997 to 2004.
Up for grabs
The opinion polls continued to narrow days ahead of Germany's election. Most now suggest that the opposition will not win an overall majority, making the likeliest outcome a ""grand coalition"" between the main centre-right and centre-left parties.
Norway voted the centre-left into office in a general election. Jens Stoltenberg, leader of the Labour Party, will now form a government, ousting the centre-right government of Kjell Magne Bondevik.
The European Court of Justice ruled that the European Commission could, in some circumstances, impose criminal penalties on those who flout European Union laws. The ruling was opposed by many national governments, which argued that the criminal law should never fall within EU powers. 
Northern Ireland witnessed its worse riots for years after a parade by the Orange Order was re-routed to avoid a Catholic neighbourhood. Around 80 police officers were hurt in the ensuing violence. The province's top policeman said the Order and loyalist paramilitaries had instigated the trouble; they blame the police.
European finance ministers vowed to stand together against fuel-price protesters who are demanding cuts in petrol taxes. But several countries promptly offered subsidies and tax rebates to favoured pressure groups.
The carnage continues
In one of the deadliest days in Iraq since the American-led invasion in 2003, at least 150 people were killed and hundreds more injured in a series of bomb attacks and shootings on September 14th. In the worst incident, a suicidebomber blew up his car in the midst of hundreds of labourers, killing at least 114. Al-Qaeda in Iraq claimed responsibility for the mayhem.
Hosni Mubarak won what was billed as Egypt's first competitive presidential election with 88.6% of the vote. His main rival in the race, Ayman Nour, won just 7.6% and cried foul. Even more strikingly, only 23% of the electorate bothered to vote.
There were anarchic scenes in the Gaza strip as the last Israeli soldiers left. Former Israeli settlements were looted and a synagogue was burned to the ground. Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas condemned the ""armed chaos"". 
In oil-rich Nigeria, thousands of people took to the streets in the city of Lagos to protest against a rise of 30% in fuel costs due to cuts in government subsidies.

NO ONE ever accused Japan of making itself easy to understand. It has just had its most thrilling general election in decades, possibly ever, a poll called courageously by the prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, after a post-office privatisation bill had been rejected in the Diet (parliament) in August. At first, that decision looked suicidal. But the maverick Mr Koizumi's gamble paid off: he won a huge mandate, seemingly for radical change (see pages 23-25). So here comes a new Japan? Look harder, and the fog starts to form.
In Sunday's poll, after all, voters restored parliamentary dominance to Mr Koizumi's Liberal Democratic Party, the same conservative group that has ruled Japan ever since 1955, bar ten months in 1993-94, and which led the country into the financial crash and economic stagnation from which it has suffered for the past 15 years. The election did enable him to expel from the party 37 rebels who had opposed his reforms, roughly 15% of the LDP's pre-election strength, so it has made the party better able to bring about change. Yet in giving the revamped LDP its biggest majority in the main (lower) house of the Diet since 1986, the voters also rejected the chief opposition group, the Democratic Party of Japan, whose manifesto actually promised a more liberal and far-reaching set of reforms than did Mr Koizumi. And the LDP's party rules anyway stipulate that Mr Koizumi has to stand down as its leader, and hence prime minister, in just one year's time.
So this apparently new Japan will be led by the same old party, and the great, purported change-maker will soon be gone. It sounds absurd: rather as if, when Britain's Margaret Thatcher won a landslide election victory in 1983, her fourth year in office just as 2005 is for Mr Koizumi, she then had to stand down in 1984, six years earlier than she eventually did. For that reason, the obvious conclusion is that the LDP will now have to change its rules, to allow Mr Koizumi to serve for at least another year or two. There is already talk of it. Yet the man himself insists that he plans to retire, on schedule. 
The real meaning of the Lionheart
Which is it, then? An exciting victory for radicalism or a very conservative choice? When Japan looks at its most inscrutable, with ritual inside evasion wrapped in confusion, the right answer is often the simplest: it is both, but go easy on the excitement. Mr Koizumi, a self-described ""Lionheart"", is a radical but only within quite a conservative context. For Japanese voters probably do not want truly radical change: otherwise they would long ago have gambled on the DPJ, flaky and divided though it is. What most voters seem to want is a steady process of change, and that is what they are going to get, whether or not Mr Koizumi remains for longer as prime minister.
The big policy issue in Japan concerns the size and role of the state. Spending is not high by global standards: 37% of GDP in 2004, which is more than in America but lower than in Britain and far lower than in continental Europe. The problem lies in the composition of the spending, the size of the budget deficit (6.4% of GDP) and the way the state interferes in the economy in other ways. Beginning in the 1970s, high spending on public works turned politics into a pork-barrel affair. In the 1990s, when the economy stumbled, the chosen solution was a great burst of Keynesian public spending, which prevented a slump but also gave a big boost to a corrupt and cartelised construction industry, poured concrete over much of the country's natural beauty and kept the political pork-barrel brimming over. In 1998, as fears grew about the national debt, that spending began to be slashed. The question was how far to go. Mr Koizumi's rise to power, in 2001, reflected the views of those who thought it should go further: that the era of pork-barrel politics was over; that the state institutions that facilitated it must be reformed or privatised; and that the public sector had to be trimmed and revamped in preparation for the inevitable increases in health-care and pensions costs resulting from the shrinking and ageing of Japan's population.
Ex post
That is why a rather arcane subject, the privatisation of Japan Post, caused a big row in the Diet and took centre stage in the election. Japan Post includes a savings bank that accounts for 30% of all personal deposits and a life insurer that has 40% of that market; and its yen330 trillion ($3 trillion) of assets have long provided the main funding for all those public-works schemes. Now that Mr Koizumi has won, he will have, with the LDP's small coalition partner, the Buddhist-backed New Komeito, a two-thirds majority in the lower house, which is enough for him to override the upper house, which rejected the postal bills in August. Yet he is no Thatcherite. In trimming back the public sector, he represents a sort of accelerated continuity of policy since 1998, not a sharp change. And look at his postal bills: although the savings bank will be made to operate in a more commercial manner from 2007 or 2008, it will not be sold off until 2017. 
Beyond the postal privatisation, the government needs to do four main things in domestic policy. It needs to avoid messing up the economic recovery that is already under way, which argues against rapid cuts in public spending and against tax rises. It needs to dismantle the other institutions through which the state has guided and distorted the economy: Mr Koizumi has already reined in a mortgage lender, the Housing Loan Corporation, and next he plans to do the same for the other eight state lenders. The government needs to sharpen competition in the private sector, partly by deregulating but more by strengthening antitrust enforcement: ideally, by elevating the Fair Trade Commission, the trustbuster, to cabinet status and giving it many more lawyers and inspectors. Finally, it needs to find ways to reform the two big future burdens on the public purse: health care and pensions.
Those tasks do not require Thatcher-style shock therapy: the time for that was the mid-1990s, and neither voters nor politicians wanted it. They need a long, steady process, with public-sector reform at the centre of the debate. That is what Mr Koizumi has achieved. Just don't get excited about it.","How to bring about change by re - electing the same old party 
 NO ONE ever accused Japan of making itself easy to understand . It has just had its most thrilling general election in decades , possibly ever , a poll called courageously by Junichiro Koizumi , after a post - office privatisation bill had been rejected in the Diet ( parliament ) in August . At first , that decision looked suicidal . But Junichiro Koizumi's gamble paid off : Junichiro Koizumi won a huge mandate , seemingly for radical change ( see pages 23 - 25 ) . So here comes a new Japan ? Look harder , and the fog starts to form . 
 In Sunday 's poll , after all , voters restored parliamentary dominance to Junichiro Koizumi's Liberal Democratic Party , the same conservative group that has ruled Japan ever since 1955 , bar ten months in 1993 - 94 , and which led the country into the financial crash and economic stagnation from which it has suffered for the past 15 years . The election did enable Junichiro Koizumi to expel from the party 37 rebels who had opposed Junichiro Koizumi's reforms , roughly 15 % of the LDP 's pre - election strength , so it has made the party better able to bring about change . Yet in giving the revamped LDP its biggest majority in the main ( lower ) house of the Diet since 1986 , the voters also rejected the chief opposition group , the Democratic Party of Japan , whose manifesto actually promised a more liberal and far - reaching set of reforms than did Junichiro Koizumi . And the LDP 's party rules anyway stipulate that Junichiro Koizumi has to stand down as its leader , and hence prime minister , in just one year 's time . 
 So this apparently new Japan will be led by the same old party , and Junichiro Koizumi will soon be gone . It sounds absurd : rather as if , when Britain 's Margaret Thatcher won a landslide election victory in 1983 , her fourth year in office just as 2005 is for Junichiro Koizumi , she then had to stand down in 1984 , six years earlier than she eventually did . For that reason , the obvious conclusion is that the LDP will now have to change its rules , to allow Junichiro Koizumi to serve for at least another year or two . There is already talk of it . Yet Junichiro Koizumi Koizumi insists that Junichiro Koizumi plans to retire , on schedule . 
 The real meaning of the Lionheart 
 Which is it , then ? An exciting victory for radicalism or a very conservative choice ? When Japan looks at its most inscrutable , with ritual inside evasion wrapped in confusion , the right answer is often the simplest : it is both , but go easy on the excitement . Junichiro Koizumi , is a radical but only within quite a conservative context . For Japanese voters probably do not want truly radical change : otherwise they would long ago have gambled on the DPJ , flaky and divided though it is . What most voters seem to want is a steady process of change , and that is what they are going to get , whether or not Junichiro Koizumi remains for longer as prime minister . 
 The big policy issue in Japan concerns the size and role of the state . Spending is not high by global standards : 37 % of GDP in 2004 , which is more than in America but lower than in Britain and far lower than in continental Europe . The problem lies in the composition of the spending , the size of the budget deficit ( 6.4 % of GDP ) and the way the state interferes in the economy in other ways . Beginning in the 1970s , high spending on public works turned politics into a pork - barrel affair . In the 1990s , when the economy stumbled , the chosen solution was a great burst of Keynesian public spending , which prevented a slump but also gave a big boost to a corrupt and cartelised construction industry , poured concrete over much of the country 's natural beauty and kept the political pork - barrel brimming over . In 1998 , as fears grew about the national debt , that spending began to be slashed . The question was how far to go . Junichiro Koizumi's rise to power , in 2001 , reflected the views of those who thought it should go further : that the era of pork - barrel politics was over ; that the state institutions that facilitated it must be reformed or privatised ; and that the public sector had to be trimmed and revamped in preparation for the inevitable increases in health - care and pensions costs resulting from the shrinking and ageing of Japan 's population . 
 Ex post 
 That is why a rather arcane subject , the privatisation of Japan Post , caused a big row in the Diet and took centre stage in the election . Japan Post includes a savings bank that accounts for 30 % of all personal deposits and a life insurer that has 40 % of that market ; and its yen330 trillion ( $ 3 trillion ) of assets have long provided the main funding for all those public - works schemes . Now that Junichiro Koizumi has won , Junichiro Koizumi will have , with the LDP 's small coalition partner , the Buddhist - backed New Komeito , a two - thirds majority in the lower house , which is enough for Junichiro Koizumi to override the upper house , which rejected the postal bills in August . Yet Junichiro Koizumi is no Thatcherite . In trimming back the public sector , Junichiro Koizumi represents a sort of accelerated continuity of policy since 1998 , not a sharp change . And look at Junichiro Koizumi's postal bills : although the savings bank will be made to operate in a more commercial manner from 2007 or 2008 , it will not be sold off until 2017 . 
 Beyond the postal privatisation , the government needs to do four main things in domestic policy . It needs to avoid messing up the economic recovery that is already under way , which argues against rapid cuts in public spending and against tax rises . It needs to dismantle the other institutions through which the state has guided and distorted the economy : Junichiro Koizumi has already reined in a mortgage lender , the Housing Loan Corporation , and next Junichiro Koizumi plans to do the same for the other eight state lenders . The government needs to sharpen competition in the private sector , partly by deregulating but more by strengthening antitrust enforcement : ideally , by elevating the Fair Trade Commission , the trustbuster , to cabinet status and giving it many more lawyers and inspectors . Finally , it needs to find ways to reform the two big future burdens on the public purse : health care and pensions . 
 Those tasks do not require Thatcher - style shock therapy : the time for that was the mid-1990s , and neither voters nor politicians wanted it . They need a long , steady process , with public - sector reform at the centre of the debate . That is what Junichiro Koizumi has achieved . Just do n't get excited about it .",740,Japan,A29-8209,IN TERM,True,"the prime minister , Junichiro Koizumi",26,True

IN A country that so often settles for mixed messages, the stunning victory of Junichiro Koizumi this week is a clear signal from Japan's voters. They are ready and eager to break with outworn special interests and modernise the ties between their government and the economy. The public may not know quite how to go about it; but having given their champion a clear mandate, and with economic recovery at last gathering force, the Japanese have more cause to be optimistic than they have had for a very long time.
Since he took over as prime minister in 2001, Mr Koizumi has complained loudly about the conservative ""forces of resistance"" that riddle his own Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has governed Japan almost continuously for the past half-century. For four years, however, he has had to temper those complaints with compromise, as his opponents in the LDP have blocked or diluted his efforts to shrink Japan's overweening state. A month ago, fed up, he decided to risk his career and plans publicly, with an election. On September 11th voters emphatically backed his message, rewarding his coalition with a two-thirds majority in parliament.
During the campaign, Mr Koizumi told the public repeatedly that he wanted the election to be about one issue: his plans to privatise the post office, which not only delivers the mail but is also the world's largest financial institution. Japan Post uses its network of 24,700 branches to collect state-subsidised bank deposits and life-insurance premiums from tens of millions of Japanese citizens, and thus controls a staggering yen330 trillion ($3 trillion) in household financial assets. Mr Koizumi wants to liberate that wealth from state hands, both to cut off the flow of funds to special interests and to let the market find better uses for Japan's massive pool of savings. 
When rejectionist members of his own party helped to defeat his plan in parliament, Mr Koizumi dissolved the lower house, called an election and refused to support the campaigns of the 37 lower-house LDP members who had opposed it. He then recruited a team of high-profile candidates--dubbed ""assassins"" by Japan's media--to challenge the LDP rebels in their home districts and campaign for postal privatisation. The result: Mr Koizumi's purged LDP won 296 of parliament's 480 seats, its biggest haul since 1986; the LDP and its coalition partner, the Buddhist-backed New Komeito, now hold a two-thirds majority that can overturn any upper-house vetoes; and 20 of the LDP rebels are no longer in office. As for Mr Koizumi himself, he is so popular that when he was found to have served Mimolette cheese, a pricey French import, to a colleague in his office, Japan's biggest online shop sold out of the stuff. 
Mr Koizumi's victory looks even more encouraging in light of the economic news. Japanese companies have been making bumper profits since 2002, helped by strong global demand and heavy Japanese investment in China. As those profits have worked their way through the economy, the country has begun to shake off the burdens that weighed it down after its asset-price bubble burst in 1990. Japan's banks, which played a central role in its long stagnation, are healthier than they have been in over a decade. And the overall economy is stringing together an increasingly reassuring record of growth. On September 12th, revised figures showed that GDP grew at a 3.3% annual rate in the second quarter.
More important, this gathering momentum is starting to feed through to Japan's labour market. Full-time employment has risen sharply this year. As the evidence of a jobs recovery has mounted over the past couple of months, it has fed hopes that higher wages and confident workers will spur consumer spending. Growing domestic demand will allow Japan's economy at last to begin rising of its own accord, without relying so much on a strong tailwind from exports and the global economy. 
It will also mean something else. Within a few months--perhaps by the time Japanese families are buying two-storey rice cakes for their New Year gatherings--Japan will be celebrating the return of inflation. In most other countries, that would hardly seem cause for cheer. But in Japan, where average prices--and wages--have been falling for nearly a decade, the deflationary spiral has done extensive damage to the economy. It has distorted markets, depressed revenues and delayed vital changes, while making the real burden of Japan's huge public debts--now 160% of GDP--seem all the more daunting. So it is great news indeed that those deflationary pressures are gradually easing, and should soon give way to rising prices.
The DPJ's usefulness
Between Mr Koizumi's winning campaign and the economy's growing strength, it is little wonder that investors are pleased. In the five weeks since the prime minister decided to dissolve parliament, Japan's stockmarket has risen by 10%. Yet some doubters are grumbling. Voters, they think, may have done more harm than good by handing Mr Koizumi's LDP such a huge victory. They also complain that his reform agenda, beyond postal privatisation, is fairly limited.
These criticisms stem from the LDP's dominance of Japanese politics. It has been in government for all but ten months since 1955, and has often acted less like a political party than like a club that allows the powerful to take turns in office. Many reformists have been counting on the emergence of two-party politics to spice up Japan's democracy. They point out that the main opposition party, the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), has tried to make politicians more accountable by publishing clear manifestos that outline its national plans. 
Those plans, moreover, call for reforms that are often more sweeping than anything Mr Koizumi has proposed. The DPJ wants to merge disparate pension schemes, to make them fairer and simpler, and to overhaul the health-care system and its finances, something that the LDP has helped the doctors' association to oppose. The opposition party has also campaigned to transfer more power from central bureaucrats to local governments; to cut public-works spending even more than Mr Koizumi has; and to slash the government's civil-service payroll by 20%. 
In short, the DPJ has been a handy opposition party to have around during the past few years, and could perhaps do Japan some good if it were to win power. Yet it lost more than one-third of its 177 seats this week, and must now try to hold itself together. As a result, Mr Koizumi's detractors argue, he has merely given a new lease to the LDP system that has held Japan back for so long.
These worries probably give too little weight to Mr Koizumi's own reformist message, and thus to the political importance of the resounding victory that he has just won. He has, after all, consistently pointed out the flaws in his own party, and has even threatened to destroy the LDP if necessary. He clearly wants to change the party, and has just helped a swathe of new LDP members to win office--many of them with urban constituents, who have different and broader interests from those of the old, rural-based LDP. And his mandate from the voters is resounding.
The prime minister's first act will be to privatise Japan Post. The immediate impact will be small, spread over the course of a decade beginning in 2007. But it will complement the ""big bang"" financial reforms enacted under Ryutaro Hashimoto in 1997, which deregulated some financial services and introduced more competition into Japan's capital markets. 
Mr Koizumi also hopes to follow this with reforms to the nine other public financial institutions that the government operates. These channel state-backed loans to a range of special interests, from small businesses to farmers to infrastructure projects. Mr Koizumi has already forced one of these institutions, the Housing Loan Corporation, to get out of the direct-lending business. Over the past few years, private banks have rushed in to fill the gap by supplying viable borrowers with mortgage loans. 
The prime minister will be lucky to accomplish much more than that during the next year. After that, LDP term limits require him to step down, and Mr Koizumi insists that he has no wish to amend those rules and stay in office. 
Steadily improving numbers
The economy is now in such good shape, however, that it can probably keep expanding on its own momentum, even if Mr Koizumi and his successors do little else by way of reform. Since the bursting of the bubble in 1990, Japan has had several economic upswings; each time, they have failed to take hold. This time looks different because it has begun to solve the underlying problems that have frustrated a lasting recovery. 
These structural flaws are invisible to those who have watched Japan's stagnation from a distance. Infrequent visitors to Tokyo invariably mention how contented and well-dressed the shoppers look as they walk along the capital's clean, safe streets. Much of the pain has been spread out across the countryside, where jobs have been lost, small firms have gone under and suicide rates have risen. 
Even without a visit to Tokyo, many outsiders cannot understand how a country with so much impressive technology, which it continues to export in quantity, could be in such trouble. Toyota and Honda, for example, continue to build new factories in North America, and are raking in profits there even as local firms such as Ford and General Motors struggle. But exports are only 10-12% of Japan's economy, and domestic demand has been moribund throughout the country's ""lost decade"". While Toyota was taking over the world, car sales in Japan fell by 16% between 1990 and 2001.
Although other countries have seen bubbles collapse, Japan had two particular disadvantages. First, it was saddled with masochistic central bankers who insisted that deflation would be good for Japan, much as bleeding was once considered the best treatment for the sick. Second, the country's business leaders, bankers, regulators and politicians conspired to ignore the true scale of Japan's bad debts in the wake of the bubble's collapse. Instead of using taxpayers' money to recapitalise banks, so that they could write off the loans to their worst borrowers, they looked the other way and hoped that it would somehow, some day, work out for the best. 
This led to huge misallocation of resources, as banks lent good money after bad in order to keep their deadbeat borrowers on life support a little longer. Anil Kashyap, an economist at the University of Chicago's business school, points out that in many sectors, such as construction and retailing, Japan was consistently channelling its resources towards the least efficient companies during the 1990s. 
In a deflationary environment, and with these insolvent companies undercutting them at every turn, even many of Japan's healthy companies could not turn their businesses round. Many of them cut costs heroically. But when everyone is slashing payrolls, then workers' pay, confidence and spending are all under pressure too, which makes it hard for anyone to boost revenues. 
Japan's setbacks were often blamed on other factors, such as an ill-advised increase in consumption taxes in 1997 and the global collapse of the information-technology sector in 2000. Those were not the real problem, however. With prices falling and the banking sector dysfunctional, Japan was simply too weak to withstand any downdrafts that it encountered.
A Chinese wind
That dreadful situation has at last begun to resolve itself over the past three years, as a helpful wind from China has finally stayed strong enough, for long enough. Japanese companies have been boosting their spending on new plants and equipment, as makers of cars, electronics and other goods began ramping up their investments in China and other overseas markets. Those companies then began buying more Japanese components and materials for their overseas factories. The resulting demand began to boost revenues; and because Japanese firms had already cut costs sharply, their profit margins began rising sharply too (see chart 1 on previous page).
Those higher profits, which Japan has now sustained for three years, have changed everything. As they continued to rise, spreading from big manufacturers to small ones, and then to many services companies, a whole swathe of corporate Japan is now able to pay its debts. The longer this profit boom has continued, the better life has become for Japan's lenders. The banks' bad loans have fallen dramatically, from yen28.4 trillion (8.7% of the total) in March 2002 to yen7.6 trillion (2.9%) now (see chart 2). And since their balance sheets are stronger, they have been able to cut off loans to the worst companies, which can no longer suck the life from their healthy competitors.
The firms that have survived this process are thus much fitter, on the whole, than they have been in years, and are confident enough to begin betting on Japan again. Jesper Koll, an economist at Merrill Lynch in Tokyo, points out that besides building factories in China, Japanese firms such as Canon and Toshiba are investing in new plants in Japan again as well.
Companies are also hiring again. The unemployment rate has fallen from 5.4% at its peak to 4.4%. The ratio of job offers per applicant is at its highest level since 1992 (see chart 3). And after a couple of years of expanding using temporary and part-time workers, Japanese firms have begun to take on more full-time staff. Wages are starting to rise, and reliably higher spending does not seem far behind. Toyota, though still keen on exports and overseas factories, is now selling its luxury Lexus cars in its home market for the first time.
In short, Japan is entering a new phase of sustainable economic growth, regardless of what Mr Koizumi does or fails to do. This does not mean that politics is irrelevant, however. Even as Japan begins to look more like a normal advanced economy, it will still have the same problems as other rich countries.
Indeed, Japan's challenges will remain, in many ways, tougher. Not only will it face a demographic crunch sooner--its population will begin shrinking by 2007, and may already have begun to do so--but it is burdened with the leftover costs of its go-slow approach to the bursting bubble. 
One of these is a young workforce that is still largely untested. A generation of young Japanese has grown up with part-time jobs, temporary work and a breakdown of vertical authority, in a system that long relied on stable employment and seniority to give workers the training they needed. If this cohort of workers emerges with weaker skills than previous ones, it will be harder to boost productivity and hence long-term growth. Nor can Japan rely on imported labour for a jolt, since it is still squeamish about immigrants.
Still, the news for this generation is hardly all bad. They value creativity more, and have more choices open to them, than their predecessors. Women still have far fewer opportunities than their counterparts in western democracies, but their situation is also improving. Every week, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's biggest business daily, carries a ""working woman"" section filled with career and investment advice. Young women no longer have to leave the country to shine.
The other challenging set of hangovers relates to Japan's public debt, and that is why Mr Koizumi's emphatic victory this week is so welcome. If he indeed steps down next September, he will scarcely be able to touch the problem before he passes the torch. Fortunately, however, many of the changes that have accelerated on his watch are starting to look irreversible. His main contribution to Japan has been to build on changes in the political system that were already under way, and to show future politicians how powerful those new tools can be if used well. 
Mr Koizumi has done this by building on the gradual reforms of his predecessors. These have laid the groundwork for more powerful cabinets, which should make it easier for future prime ministers to set their own agendas. He has also brought a lot of fresh blood into the LDP, and given its leaders more authority. Perhaps most important, Mr Koizumi has used this election to demonstrate to everyone, including the voters themselves, just how much the electorate has changed, and matured, over the course of Japan's dismal decade.","Junichiro Koizumi's landslide victory will solve only some of Japan 's problems .

 Japan 's setbacks were often blamed on other factors , such as an ill - advised increase in consumption taxes in 1997 and the global collapse of the information - technology sector in 2000 . Those were not the real problem , however . With prices falling and the banking sector dysfunctional , Japan was simply too weak to withstand any downdrafts that it encountered . 
 A Chinese wind 
 That dreadful situation has at last begun to resolve itself over the past three years , as a helpful wind from China has finally stayed strong enough , for long enough . Japanese companies have been boosting their spending on new plants and equipment , as makers of cars , electronics and other goods began ramping up their investments in China and other overseas markets . Those companies then began buying more Japanese components and materials for their overseas factories . The resulting demand began to boost revenues ; and because Japanese firms had already cut costs sharply , their profit margins began rising sharply too ( see chart 1 on previous page ) . 
 Those higher profits , which Japan has now sustained for three years , have changed everything . As they continued to rise , spreading from big manufacturers to small ones , and then to many services companies , a whole swathe of corporate Japan is now able to pay its debts . The longer this profit boom has continued , the better life has become for Japan 's lenders . The banks ' bad loans have fallen dramatically , from yen28.4 trillion ( 8.7 % of the total ) in March 2002 to yen7.6 trillion ( 2.9 % ) now ( see chart 2 ) . And since their balance sheets are stronger , they have been able to cut off loans to the worst companies , which can no longer suck the life from their healthy competitors . 
 The firms that have survived this process are thus much fitter , on the whole , than they have been in years , and are confident enough to begin betting on Japan again . Jesper Koll , an economist at Merrill Lynch in Tokyo , points out that besides building factories in China , Japanese firms such as Canon and Toshiba are investing in new plants in Japan again as well . 
 Companies are also hiring again . The unemployment rate has fallen from 5.4 % at its peak to 4.4 % . The ratio of job offers per applicant is at its highest level since 1992 ( see chart 3 ) . And after a couple of years of expanding using temporary and part - time workers , Japanese firms have begun to take on more full - time staff . Wages are starting to rise , and reliably higher spending does not seem far behind . Toyota , though still keen on exports and overseas factories , is now selling its luxury Lexus cars in its home market for the first time . 
 In short , Japan is entering a new phase of sustainable economic growth , regardless of what Junichiro Koizumi does or fails to do . This does not mean that politics is irrelevant , however . Even as Japan begins to look more like a normal advanced economy , it will still have the same problems as other rich countries . 
 Indeed , Japan 's challenges will remain , in many ways , tougher . Not only will it face a demographic crunch sooner -- its population will begin shrinking by 2007 , and may already have begun to do so -- but it is burdened with the leftover costs of its go - slow approach to the bursting bubble . 
 One of these is a young workforce that is still largely untested . A generation of young Japanese has grown up with part - time jobs , temporary work and a breakdown of vertical authority , in a system that long relied on stable employment and seniority to give workers the training they needed . If this cohort of workers emerges with weaker skills than previous ones , it will be harder to boost productivity and hence long - term growth . Nor can Japan rely on imported labour for a jolt , since it is still squeamish about immigrants . 
 Still , the news for this generation is hardly all bad . They value creativity more , and have more choices open to them , than their predecessors . Women still have far fewer opportunities than their counterparts in western democracies , but their situation is also improving . Every week , the Nihon Keizai Shimbun , Japan 's biggest business daily , carries a "" working woman "" section filled with career and investment advice . Young women no longer have to leave the country to shine . 
 The other challenging set of hangovers relates to Japan 's public debt , and that is why Junichiro Koizumi's emphatic victory this week is so welcome . If Junichiro Koizumi indeed steps down next September , Junichiro Koizumi will scarcely be able to touch the problem before Junichiro Koizumi passes the torch . Fortunately , however , many of the changes that have accelerated on Junichiro Koizumi's watch are starting to look irreversible . Junichiro Koizumi's main contribution to Japan has been to build on changes in the political system that were already under way , and to show future politicians how powerful those new tools can be if used well . 
 Junichiro Koizumi has done this by building on the gradual reforms of Junichiro Koizumi's predecessors . These have laid the groundwork for more powerful cabinets , which should make it easier for future prime ministers to set their own agendas . Junichiro Koizumi has also brought a lot of fresh blood into the LDP , and given its leaders more authority . Perhaps most important , Junichiro Koizumi has used this election to demonstrate to everyone , including the voters themselves , just how much the electorate has changed , and matured , over the course of Japan 's dismal decade .",740,Japan,A29-8209,IN TERM,True,Junichiro Koizumi,62,True

FOR much of the past two decades, Japan has been cast as the villain of the global economy because of its large saving surplus. In the mid-1980s, when America was last running large external deficits, the Reagan administration berated the Japanese for their trade barriers and their unwillingness to consume American goods. In the 1990s, the Clinton administration lectured them for relying on exports instead of sorting out their moribund domestic economy. 
Today, in contrast, there is little Japan-bashing, even though as a share of Japan's total economy the country's current-account surplus is now even bigger than it was in the 1990s (see chart 5). Instead, America's attention has shifted to China, with its soaring foreign-exchange reserves and (until recently) fixed currency. But Japan remains an important factor in the global imbalances. Its central bank still holds the largest stash of dollar reserves. A big drop in Japan's capital exports could quickly end the global saving glut. But is that likely?
With only a handful of exceptions, Japan has run a saving surplus every year since the late 1960s, but its underlying saving and investment patterns have varied a great deal. Back in the 1960s, Japan was a young, fast-growing economy, with high investment rates and even higher saving rates. Today Japan is an old, low-saving country. The trouble is that investment is even lower. 
In the 1960s and 1970s, the household saving rate soared, giving rise to the idea that the Japanese were peculiarly frugal people. In fact, their behaviour was unexceptional. Charles Yuji Horioka, an economist at Osaka University, argues that the Japanese household saving rate rose sharply in the 1960s and 1970s because the country was growing rapidly; there was little consumer credit; the population was young; and there was little pension provision (Japan had only a modest state pension scheme until 1973). 
None of this applies any more. Consumer credit is widely available (Japanese households' debt was 136% of their income in 2000, more than in America). The economy has been stagnant for a decade. And the Japanese have grown old. The share of pensioners in the population is surpassed only by Italy and Sweden. Not surprisingly, household saving has plummeted, from its peak of 23% of disposable income in 1976 to 15% in the 1980s, 10% in the 1990s and around 6% today (see chart 6). Twenty years ago, Japan's household saving rate was almost twice as high as the OECD average; today it is merely average.
Given this drop in household saving rates, why has Japan's current-account remained in surplus? Again, the reasons have changed over time. In the early 1980s, firms were investing more slowly and the government's fiscal position improved. By the late 1980s, private investment was soaring, swept along by the stock and property bubble. The current-account surplus shrank, but remained positive.
Then the bubble burst. Stock prices and then property prices plunged. Investment collapsed and corporate saving rocketed. With Japan's government unable, or unwilling, to clean up the banks' loan portfolios or force restructuring of the weakest firms, Japanese firms have spent the past decade painfully working off their earlier excesses. All profits have gone into improving firms' balance sheets. In the late 1980s, firms were borrowing from households at the rate of almost 10% of GDP a year. For the past decade they have been paying down debt or building up cash balances at a similar rate. 
Japan's government, in contrast, has been dis-saving for a decade. Japanese politicians like to blame failed Keynesian stimulus packages; in fact, the country's budget deficits were caused mainly by economic stagnation. With growth weak and prices falling, tax revenues plunged. For the past ten years the budget deficit has been running at an average of 6% of GDP, and Japan's levels of government debt are now by far the highest of any rich country. But even record budget deficits and falling household saving could not counteract the scale of corporate thrift. Japan's current-acount surplus has been rising. 
Will that change? The answer hinges mainly on whether Japanese firms start investing again. Optimists have been repeatedly disappointed over the past ten years. There were a few mini-recoveries, but they relied on export growth rather than domestic investment, and none lasted long. 
Land of rising investment?
But now the mood in Tokyo is more upbeat, and for good reason. The economy has been growing at a respectable rate for two years. After ten years of painful adjustment, corporate balance sheets are looking healthy. The banking system has been cleaned up. Firms are beginning to hire again and wages are picking up. The jobless rate is at its lowest level for seven years. Even land prices in Tokyo are beginning to rise. All this suggests that domestic investment could recover. Given Japan's demographics and its firms' memory of the past decade, no one expects an investment binge, but a gradual rise is likely. 
What about Japanese households? In the long term, demographic pressure will push the saving rate down further as more people retire. But in the short term, household saving could rebound, particularly if people were drawing down savings while the economy was weak. Mr Horioka thinks that demographics will prove the stronger factor, and expects the household saving rate to turn to zero or even negative by 2010. The IMF is more circumspect. In its latest analysis of Japan, it forecasts that household saving will fall to around 3.5% of GDP by 2010, a drop of about 2.5 percentage points from its current level. 
Given the improved investment outlook and the secular decline in household thrift, it seems clear that Japan's current-account surplus ought to fall. But Japan's new government is adding a new factor to the equation. With public debt already so high and the population ageing so quickly, Japanese politicians are nervous about their fiscal deficits. 
There has already been some fiscal tightening. Spending on public infrastructure, for instance, has fallen sharply in the past couple of years. Moderate tax hikes are slated for 2006 and 2007. Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, has promised not to raise the consumption tax under his watch, but no one is ruling out other measures. Much depends on how strong the recovery proves to be. Paul Sheard of Lehman Brothers, an investment bank, reckons that stronger growth in Japan will trigger more fiscal tightening.
Mr Koizumi's landslide election victory on September 11th strengthens that impulse. The prime minister had called the election because the old guard of his party, the Liberal Democrats, opposed the privatisation of Japan's postal savings system, a big financier of poorly allocated public spending. This issue was code for an even larger one: reducing the size of the state, and its borrowing. Now Mr Koizumi has a strong mandate to do more of that.
A tighter fiscal policy will counteract lower household saving and higher investment, so the overall effect on the current-account surplus is hard to gauge. Most official forecasts suggest that Japan's current-account surplus will decline gradually. But Japanese technocrats seem to see things differently. When the Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy, Japan's cabinet-level steering group for the economy, released a set of long-term fiscal and economic projections in January, it actually forecast a bigger current-account surplus in 2012 than today. 
The council expects a marked improvement in the government's finances, with the deficit falling from 7% of GDP to around 4%. It sees only a modest drop in Japan's private-sector saving surplus, from 11% of GDP in 2004 to 9% in 2012. If this comes to pass, the current-account surplus could rise to 5% of GDP in 2012. This is only a forecast, but it tempers hopes for a rapid turnaround in Japan's saving surplus.","Japan is getting older but its economy is looking perkier .

EUROPEAN reformers have greeted the German election result with the desperate optimism of the Victorian Brits, holed up in the Indian city of Lucknow, who hoped against hope for rescue (""Dinna ye hear it?--dinna ye hear it? The pipes o' Havelock sound!""). It was Angela Merkel that failed, they say, not reform. She was a bad campaigner. Her programme was half-hearted because regional barons stifled her zeal. Voters were spooked by fears of a flat tax that was not party policy. Anyway, Gerhard Schroder had governed as a reformer.
All true. And all specious. The fact is that Mr Schroder called the election because his reforms had been rejected (he had lost all but one of the state polls since he announced the changes in 2003). Ms Merkel failed because she wanted to go faster. Contrast the German result with Japan, where Junichiro Koizumi also held a ballot because reforms were being stymied by his party. He won a decisive mandate. Had the German vote shown up similar sentiments, Europeans would now be hailing a boost to reform in a Union that has drifted since its proposed constitution was rejected in May. Instead, the election outcome is a setback for change, and for the whole European Union.
It is a blow to the EU because it means that both France and Germany--its strongest members--are now at risk of paralysis. Defeat in the constitutional vote stripped Jacques Chirac of credibility in Europe. Now Germany's voice will be muffled too. It is unclear who will be its next chancellor, which parties will form its new government and how stable it will be; but in any case, a weakened, introvert Germany seems even less likely than before to lead the EU forward. In a club of 25, of course, France and Germany cannot stitch up European policy as they used to. But it is still unusual, and worrying, when both seize up at once. Both are likely to grow more defensive, whether separately or in tandem. The EU will feel the creeping malaise.
Things could get worse. Over the next two years, the other two big economic powers in the euro area will also hold elections. Next up is Italy, where the leader of the movement challenging Silvio Berlusconi is a former EU commission president. This will tempt the prime minister to run as a Eurosceptic. If he were to win, the lesson from Germany and Italy would be that the key to electoral success in Europe lies either in stressing the need to ""balance"" reform (as Mr Schroder did) or in bashing the EU. That does not automatically mean the French, who vote for a president in 2007, will go down the same road. But their election campaign may well be fought on familiar (pro- or anti-reform) turf; after all, the referendum in France was dominated by talk of globalisation, economic stagnation and the ""Anglo-Saxon"" attitudes of the European Commission. Railing against the beasts from Brussels who are ruining our welfare states is becoming standard fare in election campaigns. In country after country, debate about reform is fractious; opposition to it is well galvanised.
That is not the same as saying European electorates have become hostile to liberalisation. The broad voting pattern in Germany was quite close to the one in Britain that produced a solid majority for the reformer Tony Blair. Ms Merkel's coalition got almost exactly the same share of the vote as his Labour Party; the difference in outcome was dictated in part by political systems, not by a vast contrast between Britons and Germans. It is also fair to add that the rise in the Free Democrats' vote points to a constituency for faster reform in Germany. 
But the result is still worrying because it reflects a deep-seated ambivalence among voters across Europe. During the campaign, three-quarters of Germans identified ""reform"" as the only cure for their country's malaise. On the day, over half plumped for parties campaigning for little or no change. In France, the polls show worries about globalisation are only one of many national preoccupations; meanwhile small firms and shopkeepers are among the most admired institutions. Yet the French still rejected the EU constitution, partly in protest against the very forces of competition they claim not to fear. 
A half-grasped nettle
The good news is that many Europeans realise things cannot go on as they are. The bad news is that they are loth to do anything decisive about it. The question is whether this consensus, in favour of doing nothing, will one day lurch towards reform.
The mere fact that Europeans are ambivalent is worth something: it is better than being in denial about the need for change. Resistance to reform is also greater in large countries than small ones, such as the Scandinavian states and the Netherlands, probably because (being small) they are used to external pressures. It is also worth pointing out that EU governments, however queasy, can't avoid at least trying to reform: the constraints that demography places on welfare systems will not go away. 
But the fact remains that so long as voters are in two minds about this process, pro-reform majorities will be hard to achieve unless (as in Britain) the electoral system provides one. Ambivalence is likely to continue. What the German election showed is that while Europe's status quo is unsustainable (and voters know it), it is also comfortable, and too many voters enjoy that comfort too much to vote for change.
German voters rightly fretted over unemployment. But they should worry, too, about the employment rate: just one-third of citizens have full-time jobs; so each worker supports two others, and there are as many people on some form of benefit as in permanent employment. The German case is extreme, but most European states face similar pressures. This is not a sustainable social and economic system. Logically, this situation should go on producing votes against change until things become so bad that, as Britain found in 1979, ""there is no alternative"". For the time being, Europe does have an alternative: a genteel but depressing process of stagnation.","Make us reform , but not yet , say Europe 's voters

 It is a blow to the EU because it means that both France and Germany -- its strongest members -- are now at risk of paralysis . Defeat in the constitutional vote stripped Jacques Chirac of credibility in Europe . Now Germany 's voice will be muffled too . It is unclear who will be its next chancellor , which parties will form its new government and how stable it will be ; but in any case , a weakened , introvert Germany seems even less likely than before to lead the EU forward . In a club of 25 , of course , France and Germany can not stitch up European policy as they used to . But it is still unusual , and worrying , when both seize up at once . Both are likely to grow more defensive , whether separately or in tandem . The EU will feel the creeping malaise . 
 Things could get worse . Over the next two years , the other two big economic powers in the euro area will also hold elections . Next up is Italy , where the leader of the movement challenging Silvio Berlusconi is a former EU commission president . This will tempt the prime minister to run as a Eurosceptic . If he were to win , the lesson from Germany and Italy would be that the key to electoral success in Europe lies either in stressing the need to "" balance "" reform ( as Mr Schroder did ) or in bashing the EU . That does not automatically mean the French , who vote for a president in 2007 , will go down the same road . But their election campaign may well be fought on familiar ( pro- or anti - reform ) turf ; after all , the referendum in France was dominated by talk of globalisation , economic stagnation and the "" Anglo - Saxon "" attitudes of the European Commission . Railing against the beasts from Brussels who are ruining our welfare states is becoming standard fare in election campaigns . In country after country , debate about reform is fractious ; opposition to it is well galvanised . 
 That is not the same as saying European electorates have become hostile to liberalisation . The broad voting pattern in Germany was quite close to the one in Britain that produced a solid majority for the reformer Tony Blair . Ms Merkel 's coalition got almost exactly the same share of the vote as his Labour Party ; the difference in outcome was dictated in part by political systems , not by a vast contrast between Britons and Germans . It is also fair to add that the rise in the Free Democrats ' vote points to a constituency for faster reform in Germany . 
 But the result is still worrying because it reflects a deep - seated ambivalence among voters across Europe . During the campaign , three - quarters of Germans identified "" reform "" as the only cure for their country 's malaise . On the day , over half plumped for parties campaigning for little or no change . In France , the polls show worries about globalisation are only one of many national preoccupations ; meanwhile small firms and shopkeepers are among the most admired institutions . Yet the French still rejected the EU constitution , partly in protest against the very forces of competition they claim not to fear . 
 A half - grasped nettle 
 The good news is that many Europeans realise things can not go on as they are . The bad news is that they are loth to do anything decisive about it . The question is whether this consensus , in favour of doing nothing , will one day lurch towards reform . 
 The mere fact that Europeans are ambivalent is worth something : it is better than being in denial about the need for change . Resistance to reform is also greater in large countries than small ones , such as the Scandinavian states and the Netherlands , probably because ( being small ) they are used to external pressures . It is also worth pointing out that EU governments , however queasy , ca n't avoid at least trying to reform : the constraints that demography places on welfare systems will not go away . 
 But the fact remains that so long as voters are in two minds about this process , pro - reform majorities will be hard to achieve unless ( as in Britain ) the electoral system provides one . Ambivalence is likely to continue . What the German election showed is that while Europe 's status quo is unsustainable ( and voters know it ) , it is also comfortable , and too many voters enjoy that comfort too much to vote for change . 
 German voters rightly fretted over unemployment . But they should worry , too , about the employment rate : just one - third of citizens have full - time jobs ; so each worker supports two others , and there are as many people on some form of benefit as in permanent employment . The German case is extreme , but most European states face similar pressures . This is not a sustainable social and economic system . Logically , this situation should go on producing votes against change until things become so bad that , as Britain found in 1979 , "" there is no alternative "" . For the time being , Europe does have an alternative : a genteel but depressing process of stagnation .",740,Japan,A29-8209,IN TERM,True,Junichiro Koizumi,3,True

Alas, before Seiji Maehara could take over as head of the Democratic Party of Japan, the DPJ had to lose another election and its previous leader, Katsuya Okada, had to resign. Unfortunately, Mr Okada did not just perform badly before giving up his post. He first made a terrible decision--to have the DPJ vote against Junichiro Koizumi's postal privatisation scheme this summer--and then let the prime minister run rings around him in the campaign that followed.
So on September 17th, a week after losing more than one-third of their 177 seats in the lower house of parliament, stunned DPJ members chose the 43-year-old Mr Maehara as their new leader. He is the fourth opposition leader Mr Koizumi has faced in his four-and-a-half years as prime minister, and his main task is to find a new role for the battered opposition.
Its previous, self-proclaimed, role now seems irrelevant. That was to foster reform by engineering a change of government and replacing the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has governed Japan almost continuously since 1955. Now that the DPJ has only 113 seats in the 480-seat lower house, those dreams are clearly on hold. Instead, Mr Maehara must settle for trying to hold the LDP to its promises, while gradually restoring some of his party's shattered reputation. In the process, he can still probably do Japan some good.
Mr Maehara will certainly be a match for Mr Koizumi on foreign policy. The prime minister has too often seemed to stray from a laudable version of Japanese assertiveness, involving more confidence and a greater global role, to one that seems needlessly close to an old-style nationalism that does the country no favours. 
Mr Maehara has championed the first sort, arguing that Japan should shake off the timidity and self-doubt that have kept its ""self-defence forces"" from playing a useful role in international peacekeeping. He wants to update some of the rules so that, for example, Japanese troops in Iraq can defend themselves and others more effectively if attacked. While making the case for this sort of modernisation, the articulate and telegenic Mr Maehara may prove adept at taking the prime minister to task for provoking Japan's neighbours by, for instance, visiting the Yasukuni war-dead shrine in Tokyo.
Although it is not Mr Maehara's forte, there will also be important domestic issues to debate. The DPJ's new leader seems wise enough to accept that postal privatisation is not one of them. Voters clearly agree with Mr Koizumi that Japan Post's yen330 trillion ($3 trillion) of assets no longer belong in state hands, and have just handed him a two-thirds majority to prove it. Mr Maehara will no doubt point out the flaws in the LDP's implementation during a special parliamentary session this autumn to pass the privatisation bills. But otherwise there is little left to debate.
Instead, Mr Maehara is gearing up for battles over pensions and health care, which voters probably care much more about. On these issues, there is much of substance to discuss. Despite taking helpful steps last year to close a financing gap in the pension system, Mr Koizumi has said little more about either issue publicly. The DPJ will press for more sweeping changes.
Apart from that, the main issues on which the LDP will be tested involve its willingness to shrink the state now that Mr Koizumi has won it a large majority. The DPJ campaigned for deeper cuts than Mr Koizumi has offered, but many of its members are former Socialists who dislike this idea. Mr Maehara may upset them by arguing for more cuts, but he will probably do it anyway. Now that the party is so weak, it matters less that it is also divided.

TAKAFUMI HORIE is proof of the rewards of failure--and of ""Livin' on the edge"", which is what he called his company until he bought an internet portal called livedoor and adopted its name. This 32-year-old's daring takeover bid earlier this year for the venerable media group Fujisankei Communications, via its radio subsidiary Nippon Broadcasting System, ended in defeat: Fuji found a white knight to hold a blocking slab of its shares and forced Mr Horie to retreat with only a small profit and a modest business deal between Fuji and livedoor. In July 2004 his bid for a baseball team, the Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes, also failed. Yet the attendant publicity helped livedoor hugely: page views at its portal in June this year were more than six times higher than a year earlier, and the company has raised its advertising rates twice in less than six months. It remains a distant third in the internet portal business behind Yahoo! Japan and Rakuten, but its share price has stayed high despite stock dilution and the Fuji bid's failure, and its earnings multiple is higher than that of Yahoo! Japan.
""The nail that sticks up"", runs a hoary Japanese saying, ""gets hammered down."" Yet Mr Horie is an upstanding nail who has become famous as well as much admired, according to opinion polls, for his willingness to challenge old ways of doing things. He even ran (unsuccessfully) for the Diet in September's elections. And he is not alone in breaking taboos. Hot on the heels of his bid, in July a young construction design firm, Yumeshin Holdings, launched a hostile tender offer for an older firm, Japan Engineering Consultants. And last year Sumitomo-Mitsui Financial Group, one of Japan's biggest banks, barged its way into a friendly merger deal between two other mega-banks, Mitsubishi-Tokyo Financial Group (MTFG) and UFJ Holdings, offering to buy UFJ for a specified price. That may sound mundane, but to Japanese sensibilities it was shocking, because UFJ's board had already accepted the merger proposal, even though no price had been set.
A related bank, Sumitomo Trust, weighed in too, seeking a court injunction to block the MTFG-UFJ merger on the ground that it violated a prior deal under which it was to buy a UFJ division. In the end, after a protracted battle in the courts and the capital markets, MTFG prevailed, but only at a cost: cash compensation for Sumitomo Trust, a big cash injection into UFJ to help it deal with its bad loans and a higher price for shareholders than it would otherwise have been paying.
The livedoor-Fuji battle, the Yumeshin bid and the mega-bank sumo-wrestling match illustrate three important developments. The first is a new willingness to use the courts as arbiters in corporate disputes, which reflects both changes in attitudes and changes in the law. Livedoor managed to get several of Fuji's attempted defence manoeuvres struck down by the courts before Fuji's white knight came along. Yumeshin failed to block Japan Engineering's defences of a stock split and an equity warrant issue, but the Tokyo District Court laid down reassuring criteria for their use: that they must not simply be in the board's self-interest, and that they are subject to shareholders' approval. 
Secondly, a change in the ownership pattern of publicly traded shares is making transactions and challenges easier. In 1992, according to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, 46% of all listed equities were held as cross-shareholdings by related companies, and only 6% by foreign investors. In 2004, cross-shareholdings accounted for merely 24% of shares whereas foreign ownership had risen to 22% of the total. However, that foreign slice is volatile, moving up and down along with investing institutions' perception of the Japanese market. Cross-shareholdings first became prominent during a fright about hostile takeovers in the 1960s, so there is a chance that scared managements may now seek to rebuild them. Against that, though, new capital-adequacy rules due to take effect in 2006-07 will force Japanese banks to sell more of their holdings.
The third development is still small but is emerging steadily. It is the arrival on the scene of funds and partnerships willing to use their investments to challenge existing managements or to act as intermediaries to facilitate mergers and disposals. One example is M&A Consulting, a shareholder-activist fund that also profited from building a stake in Nippon Broadcasting System earlier this year, and which has specialised in pressing managements to use their cash piles to raise dividends and make share buybacks. Another is Privee Zurich Turnaround Group, a private-equity fund which despite its name is thoroughly Japanese, and which has also flirted with hostile bids. A third is Advantage Partners, a private-equity investor chiefly in the business of acquiring assets from companies being split up or turned around.
Alongside these new Japanese species there are the larger and more familiar foreign funds: Ripplewood Holdings, which with J.C. Flowers & Co made a fortune by buying Shinsei Bank, formerly Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, from the government in 2000 and transforming it; Carlyle Group; Lone Star; Cerberus; and several others. By and large, though, it is the Japanese upstarts that are acting most aggressively, whereas the foreign funds try to stress how socially responsible they are.
Both make up only a small slice of market activity. But no matter: in any business, pressure on the margin can influence the rest. To some degree, indeed, these ginger groups have been encouraged by people in the Japanese establishment with just that thought in mind. Mr Horie may be an outsider, but plenty of the activist funds are run and staffed by well-connected former bureaucrats and by people in their 30s and 40s who lost their jobs or their loyalty during the banking meltdown of the 1990s. M&A Consulting, for example, is run by three partners, two of whom are former bureaucrats and the third used to work for Nomura Securities. An early investor in the firm, and a crucial provider of introductions, was Toshihiko Fukui, before he became governor of the Bank of Japan. Similarly, Ripplewood managed to recruit several senior Japanese to its board, including Minoru Makihara, then chairman of Mitsubishi Corporation, the trading and investment firm that epitomises the Japanese establishment.
The livedoor bid for Fuji illustrated another point about Japanese capitalism: that for a seemingly cosseted, conformist activity, it is strikingly unregulated. When almost everyone obeys unwritten rules, little attention needs to be paid to the written ones. So the supposedly heroic Mr Horie was able to mount his bid in ways that would be considered outrageous in London or New York: he built up his 35% stake in NBS in off-market trading, diluted his own investors' shareholdings without consulting them and never offered a standard price to all NBS shareholders. 
The wild west goes east
Part of the problem is that takeovers and other pressures from shareholders were long considered taboo or irrelevant. The protective role of main banks and cross-shareholdings was enough to regulate matters. Now that both of those protections are weakening, there is a fairly broad consensus that the law and the regulatory system need to be changed. But that change is happening slowly. An optimistic view is that the process is at roughly the halfway stage. Still, some important progress has already been made.
One of the worst corporate sins of the 1980s was the use of subsidiaries to hide problems, park surplus staff or disguise adventures: they did not have to be consolidated into profit-and-loss accounts. New holding-company and accounting laws in 1999-2001 changed that. A so-called ""big bang"" of financial reform in 1998 was in truth more like a slow drum roll, but it brought in a new regulatory body, the Financial Services Agency, with the job of supervising financial institutions and accounting practices. 
One obstacle to firms selling divisions and subsidiaries to each other was a rule that required an appraisal of all the division's assets by a court-appointed inspector. In 2000 a new law abolished that rule for ""non-core"" business units, defined as small, underperforming ones. That does not go far enough--firms ought to be free to sell what they like--but it has stimulated a lot of trading in distressed assets. Another new rule has reduced the capital requirement for new limited companies to just yen1, down from yen3m.
Virtually the whole of the Japanese commercial code is being overhauled along similar lines. Nevertheless, with politicians afraid of instability and especially foreign takeovers, and under pressure from big employers, many of the reforms so far have been as helpful to corporate defence as offence. Laws already passed have permitted companies to offer shares with differential voting rights, to grant stock acquisition rights through options and warrants, and to set up such provisions as a ""poison pill"" to be deployed in the event of a takeover bid. 
On the other hand, the law has defined the proper purposes of such measures as well as the need for shareholder meetings to approve them. And it has made proxy votes against such measures easier. All that has helped boost the role of the courts. Earlier this year the Tokyo District Court rejected a crude poison pill proposed by Nireco, an instrument-maker. 
The role of shareholders has been boosted too: at the spate of annual meetings on June 29th shareholders rejected poison-pill proposals at several big firms, including Tokyo Electron, Fanuc and Yokogawa Electric. Many other similar proposals passed, but significantly even some Japanese institutional investors took part in anti-management votes. Previously they had been quiescent. 
One provision the Diet (parliament) considered too hot to handle was a reform to allow foreign firms to use their own shares as currency in acquisitions in Japan, whether hostile or friendly. This would bring the rules for foreigners into line with those already in place for Japanese companies. But in April the measure was postponed for a year. Unless there is a big controversial cross-border battle in the meantime, however, it stands a good chance of being passed in due course. 
Another area of law that needs further refinement is the definition in corporate governance of outside directors: they have been given an enhanced role, especially in big firms that choose to adopt an American-style board committee system, but there is no requirement that they be wholly independent. Seibu, a railway and property giant whose autocratic boss, Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, was charged with fraud earlier this year, held no board meetings for seven years. It did have outside directors, but they all had business relationships with Mr Tsutsumi.
For all the fuss over hostile takeovers, however, such battles are rare even in America, which sees barely one each year. Even the theoretical possibility of such an event, though, helps put pressure on managements to improve their profits as well as to pay dividends to shareholders. Japanese corporate profits are at a record high mainly for other reasons, but market pressure has literally paid dividends: in the past seven years the dividend yield for firms listed in Tokyo has almost doubled (see chart 3). 
Even so, the most important sort of transaction, in Japan as in America, is the friendly sort, whether involving whole firms or divisions of them. In the first eight months of this year, according to the Nihon Keizai financial daily, 1,735 M&A deals were completed, 28% up on a year earlier. 
As James Abegglen, a veteran consultant and scholar in Tokyo, observes in his recent book, ""Redesigning the Kaisha"", the consolidation of whole industries during the past decade has been impressive: from 14 oil companies to four; from seven big cement firms to three; from 14 pulp and paper companies to three; from seven industrial gas firms to three; from five big steel firms to four; from 15 big banks to just three. And big companies have traded or closed thousands of subsidiaries. 
More competition, please
Neither the lawyers nor the financial advisers have been idle. Many of Japan's biggest and most internationally famed firms are now more focused and efficient than before. Their scale and new concentration will make it easier for them to compete abroad. But for them, and even more for the huge array of domestic firms, there is another, more important question: is there enough competition at home to keep them all on their toes? 
Deregulation during the 1990s, in fields such as telecoms, transport, energy, finance and retailing, benefited consumers to the tune of 4.6% of GDP in 2002, or so the Cabinet Office claims. This certainly helped, though the OECD reports that Japanese electricity and telecoms prices, for example, remain the highest among that organisation's rich-country members. But perhaps the biggest issue now is whether Japanese anti-monopoly laws stand a chance of being enforced.
There is certainly some political will to do so. Amendments to antitrust law passed by the Diet in April and due to come into effect early in 2006 will bring four main changes: an increase in the penalties for breaking the law from 6% of affected sales for most large firms to 10%, with surcharges for repeat offenders; the introduction of a new incentive for cartel members to blow the whistle by offering discounted fines for those who come clean early; new powers for the Fair Trade Commission, Japan's trust-buster, to make raids and seize documents; and new powers for the FTC to issue cease-and-desist orders before holding a hearing rather than waiting until afterwards. 
That all sounds robust, and the new law was passed despite opposition to its first draft from big businesses. Yet those penalties remain lower than those used in the European Union and America. And in the past Japan has been none too assiduous in enforcing what legislation it had in this area. The OECD notes that there have been only 13 criminal antitrust cases in Japan since 1950, and that no one has ever gone to jail for breaking competition law. 
Until 2002 the FTC was a small body with a low status, firmly under a ministry's thumb. However, one of the less noticed moves of the prime minister, Mr Koizumi, was that he shifted the FTC so that it now reports directly to the Cabinet Office, and gave it a new boss and a bit more money. Whereas in 1995 the FTC had 220 investigators and a budget of yen5.24 billion, last year it had 331 investigators and a budget of yen7.82 billion.
There are some omens that bode well for stronger enforcement. Just as the courts have played a bigger role in securities disputes, so the Tokyo Stock Exchange acted decisively when Seibu's frauds were disclosed, forcing the firm to delist in December last year. The FTC too has become more active. In March it fined six steel firms a total of yen6.8 billion for price-fixing. Barely a week goes by without an FTC raid or an indictment of a construction company or a member of staff of the Japan Public Highway Corporation, a soon-to-be-privatised government agency, for rigging bids for bridge contracts. In May, the FTC filed a criminal prosecution of eight such companies.
It could be argued, though, that the TSE acted only once the game was up for Seibu. The bridge scandal too has been convenient for the government: Mr Koizumi wanted to show that privatisation will make a big difference, and to discredit the agency's top bureaucrats sufficiently to ensure that they cannot scupper the plan. Yet if competition enforcement is simply a product of the political winds, what if the winds change?

When almost everyone obeys unwritten rules , little attention needs to be paid to the written ones . So the supposedly heroic Mr Horie was able to mount his bid in ways that would be considered outrageous in London or New York : he built up his 35 % stake in NBS in off - market trading , diluted his own investors ' shareholdings without consulting them and never offered a standard price to all NBS shareholders . 
 The wild west goes east 
 Part of the problem is that takeovers and other pressures from shareholders were long considered taboo or irrelevant . The protective role of main banks and cross - shareholdings was enough to regulate matters . Now that both of those protections are weakening , there is a fairly broad consensus that the law and the regulatory system need to be changed . But that change is happening slowly . An optimistic view is that the process is at roughly the halfway stage . Still , some important progress has already been made . 
 One of the worst corporate sins of the 1980s was the use of subsidiaries to hide problems , park surplus staff or disguise adventures : they did not have to be consolidated into profit - and - loss accounts . New holding - company and accounting laws in 1999 - 2001 changed that . A so - called "" big bang "" of financial reform in 1998 was in truth more like a slow drum roll , but it brought in a new regulatory body , the Financial Services Agency , with the job of supervising financial institutions and accounting practices . 
 One obstacle to firms selling divisions and subsidiaries to each other was a rule that required an appraisal of all the division 's assets by a court - appointed inspector . In 2000 a new law abolished that rule for "" non - core "" business units , defined as small , underperforming ones . That does not go far enough -- firms ought to be free to sell what they like -- but it has stimulated a lot of trading in distressed assets . Another new rule has reduced the capital requirement for new limited companies to just yen1 , down from yen3 m. 
 Virtually the whole of the Japanese commercial code is being overhauled along similar lines . Nevertheless , with politicians afraid of instability and especially foreign takeovers , and under pressure from big employers , many of the reforms so far have been as helpful to corporate defence as offence . Laws already passed have permitted companies to offer shares with differential voting rights , to grant stock acquisition rights through options and warrants , and to set up such provisions as a "" poison pill "" to be deployed in the event of a takeover bid . 
 On the other hand , the law has defined the proper purposes of such measures as well as the need for shareholder meetings to approve them . And it has made proxy votes against such measures easier . All that has helped boost the role of the courts . Earlier this year the Tokyo District Court rejected a crude poison pill proposed by Nireco , an instrument - maker . 
 The role of shareholders has been boosted too : at the spate of annual meetings on June 29th shareholders rejected poison - pill proposals at several big firms , including Tokyo Electron , Fanuc and Yokogawa Electric . Many other similar proposals passed , but significantly even some Japanese institutional investors took part in anti - management votes . Previously they had been quiescent . 
 One provision the Diet ( parliament ) considered too hot to handle was a reform to allow foreign firms to use their own shares as currency in acquisitions in Japan , whether hostile or friendly . This would bring the rules for foreigners into line with those already in place for Japanese companies . But in April the measure was postponed for a year . Unless there is a big controversial cross - border battle in the meantime , however , it stands a good chance of being passed in due course . 
 Another area of law that needs further refinement is the definition in corporate governance of outside directors : they have been given an enhanced role , especially in big firms that choose to adopt an American - style board committee system , but there is no requirement that they be wholly independent . Seibu , a railway and property giant whose autocratic boss , Yoshiaki Tsutsumi , was charged with fraud earlier this year , held no board meetings for seven years . It did have outside directors , but they all had business relationships with Mr Tsutsumi . 
 For all the fuss over hostile takeovers , however , such battles are rare even in America , which sees barely one each year . Even the theoretical possibility of such an event , though , helps put pressure on managements to improve their profits as well as to pay dividends to shareholders . Japanese corporate profits are at a record high mainly for other reasons , but market pressure has literally paid dividends : in the past seven years the dividend yield for firms listed in Tokyo has almost doubled ( see chart 3 ) . 
 Even so , the most important sort of transaction , in Japan as in America , is the friendly sort , whether involving whole firms or divisions of them . In the first eight months of this year , according to the Nihon Keizai financial daily , 1,735 M&A deals were completed , 28 % up on a year earlier . 
 As James Abegglen , a veteran consultant and scholar in Tokyo , observes in his recent book , "" Redesigning the Kaisha "" , the consolidation of whole industries during the past decade has been impressive : from 14 oil companies to four ; from seven big cement firms to three ; from 14 pulp and paper companies to three ; from seven industrial gas firms to three ; from five big steel firms to four ; from 15 big banks to just three . And big companies have traded or closed thousands of subsidiaries . 
 More competition , please 
 Neither the lawyers nor the financial advisers have been idle . Many of Japan 's biggest and most internationally famed firms are now more focused and efficient than before . Their scale and new concentration will make it easier for them to compete abroad . But for them , and even more for the huge array of domestic firms , there is another , more important question : is there enough competition at home to keep them all on their toes ? 
 Deregulation during the 1990s , in fields such as telecoms , transport , energy , finance and retailing , benefited consumers to the tune of 4.6 % of GDP in 2002 , or so the Cabinet Office claims . This certainly helped , though the OECD reports that Japanese electricity and telecoms prices , for example , remain the highest among that organisation 's rich - country members . But perhaps the biggest issue now is whether Japanese anti - monopoly laws stand a chance of being enforced . 
 There is certainly some political will to do so . Amendments to antitrust law passed by the Diet in April and due to come into effect early in 2006 will bring four main changes : an increase in the penalties for breaking the law from 6 % of affected sales for most large firms to 10 % , with surcharges for repeat offenders ; the introduction of a new incentive for cartel members to blow the whistle by offering discounted fines for those who come clean early ; new powers for the Fair Trade Commission , Japan 's trust - buster , to make raids and seize documents ; and new powers for the FTC to issue cease - and - desist orders before holding a hearing rather than waiting until afterwards . 
 That all sounds robust , and the new law was passed despite opposition to its first draft from big businesses . Yet those penalties remain lower than those used in the European Union and America . And in the past Japan has been none too assiduous in enforcing what legislation it had in this area . The OECD notes that there have been only 13 criminal antitrust cases in Japan since 1950 , and that no one has ever gone to jail for breaking competition law . 
 Until 2002 the FTC was a small body with a low status , firmly under a ministry 's thumb . However , one of the less noticed moves of Junichiro Koizumi , was that Junichiro Koizumi shifted the FTC so that it now reports directly to the Cabinet Office , and gave it a new boss and a bit more money . Whereas in 1995 the FTC had 220 investigators and a budget of yen5.24 billion , last year it had 331 investigators and a budget of yen7.82 billion . 
 There are some omens that bode well for stronger enforcement . Just as the courts have played a bigger role in securities disputes , so the Tokyo Stock Exchange acted decisively when Seibu 's frauds were disclosed , forcing the firm to delist in December last year . The FTC too has become more active . In March it fined six steel firms a total of yen6.8 billion for price - fixing . Barely a week goes by without an FTC raid or an indictment of a construction company or a member of staff of the Japan Public Highway Corporation , a soon - to - be - privatised government agency , for rigging bids for bridge contracts . In May , the FTC filed a criminal prosecution of eight such companies . 
 It could be argued , though , that the TSE acted only once the game was up for Seibu . The bridge scandal too has been convenient for the government : Junichiro Koizumi wanted to show that privatisation will make a big difference , and to discredit the agency 's top bureaucrats sufficiently to ensure that they can not scupper the plan . Yet if competition enforcement is simply a product of the political winds , what if the winds change ?

NO COUNTRY in modern history has moved so swiftly from worldwide adulation to dismissal or even contempt as did Japan, in a process that began more or less as the temple bells were tolling in the new year of 1990. In the 15 years that followed, amid crashing stock- and property markets, mountains of dud debt, scores of corruption scandals, vast government deficits and stagnant economic growth, Japan mutated from being a giver of lessons to a recipient of lectures, all of which offered recipes for its reform and revival. Those lectures, although received politely by a newly self-deprecatory Japanese elite, seemed to be ignored. Now, however, the time for lectures is over. Japan is back. It is being reformed. It is reviving.
Really? The very unJapanese event that took place on September 11th--a snap general election called on a policy issue and won in spectacular fashion by the reformist prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi--has changed perceptions of Japan as an irredeemable dud, but not much. After all, the case for cynicism is compelling. 
There have been several false dawns during those 15 dismal years, most notably in 1996-98 when an incipient recovery turned into a fresh recession and produced both a banking crisis and an apparent enthusiasm for reform. Since then, Japan has suffered a price deflation that has still not come to an end. Since 2001 it has had a prime minister, that same Mr Koizumi, who has talked a lot about reform but whose real achievements remain rather hard to get your arms around. Moreover, the OECD recently rated Japan's potential rate of GDP growth for the rest of this decade at a mere 1.3% a year, on the basis of poor productivity growth and a population that is shrinking and ageing. Politics didn't even come into it.
But remember. During the 1980s, when adulation (or fear) of Japan was at its peak, many observers made the mistake of assuming that because some things in the country plainly worked extremely well, everything did, so everything must be worth emulating and the trend must be ever upwards. That is why your present author named a book he published in 1989 ""The Sun Also Sets"". Japan's sun does not only rise, the book argued; trends can also bring about their own downfall. Since 1990, the opposite mistake has been made: just because some things have gone badly wrong, so everything has been assumed to be wrong, in perpetuity or at least pending a revolution. Hence the somewhat self-indulgent title of this survey: the Japanese sun does not only set, either. It also rises, and looks likely to do so from now on. 
For the case for greater optimism is also strong. It is not based on any notion that Mr Koizumi's victory represents the start of radical change. Nor is it intended to suggest that privatisation of the postal savings system--the reform issue around which September's election was fought--will somehow magically turn Japan from a sloth economy to a growth one, for it won't. Rather, it is based on the view that Mr Koizumi's victory is the culmination of a long period of incremental change, bringing welcome confirmation that that change is not likely to be reversed.
Even after his landslide win, it is not inevitable that Mr Koizumi will get his way, for his party's rules stipulate that he will have merely a year as leader to exploit his new mandate. Still, there is a chance that the party will extend his term, but also a likelihood that any successor will follow the Koizumi script. This would mean that the size and role of the Japanese state will shrink, in a slow but remorseless process over the next decade or so. That will gradually help improve the public finances, which are in a mess; gradually help reduce the financial distortions that have arisen from the state's role in banking; and gradually help reform politics, which had become dependent on state cash and power.
Gradually: that could be Japan's watchword. The country has not had a revolution, nor has it gone through the ""shock therapy"" of reform that Margaret Thatcher deployed in Britain in the 1980s or that some central European countries tried in the 1990s, and it is not likely to go through that now. For this is not a country of revolutions, but rather one that tends to follow a course faithfully and steadily once it has been agreed upon and set. 
For the past decade, although the main approach to the country's immediate macroeconomic and financial woes has been one of muddling through and hoping for the best, there has been a gradual process of reform, of setting new courses and parameters for behaviour. This has consisted of an accumulation of many small changes--some in politics, but also in financial regulation, in corporate law, in public opinion, in capital markets, in corporate mores. The two big questions have been, first, whether that process will endure; and, second, whether the burdens of the past--debt, deflation, corruption, labour protection--will continue to overwhelm the benefits that come from those changes, or whether Japan might soon be in a position to grow and develop again as a normal country might.
September's election answered the first question. But to answer that second question, it is no good speculating about politics, nor expecting the politicians to produce radical, invigorating reforms. They have neither the power nor the capability for that. The place to look is not in the fancy headlines of politics but deep in the fabric of Japan's economy and society. And although there may not be one single reason to expect a transformation, there may well be one single field of data that currently holds the clue as to whether economic recovery is going to be sustainable in the longer term, as well as exemplifying some of the biggest changes that have taken place. That field is employment and wages. 
Lessons from the labour market
The Japan of old was known as the country of ""lifetime employment"", a somewhat exaggerated but still important notion that in return for loyalty and flexibility big employers typically offered a lifetime commitment to their workers, with associated company unions, generous fringe benefits and pay rising according to age and seniority. That also made for a fairly egalitarian society. Shock therapy would have shattered the lifetime notion, producing a big rise in unemployment. So it never happened: most big companies chose to maintain their commitment, asking workers to take pay cuts and waive bonuses rather than lose their jobs, but ceased to hire new graduates. Less than half as many new graduates were hired in 2003 as in 1997.
But also, helped by changes to employment law, firms found flexibility in another way: by hiring part-timers and others on temporary contracts, both at far lower cost than for regular workers. In 1990 such ""non-regular"" workers made up 18.8% of the labour force. Earlier this year, that figure reached 30%, which in Japan's 65m-strong labour force means roughly 20m people. Those workers are predominantly women, the young and the fairly low-skilled. Since 2003, the law has allowed contracts to be counted as temporary, and thus cheap, for up to three years. The use of contract workers remains forbidden in some sectors that employ lots of people, including health care and construction, but has gradually become permitted almost everywhere else. Canon, for example, a successful electronics firm that still firmly maintains a lifetime commitment for its ""core"" workers, employs fully 70% of its Japanese factory staff on such ""non-regular"" terms, up from 50% five years ago and 10% a decade ago, according to Fujio Mitarai, Canon's president.
This new labour flexibility has contributed to a boom in company profits and to the paying down of debt. In 1998 workers' pay equalled about 73% of corporate earnings. By 2004 the proportion had dropped to 64%. Other factors helped too, most notably a big rise in exports to China in 2002-04, which revitalised manufacturers of all kinds, whether metal-bashers or precision engineers, and a series of bank nationalisations and mergers in 1998-2004 during which bad loans worth trillions of yen came good or were written off.
As a result, the gigantic pile of dud corporate debt for which Japan became notorious in the late 1990s is now a lot smaller: from a peak of more than yen43 trillion in 2001, non-performing loans held by banks have more than halved to less than yen20 trillion (see chart 2 on the next page). The number is now also thought to be more or less accurate, whereas until 2001 or so official figures for non-performing loans were appallingly and deliberately underestimated.
Labour flexibility came at a price, however. Falling wages boosted profits but also weakened demand. In recent years, consumption has been sustained only by households choosing to save less of their incomes: the Japan that in the 1980s was reputed to be a nation of savers now has a household saving rate of merely 5% of disposable income, one-third of its level in 1990. New jobs have been created, but as 2005 began most were still part-time or on temporary contracts. Part-time workers in Japan get on average less than half the full-time hourly wage. The lowlier contract workers, such as shelf-stackers in convenience stores, can expect yen600-800 per hour, which is well below the British legal minimum wage. Little wonder that an economic commentator, Takuro Morinaga, topped the bestseller charts in 2003-04 with a book on how to live on yen3m a year. So much for the idea of Japan as a high-cost country.
As long as wages were falling and the new employment being created was the cheaper, less secure sort, there was little chance that economic growth could become truly sustainable. The cost-reduction and flexibility may have been a necessary condition of eventual recovery, but could not itself bring it about. Rather as in America during the Great Depression, declining demand has helped to neutralise improvements taking place elsewhere in the economy. Moreover, there are limits to what export-led growth, the great hope of 2002-04, can achieve, given Japan's already large current-account surplus (3.6% of GDP), the chance that the yen will strengthen against the dollar and the danger of slower demand in Japan's top foreign markets, China and America. 
Since April, however, the employment data have shown something new and more promising: full-time employment is growing faster than the part-time sort for the first time in a decade, and although some of that growth is still in full-time contract work, regular employment is rising too. Wages are also rising, at their fastest rate since 1998 (which mainly means they are simply rising, at last), and bonuses are again being paid.
It is still early days--too early to tell how strong this rise in employment and incomes will prove to be. Probably, its effect will be gradual: people may try to rebuild their savings rather than spending all their gains, competition from low-cost China and India will help limit wage gains, and firms scarred by the past 15 years are unlikely to embark upon an investment and hiring binge. What this development does suggest, though, is that the last of the three excesses that have burdened the economy since 1990--excess corporate debt, excess capacity and excess labour--may now finally be on the point of elimination. 
Elimination is probably too strong a word, for whether something is excessive is a subjective question. The ratio of debt to operating profits for large and medium-sized firms is down to levels typical in the 1980s, ie, less than 10%, compared with 15-20% at the peak in 1999. Smaller firms still hold debt of nearly 15% of operating profits, but that too is down from over 20% in 1999. Excess capacity is a particularly subjective matter: the capacity-utilisation rate reported by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry is back up to 1992 levels, and businessmen's perceptions, as reported in the Bank of Japan's regular Tankan survey, are that excess capacity has largely disappeared. 
The important issues now, though, revolve around risk, stability and incentives. During the 1990s, although Japan experienced only stagnation rather than collapse, there was always a risk that collapse might come. With corporate debt cleaned up and banks reformed, that risk has gone. Banks certainly think so: their lending has recently started to expand again for the first time since 1998. The alternative now seems to be either slow growth or faster growth, not growth or slump. Moreover, an economy that relies on increases in private spending, by households and by companies, is likely to follow a more stable path than one that depends solely on export demand or public spending. What matters most, though, is how that spending will be used. And that is a question of whether the incentives governing such spending have changed: the incentives for companies to waste the money or use it well, and the incentives for politicians and bureaucrats to abuse it, steal it or otherwise distort it.
A very stealthy revolution
That is where the many other small changes come in. A simple way to understand what happened to Japan in the 1980s and 1990s is that a country with many strengths, especially a high average level of education, formidable technology and powerful social co-ordination within companies, came to lose its basic disciplines and incentives, particularly in the late 1980s when it experienced one of the biggest asset booms in world history. Flushed with success and with seemingly costless capital, companies expanded and diversified recklessly. Banks lent regardless of risk or business viability. Bureaucrats and politicians resisted calls for deregulation that could have extended competition and encouraged innovation, because they did not think it was necessary. Interest groups anyway blocked change, chiefly by bribing politicians. The mass media were largely suborned by the political and corporate establishment.
The collapse of the stock- and property booms after 1990 and the ensuing recession might have been expected to shake all this up. It didn't, for two main reasons. The first was that the principal economic response to the slump, ie, massive public-works spending, further enriched some pressure groups and many politicians, making them even more able to resist change, and an expansionary monetary policy deadened the price mechanism that ought to have imposed discipline. The second was that for a mixture of social and psychological reasons, neither bureaucrats nor companies chose to admit what was really happening.
A 15-year gradual work-off of the excesses inherited from the 1980s would not have been what most analysts would have recommended or even expected in 1990, whether they were rude foreign lecturers or polite Japanese. And it has been a more painful period than any visits limited to prosperous Tokyo would suggest. Provincial cities and rural areas have suffered greatly, with shuttered-up streets and rising levels of poverty. Suicides have soared, up more than 50% since 1990 to 34,500 in 2003. By Japan's standards, crime has risen too, though it remains low in comparison with America and most of western Europe. Still, compared with what might have happened in most other developed countries had they gone through the same prolonged experience, Japanese society has remained remarkably stable.
Yet although society has been stable, the appearance of policy paralysis is misleading. Actually, bit by bit, step by step, a great deal has been changed, in what may come to look with hindsight like a sort of revolution by stealth. The changes are still continuing and being battled over, so it is too soon to judge whether that word will in the end be justified. But what this revolution-in-progress has already done is to alter many of the incentives surrounding political and corporate behaviour.
It needed to, because in 1985-95 Japanese companies proved incredibly bad at using their own money--or rather, their shareholders' money. Neither commercial law nor the courts helped the shareholders' cause very much. Banks supposedly provided the discipline in the system through their ability to intervene in their big customers' affairs when things went wrong, but such interventions became rarer as the asset bubble inflated, and then rarer still once the banks got into at least as much trouble as their customers. Then, banks kept alive what became known as ""zombie"" companies for fear of acknowledging their bad loans, of creating unemployment or of upsetting the whole collective applecart.
This used to be called financial socialism, which was meant as a compliment. That time has long gone. Now, a joke is circulating in Tokyo about Chinese students on a course there. Someone asks them why they spend so much time with other Chinese rather than with Japanese students. Their answer: because we are afraid the Japanese might teach us communism. The way things are going, the joke might soon become obsolete.

In recent years , consumption has been sustained only by households choosing to save less of their incomes : the Japan that in the 1980s was reputed to be a nation of savers now has a household saving rate of merely 5 % of disposable income , one - third of its level in 1990 . New jobs have been created , but as 2005 began most were still part - time or on temporary contracts . Part - time workers in Japan get on average less than half the full - time hourly wage . The lowlier contract workers , such as shelf - stackers in convenience stores , can expect yen600 - 800 per hour , which is well below the British legal minimum wage . Little wonder that an economic commentator , Takuro Morinaga , topped the bestseller charts in 2003 - 04 with a book on how to live on yen3 m a year . So much for the idea of Japan as a high - cost country . 
 As long as wages were falling and the new employment being created was the cheaper , less secure sort , there was little chance that economic growth could become truly sustainable . The cost - reduction and flexibility may have been a necessary condition of eventual recovery , but could not itself bring it about . Rather as in America during the Great Depression , declining demand has helped to neutralise improvements taking place elsewhere in the economy . Moreover , there are limits to what export - led growth , the great hope of 2002 - 04 , can achieve , given Japan 's already large current - account surplus ( 3.6 % of GDP ) , the chance that the yen will strengthen against the dollar and the danger of slower demand in Japan 's top foreign markets , China and America . 
 Since April , however , the employment data have shown something new and more promising : full - time employment is growing faster than the part - time sort for the first time in a decade , and although some of that growth is still in full - time contract work , regular employment is rising too . Wages are also rising , at their fastest rate since 1998 ( which mainly means they are simply rising , at last ) , and bonuses are again being paid . 
 It is still early days -- too early to tell how strong this rise in employment and incomes will prove to be . Probably , its effect will be gradual : people may try to rebuild their savings rather than spending all their gains , competition from low - cost China and India will help limit wage gains , and firms scarred by the past 15 years are unlikely to embark upon an investment and hiring binge . What this development does suggest , though , is that the last of the three excesses that have burdened the economy since 1990 - -excess corporate debt , excess capacity and excess labour -- may now finally be on the point of elimination . 
 Elimination is probably too strong a word , for whether something is excessive is a subjective question . The ratio of debt to operating profits for large and medium - sized firms is down to levels typical in the 1980s , ie , less than 10 % , compared with 15 - 20 % at the peak in 1999 . Smaller firms still hold debt of nearly 15 % of operating profits , but that too is down from over 20 % in 1999 . Excess capacity is a particularly subjective matter : the capacity - utilisation rate reported by the Ministry of Economy , Trade and Industry is back up to 1992 levels , and businessmen 's perceptions , as reported in the Bank of Japan 's regular Tankan survey , are that excess capacity has largely disappeared . 
 The important issues now , though , revolve around risk , stability and incentives . During the 1990s , although Japan experienced only stagnation rather than collapse , there was always a risk that collapse might come . With corporate debt cleaned up and banks reformed , that risk has gone . Banks certainly think so : their lending has recently started to expand again for the first time since 1998 . The alternative now seems to be either slow growth or faster growth , not growth or slump . Moreover , an economy that relies on increases in private spending , by households and by companies , is likely to follow a more stable path than one that depends solely on export demand or public spending . What matters most , though , is how that spending will be used . And that is a question of whether the incentives governing such spending have changed : the incentives for companies to waste the money or use it well , and the incentives for politicians and bureaucrats to abuse it , steal it or otherwise distort it . 
 A very stealthy revolution 
 That is where the many other small changes come in . A simple way to understand what happened to Japan in the 1980s and 1990s is that a country with many strengths , especially a high average level of education , formidable technology and powerful social co - ordination within companies , came to lose its basic disciplines and incentives , particularly in the late 1980s when it experienced one of the biggest asset booms in world history . Flushed with success and with seemingly costless capital , companies expanded and diversified recklessly . Banks lent regardless of risk or business viability . Bureaucrats and politicians resisted calls for deregulation that could have extended competition and encouraged innovation , because they did not think it was necessary . Interest groups anyway blocked change , chiefly by bribing politicians . The mass media were largely suborned by the political and corporate establishment . 
 The collapse of the stock- and property booms after 1990 and the ensuing recession might have been expected to shake all this up . It did n't , for two main reasons . The first was that the principal economic response to the slump , ie , massive public - works spending , further enriched some pressure groups and many politicians , making them even more able to resist change , and an expansionary monetary policy deadened the price mechanism that ought to have imposed discipline . The second was that for a mixture of social and psychological reasons , neither bureaucrats nor companies chose to admit what was really happening . 
 A 15 - year gradual work - off of the excesses inherited from the 1980s would not have been what most analysts would have recommended or even expected in 1990 , whether they were rude foreign lecturers or polite Japanese . And it has been a more painful period than any visits limited to prosperous Tokyo would suggest . Provincial cities and rural areas have suffered greatly , with shuttered - up streets and rising levels of poverty . Suicides have soared , up more than 50 % since 1990 to 34,500 in 2003 . By Japan 's standards , crime has risen too , though it remains low in comparison with America and most of western Europe . Still , compared with what might have happened in most other developed countries had they gone through the same prolonged experience , Japanese society has remained remarkably stable . 
 Yet although society has been stable , the appearance of policy paralysis is misleading . Actually , bit by bit , step by step , a great deal has been changed , in what may come to look with hindsight like a sort of revolution by stealth . The changes are still continuing and being battled over , so it is too soon to judge whether that word will in the end be justified . But what this revolution - in - progress has already done is to alter many of the incentives surrounding political and corporate behaviour . 
 It needed to , because in 1985 - 95 Japanese companies proved incredibly bad at using their own money -- or rather , their shareholders ' money . Neither commercial law nor the courts helped the shareholders ' cause very much . Banks supposedly provided the discipline in the system through their ability to intervene in their big customers ' affairs when things went wrong , but such interventions became rarer as the asset bubble inflated , and then rarer still once the banks got into at least as much trouble as their customers . Then , banks kept alive what became known as "" zombie "" companies for fear of acknowledging their bad loans , of creating unemployment or of upsetting the whole collective applecart . 
 This used to be called financial socialism , which was meant as a compliment . That time has long gone . Now , a joke is circulating in Tokyo about Chinese students on a course there . Someone asks them why they spend so much time with other Chinese rather than with Japanese students . Their answer : because we are afraid the Japanese might teach us communism . The way things are going , the joke might soon become obsolete .

IN SEPTEMBER 1998 the cover of The Economist carried the headline ""Japan's amazing ability to disappoint"", commenting on the government's bungling of yet another bank-rescue plan. It attracted a petulant protest from the Japanese embassy in London. Motoo Shiina, a veteran Diet member, offered a more thoughtful dissent: the correct headline, he said, would have been ""The Japanese people's amazing ability not to be disappointed"". Not so snappy, perhaps, but he had a point: surely in no other democracy would the same party that had been running the country continuously since 1955--the Liberal Democrats--have been left in government following a financial crash and an economic slump to which they had found no solution. They did lose power for all of ten months in 1993-94, but then returned to government, albeit leading a series of coalitions. And they have just been returned to power once again in a landslide, giving them their biggest parliamentary majority since 1986, despite having presided over 15 years of stagnation.
That account, of course, leaves out Junichiro Koizumi, who since 2001 has led the LDP and served as prime minister, and whose early slogan was ""change the LDP to change Japan"". His electoral genius at first looked as though it might be limited to his photogenic long wavy hair and clever marketing techniques, including his Lionheart e-mail magazine. The election result on September 11th, though, proved that there is rather more to him than that. By calling a snap general election over a single issue of economic reform, the privatisation of Japan Post, which had been opposed by rebels in the LDP but also, crucially, by the main opposition party, the Democratic Party of Japan, he managed the seemingly impossible: to cast the LDP, the ultimate guardian of the status quo, as the party of change. No, you might object, he cast himself as the bringer of change, not the LDP. Yes, but under the party's rules Mr Koizumi has only one more year to serve as leader. Then, unless the rules are changed to extend his term, someone else will inherit the powerful position he has just built for his party. The long-term winner of the September 11th election was the LDP, not Mr Koizumi.
That raises a crucial question: might it all be just a mirage? That thought is raised, first, by how exceptional Mr Koizumi looks when you compare him with other LDP politicians. He has already lasted longer in office than any prime minister since Yasuhiro Nakasone (1982-87), who was himself the longest-serving since the postwar record-holder, Eisaku Sato (1964-72). Although Mr Koizumi has been a career party member and comes from a political family, in politics he is a loner. He is said to have no real party friends and no political support group. Once he is out of power, which could be in September 2006, or at the latest one or two years later, most people expect him to leave politics altogether. 
The concern is reinforced if you examine Mr Koizumi's record of pushing his supposedly bold reforms through the Diet in the past four years. To get his way against a lot of opposition from bureaucrats and from inside the party, he broke with tradition by using non-politicians to front his schemes: Naoki Inose, a historical writer, for the privatisation of the Japan Public Highway Corporation, the agency in charge of building roads and bridges that has been at the heart of the country's corrupt and wasteful public-works schemes; Heizo Takenaka, an economics professor and, since 2001, his main economic-reform minister, for the privatisation of Japan Post. Their styles have been very different: while Mr Inose has shot from the lip in the effort to discredit his opponents, Mr Takenaka has beavered away more quietly. But the outcomes have been similar: such reform as has occurred has been heavily watered down. In the case of Japan Post it was even rejected--until Mr Koizumi won his landslide.
No rush
Now, Japan Post will indeed be reorganised and sold off--but over a period of more than a decade. This reform, like that of the highway agency, matters chiefly because the postal savings bank has been responsible for huge distortions in the allocation of funds, and with it a great deal of political corruption. It also matters because, after a decade of high public spending, the national gross public debt has reached 170% of GDP, just when the population is ageing rapidly, opening up the prospect of lower tax revenues and higher medical and pension costs. 
Moreover, Japan Post, with subsidised deposits and insurance policies worth yen330 trillion, taking 30% of all personal deposits and 40% of life insurance, has sat like an elephant in the middle of the financial-services business, skewing the market against the commercial banks and insurers and distorting the price mechanisms that would otherwise direct money flows to the best advantage. So Messrs Koizumi and Takenaka are reorganising the elephant into four separate parts arranged under a joint holding company, handling mail delivery, post offices, savings and insurance respectively. Each will have a profit-and-loss account, but all will remain publicly owned until at least 2017. Savings deposits have already lost their subsidies, though, and the banking and insurance divisions will now have to pay more attention to risk and returns.
Similarly, the highway agency has been split into six, with effect from October 1st, but will remain in public ownership for the time being. The main hope there, too, is that by giving the new roads agencies the obligation to service and repay an accumulated yen40 trillion of debt, they can be made to act in a more businesslike and disciplined fashion.
The direction of policy under Mr Koizumi is thus clear: state lending and spending needs to be given new constraints and incentives, he thinks, and ultimately to be shrunk. Later this year, Mr Takenaka says, he will turn his attention to eight other state-owned banks. There was also talk in the LDP's election manifesto of reforms to the public health-care system and to pensions, though few details were given. 
Resistance to shrinking the state is stiff, however, not so much on ideological grounds as from interest groups: the construction industry, the bureaucrats, the medical profession, postal workers, all of whom have cultivated politicians to further their cause, particularly in the LDP. That is why Mr Koizumi and his front men from outside politics have struggled to make headway. But it also should prompt reflection on the paradoxical nature of the election result: that Mr Koizumi won his apparent mandate for change against an opposition party, the DPJ, whose manifesto actually proposed much more radical reforms, including a more rapid shrinking of the state. Yet the DPJ was crushed, losing one-third of its seats. Its dull but very worthy leader, Katsuya Okada, resigned.
In the Lionheart's lair
That paradoxical result is testament both to Mr Koizumi's tactical brilliance and to Mr Okada's fatal mistake in getting his party to oppose postal privatisation in the Diet. He did that because the DPJ is an awkward collection, created only in 1996-98, of former LDP members, former socialists and young, genuinely liberal newcomers; the socialists among them retain close ties to the postal workers' union. 
For now, though, the DPJ's defeat has destroyed the long-held dream of many political pundits: that Japan would develop a two-party system and have alternating governments. The LDP has regained its traditional dominance. If its coalition with a small Buddhist-backed party, New Komeito, survives, then the pair's two-thirds majority in the Diet's lower house will henceforth allow it to get its way on everything bar a revision to the constitution (which also requires a two-thirds majority in the upper house, where the LDP is weaker, and a simple majority in a national referendum).
But is it the same LDP, or has Mr Koizumi succeeded in changing it, as he promised? Essentially, he has changed it in three ways, none of which is guaranteed to survive his retirement but all of which stand a chance of doing so. The first is that he has severely disabled the system of factions which had long run the party. The factions existed primarily to raise money and to hand out jobs. The introduction of public funding for political parties in 1994 weakened the fund-raising function, as did an electoral reform at the same time that replaced multi-member constituencies (for which party factions therefore competed) with a mixture of single-member seats and proportional representation. Mr Koizumi demonstrated that the factions were weakening by winning the party's leadership election in 2001 against a candidate from the richest and supposedly strongest faction, and rubbed in the lesson by ignoring the factions when appointing his cabinet. They still exist, but for the moment mainly as networking groups rather than power centres.
Mr Koizumi's second change has been to concentrate power in the hands of the party's secretary-general (who is appointed by him) and, within the government, in the prime minister's office. Public funding for political parties had already added to the secretary-general's role, because the money (a total of yen30 billion a year for all parties) is channelled through each party headquarters. Since 2003 the same has been true for political funding supplied by Nippon Keidanren, the employers' federation. That stronger party role was on display in August when Mr Koizumi ordered the expulsion of 37 LDP members of the lower house who had opposed his postal privatisation bills.
Under this new regime, advancement within the party depends on loyalty to the leadership more than to the factions. Within the government, too, the leadership has been strengthened. For decades, Japanese prime ministers have been fairly weak figures, with party power diffused by the factions and governmental power dominated by the ministries. That worked, you could argue, because informal co-ordination between the elites in the bureaucracy, the LDP and big business was strong, though that also led to corruption and a lack of accountability. As in other countries, a blend of economic and social change, scandals and public hostility has discredited that old-boy network (which in Japan was called the iron triangle), requiring its partial replacement by more formal, rule-based structures.
Under Mr Koizumi that process of replacement has been accelerated, with more money and staff for the prime minister's office and a reorganisation of ministries to establish a new hierarchy. One main tool of that new control is the Council of Economic and Fiscal Policy, which is chaired by the prime minister and steered by his economics supremo, Mr Takenaka. In theory at least, that council can boss even the finance ministry about.
""In theory"" is an important qualification, for much depends on how these new powers are used, and by whom. The third way in which Mr Koizumi has changed politics could determine that, although it is the most uncertain of all. What he seems to have shown is that the way to gain and hold power is by appealing to the public, by making gestures of leadership and by favouring change. Budding successors who would like to continue in that vein, either by choice or because that is the way to win elections, should thus be expected to follow Mr Koizumi's lead in disabling party factions, centralising party power and strengthening the prime minister's office. But will they? A two-thirds majority in the Diet, with an enfeebled opposition, could cause them to move the other way: if you feel untouchable, why bother with public opinion? 
Voice of the people, voice of law
By continuing a policy begun in 1998 by an earlier prime minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, of cutting public-works spending, and now reinforcing it through reforms to Japan Post and the highway agency, Mr Koizumi has probably put an end to pork-barrel politics. The demographic squeeze on public finances will make that almost impossible to reverse. The successors to Mr Koizumi most often mooted within the party--Shinzo Abe, a fairly right-wing former LDP secretary-general who is both youthful and telegenic, and Yasuo Fukuda, a respected former cabinet secretary--suggest that the old stuffed-shirt politics might also be in abeyance. But in a newly victorious party, personal support could shift rapidly. That makes it premature to make assumptions about the succession.
There are, though, more lasting signs that inspire some confidence about the direction and durability of change. The basic incentives surrounding politicians were altered not by the exceptional Mr Koizumi but by those electoral and campaign-finance reforms back in 1994. Political ethics laws from that same period have sought to crack down on corruption, as has a 1994 provision that made candidates legally responsible for illegal actions by their campaign supporters even if they have no direct knowledge of them. These changes have not eliminated corruption by any means, but they have constrained it. 
Meanwhile, the voice of public opinion has been getting gently but steadily stronger. Disappointment with the old guard has long been coming through clearly in local elections for city mayors and prefectural governors, where all sorts of mavericks and outsiders have gained power. September's vote demonstrated at least a desire for change at national level too. Also, though, it has become easier for non-party groups to influence policy outside the Diet. Until 1998, individuals could not readily form lobby groups or associations to promote their particular hobby-horses, because such non-profit organisations had no legal basis. Since then, more than 20,000 have been recognised under a new law. Crucially, they do not yet benefit from the sort of tax exemptions that help explain why America has more than 1.4m non-profits. But even this small vanguard is beginning to have an impact on policy debates, though mainly at local level, and to launch legal challenges to companies and to the government. 
That public pressure is now more easily applied thanks to a freedom-of-information law which was passed in 2001, and to quite sweeping judicial reforms that became law in 2002-04. These have resulted in the opening of 68 new professional schools designed to double the number of qualified lawyers over the next decade or so; in the imposition of a two-year time limit on all first-instance trials of criminal and civil cases; in the creation of a new intellectual-property court; and in a new mechanism for involving citizens on judicial panels in criminal cases.
As Jeff Kingston, a professor at Temple University in Tokyo, writes in his excellent book ""Japan's Quiet Transformation"", what is happening is that the old system of ""rule by law"", with wide administrative discretion and limited legal redress, is being replaced by something more akin to ""rule of law"". It is the same trend as that evident in policy co-ordination by elites and the evolution of corporate law: old methods of discretionary power based on unwritten rules are fading away, with new structures and new written rules rising to take their place.
Not surprisingly, not everyone feels comfortable with this increase in the role and number of lawyers. But the increasing role for public opinion is causing some disquiet too. Being popular and campaigning publicly for change, as Mr Koizumi does, is all very fine and democratic, but alongside such virtues has also come a possible vice: anti-Chinese nationalism. Mr Koizumi is no sophisticate in foreign affairs, but in his four years in office he has achieved a steady expansion of Japan's constitutionally limited military role, for example by sending troops to Iraq, and a steady deterioration in Japan's relationship with two of its neighbours, China and South Korea. Until September's election, those worried by such developments could comfort themselves with the hope that the opposition, the DPJ, which adopted a much less assertive, more diplomatic foreign stance, could either become the next government or else restrain the LDP. No longer. Like its old foes in China, Japan is now back to one-party rule.

One main tool of that new control is the Council of Economic and Fiscal Policy , which is chaired by the prime minister and steered by his economics supremo , Mr Takenaka . In theory at least , that council can boss even the finance ministry about . 
 "" In theory "" is an important qualification , for much depends on how these new powers are used , and by whom . The third way in which Junichiro Koizumi has changed politics could determine that , although it is the most uncertain of all . What Junichiro Koizumi seems to have shown is that the way to gain and hold power is by appealing to the public , by making gestures of leadership and by favouring change . Budding successors who would like to continue in that vein , either by choice or because that is the way to win elections , should thus be expected to follow Junichiro Koizumi's lead in disabling party factions , centralising party power and strengthening the prime minister 's office . But will they ? A two - thirds majority in the Diet , with an enfeebled opposition , could cause them to move the other way : if you feel untouchable , why bother with public opinion ? 
 Voice of the people , voice of law 
 By continuing a policy begun in 1998 by an earlier prime minister , Ryutaro Hashimoto , of cutting public - works spending , and now reinforcing it through reforms to Japan Post and the highway agency , Junichiro Koizumi has probably put an end to pork - barrel politics . The demographic squeeze on public finances will make that almost impossible to reverse . The successors to Junichiro Koizumi most often mooted within the party -- Shinzo Abe , a fairly right - wing former LDP secretary - general who is both youthful and telegenic , and Yasuo Fukuda , a respected former cabinet secretary -- suggest that the old stuffed - shirt politics might also be in abeyance . But in a newly victorious party , personal support could shift rapidly . That makes it premature to make assumptions about the succession . 
 There are , though , more lasting signs that inspire some confidence about the direction and durability of change . The basic incentives surrounding politicians were altered not by Junichiro Koizumi but by those electoral and campaign - finance reforms back in 1994 . Political ethics laws from that same period have sought to crack down on corruption , as has a 1994 provision that made candidates legally responsible for illegal actions by their campaign supporters even if they have no direct knowledge of them . These changes have not eliminated corruption by any means , but they have constrained it . 
 Meanwhile , the voice of public opinion has been getting gently but steadily stronger . Disappointment with the old guard has long been coming through clearly in local elections for city mayors and prefectural governors , where all sorts of mavericks and outsiders have gained power . September 's vote demonstrated at least a desire for change at national level too . Also , though , it has become easier for non - party groups to influence policy outside the Diet . Until 1998 , individuals could not readily form lobby groups or associations to promote their particular hobby - horses , because such non - profit organisations had no legal basis . Since then , more than 20,000 have been recognised under a new law . Crucially , they do not yet benefit from the sort of tax exemptions that help explain why America has more than 1.4 m non - profits . But even this small vanguard is beginning to have an impact on policy debates , though mainly at local level , and to launch legal challenges to companies and to the government . 
 That public pressure is now more easily applied thanks to a freedom - of - information law which was passed in 2001 , and to quite sweeping judicial reforms that became law in 2002 - 04 . These have resulted in the opening of 68 new professional schools designed to double the number of qualified lawyers over the next decade or so ; in the imposition of a two - year time limit on all first - instance trials of criminal and civil cases ; in the creation of a new intellectual - property court ; and in a new mechanism for involving citizens on judicial panels in criminal cases . 
 As Jeff Kingston , a professor at Temple University in Tokyo , writes in his excellent book "" Japan 's Quiet Transformation "" , what is happening is that the old system of "" rule by law "" , with wide administrative discretion and limited legal redress , is being replaced by something more akin to "" rule of law "" . It is the same trend as that evident in policy co - ordination by elites and the evolution of corporate law : old methods of discretionary power based on unwritten rules are fading away , with new structures and new written rules rising to take their place . 
 Not surprisingly , not everyone feels comfortable with this increase in the role and number of lawyers . But the increasing role for public opinion is causing some disquiet too . Being popular and campaigning publicly for change , as Junichiro Koizumi does , is all very fine and democratic , but alongside such virtues has also come a possible vice : anti - Chinese nationalism . Junichiro Koizumi is no sophisticate in foreign affairs , but in Junichiro Koizumi's four years in office Junichiro Koizumi has achieved a steady expansion of Japan 's constitutionally limited military role , for example by sending troops to Iraq , and a steady deterioration in Japan 's relationship with two of its neighbours , China and South Korea . Until September 's election , those worried by such developments could comfort themselves with the hope that the opposition , the DPJ , which adopted a much less assertive , more diplomatic foreign stance , could either become the next government or else restrain the LDP . No longer . Like its old foes in China , Japan is now back to one - party rule .

IT HAS taken an extraordinarily long time, but Japan really is now recovering from its debt- and deflation-ridden stagnation of the past 15 years. Proper jobs are being created, wages are rising and economists are raising their forecasts of economic growth--all despite worries about high oil prices and an American slowdown. The prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, grabbed the world's attention last month by calling and winning a snap general election, as a referendum on economic reform. Foreign investors are rushing to Tokyo so as not to miss the fun. There is a spring in the step of Japanese politicians and diplomats, relieved that they no longer have to apologise for Japan's weakness, pleased that they might now be better placed to deal with those bumptious Chinese. They have to pinch themselves to be sure it isn't all a dream.
In a way, it is. The turnaround in perceptions of Japan has been so sudden that it risks being overdone. The immediate road ahead for the economy still looks bumpy, with prices continuing to fall, albeit slowly, overall lending contracting and a big budget deficit of 6.4% of GDP making tax rises look probable. With their wages rising and jobs feeling more secure, consumers may soon start to spend more, allowing economic growth to be led by domestic demand rather than by exports and capital investment. But that process too is likely to be gradual, as households may well also rebuild their savings, which have been depleted during the past decade. 
Gloomy old hands then turn to the longer term to prove that after autumnal optimism will come winter. Japan's population is starting to shrink, and so is its labour force. With productivity growth meagre in recent years, that implies a bleak future: the OECD recently calculated the country's potential growth rate till 2010 at a mere 1.3% a year. Mr Koizumi is a radical only by Japanese standards, and his party rules give him but one more year in power. And China, surely, is the real star of Asia, destined to out-sprint the sluggish, over-rigid Japanese and eventually to dominate the region's politics as well as its economy.
Japanese tortoises
In the short term, it is right to be cautious. Japan's immediate prospects matter greatly for a world worried about slowdowns elsewhere, and forever depressed about reform and recovery in the other great has-been economy, Germany. But, better though they look, they could be prey to both external shocks and the vagaries of the economic cycle. The longer term is much more important, for both economic and political reasons. If the world's second-biggest economy is doomed to a genteel decline, then East Asia in future will have one great economic power rather than two and no one to balance China's rise except India, way over to the west, or an over-extended America, across the ocean. 
Yet Japan is not doomed to decline. The slow and steady really do win races, and not just in fables. As our survey in this issue argues, Japan has been going through a long wave of incremental reforms, which together have changed politics, the economy and financial markets far more than most people realise, promising the country a bright long-term future. September's election result confirmed that that process is now accepted and that it will continue, with a steady slimming of the state's role in the economy. Until the corporate debt burden had been shed, and until deflation has ended, those reforms always looked beside the point, too weak to counter the ever-present risk of economic meltdown. With that risk gone, the pile of incremental reforms now has a chance to make a difference. And the crucial difference they will make is to the incentives governing corporate, political and financial behaviour.
Chinese hares
The slow growth in productivity that makes OECD forecasters gloomy about Japan's potential was a consequence of the country's astonishing waste of capital during the 1990s, combined with a reluctance to cut jobs. Money was misallocated during the great stock and property bubble of the 1980s, but then even more was wasted in the next decade, as banks kept ""zombie"" companies alive and politicians raided the biggest pork barrel in history. Now that is past, even a modest improvement in the allocation of capital and the use of labour would boost returns and productivity. Reforms in corporate law and changes in the capital markets make it likely that the improvement will be better than modest. And, as workers become scarce again, further investment in information technology and other sorts of automation should boost productivity.
The ageing and shrinking of Japan's population over the next 10-15 years could thus raise productivity, not reduce it. With labour short, sentiment and social concern will not impede efficiency, as they did in the over-manned 1990s. And the strengths that made Japan rich in the 1970s and 1980s--good education, advanced technology and smooth co-ordination within companies--will again come to the fore.
There is plenty more to be done if Japan is to achieve this brighter, high-productivity future. Pension and health costs need to be cut; Japan's universities need to be revamped; antitrust policy needs to be reinforced in order to foster more competition. Above all, the politicians need to avoid messing up macroeconomic policy by raising taxes too sharply.
If all that is done, however, great prizes are within reach: rising productivity, rising living standards, a rising international reputation and, above all, a rising chance to face up to China on equal, or even superior, terms. Japan's relationship with China is a scratchy, tense affair; the latest dispute concerns gas and gunboats ()see page 72. If conflict--diplomatic or military--is to be avoided, Japan needs to become stronger, but also to foster other Asian alliances, perhaps through European-style regional institutions. To its Asian neighbours, the Chinese hare is impressive but also worrying. A Japan that showed itself to be a steady, prosperous and reliable tortoise would be an appealing counterweight. In Japanese fables tortoises do win races, but they are also something else: they are symbols of potency.","Japan 's chances of prosperity and influence look surprisingly bright

IF YOU visit the Yasukuni shrine in central Tokyo, as Junichiro Koizumi has insisted on doing once a year to loud protests in China and South Korea, it is hard at first to see why this memorial to Japan's war dead is so controversial. Every country commemorates its military dead; this shrine dates back to 1869 and is dedicated to the 2.5m Japanese who have died in wars or civil wars since 1853. Its name, bestowed upon it by Emperor Meiji in 1879, means ""peaceful country"". Only once you hear that among the spirits venerated at Yasukuni are 14 class A war criminals who were executed after the Tokyo war tribunal in 1948, and whose names were added to the roster at the shrine in 1978, do worries start to set in. But it is the shrine's war museum, the Yushukan, which really sets foreign eyebrows rising: this is no mere place of prayer, but puts over a controversial view of Japanese history. 
To concern expressed about the presence of those 14 spirits, the government's response is that, yes, this is regrettable but Yasukuni has been a private religious entity since 1945 and Japan's post-war, American-drafted constitution separates state and religion, so the government can do nothing about it. Besides, in the Shinto religion, the kami, or spirits, at a shrine are thought to be indivisible: the war criminals have been put among the 2.5m others rather like 14 drops of water might be put into an ocean. 
The flaw in that claim of constitutionally mandated impotence is that Yasukuni retains a strong tie with the head of state himself, the emperor. No emperor has visited the shrine personally since 1975, but every year, during the two principal rites at the shrine in the spring and the autumn, an emissary from the emperor plays the central role. The archive at the shrine, which is where the names of the war dead are logged, was built with a private donation from Emperor Hirohito (now Showa) in 1972. 
The museum has no such direct link to the emperor. But, as John Breen of London's School of Oriental and African Studies wrote in June in ""Yasukuni Shrine: Ritual and Memory"", an article for the Japan Focus website, the Yushukan is not like most other countries' official war museums: it is a museum without mention of any enemies. 
Its sole purpose is to glorify Japan's dead, but in doing so it tells a clear story about Japan's conquests in Korea, Taiwan and China and about the Pacific war in general: that they were heroic efforts to liberate Asia. And it features a large exhibit about the one judge at the Tokyo war-crimes tribunal, Radhabinod Pal from India, who considered the tribunal illegitimate. On the shrine's website, when you click for the museum, a slogan appears: ""The truth of modern Japanese history is now restored.""
Officially, that is not the government's view. Japan accepted the verdict of the tribunal when it signed the San Francisco peace treaty in 1951, and insists that debate about the war is an inevitable part of being a democracy. But the fact that this debate is being conducted not just by extremists but by a shrine associated with the prime minister and many other LDP politicians as well as with the emperor makes this ambiguous, to say the least. 
One obvious solution would be to have another official memorial. Yet one already exists: a war cemetery at Chidorigafuji in Tokyo. There is also a big ceremony on August 15th every year at the Nippon Budokan, Japan's martial-arts centre, to commemorate the end of the second world war, which is attended by the emperor and the prime minister. The real problem lies at Yasukuni. For, private or not, it has a special status.

EVERY so often, a slogan rings out: Welcome to the new Japan! It comes from any pundit or panjandrum wanting to claim that, in a country that to many seems so unchanging, some dramatic new trend can be seen. But it is usually misleading, or exaggerated, for Japan doesn't do drama (and that is not a comment on Kabuki and Noh), except when it feels under threat of invasion, as in the 1860s, or suffers a wartime defeat, as in 1945. The stock- and property-market crashes that began in 1990 were dramatic for those caught up in them, and certainly produced a sharp change in perceptions of Japan in the world as well as in Japan's perception of itself. But the social and political response was totally undramatic. The country muddled through, at first in denial but later with a host of incremental adjustments. Fifteen years on, the same party is in government with a big majority, society remains stable, and Toyota is the world's best car company. Anyone know the Japanese for plus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose?
As this survey has argued, however, that too is misleading. Those incremental adjustments, in politics, corporate law, capital markets, financial regulation, labour law and practices, and much else besides, have altered the incentives guiding society, the economy and politics. In part, the effect has been to reduce the distortions, misallocation of capital and indiscipline that have for about two decades neutralised Japan's long-standing economic and social strengths: excellent education, co-operative relations inside companies and advanced technology. But also, over the longer term, such a gradual accumulation of many small reforms will lead the country in new directions, especially given the recent changes in East Asia and the world economy as a whole, and given its own changing demography. No one can really know where those directions might take Japan over, say, the next 15 years. But some guesses can be made.
The easiest place to start is with demography. With birth rates having plummeted since the baby-boom of the 1950s and life expectancy having lengthened every year, the trend is pretty much fixed for at least the next 15-20 years: the government thinks the total population may have begun to shrink in the first half of this year, and it is certain to do so from 2007 onwards. That shrinkage will be slow, but with fewer children already entering the labour force and more people retiring, the working-age population (ie, aged 15-64) will fall by about 0.7% a year, says the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare.
If you extrapolate current trends well beyond 2020, you get quite startling numbers. The health ministry's central projection suggests Japan's population could fall from nearly 128m now to about 100m in 2050. Peter Morgan, chief economist in Tokyo for HSBC bank, reckons the ministry is being over-optimistic about birth rates, given that more and more women are marrying later or not at all. He thinks that a prudent projection for 2050 is actually a drop to 86m people. As Mr Morgan knows, however, demography is not destiny beyond 15-20 years. France, Scandinavia and above all America have shown recently that falling fertility rates can start to rise again. That could happen in Japan too.
The trouble is that the possible policy responses to boost the workforce and revive population growth could end up contradicting one another. With the labour force shrinking and ageing, companies and the government are both likely to try much harder to bring more women into the labour force and to use them in skilled and responsible positions. But the more that effort succeeds, the fewer babies are likely to be born. If the government tries to encourage women to have more children, on the other hand, fewer will be in the workforce in their 20s and 30s. 
The way to meet both of those objectives would be to spend a lot more public and corporate money on child-care facilities, which are currently in short supply. The old way was to use granny, but today's and tomorrow's grannies want to spend their retirements travelling the world, and young women are not keen on having them around the house in any case. So there is bound to be some increase in spending on child care. 
Awkwardly, the pressure for that spending will come at the same time as the public finances are being tortured in other ways. Ideally, you would not want to start dealing with all these problems when the budget deficit is already at 6.4% of GDP and gross public debt is 170% of GDP, as they have been in 2004-05. That is why the trend that Mr Koizumi has been busy accelerating, namely cutting back state spending, especially in wasteful public-works schemes and subsidised lending, is bound to continue. Space needs to be made in the public purse for child care, pensions and medical costs.
A shrinking labour force, with efforts to give women a bigger role, also means that the great worry of the past five years--that the rise of part-time and contract workers was producing a two-tier workforce--is likely to fade. There may be some more trimming of the protections given to regular workers in order to keep things flexible, but with labour scarce the new shifting army of irregulars, now 30% of the total, will surely fall in numbers. 
Another solution that is often mooted to deal with both low fertility and scarce labour is immigration, which in conformist, homogeneous Japan has so far been tiny, except to take up the nastiest of jobs. Most people's chief candidate for a bigger immigrant workforce has been health care, where a government desperate to reduce state medical costs ought to welcome cheaper Filipina nurses with open arms. The medical profession, protective of its own pay, has blocked that up till now. Eventually, cost pressures combined with a stronger economy are likely to break that resistance. But beyond nursing, nobody should expect a big rise in immigration. The social and cultural fear of it shows no sign of changing. 
The potential of robots
The opening article of this survey cited the OECD's recent estimate of Japan's potential annual growth rate in 2004-10: just 1.3%. That number anyway looks low, as even during the country's stagnant decade of 1993-2003 the annual average growth rate was 1.1%. What it reflects, though, is an arithmetical calculation based on two numbers: the shrinking labour force just described; and the slow annual growth in productivity in the 1990s of about 2%, a whole percentage point less than in the 1980s. But the OECD's projection for productivity growth until 2010 is only a miserable 1.7% a year. 
Here is a prediction, made with no arithmetic but much confidence: Japan's growth rate for the rest of this decade, and quite possibly for much of the following decade too, will be a lot higher than 1.3% a year. The country saw its productivity growth drop during the 1990s because it misused huge amounts of capital, and at the same time many companies hoarded labour rather than laying off workers. Now, with public-works schemes slashed, bank bad-debt accounts honest, shareholders and other ginger groups pressing public companies to boost profits and dividends, and the over-diversification of big companies a thing of the past, capital is bound to be allocated more efficiently. There is much catching up to be done in capital investment in any case that should boost productivity, and a much tighter labour market will force companies to seek ways to boost it even more.
One way that is already being talked about at the bigger manufacturing companies is the use of robots. Japan has long gone further than other developed countries in replacing workers with machines. An alternative is to replace Japanese workers with Chinese ones by opening factories in China, and some of that has been done. But the big electronics firms, for instance, are leery of that and others may become so too: Chinese workers' productivity is lower, they are harder for the Japanese to manage, there is a big risk of intellectual-property theft, and political relations between Japan and China are likely to remain scratchy. All this could well make robots and other machines increasingly attractive--especially if capital costs stay low.
No one can know, in an economy as large and diverse as Japan's, which industries are going to grow the most during the next 15 years. The game of picking winners became obsolete long ago. It is safe, though, to say that technology will still play a big part in investment and output growth in Japan. The country has been spending 3.1% of GDP on research and development even during the stagnant years, compared with 2.8% in America and an average of 1.9% in the European Union. Much of that is in advanced electronics, a field in which Japanese firms still lead the world. In future, there will be plenty too in nanotechnology, which takes the Japanese skill in miniaturisation down to the molecular level. Big efforts will also be made in biotechnology, though Japanese firms have a meagre record in that field so far.
A serious problem in the past 15 years has been slow growth in services businesses, which have failed to provide enough jobs and income to make up for those lost in metal-bashing. Deregulation has improved matters, but costs for telecoms and electricity remain high relative to those in other countries and there is still too little competition. A prime example is the vast wholesale-supply business: Jesper Koll, chief economist at Merrill Lynch in Tokyo, points out that of Japan's 380,000 wholesalers, two-thirds trade with each other rather than directly with a retailer or a producer. The squeeze on those middlemen has begun. Seven-Eleven, for example, recently cut soft-drink prices at its convenience stores by more than 20%, at the wholesalers' expense.
Another services business that will need a kick up its bottom line is travel and tourism. All those pensioners are going to want to do more and more sightseeing, and rural areas are going to need the jobs that tourism brings. Although transport in Japan is top-notch, it remains pricey, however, and hotels are poor. An even bigger problem is that job-creation through public works has made so much of the countryside so ugly, thwarting job-creation through tourism. There are the beginnings of a movement among local authorities to tidy up their areas, dealing with what have become known as keikan mondai, or view problems. But there will have to be a lot more of that sort of thing if tourism is going to grow, especially from abroad. 
Back to the politics of affluence
If the government is to become serious about raising productivity growth, which it surely must, competition will have to be strengthened, whatever the objections. Still, even with stronger antitrust enforcement and fresh deregulation to encourage more entrepreneurs, Japan is not going to become an American-style, free-market economy. You can tell by listening to one of its leading venture-capitalists, Yoshitaka Kitao of Softbank Investment. Despite his brash braces and combative manner, Mr Kitao talks a lot about the social obligations of companies. He thinks that young entrepreneurs like livedoor's Takafumi Horie, the notorious hostile bidder, are too greedy for money. 
Over the next 10-15 years, Japan will have to begin to deal with the consequences of population decline. Faced with that burden, the country's GDP growth will never again reach the dizzy heights of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, nor be anything like as exciting as China's. But the more important measure is GDP per head, for that gauges living standards: if moderate GDP growth can be maintained alongside a slowly shrinking population, then GDP per head will rise quite nicely. 
Just as neither the politics nor the economics of America after 1945 could sensibly be predicted on the basis of trends during the Great Depression of the 1930s, so the politics and economics of Japan ought not to be projected from its depressed past 15 years. With the important exception of the public debt, the excesses from that period now look to be gone. Politics and public policy will again face up to the demands of affluence, of labour shortages, of rising environmental concerns, of faltering universities and, above all, of a changing East Asian neighbourhood.
Given its huge electoral success on September 11th, much of that political debate can now be expected to take place within the Liberal Democratic Party, just as it has for the past half century, rather than between the twin poles of a two-party system. But it would take a brave man to predict that the LDP will still be in power in 2020. The lessons from Mr Koizumi, that electoral success requires charisma, a clear message and the promotion of change--rather than the old ingredients of money, a family name and a party machine--will not be lost on the younger generation in the opposition. Their time will come.
It might even come over the issue of foreign policy. The LDP's hawkish response to Chinese bullying has stoked up some nationalist feelings in Japan, but this remains a pacifist nation at heart. A bigger role in peacekeeping and humanitarian operations can be expected in future, but short of a grave international crisis there is little likelihood of Japan revising its constitution to unshackle its armed forces, nor of the country going nuclear. 
Hence a final prediction for the Japan of 2020. In 15 years' time Japan will be a leading member of some sort of pan-Asian union, which will help it to keep China at bay. But it will still huddle closest to the United States, which will still have bases on Japanese soil. Some things never change.
Caption: Rare and precious","Japan 's next 15 years are likely to be a lot sunnier than the last 15 
 EVERY so often , a slogan rings out : Welcome to the new Japan ! It comes from any pundit or panjandrum wanting to claim that , in a country that to many seems so unchanging , some dramatic new trend can be seen . But it is usually misleading , or exaggerated , for Japan does n't do drama ( and that is not a comment on Kabuki and Noh ) , except when it feels under threat of invasion , as in the 1860s , or suffers a wartime defeat , as in 1945 . The stock- and property - market crashes that began in 1990 were dramatic for those caught up in them , and certainly produced a sharp change in perceptions of Japan in the world as well as in Japan 's perception of itself . But the social and political response was totally undramatic . The country muddled through , at first in denial but later with a host of incremental adjustments . Fifteen years on , the same party is in government with a big majority , society remains stable , and Toyota is the world 's best car company . Anyone know the Japanese for plus ca change , plus c'est la meme chose ? 
 As this survey has argued , however , that too is misleading . Those incremental adjustments , in politics , corporate law , capital markets , financial regulation , labour law and practices , and much else besides , have altered the incentives guiding society , the economy and politics . In part , the effect has been to reduce the distortions , misallocation of capital and indiscipline that have for about two decades neutralised Japan 's long - standing economic and social strengths : excellent education , co - operative relations inside companies and advanced technology . But also , over the longer term , such a gradual accumulation of many small reforms will lead the country in new directions , especially given the recent changes in East Asia and the world economy as a whole , and given its own changing demography . No one can really know where those directions might take Japan over , say , the next 15 years . But some guesses can be made . 
 The easiest place to start is with demography . With birth rates having plummeted since the baby - boom of the 1950s and life expectancy having lengthened every year , the trend is pretty much fixed for at least the next 15 - 20 years : the government thinks the total population may have begun to shrink in the first half of this year , and it is certain to do so from 2007 onwards . That shrinkage will be slow , but with fewer children already entering the labour force and more people retiring , the working - age population ( ie , aged 15 - 64 ) will fall by about 0.7 % a year , says the Ministry of Health , Labour and Welfare . 
 If you extrapolate current trends well beyond 2020 , you get quite startling numbers . The health ministry 's central projection suggests Japan 's population could fall from nearly 128 m now to about 100 m in 2050 . Peter Morgan , chief economist in Tokyo for HSBC bank , reckons the ministry is being over - optimistic about birth rates , given that more and more women are marrying later or not at all . He thinks that a prudent projection for 2050 is actually a drop to 86 m people . As Mr Morgan knows , however , demography is not destiny beyond 15 - 20 years . France , Scandinavia and above all America have shown recently that falling fertility rates can start to rise again . That could happen in Japan too . 
 The trouble is that the possible policy responses to boost the workforce and revive population growth could end up contradicting one another . With the labour force shrinking and ageing , companies and the government are both likely to try much harder to bring more women into the labour force and to use them in skilled and responsible positions . But the more that effort succeeds , the fewer babies are likely to be born . If the government tries to encourage women to have more children , on the other hand , fewer will be in the workforce in their 20s and 30s . 
 The way to meet both of those objectives would be to spend a lot more public and corporate money on child - care facilities , which are currently in short supply . The old way was to use granny , but today 's and tomorrow 's grannies want to spend their retirements travelling the world , and young women are not keen on having them around the house in any case . So there is bound to be some increase in spending on child care . 
 Awkwardly , the pressure for that spending will come at the same time as the public finances are being tortured in other ways . Ideally , you would not want to start dealing with all these problems when the budget deficit is already at 6.4 % of GDP and gross public debt is 170 % of GDP , as they have been in 2004 - 05 . That is why the trend that Junichiro Koizumi has been busy accelerating , namely cutting back state spending , especially in wasteful public - works schemes and subsidised lending , is bound to continue . Space needs to be made in the public purse for child care , pensions and medical costs . 
 A shrinking labour force , with efforts to give women a bigger role , also means that the great worry of the past five years -- that the rise of part - time and contract workers was producing a two - tier workforce -- is likely to fade . There may be some more trimming of the protections given to regular workers in order to keep things flexible , but with labour scarce the new shifting army of irregulars , now 30 % of the total , will surely fall in numbers . 
 Another solution that is often mooted to deal with both low fertility and scarce labour is immigration , which in conformist , homogeneous Japan has so far been tiny , except to take up the nastiest of jobs . Most people 's chief candidate for a bigger immigrant workforce has been health care , where a government desperate to reduce state medical costs ought to welcome cheaper Filipina nurses with open arms . The medical profession , protective of its own pay , has blocked that up till now . Eventually , cost pressures combined with a stronger economy are likely to break that resistance . But beyond nursing , nobody should expect a big rise in immigration . The social and cultural fear of it shows no sign of changing . 
 The potential of robots 
 The opening article of this survey cited the OECD 's recent estimate of Japan 's potential annual growth rate in 2004 - 10 : just 1.3 % . That number anyway looks low , as even during the country 's stagnant decade of 1993 - 2003 the annual average growth rate was 1.1 % . What it reflects , though , is an arithmetical calculation based on two numbers : the shrinking labour force just described ; and the slow annual growth in productivity in the 1990s of about 2 % , a whole percentage point less than in the 1980s . But the OECD 's projection for productivity growth until 2010 is only a miserable 1.7 % a year . 
 Here is a prediction , made with no arithmetic but much confidence : Japan 's growth rate for the rest of this decade , and quite possibly for much of the following decade too , will be a lot higher than 1.3 % a year . The country saw its productivity growth drop during the 1990s because it misused huge amounts of capital , and at the same time many companies hoarded labour rather than laying off workers . Now , with public - works schemes slashed , bank bad - debt accounts honest , shareholders and other ginger groups pressing public companies to boost profits and dividends , and the over - diversification of big companies a thing of the past , capital is bound to be allocated more efficiently . There is much catching up to be done in capital investment in any case that should boost productivity , and a much tighter labour market will force companies to seek ways to boost it even more . 
 One way that is already being talked about at the bigger manufacturing companies is the use of robots . Japan has long gone further than other developed countries in replacing workers with machines . An alternative is to replace Japanese workers with Chinese ones by opening factories in China , and some of that has been done . But the big electronics firms , for instance , are leery of that and others may become so too : Chinese workers ' productivity is lower , they are harder for the Japanese to manage , there is a big risk of intellectual - property theft , and political relations between Japan and China are likely to remain scratchy . All this could well make robots and other machines increasingly attractive -- especially if capital costs stay low . 
 No one can know , in an economy as large and diverse as Japan 's , which industries are going to grow the most during the next 15 years . The game of picking winners became obsolete long ago .

In future , there will be plenty too in nanotechnology , which takes the Japanese skill in miniaturisation down to the molecular level . Big efforts will also be made in biotechnology , though Japanese firms have a meagre record in that field so far .

ANYONE who goes to a particular shady corner of Tokyo's Yasukuni shrine at 10am on October 15th will come across a curious sight. There, around a stone tablet some five feet high with a rock balanced on the top of it, the visitor will see South Korean officials, Buddhist monks and members of civic groups offering their veneration. This is curious, because Yasukuni is not simply a memorial to Japan's dead in all its wars; it is also the glorification of a half-century of Japanese militarism and aggression, of which the Koreans were the earliest victims. 
""But this monument"", says one South Korean official, ""is our shrine."" The stone is called, by the Koreans, Bukgwandaecheopbi, which means ""monument for the great victory at Bukgwan"". The great victory took place on the Korean peninsula in 1592, and it was a rare one over a Japanese army. The victors were a raggle-taggle collection of volunteer local Korean farmers, monks and landlords led by a General Jeong Mun-bu, and the monument was raised a century later, with a detailed description of the fight against the Japanese engraved on the face of it.
Near Bukgwan it stood until the Russo-Japanese war of 1904-05, which was fought chiefly over Korea. The stone took the fancy of a Japanese general who shipped it back as booty; and soon it found its way to the Yasukuni shrine. There it languished anonymously until 1978, when a South Korean recognised it. From then on, civic groups and the South Korean government lobbied for its return. This week, in a tight-lipped ceremony, the Japanese government and the shrine's Shinto priests agreed, and in a few days the stone will be flown to Seoul and put on public display.
Its journey will probably not end there. For Bukgwan happens to be in North Korea. One official says that, so warm are relations now between North and South, that the monument might even make its way up on the first train if rail links are re-established, as planned, next year. And relations between South Korea and Japan? Despite this small gesture of returning the Bukgwan stone, says the official, so long as Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, continues to visit the Yasukuni shrine each year, ""a deterioration in relations at the highest level is unavoidable.""","A small improvement in Japan-Korea relations

Romano Prodi, Italy's opposition leader, hailed a ""dream-like"" victory after securing three-quarters of the vote in a primary designed to see who was the most popular politician on the centre-left. But the atmosphere was marred by the assassination of the deputy governor of the Calabria region. 
Some things don't change
Junichiro Koizumi, Japan's prime minister, paid a surprise visit to the Yasukuni shrine, where Japan's war dead, including 14 war criminals, are remembered. Both China and South Korea cancelled planned ministerial meetings, and a summit meeting with South Korea has also been put on hold.
New Zealand's prime minister, Helen Clark, formed her latest government, a month after a general election. In a novel development, it will feature ministers from allied parties who do not sit in cabinet.
Following last week's earthquake, India restored telephone links across the ""line of control"" dividing Indian- from Pakistan-ruled Kashmir. The two sides are considering opening the line for humanitarian relief. But the number of people at risk from the quake continued to mount. There are now thought to be 3m people left homeless, many in desperate conditions.
Human-rights groups criticised a ten-year sentence handed to a Maldives opposition activist, Jennifer Latheef, who was convicted of inciting a riot in 2003.

LATE last week, Japan's parliament comfortably passed bills that will eventually lead to the privatisation of the country's post office, a behemoth that not only delivers the mail but is also the world's biggest financial institution, specialising in channelling savings towards politicians' pork-barrel projects. It was the upper house's voting down of the bills in the summer that led the prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, to go over the head of his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and call a snap general election for September 11th. The astounding outcome of that political gamble--a clear popular mandate for privatisation--brought a fractious LDP back into line, redoubling the prime minister's authority both within the government and the country as a whole.
Yet rather than bask in these achievements, Mr Koizumi this week strode towards new controversy, by paying a sudden visit (his fifth as prime minister) to Tokyo's Yasukuni shrine on October 17th. The place is Japan's chief memorial to its war dead. It is also a focal point for right-wing fanatics and their view that Japan was more victim than aggressor in the half-century of Asian wars up till Japan's defeat in 1945. The souls of 14 war criminals are among those enshrined there.
Even though his visit was followed by those of about 200 parliament members, Mr Koizumi immediately played it down. He went, you see, in a private capacity not a public one: did he not wear a plain grey suit instead of the customary morning tails? Though he pledged that Japan would never wage war again, both Chinese and South Korean foreign ministers cancelled planned meetings with their Japanese counterpart, Nobutaka Machimura. The Chinese authorities issued orders to cancel bilateral exchanges on the mainland, citing a desire at a time of fervent anti-Japanese feelings to prevent ""unexpected contingencies"". A planned summit later this year between South Korea's Roh Moo-hyun and Mr Koizumi is also off.
Mr Koizumi's visit also displeased some of his domestic allies. No other cabinet members visited the shrine, and some were outspoken in their criticism. Still, the consequence for Mr Koizumi's domestic agenda is likely to be negligible. There, the two issues of pressing interest to the political classes are, first, who is in the running to succeed Mr Koizumi if, as he promises, he steps down as party leader and prime minister next September; and second, now that postal privatisation is in the bag, what, if anything, is Mr Koizumi's reform agenda for the remainder of his term? When those two issues are answered, a third will arise: will the successor wish or be able to run with the reform agenda sketched out by Mr Koizumi?
Part-answers to all these questions may be supplied as soon as November 2nd, when a cabinet reshuffle is expected. Four men are spoken of as possible successors to Mr Koizumi: the favourite, Shinzo Abe, the LDP's acting secretary-general, a vocal Koizumi supporter and scion of a political dynasty; Yasuo Fukuda, an LDP grandee (and son of a former prime minister) who has kept some distance from Mr Koizumi since resigning as chief cabinet secretary last year; Taro Aso, internal-affairs minister and, like Mr Abe, grandson of a former prime minister; and Sadakazu Tanigaki, the finance minister, whose chief virtue is that he has few enemies. If any of these fail to get a post in the new cabinet, their chances are scotched.
One other person to watch in the reshuffle is Heizo Takenaka. Mr Takenaka, a former academic, was put in charge of first banking reform and then postal privatisation. He has now been instructed to come up with proposals to reform the remaining clutch of government-affiliated banks, to clean up a series of opaque government accounts, and to cut the number of public employees at every level of government. What task Mr Takenaka is allotted, whether it is slimming government or reforming the medical system, for instance, will give a sense of the priorities in what remains of Mr Koizumi's term.
And after that? Mr Koizumi's mantle is attractive enough for his successor to want to inherit it; so his policies are likely to be followed. None of the four candidates for the party leadership appears to have differences over domestic policy. The problem is knowing whether they have any strong views at all.","Now that Junichiro Koizumi 's visited the Yasukuni shrine

THEY'RE back, and the lap dancers approve. Fund managers--from America, Europe and Cayman-registered hedge funds--complain that they can't get a room in Tokyo's swishest hotels. Brokers from the likes of UBS and Goldman Sachs pack their overseas clients into the strip joints of Roppongi. For international money managers, Tokyo--ignored for so long--is the big happy bull-market story. Even golf courses, that great symbol of bubble and bust, are back in the news, as Lone Star, an American investment group and the biggest operator of courses in Japan, says it will float them on the stockmarket. Still, one anxiety is likely to grow: foreign investors' exuberance about Japan is not shared by the locals.
Japanese shares are nowhere near their peak of 1990, at the end of the bubble years. Yet since the market bottomed in the spring of 2003, the Tokyo Stock Exchange's broad-based Topix index has nearly doubled, to four-year highs. It has rallied by a quarter since early summer alone, even if shares have retreated a bit in recent days. The market has been driven up almost entirely by foreigners. Since April 2003 overseas investors have bought an extraordinary yen22 trillion-worth ($191 billion) of Japanese equities, and now own a quarter of all listed shares. At the outset, hedge funds were the biggest buyers--opportunistic money that presumably might leave as swiftly as it arrived. Recent buying, though, appears to have been by funds taking a long view of Japan's prospects.
It is hard if not impossible to find an economist or equity strategist who has not become markedly more upbeat about that long view. On the political front, the striking win for Junichiro Koizumi, the prime minister, and his Liberal Democratic Party on September 11th underscored a popular desire for the incremental reforms that have begun to roll back the overweening power of the pork-barrel state. Although Mr Koizumi insists he will step down as prime minister next September, his successor will not be able to ignore such a popular mandate. The result, eventually, ought to be a smaller government and a much more flexible economy.
On the structural side, economists say, the baneful consequences of the bubble years are now in the past. The huge overhang of bad debts in the banking system, excess industrial capacity and unproductive labour that held back the Japanese economy for over a decade has now largely been cleared.
Crucially, much of the corporate sector has undergone profound change. Japan's cosy system of cross-shareholdings has fallen from half of all stockmarket capitalisation at the peak to just one-fifth today, a measure of greater corporate focus. A fall in unit labour costs is a mark of greater labour flexibility. Corporate profits have jumped, to twice what they were at the height of the bubble economy, and are driving an investment boom. Further scope for productivity increases is highly bullish for shares in the long run.
The only thing missing in this upbeat story is a clear end to several years of post-bubble deflation. Yet on October 18th, the Bank of Japan's deputy governor, Kazumasa Iwata, told parliament that the central bank expected consumer-price inflation to be out of negative territory by the end of the year. His comments also signal that sometime in 2006 the bank will cease its ultra-loose policy of ""quantitative easing""--essentially, flooding the economy with free money. In anticipation, the price of Japanese government bonds has been falling recently (and their yields therefore rising). In most other countries, this would be seen as bearish for equities. Not in Japan: economists explain the sell-off in the bond market as a return to the proper pricing of money and a more normally functioning economy.
Yet domestic investors continue to be net sellers of Japanese shares. Their appetite for risk, after years of disappointment, does not match that of foreigners. Of households' financial assets, 54% are kept in bank deposits or under the mattress; shares comprise just 8.5%. Although no bear himself, Paul Sheard, chief economist in Japan at Lehman Brothers, says that this caution perhaps remains justified, for deflationary headwinds still blow.
Underwhelmed
One indication is the property market. Residential land prices in Tokyo rose in the first half of this year for the first time in 15 years, but prices continue to fall elsewhere, albeit at a slowing rate. It is hard to imagine households being bullish about shares before they are bullish again about their homes. A second is bank lending. In September private-sector banks lent more (after adjusting for ""special factors"") than they had a year before, for the second month in a row. And regional banks are starting to lend more again, chiefly to small and medium-sized businesses. Nevertheless lending by the big city banks has still to recover. And once public financial institutions are taken into account, total lending is still contracting.
Given these lingering worries, what the Bank of Japan does next is crucial. Raise interest rates too soon--by next spring, for instance, as some suggest--and Japan's tentative recovery could stall (alas, not for the first time). Households could hold back, either from buying goods and services or from investing in shares. Bear in mind too that a rise in consumption taxes to help plug the budget deficit is a near-certainty for 2007, which will act as a dampener.
True bulls, however, make two points about local investors. Jesper Koll, Merrill Lynch's chief economist in Tokyo, says that the Japanese are already buying shares, but in a way that does not show in official statistics: Japanese brokers, investment trusts and life insurers, with an appalling investment record themselves, are entrusting money to the same hedge funds whose managers are partying in Roppongi.
The second point, made by Christopher Wood, the chief Asian equity strategist at CLSA, an investment bank, is that Japan is in a bull market that could last for years. ""The longer the Japanese domestics do not buy, the more inevitably they will buy. And when they do, they will do it all at the same time,"" he argues. He may be right, but possibly not before some foreigners wonder whether they are setting themselves up for one last fall.","Foreigners are piling into Japanese shares . The locals are n't so sure

SITTING bare-footed and cross-legged under a makeshift awning, Teruo Onishi, a retired schoolteacher and peace activist, looks across from the beach at Henoko to an islet with a shrine to welcome the sea gods that look after this part of the world, and a coral reef beyond. He delivers a history lesson. Though the arrival at Japan's shores in 1854 of Commodore Matthew Perry's ""black ships"" may, with good reason, be better known to Japan and the world, says Mr Onishi, it is the earlier, friendly visit to Okinawa of a British naval captain, Basil Hall, in 1816 that is remembered by locals.
Okinawans took to Hall, allowing him to land and even to bury one of his crew--the grave may still be seen. On his voyage back to England, Hall called on Napoleon on St Helena. He spoke warmly and at length of the Ryukyu archipelago (then known as Loo-Choo, which now makes up Japan's Okinawa prefecture). When, Hall wrote later, he recounted how the Okinawans had no ""wars or weapons of destruction"", Napoleon was amazed.
Today, few spots in the world are as heavy with weapons of destruction as Okinawa, and they are American: this southernmost of Japan's prefectures is home to half the 50,000 servicemen America maintains in the country. After a teenage girl was raped in 1995 by three of them, America agreed to close its most deeply resented facility on Okinawa--Futenma air base, its biggest overseas marine base, squeezed right up against crowded Ginowan city. But first, an alternative had to be found.
America proposed building a floating heliport 1.5 miles (2.5km) long over the coral reef at Henoko, on Okinawa's eastern side. The Japanese government turned down the site, where dugong, a rare sea-cow, graze. Instead, it proposed that the heliport be built on land near Henoko, where America's Camp Schwab now sits. This time the Americans objected. Not only would that cramp the marines' training, they said; there were also villages about, and the whole point of relocating was to escape local residents' objections to noise and danger.
Nearly a decade after the negotiations to move Futenma began, a sense of urgency has been growing. Occasional rapes, assaults and traffic accidents committed by American servicemen still arouse resentment. Last year a helicopter crashed on a university campus in Ginowan. Both America and Japan are now keen to have something to show for a planned summit between George Bush and Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, in mid-November, when Mr Bush may also visit Okinawa.
This week the Americans' frustration erupted over the lack of progress. Richard Lawless, deputy defence secretary for Asia and the Pacific, said in Tokyo that the security alliance with Japan, the foundation of America's security policy in Asia, was being undermined by ""interminable dialogue over parochial issues"". That outburst seemed to do the trick. For on October 26th a deal appeared to have been reached. This would involve building a heliport with a shorter runway, partly on Camp Schwab land and partly running into the sea.
This will supposedly save the dugong's grounds and keep flights farther from residential areas. Ending the rift with Japan will also help the Americans to overhaul their security strategy in East Asia, giving them more flexibility to deal with the threats posed by terrorism, by a nuclear-armed North Korea, by the military muscle of a rising China and, with that, the potential for conflict over Taiwan. With the base row over, if America can rely upon Japan to play a greater part in its own defence, America can reduce the number of its own troops in Japan and move some forces to Guam or even Hawaii.
First, however, the deal over the relocation of the Okinawa air base has to satisfy the people of the island, and the politics is tricky. For a start, the governor, Keiichi Inamine, a proud man, has blessed the offshore heliport scheme and appears unwilling to lose face. As for the electorate, anti-military feelings are high. It is not just that Okinawa, with 0.6% of Japan's land area, has long had to bear a disproportionate brunt of the American presence. History still plays a powerful part: some of the bloodiest campaigns anywhere in the second world war were fought in Okinawa, and a third of the civilian population died. America did not return Okinawa's sovereignty to Japan until 1972, and feelings of second-class citizenship linger.
On the other hand, the bases' presence brings lashings of central government money to the country's poorest prefecture. On top of a cornucopia of grants, subsidies and tax concessions, the government pays the salaries of the 8,800 Japanese who work in the bases. Okinawans on whose land the bases are built are paid yen80 billion ($670m, or over $100,000 a hectare) in rent a year. These landowners, of whom there are 29,000, are in no hurry to see the Americans go. With a key mayoral race in Nago, near Henoko, next January and a governor's race later in the year, regional security might yet have to wait.

Plans for a ""grand coalition"" in Germany were thrown into disarray when two of its main backers stepped down. Franz Muntefering quit as chairman of the Social Democrats after failing to get his candidate chosen as party secretary. Edmund Stoiber, head of the Bavarian Christian Social Union, then said he would not serve as economics minister. The would-be chancellor and head of the Christian Democrats, Angela Merkel, insisted that she would create a grand coalition anyway.
Paris was convulsed by several days of rioting in the suburbs after two North Africans died, allegedly while fleeing police. France's prime minister, Dominique de Villepin, cancelled a trip to Canada to deal with the consequences.
The conservative Law and Justice Party, which took the most seats in Poland's election in September, formed a minority government with Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz as prime minister. The government drew support from a populist party led by Andrzej Lepper, but not from the second-biggest conservative party, Civic Platform.
Britain's work and pensions secretary, David Blunkett, resigned from Tony Blair's cabinet (again). He had failed to follow the proper rules over shareholdings and directorships after he quit as home secretary last December over an affair.
Trading up
On the eve of a 34-country Summit of the Americas in Argentina, George Bush admitted that a plan for a Pan-American free-trade area had ""stalled"". He said the Doha round of world trade talks was more important. 
An inquiry into the abuse of a scheme by Canada's Liberal government to promote federalism in Quebec exonerated Paul Martin, the prime minister, but blamed Jean Chretien, his predecessor, for ""omissions"" and several of his officials for mismanagement.
A report in Veja, Brazil's leading news magazine, claimed that the Workers' Party of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva received $3m from the Cuban government for its election campaign in 2002. Brazil's electoral law bans foreign donations. The party's president and the Cuban government both denied the claim.
Bolivia's caretaker president, Eduardo Rodriguez, issued a decree postponing his country's general election by two weeks to December 18th, after Congress had failed to settle a row over redistricting. The president's decree awards four extra seats to the more prosperous east at the expense of the highland west.

Iran's new president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, refused to recant after western leaders reacted with outrage to his remarks last week that Israel's ""occupying regime"" should be ""wiped off the map"". Moreover, Iran seemed set to start processing a new batch of uranium at its Isfahan nuclear plant--despite western pressure to halt all such activities.
The UN Security Council unanimously told Syria to co-operate more fully with a UN investigation into the killing of a former Lebanese prime minister, Rafik Hariri, or face ""further action"", meaning economic sanctions. Syrians suspected of involvement in the killings, some very close to President Bashar Assad, could face a ban on travel and have their foreign assets frozen.
In Zimbabwe, a minister in President Robert Mugabe's government admitted that the forcible seizure of mostly white-owned farms had contributed to the current massive crop failure in the country. Farms had been given to ""people without the faintest idea of farming"".

JUNICHIRO KOIZUMI says he wants to have time to dine out and listen to music again. So though he led the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to a landslide victory in a snap general election in September, he still insists that he will step down as prime minister next September, after five years in the job, when his term as LDP president expires. Since he has also promised to give those in the running to succeed him the chance to prove themselves before he goes, the cabinet reshuffle that took place this week--presumably his last--has been eagerly dissected.
The only man in politics approaching Mr Koizumi in popular appeal is Shinzo Abe, whom the prime minister has now brought into the cabinet as chief cabinet secretary. This 51-year-old is considered, at least by political standards, to be both youthful and good-looking. He is from a notable political dynasty. And, perhaps contributing most to his popularity, he has taken a hard line against North Korea over their abduction of Japanese people in the 1970s and 1980s. What has probably counted most with Mr Koizumi, however, is that Mr Abe has been a staunch supporter of his domestic reforms. This week came his reward. The chief cabinet secretary has power second only to the prime minister, for not only is he responsible for managing the cabinet, but he also serves as the government spokesman.
When asked whether he was interested in the top job, his rival, Taro Aso, replied with un-Japanese frankness: ""I should say so."" His prospects will not have been harmed by being made foreign minister, a reward for helping Mr Koizumi, as internal-affairs minister, with the drive to privatise the post office. A third possible contender for the leadership is Sadakazu Tanigaki, who may have been relieved to keep his job as finance minister: Mr Koizumi is said to have berated him last week for not pushing reform hard enough.
The fourth politician until recently thought of as a candidate, Yasuo Fukuda, failed to make it back into the cabinet after resigning as chief cabinet secretary last year. At 69, his age may have counted against him, and he was probably no fan of Mr Koizumi's centralising style of leadership. He has also long taken a foreign-policy line notably softer towards China than that of either Mr Abe or Mr Aso. These two not only advocate a more muscular role for Japan in international and security affairs, in large part in order to counter a rising China, but also visit the Yasukuni shrine, a symbol of Japan's militarist past. 
The prime minister, then, has promoted potential successors in the same nationalist mould as himself. But it is in the realm of domestic policy that they will have to prove themselves, for the reshuffle, more than anything, shows Mr Koizumi's determination to push on with reform. Mr Tanigaki's chief job, for example, is now to privatise or get rid of eight government-affiliated banks; he will also have the unpopular task of pushing through a rise in the sales tax to help cut the budget deficit.
The new minister for the economy and financial affairs, Kaoru Yosano, who comes from running the LDP's policy-research council, takes over the post that has been at the heart of Mr Koizumi's reform drive. The previous incumbent, Heizo Takenaka, an academic economist whom Mr Koizumi brought into government to sort out first the banks and then the postal system, has been made minister for internal affairs. He will also continue to oversee postal reform. His main task will be to slash the numbers of civil servants and to decentralise government powers to tax and spend. But if he rises to the challenge, Mr Takenaka might even be considered as being a potential interim prime minister. After all, no one now doubts Mr Koizumi's capacity to surprise.","Junichiro Koizumi plans to ensure Junichiro Koizumi's reforms outlast Junichiro Koizumi

ON GEORGE BUSH'S swing through North-East Asia--taking in South Korea, host to a regional summit, China and Mongolia--the president stopped off first in Japan, the United States's staunchest ally in the region. In Kyoto on November 16th, Mr Bush talked about his hopes for the extension of the democracy and freedom that he has wished on other parts of the world. Chiefly, Mr Bush urged China to follow the examples of Japan, South Korea and--an example bound to infuriate--Taiwan in embracing ""the universal principles"" of democracy and freedom.
In particular, the president singled out Japan for praise. The earliest country to adopt democratic norms, Japan was ""a pillar of stability and security for the region"". And on the back of trade and investment, ideas about freedom had flowed too, for a ""free Japan has helped transform the lives of others in the region"".
If only, many Japanese think, that were true now. Instead, a growing obsession among policy types is how fast Japan is losing power and prestige. ""Japan"", says Yukio Okamoto, a former diplomat who now runs a political consultancy, ""has no friend and, in the context of China's rise, I'm very concerned about it.""
It is not, in this view, just that Japan's economic influence in the rest of Asia ebbed after the country's economic bubble burst in the early 1990s, allowing China to fill the gap. Rather, the root of Japan's malaise is friction with its neighbours, chiefly China and South Korea, over historical debates about Japan's wartime guilt. Those who hold this view think that the blame falls fairly evenly. China plays up nationalist, anti-Japanese sentiment at home in an attempt to unify a country whose ruling ideology is bankrupt. And the Japanese government declines to overhaul an educational system that glosses over the country's responsibility for its wartime past. Meanwhile, the prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, continues to inflame foreign sensitivities by visiting Tokyo's Yasukuni shrine, where the souls of Japan's war dead are enshrined.
These tensions about the past have much to do with rivalry in the future. And a common view now is that the spat has already weakened Japan's position in Asia. One foreign-policy expert argues that Asia is splitting into two: ""continental"" Asia, where China is fast becoming the hegemon, and ""island"" Asia, which includes, well, Japan. China lays active claim to Japan's Senkaku islands, and rights to oil and gas fields in the East China Sea are disputed. Last year an incursion by a Chinese submarine into Japanese waters drew a rare Chinese apology. And this summer, China lobbied vigorously against Japan's bid for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. Such tensions are inevitable, perhaps, given that the alliance with America, conceived in the cold war, is these days mostly about containing China.
In this context, the Japanese are obsessively taking the pulse of the country's relationship with America. On matters of trade, relations are a world away from the frictions of the past two decades over cars, semiconductors and exchange rates. Even that most touchy of subjects, beef, may not be a problem much longer. Now that a panel of worthies has pronounced on the issue, the Japanese government appears to be getting ready to lift a two-year ban on American beef imports following an outbreak of mad-cow disease. And although Japan has shown not a scintilla of zeal for moving the Doha round of trade talks forward, Mr Bush dealt only the mildest of rebukes this week. China has taken over the role of trade ogre from Japan--hardly surprising since its trade surplus with America is almost three times Japan's.
It is over matters of security that Japanese policymakers have their niggles. Currently, America and Japan are deep in discussion between their respective defence and foreign ministries about reshaping their security alliance in a way that will supposedly lead to a ""transformation"" of America's huge military presence in Japan, requiring fewer, more mobile American troops and greater ""burden-sharing"" from Japan in the face of future threats. These include terrorism, a nuclear North Korea and, one day perhaps, China making a grab for Japan's near-neighbour, Taiwan. The deliberations, which began in 1996, might come to fruition next spring.
Part of the agreement, it has already been announced, is to move 7,000 American troops from Japan to Guam and possibly Hawaii--provided that they can return quickly to Japan in time of crisis. Yet some Japanese strategists worry about American commitment. ""Transformation"", they say, could come to mean mainly saving money. So, says Naoyuki Agawa of Keio University, one potential risk for Japan is that the Americans will ""think that technology can compensate for forward deployment"". Another worry, which Mr Bush's assurances in Kyoto have not entirely dispelled, is that the administration, burdened with troubles at home and overstretched in Iraq, might cut back its diplomatic and military efforts in Asia.
Either way, the challenges of a nuclear North Korea and an ascendant China strengthen the hand in foreign-policy circles of those ""realists"" who argue for a greater ""normalisation"" of Japanese foreign policy. They include not just Mr Koizumi, but his new foreign minister, Taro Aso, and new chief cabinet secretary, Shinzo Abe. By normalisation, they mean Japan should better protect its interests by taking on a more muscular security role, even if that means amending or at least reinterpreting Japan's pacifist constitution.
That does not mean pursuing an independent policy--at least, not for now. After all, by pushing the constitution to its limits in sending navy refuelling ships and escorts to the Indian Ocean during the Afghan war in 2001 and keeping them there, and by putting peacekeepers in southern Iraq, Mr Koizumi has gone out of his way to show support for America. With peacekeeping missions in Cambodia and East Timor, Japan has also helped cut America's burden in the region. Hence the praise this week. But should America's commitment to Japan ever waver, a more independent stance to fall back on wouldn't hurt.","Worries in Japan over its declining influence in the region make good relations with America all the more important

A GREAT display of unity marked the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) summit in Pusan, South Korea, last weekend: the assembled leaders agreed that bird flu was a bad thing. Otherwise, the show was a depressing exercise. A welcome call was made for progress in the talks to liberalise world trade; and the assembled heads admonished Europe for showing no great readiness to slash farm protection. Yet APEC's motley bunch had no common proposals of their own for giving momentum to trade liberalisation before the crucial World Trade Organisation (WTO) talks due in December. And the criticism of Europe was mild.
Above all, a political spat between Japan and its neighbours over its wartime past brought home the limits to regional co-operation. South Korea's president, Roh Moo-hyun, delivered a finger-wagging lecture to Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, about his visits to Tokyo's Yasukuni shrine, where some war criminals are honoured. China's president, Hu Jintao, refused to chat with Mr Koizumi on the sidelines. Packing an empty bag, Mr Koizumi returned to Tokyo to unveil the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's proposals for revising Japan's pacifist constitution. The new draft keeps the country's commitment to peace but asserts Japan's right to defend itself, use its armed forces to take part in international operations and even come to the aid of allies. The unveiling marks the beginning of a long and needed debate about Japan's ""normalisation"". Yet the move is bound to provoke accusations from China of militarism on the rise.
Mr Koizumi also welcomed a visit by President Vladimir Putin of Russia. Unresolved wartime issues colour relations between these two countries, too, for in the last days of the second world war the Soviet Union seized four Kurile islands, known in Japan as the Northern Territories; and since they have not been returned, no border between Russia and Japan has been drawn nor peace treaty signed. When Mr Putin last visited Japan five years ago, differences were wide. This time, he was determined to talk only about business, and dragged along dozens of Russian executives. Mr Koizumi's reward was the tantalising promise of a pipeline running from oilfields in eastern Siberia to the Sea of Japan. Japan promised in return to back Russia's bid to join the WTO.
As for President George Bush, his APEC summit was not much better than Mr Koizumi's. His attention was continually distracted by the domestic fallout from Iraq. And, the day after Mr Bush had praised Mr Roh for having committed 3,200 troops in Iraq, helping ""democracy flourish"" in the Middle East, his hosts announced that a third of them were to be withdrawn. With a bitter taste, Mr Bush left for Beijing. 
His visit to China was not meant to change the world. By the time he departed on November 21st for the first ever presidential trip to Mongolia--having met top Chinese leaders, attended a church service and, of all things, gone cycling with Chinese athletes--Mr Bush could fairly claim to have done what he came to do: keep things ticking along in what is perhaps becoming the world's most crucial bilateral relationship.
Mr Bush describes Sino-American relations as ""complex"". The talks with Hu Jintao and the prime minister, Wen Jiabao, covered a nuclear North Korea, the status of Taiwan and America's grievances over China's exchange-rate policy, its $200 billion annual trade surplus with America, violations of intellectual property rights and shoddy human-rights practices.
America evidently wants to tread more gingerly on matters of human rights these days. At any rate, says China's foreign-ministry spokesman, Kong Quan, human rights ""made up a tiny, tiny, tiny part"" of the meetings. Mr Bush urged China's leaders to allow greater religious and political freedom. Keen for its part to keep the visit friendly and business-like, China likewise offered measured responses. It also claimed progress on improving human rights, and vaguely promised more.
China gave similar promises, but no timetable, to make its currency more flexible. It also promised to buy 70 jets from Boeing over the next three years. None of this is earth-shaking stuff, but the tone of these meetings is increasingly mature. That is a virtue that China and Japan, to the detriment of the region's stability, have not found in their relations.","Political limits to the region 's economic aspirations 
 A GREAT display of unity marked the Asia - Pacific Economic Co - operation ( APEC ) summit in Pusan , South Korea , last weekend : the assembled leaders agreed that bird flu was a bad thing . Otherwise , the show was a depressing exercise . A welcome call was made for progress in the talks to liberalise world trade ; and the assembled heads admonished Europe for showing no great readiness to slash farm protection . Yet APEC 's motley bunch had no common proposals of their own for giving momentum to trade liberalisation before the crucial World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) talks due in December . And the criticism of Europe was mild . 
 Above all , a political spat between Japan and its neighbours over its wartime past brought home the limits to regional co - operation . South Korea 's president , Roh Moo - hyun , delivered a finger - wagging lecture to Junichiro Koizumi's , about Junichiro Koizumi's visits to Tokyo 's Yasukuni shrine , where some war criminals are honoured . China 's president , Hu Jintao , refused to chat with Junichiro Koizumi on the sidelines . Packing an empty bag , Junichiro Koizumi returned to Tokyo to unveil the ruling Liberal Democratic Party 's proposals for revising Japan 's pacifist constitution . The new draft keeps the country 's commitment to peace but asserts Japan 's right to defend itself , use its armed forces to take part in international operations and even come to the aid of allies . The unveiling marks the beginning of a long and needed debate about Japan 's "" normalisation "" . Yet the move is bound to provoke accusations from China of militarism on the rise . 
 Junichiro Koizumi also welcomed a visit by President Vladimir Putin of Russia . Unresolved wartime issues colour relations between these two countries , too , for in the last days of the second world war the Soviet Union seized four Kurile islands , known in Japan as the Northern Territories ; and since they have not been returned , no border between Russia and Japan has been drawn nor peace treaty signed . When Mr Putin last visited Japan five years ago , differences were wide . This time , Junichiro Koizumi was determined to talk only about business , and dragged along dozens of Russian executives . Junichiro Koizumi's reward was the tantalising promise of a pipeline running from oilfields in eastern Siberia to the Sea of Japan . Japan promised in return to back Russia 's bid to join the WTO .

NEXT week, half the world will sit down together in Kuala Lumpur for the first East Asia Summit. Since they represent collectively 49% of the global population (or claim to, in the case of China, Myanmar and a few other authoritarian hold-outs), you might think the summiteers would have some weighty matters to discuss. China and India, two populous, up-and-coming powers that are both potential partners and potential competitors, will be there. So will China's longer-standing regional rival, Japan, still East Asia's weightiest economy and these days a much more active player across the board; as will South Korea, the ten countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), Australia and New Zealand. The dawn of a ""new Asia"", claim enthusiasts. But most of the 16 at the table will be relieved simply to agree to meet again. So what, then, is the point in meeting at all?
Getting this motley bunch together is a feat. Unlike today's more settled Europe, fast-changing East Asia lacks the underpinnings of broad alliances, and is criss-crossed instead by unstable rivalries. Real power is still measured unnervingly in comparisons of missile reach and warship tallies. And real conflict threatens from time to time, over rival claims to rocks and reefs thought to sit atop sought-after energy reserves, over Taiwan and over North Korea's threatening nuclear behaviour. Yet the region boasts few talking shops, except for the unwieldy annual Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) summit and ASEAN's Regional Forum and its other off-shoots (meetings will take place next week, first with China, Japan and South Korea bilaterally, then at what is called ASEAN+3), all heavily scripted, awkwardly choreographed events. 
Divergent views, if not downright hostility, across the table will cramp diplomatic style at the first East Asian Summit too. China's prime minister, Wen Jiabao, may yet even refuse to talk to Japan's Junichiro Koizumi, because of his controversial visits to the Yasukuni shrine that honours Japan's war-dead but where some war criminals are also enshrined. 
Not only that, but America, the Asia-Pacific power that does most for the region's stability and security, is not invited. China, with ambitions to regional leadership, planned it that way. Yet China's idea for an East-Asians-only club, with a ""security dimension"" modelled on the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation which it has used to counter American influence in Central Asia, was blocked by Japan and America's other friends in the region. By drawing in India they have usefully diluted China's influence, to the quiet relief of everyone else, as has the invitation to Australia and New Zealand. But America is miffed to be excluded, and will be tempted to think that any club that won't have it as a founder-member isn't worth paying heed to.
Irrelevance may indeed be the East Asia Summit's fate. But to wish for that would be a mistake. Excited talk of an Asian version of the European Union is hugely premature. But alongside the military rivalries, there is now emerging an East Asian community of other more beneficial interests: in trade, investment and financial co-operation, as well as in combatting global scourges like AIDS and bird flu, or dealing with piracy, proliferation and terrorism. 
Nor would mimicking the EU be a measure of Asia's success. Without all the burdensome fish quotas and labour-market regulations that Europeans have invented for themselves, East Asia's economies (except dysfunctional Myanmar's) are already growing closer. Next week's 16 summiteers already do more than half (51%) of their total trade with each other. Some look forward to a time when ""Asia"" collectively will speak truth to both America and the EU in talks on trade and the world economy.
Letting the past go
Whether that will ever be possible with contending heavyweights like China, Japan, India and a someday united Korea is doubtful. But the more opportunities for Asia's bigs and smalls to talk about practical things, the better: a former Japanese and a former South Korean foreign minister have joined forces with the private Eurasia Group to propose a more permanent five-party North-East Asia security dialogue (growing out of the six-party talks over North Korea), including both America and Russia. But none of this will help unless China, Japan and Korea find ways to put their awful history behind them where it now belongs (a reformed shrine to Japan's war-dead would help too), stop teaching their schoolchildren to loathe one another, and look instead to Asia's future.","And that means China and Japan too

THE most prominent feature of the mess into which Japan's economy had sunk after the bursting of its asset bubble a decade and a half ago was the country's grinding deflation: for the past seven years, prices have fallen relentlessly. So it is a momentous thing to contemplate the return of inflation, however mild, by the year's end. In October the ""core"" consumer-price index (ie, excluding fresh food) remained unchanged, compared with a year earlier, after a 0.1% fall in September. When figures for November come out later this month, they, too, will probably show prices unchanged or, whisper it quietly, even a tiny bit higher. But even if inflation is not to return in November, most economists say, then expect galloping inflation of 0.1% in December.
A cause for celebration, you would think, in an economy that is now showing ever more signs of pulling itself out of its long slump. Yet the only thing to be uncorked is an unholy row between the government of the prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, and the central bank.
As the economy picks up, the Bank of Japan has been making it clear that the day is approaching when it will stop flooding the banking system with excess liquidity, a policy known as ""quantitative easing"" that was introduced in 2001 when interest rates that had been driven down to zero were still doing nothing to revive the economy. 
In particular, the Bank of Japan thinks that the output gap between what the economy can produce and what it is actually producing is narrowing quite fast, raising the prospect of imminent inflationary pressures. The central bank is also worried that speculative bubbles might already be starting to form in some asset markets. The stockmarket, for instance, is up by one-tenth since the beginning of November, and by about 40% since the start of the year. So there are good reasons, the bank reckons, to prepare the world for an ""exit"" from a policy that targets the amount of liquidity sloshing around the system, in favour of adopting once again the more orthodox policy of steering monetary policy by setting interest rates.
A livid government, thinking such a move premature, has been hurling threats at the central bank. Heizo Takenaka, the new internal-affairs minister and Mr Koizumi's chief reformist ally, said recently that monetary policy was not the Bank of Japan's alone to make; should it end its policy of super-loose money, he added, then the central bank's independence, granted only in 1998, ""could be discussed in the political arena."" Meanwhile, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party has just formed a new monetary-policy panel, headed by a fierce critic of the central bank, Kozo Yamamoto. The central bank is highly sensitive to criticism, given some big blunders in the past, especially when it raised rates in August 2000, way too soon.
Who is right this time? Certainly, the end of deflation is not assured. There is a risk that price rises will peak after the first quarter of next year, if the past effects of higher oil prices start to work their way out of the consumer-price index. The Bank of Japan forecasts inflation in the fiscal year to end-March 2007 of 0.5%: though at the optimistic end of the range of forecasts, it hardly provides much margin for error.
The government's chief concern, however, has to do with burden-sharing. Indeed, its alarm can be seen partly as a measure of its commitment to reforms which, while welcome in the long run, have a depressive effect in the short term. Mr Koizumi is committed to slashing debt issuance in order to plug a big budget deficit, while a hike in the sales tax looks increasingly likely in 2007. Plans for deregulation will also weigh upon economic activity in the near term. The government wants the central bank, with a loose policy, to carry some of the load. In particular, it does not want the bank to stop its huge monthly purchases of government bonds, equivalent to two-fifths of all debt issuance. A sudden end to those purchases would push bond yields up and, with them, the government's cost of servicing its debt. As it is, debt-service consumes 22% of the annual budget.
There are signs that the Bank of Japan, while asserting its intention to ""exit"" at some point, probably early next summer, is seeking to accommodate the government. Officials are at pains to say that it is possible to begin mopping up excess liquidity even as purchases of government bonds are kept up. Most important, they say that a return to a policy that targets interest rates does not preclude leaving them at zero for a long time--financial markets, for instance, do not now expect the first hike in rates until 2007 at the earliest. If inflation creeps back up, and interest rates do not change, monetary policy would actually get looser. That might be enough to mollify the politicians.","But already there are tensions over tighter money

""ONE vision, one identity, one community"" was the wishful official slogan of a diplomatic extravaganza in Malaysia this week, bringing together the leaders of nations with half of the world's population. The first East Asia Summit was an ambitious attempt to create a common purpose among 16 countries ranging from impoverished despotisms to advanced democracies. But with two of the most powerful governments, Japan and China, not even on talking terms, the prospects were always going to be dim.
The East Asia Summit is intended to become an annual event, held in tandem with leadership meetings of the ten-member Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and ASEAN+3, which also includes China, Japan and South Korea. But even its geographically inappropriate name reflects how little agreement there is about what this new group should be. The summit includes the ASEAN+3 countries, as well as three from outside the region: India, Australia and New Zealand. China had wanted something more strictly East Asian, while others, notably Japan, wanted the inclusion of countries that could dilute China's influence. The latter camp won, so the probability now is that China will quietly ignore the new forum, and concentrate its diplomatic energies on the more exclusive ASEAN+3 instead.
Besides, what was this unwieldy grouping supposed to achieve? Some speak of building a giant free-trade area, and even of promoting common values. But achieving consensus among such vastly different economies, cultures and political systems would be more arduous than anything encountered in regional community building elsewhere. 
The 16 countries said that they would talk about ""broad, strategic, political and economic issues of common interest"". But they agreed that ASEAN would be the ""driving force"" behind the new forum and that ASEAN+3 would continue to play a ""significant role"". With ASEAN (which as a block is on good terms with China) as the hub of Asian summitry, China will have less to fear from the parallel development of a wider grouping including more of America's friends. 
Chu Shulong of Tsinghua University in Beijing says that Chinese leaders now regard ASEAN+3 as the region's most important multilateral forum and downplay the new group's importance. The focus of China's efforts will remain establishing its own free-trade area with ASEAN. It is worth noting, though, that none of these configurations work particularly well: ASEAN's internal free-trade plans are lagging, and a plan to sign a deal with South Korea at the summit foundered over rice.
The wording of the summit's final declaration was an attempt to keep all sides happy by avoiding anything specific. It made no mention of establishing an East Asia community, or working towards a free-trade area. Nor did it specify the geographical boundaries of the grouping. Russia says it wants to take part in the next summit, to be held in the Philippines next December. But America is not angling for an invitation just yet. It is probably not yet sure whether it is worth being invited. 
Overshadowing the summit were sharp disagreements between Japan and South Korea and China over a visit in October by Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, to the Yasukuni Shrine, where Japan's war dead, including war criminals, are honoured. Normally, China, Japan and South Korea would hold a separate summit on the sidelines of the ASEAN talks. This time, because of China's ire, they held no meeting, though the prime ministers of China and Japan managed a chilly handshake at the end of the gathering.
In public, optimism abounded. The East Asia Summit ""takes us on light years from where we've been,"" said Helen Clark, New Zealand's prime minister. ""It's important for political and security dialogue. It's important for understandings across civilisations."" But with a lukewarm China, those hoping for a European Union in the east will be disappointed.","A grand summit is a damp squib

After starting his first internet company, aptly named Livin' On The Edge, a decade ago when he was still a student at Tokyo University, he dropped out of school to ride the internet wave, advising like-minded students to do the same.
Even in its early days, people took note of his company, tucked away in the back streets of Shibuya, Tokyo's hotspot for the young. Since then, Mr Horie has made a fortune: first by listing his company on Mothers, a stockmarket for start-ups run by the Tokyo Stock Exchange, and then by using the profits to buy livedoor, a defunct internet-service provider. Chiefly through financial engineering (his company, renamed livedoor in 2004, has split its stock 30,000-fold) and a succession of often surprising mergers and acquisitions, the market value of the empire Mr Horie built rose to about yen930 billion ($8 billion) at its peak. Livedoor controls around 50 companies, including an accounting-software house, an online travel agency, a securities company, a mail-order retailer and a second-hand car firm. In the year to last September livedoor's profits quadrupled, to yen15 billion.
Yet on January 16th it was Mr Horie who was taken by surprise. His company, now located in Roppongi Hills, a prestigious Tokyo landmark, was raided by prosecutors and investigators from the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission (SESC), on suspicion of securities-law violations. They also raided his home in a probe that lasted until dawn. 
The investigation is centred around livedoor Marketing, an advertising affiliate, which is suspected of having deceived the public in October 2004 by announcing that it would buy Money Life, a publisher, through a share swap--when it already controlled the firm through a private-investment arm. If the deception is proven, that would amount to market manipulation, a serious offence. Prosecutors also suspect livedoor Marketing of fiddling its accounts so as to boost its share price. Investigators are digging to see the extent of Mr Horie's involvement.
Such was the shock caused by the investigation that on January 17th livedoor shares lost yen100 billion in stockmarket capitalisation, while the benchmark Nikkei share index saw its largest one-day drop since last April (see page 73). The scandal sent politicians scrambling for cover. Mr Horie had stood for election last September as an independent, but one strongly backed by Junichiro Koizumi, the prime minister. Mr Horie was a vocal supporter of Mr Koizumi's plans to privatise the post office--the central issue of the whole campaign. He took on Shizuka Kamei, one of the staunchest opponents of Mr Koizumi within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, and lost.
While many locals, especially the smirking corporate old-guard, seem already to have judged Mr Horie and condemned him, he still has support. After all, financial jiggery-pokery is a pretty traditional activity in Japan. ""Everyone in the international community is watching this closely, because of concerns that this could represent selective enforcement against an aggressive young entrepreneur,"" says a foreign lawyer based in Tokyo.
Waking up Japan
If the prosecutors make their allegations stick, it would be a huge setback for a man who has helped shake Japan out of its stolidity. Mr Horie's first real brush with fame came in 2004 during a crisis in baseball. The rising popularity of soccer meant that baseball was losing fans and money. When one of Japan's two baseball leagues was threatened with collapse and the players went on strike, Mr Horie stepped in--offering to buy a cash-strapped team and promoting new ideas to revitalise the sport. His actions prompted other investors to get involved. Although Mr Horie did not ultimately buy a team, he won a reputation as the man who saved Japanese baseball.
Mr Horie also introduced to Japan the hostile takeover, with his brazen bid to take a controlling stake in Nippon Broadcasting System (NBS), a radio station--which, because of a complicated system of cross shareholdings, was regarded as a bid to gain control of Fuji Television, Japan's biggest commercial television station. Fuji fought a bitter and emotional battle over the airwaves and in court against the interloper; while livedoor fought cunningly by skirting the rules--buying shares during after-hours trading, enabling it to avoid disclosure. The Financial Services Agency somewhat belatedly plugged the loophole. The two-month conflict was finally resolved last April, through an amicable settlement in which livedoor sold its stake in Fuji (for a tidy profit), and Fuji made an investment in livedoor. Mr Horie's actions helped change the way Japanese companies do business and have prompted other high-profile hostile bids. Yet there has also been a backlash against the financial liberalisation that Mr Horie has taken advantage of. Under current law, foreign companies can only buy Japanese firms with cash, rather than using their own shares. This rule was due to be scrapped. But after the livedoor-Fuji battle, the government decided to postpone the change for another year. 
Mr Horie's emblematic status ensures that he has been at the heart of the unresolved struggle in Japan between those who look to markets to determine such things as who should own companies and those who think that Japan's stockmarket today is overrun by short-term adventurers and the companies that cater to them. The chances of a backlash, especially from the corporate old-guard, will depend on whether Mr Horie continues to live on the edge, or whether he has just walked over it.","Takafumi Horie , dotcom challenger of Japan 's corporate elite , may have taken a step too far

YOU would think the man had never heard of lame ducks. Fewer than nine months before Junichiro Koizumi is due to quit as leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and so as prime minister, his bandwagon keeps rolling. Last week, giving his policy speech at the annual opening of the Diet for the last time, he promised an agenda full of reform. The intention this session, he said, is to revamp welfare and pension schemes, to shrink the number of civil servants, to decentralise government to newly revamped localities, to start privatising public services and to privatise or consolidate eight government-linked financial institutions.
By June, moreover, the government will be able to lay out how it is to put its fiscal affairs in long-term order after years of big budget deficits. All wonderful stuff. And Mr Koizumi is able to make such claims because his popularity is still high and his political authority continues unchallenged by backroom dealings since he engineered a landslide general-election victory for the LDP last September. The election was fought over the issue of reform, notably the privatisation of the postal system. ""With momentum from postal privatisation,"" Mr Koizumi promised, ""I will continue reforms to create a simple and efficient government."" He is retiring only because he has run up against the LDP's own term limit for its leader.
For how many more months can his authority remain unchallenged? A faint whiff of vulnerability came this past week, with a scandal that has broken over a company called livedoor, a high-profile internet and finance business under investigation for murky dealings including alleged stockmarket manipulation and accounting irregularities. Mr Koizumi has no direct ties with either the company or its loud-mouthed young founder, Takafumi Horie, who has just been arrested ()see page 72. But in last September's election Mr Horie ran--and lost--as an independent in support of Mr Koizumi and his reform agenda. The prime minister's point man on structural reforms, Heizo Takenaka, went down to Hiroshima to campaign for Mr Horie--something that now looks like a lapse of judgment. Mr Horie is fast becoming the symbol of all that can go wrong with rapid reforms.
If the livedoor scandal can be contained, then Mr Koizumi's writ can be expected to extend at least until March, when the budget is meant to be passed, and probably well into the summer. At some point, of course, public attention will shift from Mr Koizumi to the contest within the LDP to succeed him. But even by then, Mr Koizumi expects, he will have set the agenda: he insists that potential candidates should be judged by their commitment to reforms that allocate economic resources more efficiently in Japan. 
Mr Koizumi's last months coincide with accelerating economic growth and a definitive end to seven years of grinding deflation--in November core prices rose by 0.1%, and a positive core inflation rate for December is also expected to be announced on January 27th. The prospect has recently drawn the central bank into the political line of fire, for the Bank of Japan is contemplating, by late spring or early summer, winding down its practice of flooding the banking system with excess liquidity, a policy known as ""quantitative easing"", introduced in 2001 in an attempt to break deflation. Sometime later, as the gap narrows between what the Japanese economy is capable of producing and what it is actually producing, the bank wants to end its policy of keeping interest rates, in effect, at zero. Yet some politicians, including Mr Takenaka, have threatened to curtail the bank's independence if it tightens monetary policy before politicians deem it safe to do so--perhaps by forcing an inflation-targeting regime on it. 
Though to some this looks like dangerous bullying of the Bank of Japan, the debate is actually a healthy one, says Robert Feldman, chief economist at Morgan Stanley in Tokyo. Japan's fiscal problems, the need to allocate resources better in the economy and the risks of deflation: all need to be considered together. It is possible to see the outlines of an agreement, where the bank accepts the need for some kind of inflation targeting, along with the understanding that it will not raise interest rates soon if the government continues to push reforms and tackle spending. Such an agreement, in other words, could help keep the Koizumi bandwagon rolling.","There 's still no alternative to the Junichiro Koizumi doctrine

SPEED is everything in the information-technology industry. Or so Takafumi Horie, the 33-year-old founder and ex-president of livedoor, an internet and finance company, was fond of saying. Unfortunately for him, Japan's prosecutors seemed to agree. After raiding the firm only a week ago, they arrested Mr Horie on January 23rd with unprecedented celerity. Also detained were Ryoji Miyauchi, livedoor's chief financial officer, and the presidents of livedoor Marketing, a listed affiliate, and livedoor Finance, a subsidiary. They face charges of market manipulation and accounting fraud. 
The alleged offences took place in late 2004, when livedoor Marketing skirted disclosure rules by announcing that it was buying Money Life, a publisher, through a share swap--when its parent company in fact already controlled the publisher through a private investment firm. It also allegedly cooked its books to show a profit instead of a loss, reportedly by transferring profits from a consumer-finance arm to boost livedoor Marketing's share price. The prosecutor's office won permission to hold the four executives at a detention centre for ten days for further questioning.
With half of its six board members behind bars, livedoor quickly rushed to reorganise itself. Mr Horie was ousted as president and a new president appointed. He is Kozo Hiramatsu, a 60-year-old former Sony executive who founded an accounting software firm that was bought by livedoor in December 2004, after the alleged financial finagling. On January 25th Mr Horie resigned from the board.
The new management faces a fearsome task. Livedoor, which is on the brink of being delisted by the Tokyo Stock Exchange, has seen roughly three-quarters of its stockmarket value wiped out since the raid. On January 24th its market capitalisation fell below its total asset value of yen200 billion ($1.7 billion), prompting fears of fresh turmoil as sell and buy orders rushed in. Livedoor's penchant for share splits means it now accounts for almost half of all trading units on the exchange. To counter further trouble, the exchange said on January 25th that it would limit trading in livedoor shares to 60 minutes, after previously cutting it to 90 minutes.
The reverberations from the scandal have sent politicians from the ruling Liberal Democratic party diving for cover. Junichiro Koizumi, the prime minister, was among others who strongly supported Mr Horie when he stood for election last September as an independent. Livedoor itself may now face a takeover bid. It owns more than 50 companies, some of which could be attractive investments.
If the allegations are proved, the repercussions are likely to gather force. Mr Horie had come to stand for a fresh approach in Japan's stuffy ways of doing business. Now some of the old guard are gloating over what they see as the dangers of adopting western, market-based practices. More worryingly, these practices are said by some to have created a polarisation in wealth, symbolised at one end by Mr Horie. Securities fraud and book-cooking are, in fact, thoroughly Japanese traditions. But there might still be a backlash.

PESSIMISTS about Japan's current economic recovery have had a disappointing few weeks. Convinced that faster economic growth, stronger corporate balance sheets and cleaned-up banks were just a mirage, their eyes brightened on January 16th when the country's most high profile young entrepreneur for years, Takafumi Horie, was raided by prosecutors and later arrested on suspicion of securities offences, bringing about turmoil on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and recriminations among politicians and in the media. Didn't the collapse and exposure of his internet-based conglomerate, livedoor [sic], show that pro-market reforms had gone too far? Alternatively, might the attack on Mr Horie have been politically motivated or prompted by corporate dinosaurs, showing that nothing has really changed in corrupt, murky Japan?
It has all been a great tale, played out in just the sort of blaze of publicity that the T-shirted Mr Horie used to good effect in 2004-05 when he was building his firm with masses of small acquisitions amid a series of failed big ones. Unfortunately, real life has not followed that rags-to-riches-to-rags script. The turmoil in Japanese shares was over within three days and the market has resumed its rise. The economy keeps on looking stronger, not weaker, with this week's figures showing healthy rises in output and consumer spending, and a jobs market where vacancies match applicants for the first time in 13 years and wages are rising at last. And a closer look at what Mr Horie is accused of shows him to be the opposite of what his detractors claim: not an innovative American-style capitalist but rather a traditional Japanese book-cooker, one whose methods show that Japanese rules have changed too little, not too much (see pages 69-71).
Old practices need new laws
Mr Horie's sole true innovation lay in his use of publicity. Out of the failure of his bids for a baseball team and then a television company he built notoriety, a big rise in visits to his internet portal, and a general sense that although his underlying business remained a mystery he might be on to something so his shares were worth a punt. If that underlying business was a chimera--it still isn't clear--then his crime was to blend the ancient capitalist art of confidence-trickery, seen in pyramid schemes and South Sea Bubbles since the beginning of time, with the sadly traditional Japanese art of obscure accounting and market manipulation. Virtually every Tokyo financial scandal of the past 20 years has featured those arts.
What he also exploited, though, was the failure of Japanese securities law and its enforcement to move with the times. His practices were pretty traditional, but he used them with a speed, aggression and visibility that were new. Many of the things he is known to have done were perfectly legal, such as using after-hours share trading to build up large stakes in target companies, or exploiting artificial liquidity shortages after stock splits. In a properly regulated financial market they would not be. Nor would his accounting have been allowed to be as obscure as it was, whether or not it is proven to have been illegal.
As a result, the right response by policymakers to the demise of livedoor should be to tighten regulation--but that means making new reforms, not rolling back past ones. In a broad sense, what has happened in Japan in the past 20 years is a shift away from a system in which bureaucrats and their corporate and political pals ruled the place informally, using their discretion to guide behaviour, to one in which laws are clearer and their interpretation and enforcement is more open. In the past five years, for example, much of the country's commercial code has been rewritten to make more explicit the responsibilities and powers of companies, boards and their shareholders, giving courts a bigger role in sorting out disputes and malpractice. But that effort, tedious and technical though it is, needs to go much further. New rules are needed to define the role and nature of an outside director, for example, to ensure equal treatment of all shareholders during a takeover bid or merger, to regulate the use of stock splits, and to make stricter demands about financial reporting by listed companies. Just as important, the means of enforcing existing and new rules needs to be strengthened: Japan's equivalent of America's Securities and Exchange Commission, the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission, needs a lot more staff and money. The same is true of the Fair Trade Commission, the country's trustbuster.
Japan needs new entrepreneurs--and has them
Some may think that this will contradict the efforts of Junichiro Koizumi, the prime minister, and his fellow reformers to reduce the role of the Japanese state. It shouldn't: Japan doesn't need a smaller state, at least not as measured by numbers of employees or public spending, for both compare well with other rich countries, but rather one that behaves differently. It should be setting clear rules and then enforcing them, not interfering at will with financial markets or the wider economy, as in the past.
Others may worry that new regulations, combined with the downfall of Mr Horie, will discourage young entrepreneurs and generally dampen corporate Japan's ""animal spirits"". Yet neither need be so. The country has plenty of eager young entrepreneurs or go-getting managers, many of them shed by failed banks and other firms in the 1990s and now keen to make their own way. Some can be seen working for private equity firms or for funds putting pressure on corporate boards, others in scores of services and technology firms. Big companies too have not just cut costs and repaid debts: they have got rid of the sprawling networks of subsidiaries that were built up in the 1980s, and many have turned themselves into more focused, profit-oriented entities. A new mood is abroad in corporate Japan, but it is a mood that craves clarity: clarity about what the rules governing corporate behaviour actually are, about whether those rules will be enforced, and whether the courts can be appealed to efficiently during disputes. That, above all, is the lesson of livedoor.","Japanese firms really are cleaner , more determined and more focused . But they need better regulation

The economy keeps on looking stronger , not weaker , with this week 's figures showing healthy rises in output and consumer spending , and a jobs market where vacancies match applicants for the first time in 13 years and wages are rising at last . And a closer look at what Mr Horie is accused of shows him to be the opposite of what his detractors claim : not an innovative American - style capitalist but rather a traditional Japanese book - cooker , one whose methods show that Japanese rules have changed too little , not too much ( see pages 69 - 71 ) . 
 Old practices need new laws 
 Mr Horie 's sole true innovation lay in his use of publicity . Out of the failure of his bids for a baseball team and then a television company he built notoriety , a big rise in visits to his internet portal , and a general sense that although his underlying business remained a mystery he might be on to something so his shares were worth a punt . If that underlying business was a chimera -- it still is n't clear -- then his crime was to blend the ancient capitalist art of confidence - trickery , seen in pyramid schemes and South Sea Bubbles since the beginning of time , with the sadly traditional Japanese art of obscure accounting and market manipulation . Virtually every Tokyo financial scandal of the past 20 years has featured those arts . 
 What he also exploited , though , was the failure of Japanese securities law and its enforcement to move with the times . His practices were pretty traditional , but he used them with a speed , aggression and visibility that were new . Many of the things he is known to have done were perfectly legal , such as using after - hours share trading to build up large stakes in target companies , or exploiting artificial liquidity shortages after stock splits . In a properly regulated financial market they would not be . Nor would his accounting have been allowed to be as obscure as it was , whether or not it is proven to have been illegal . 
 As a result , the right response by policymakers to the demise of livedoor should be to tighten regulation -- but that means making new reforms , not rolling back past ones . In a broad sense , what has happened in Japan in the past 20 years is a shift away from a system in which bureaucrats and their corporate and political pals ruled the place informally , using their discretion to guide behaviour , to one in which laws are clearer and their interpretation and enforcement is more open . In the past five years , for example , much of the country 's commercial code has been rewritten to make more explicit the responsibilities and powers of companies , boards and their shareholders , giving courts a bigger role in sorting out disputes and malpractice . But that effort , tedious and technical though it is , needs to go much further . New rules are needed to define the role and nature of an outside director , for example , to ensure equal treatment of all shareholders during a takeover bid or merger , to regulate the use of stock splits , and to make stricter demands about financial reporting by listed companies . Just as important , the means of enforcing existing and new rules needs to be strengthened : Japan 's equivalent of America 's Securities and Exchange Commission , the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission , needs a lot more staff and money . The same is true of the Fair Trade Commission , the country 's trustbuster . 
 Japan needs new entrepreneurs -- and has them 
 Some may think that this will contradict the efforts of Junichiro Koizumi , and Junichiro Koizumi's fellow reformers to reduce the role of the Japanese state . It should n't : Japan does n't need a smaller state , at least not as measured by numbers of employees or public spending , for both compare well with other rich countries , but rather one that behaves differently . It should be setting clear rules and then enforcing them , not interfering at will with financial markets or the wider economy , as in the past . 
 Others may worry that new regulations , combined with the downfall of Mr Horie , will discourage young entrepreneurs and generally dampen corporate Japan 's "" animal spirits "" . Yet neither need be so . The country has plenty of eager young entrepreneurs or go - getting managers , many of them shed by failed banks and other firms in the 1990s and now keen to make their own way . Some can be seen working for private equity firms or for funds putting pressure on corporate boards , others in scores of services and technology firms . Big companies too have not just cut costs and repaid debts : they have got rid of the sprawling networks of subsidiaries that were built up in the 1980s , and many have turned themselves into more focused , profit - oriented entities . A new mood is abroad in corporate Japan , but it is a mood that craves clarity : clarity about what the rules governing corporate behaviour actually are , about whether those rules will be enforced , and whether the courts can be appealed to efficiently during disputes . That , above all , is the lesson of livedoor .",740,Japan,A29-8209,IN TERM,True,"Junichiro Koizumi , the prime minister",2,True

WHO is a fan of Horiemon now? A hero of the internet age, who challenged fusty ways of doing business, Takafumi Horie now sits in a Tokyo jail. A couple of weeks after prosecutors raided the headquarters in Roppongi Hills of the upstart empire that Mr Horie assembled in a fit of acquisitions, livedoor lies in ruins, its stockmarket capitalisation now below the group's net asset value.
Nemesis takes just a year: last February, livedoor launched a shocking hostile bid, Japan's first ever, for an august broadcasting group, Fujisankei Communications, fought off only when a white knight was found. This week, by contrast, Fuji said that it might rescue livedoor by taking it over. When Mr Horie was riding high, the media--Fuji TV's reporters honourably excepted--delighted in building him up still further, conferring on him his nickname derived from a cartoon character with boundless optimism. The media are now having an equally high time of it pushing him back down. What has not changed is that Horiemon is still by far the biggest story in town.
Mr Horie was arrested on January 23rd, and has been held incommunicado since, while a new management team has taken over livedoor. Other former executives have also been arrested. Hideaki Noguchi, a friend and former livedoor executive, has been found dead in a hotel, an apparent suicide. No charges have yet been laid in the livedoor case, and it is still far from clear exactly what Mr Horie and other executives, notably Ryoji Miyauchi, the chief financial officer, are alleged to have done. 
Certainly, without a hint of independent inquiry, the Japanese press recycles each day what it has been spoon-fed, off the record, by the Tokyo district prosecutor's office. Such leaks, seeking to build a case in public before charges are even filed, are a part of the problem, says Atsushi Nagano, a lawyer at Nishimura & Partners in Tokyo. They are, he says, why the public is still confused about what the livedoor scandal is all about.
Livedoor is said to have manipulated the market in 2004, when a subsidiary announced that it was pursuing a publishing company it already controlled. It is also said to have manipulated its accounts, moving money around the group when it saw fit, including into Swiss bank accounts under fictitious company names. Opaque investment partnerships--not unlike those used by Enron in America--were supposedly used to acquire stakes. Meanwhile, share splits artificially inflated the price of livedoor shares, which were invariably used as the currency for acquisitions.
The firm may well have been shot through with financial crookery. The trouble is that some of what the prosecutors allege through the press is vague, and much of the rest not necessarily illegal in Japan, even if it clearly is elsewhere. For instance, there are no accounting rules for Enron-style investment partnerships. At the least, questions ought to have been raised much earlier about livedoor's activities. After all, much of the freewheeling in which Mr Horie engaged--share splits, the building up of stakes in acquisition targets during off-market trading and the like--was there for all to see, yet regulators at the time applied little scrutiny and took little action.
That is why the prosecutors' actions now--more than $6 billion in stockmarket value has been destroyed before a single indictment has been made--come across as extremely harsh, with motivations that are still unclear. Some politicians and analysts wonder whether the prosecutors were put up to it by opposition politicians who were appalled by Mr Horie's decision to stand (unsuccessfully as it turned out) on a reformist ticket supporting the prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, in last September's elections for the Diet (parliament). Whether or not there was direct encouragement, it is certainly true that many politicians are quietly happy with livedoor's fall from grace.
Though they have 30 days in which to file charges against Mr Horie, prosecutors in Japan rarely make arrests unless they are sure of their case--the verdict, it is said, comes first, and the trial later. So it may yet turn out that investigators have evidence of something more concrete and heinous. Rarely do they move like this in cases of pure securities fraud. It is conceivable that some of the companies livedoor acquired were in the pocket of yakuza crime syndicates, for instance, which used them for money-laundering. Conceivable, too, that livedoor was channelling funds to politicians, in which case the story will grow. Both possibilities are raised by informed observers, and both have historical precedents. In the meantime, the abruptness with which the authorities kicked down livedoor--Christopher Wells of White & Case, a law firm, calls them an ""Old Testament god""(ie, vengeful)--adds to concerns about shortcomings both in the way business is conducted in Japan, and in the way it is supervised by the authorities.
He did it his way
The livedoor saga has brought these questions to the fore partly by unleashing an emotional debate about where the country is heading. This debate matters, because Japan's economy is now returning to something like normal, after 15 years of post-bubble slump. Companies have sloughed off their debts, and are making record profits (see chart 1). Some of the improvement in the corporate sector came about by cutting staff or wages which, while necessary, precluded the kind of recovery among households that ensures economic momentum. Since last year, however, wages have been rising, while jobs are also on the increase. This week it was announced that for the first time in 13 years Japan has a job again for everyone who wants one; in December alone, 30,000 jobs were added to the economy, while household spending was up by 3.2%, compared with a year earlier.
That is all good news. But Japan has a demographic predicament: a rapidly declining workforce in relation to a population which itself is set to shrink. This can be addressed, in the long run, only by a permanently higher level of productivity growth. And here lies the significance of the livedoor debate. If what happened at livedoor is somehow symptomatic of a broader misallocation of economic and financial resources--for example, due to regulatory incentives that skew company behaviour--then Japan will lack the economic strength to address its demographic predicament. Still worse would be if the wrong lessons were drawn from livedoor, skewing incentives even further.
At the moment, it is Japan's old corporate establishment that is most likely to draw the wrong conclusions. To the members of the corporate old guard whom Mr Horie so delighted in taunting, the case is clear-cut. Among the members of the Keidanren, Japan's big-business association, are plenty of die-hards for whom livedoor represents the excesses of what in Japan is called ""market fundamentalism"", for which read the liberalisation of markets and raw-blooded capitalism imported, as opponents see it, under American pressure. Their criticism has a political dimension, too, for this is the style championed in Mr Koizumi's rhetoric. At least until the livedoor scandal, it was the approach he wanted his potential successor to adopt after he steps down in September.
Certainly, livedoor and its fast-moving acquisitive style--an internet portal, it came to own, among many things, a second-hand car dealer and an online share brokerage--could not have come about without the recent liberalisation of Japan's markets. For instance, the ""big bang"" financial reforms of 1998--actually a rolling programme of deregulation--rendered acquisitions among Japanese firms easier. In the early 1990s nearly half of all listed equities were held by companies in a cosy web of cross-shareholdings. Reforms required such holdings to be valued in company accounts at their market price, encouraging their disposal. Today, cross-shareholdings account for less than a quarter of the market. The changes also encouraged share splits, which, by increasing stockmarket liquidity, make shares relatively easier to buy. And changes to tax rules have since made it easier for domestic companies to pay for acquisitions with shares rather than with cash. (Foreign companies, meeting local political resistance, are still waiting for new rules that will allow them the same treatment.)
In with the new
Such changes have spawned new breeds of companies, of which the prelapsarian livedoor was neither the first nor the most impressive, even if it was perhaps the most conspicuous. Rakuten and Softbank, which owns a 41.8% controlling stake inYahoo! Japan, are examples of internet and information-technology ventures for which acquisitions have been important. With hindsight, all now have business models that are markedly more coherent than livedoor's improvisatory approach, which appeared to consist mainly of inflating its share price ever higher. Other outfits, such as the high-profile M&A Consulting Fund, have put their money to work challenging company managers, turning around stricken businesses or helping to merge or dispose of assets. These firms are all part of a trend encouraging a transformation of corporate Japan. The outcome is greater management focus and attention to shareholder returns. For the past four or so years, mergers and acquisitions in Japan have been growing fast. Last year, according to Thomson Financial, deals more than doubled in value, to $170 billion, easily outpacing the rest of the world. Restructuring has contributed to companies' record profitability, and underpinned a stockmarket that rose by 40% in 2005.
While the old guard plays down the benefits of such ""market fundamentalism"", it loudly bewails the risks: the implication is that somehow the old system enshrined higher ethical norms. Really? Old corporate Japan is rife with scandal. Only last year, Seibu, a railway firm and longtime paragon of the elite, was charged with accounting fraud, and its shares were delisted from the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE). The difference, says Peter Tasker, a consultant in Tokyo, is that where ""Old Japan"" used to be concerned about covering up losses, ""New Japan"" rogues appear set on fabricating gains.
The TSE has now moved quickly to quarantine livedoor, which is listed on the exchange's start-up board called the Mothers Market; trading is limited to just an hour a day, presaging that it may soon be delisted entirely, as Seibu was. But, like the livedoor arrests, this seems to have come too late. The livedoor story underscores the woeful state of corporate governance and market supervision in Japan, and shows that the system is incapable of regulating behaviour at an earlier stage. The establishment has thought for too long that it is enough for Japan to be hidebound, while paying insufficient attention to ensuring that it was rulebound. Livedoor tested the defences, and found them to be weak.
Governance in Japan is marked by a lack of clear disclosure rules. The absence of accounting rules for investment partnerships is one example. When it comes to takeover bids, no clear rules are in place about how and in what ways parties may act in concert to acquire stakes in target companies. Thus, Mr Horie was able to gather a 35% stake in Fuji's radio subsidiary in after-hours trading--and even got a court to bless the action--though an investor is meant to declare once his stake reaches 5%. There is no threshold, as there is in Europe and some of the rest of Asia, above which an acquirer of shares must make a full bid for a target. Nor need a bidder offer the same price to all shareholders. In the case of Fuji, Mr Horie saw the gaps in all these areas, and drove a coach right through them.
A fresh commission
These gaps can be plugged, and some no doubt now will be. There is also the keen expectation among those pushing for change that regulatory bodies will now be beefed up, in particular, the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission (SESC), an arm of the Financial Services Agency, the cabinet-level body responsible for financial regulation. The SESC is pitifully staffed, with fewer than 320, compared with 3,800 at America's equivalent, the Securities and Exchange Commission. With Mr Koizumi's commitment to cut the government bureaucracy by 5%, it has been hard for politicians to argue that more staff should be sent to the SESC to identify and stop securities shenanigans. Now, the economy minister, Kaoru Yosano, says that more staff should be a top priority. Though calls to split off the SESC and give it independent clout are likely to face strong opposition from politicians, a debate needs to start on what powers a reformed SESC should have, and how it should be financed. For instance, in America civil fines levied for financial misdemeanours are ploughed back into enforcement. The Japanese system caters neither for civil fines nor for class-action suits.
More changes will be needed. Regulators must also be ready to act sooner on signs of unsavoury activity. A case in point is livedoor's frequent use of stock splits (it split its shares 30,000-fold). In theory, splitting shares should not lead to a change in a company's valuation. In Japan, however, a paperbound system means that investors must send off for new certificates, and in the several weeks that this takes they have no means to trade. It is not hard, therefore, to take advantage of a temporary artificial shortage of shares after a stock split to ramp up a company's shares, increase the company's stockmarket valuation, and use that to acquire more assets, or borrow more money, or whatever.
Nishimura's Mr Nagano, who as a former senior official at the finance ministry was a key participant in the big-bang reforms, says this was an unintended consequence of them. When the flaw became apparent, he says, the authorities should have stepped straight up and admitted it; for instance, they should have banned any announcements of mergers or acquisitions during the period of artificial scarcity following a stock split. That they did not, Mr Nagano thinks, was perhaps because of Mr Horie's popularity at the time.
Livedoor lessons point not just to a need for thorough overhaul of surveillance and corporate governance. The hardware at the heart of Japan's market capitalism, at the TSE, has also been tried and found to be sorely lacking. On news of the livedoor raid by prosecutors last month, investors, many of them housewives who had taken up day trading during the bull market, dumped shares in a panic. Orders swamped the exchange, forcing it to close early for the first time in its history. The exchange, says a bank head in Tokyo, is a ""sclerotic, bureaucratised institution without a strategy, unable to think ahead."" Though the TSE is rushing to upgrade capacity, doubts will remain about its readiness in the face of the more vibrant markets that an economic recovery might be expected to bring.
Whether the livedoor mess leads to swifter improvements in disclosure, surveillance and corporate governance, or whether the opposite conclusion is drawn--that liberalisation should be rolled back--hangs to an extent on the political contest among those keen to take over from Mr Koizumi as prime minister and leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).
For the first time since the LDP's landslide win last September, the opposition Democratic Party of Japan has found its voice, attacking Mr Koizumi and his reformist allies for allowing unbridled corporate greed. But the strongest criticism comes from within his own party. In particular, the reputation of the chief architect of the prime minister's reforms, Heizo Takenaka, a former economics professor who has many detractors, is badly dented within the LDP, says Takao Toshikawa, editor of Insideline, a political newsletter. Mr Takenaka vigorously championed Mr Horie's bid for parliament, going down to Hiroshima to campaign for him. Until recently, he had been increasingly mentioned as a contender for the premiership, but if he had such hopes, they have now been dashed. What is more, Mr Takenaka now becomes a liability for the presumed front-runner, Shinzo Abe, the chief cabinet secretary, who had been counting on him to provide the domestic-policy expertise that Mr Abe obviously lacks.
There are other areas where reform, broadly defined, is on the defensive in Japan. One has to do with a growing construction scandal, where architects were discovered to have faked earthquake-resistance data for condominiums after the inspection system was deregulated in the late 1990s. Conceivably, this, together with the political effects of the livedoor scandal, could move Japanese policymaking back towards the cosy, more consensual form of politicking from which Mr Koizumi did so much to separate himself.
On the other hand, whatever wrongs Mr Horie is found to have committed at livedoor, some radical changes in public perceptions that he helped bring about are unlikely to revert. The biggest is the concept, recent to Japan, that companies belong to shareholders, not managers. That is not to say a spate of hostile takeovers is imminent. Still, shareholders will increasingly ask managers to listen to them. Even a children's television programme, ""Weekly Children News"", describes, in the simplest terms, such things as investments and the benefits of mergers. Given the present harrumphing about livedoor from the old guard, perhaps the programme airs in the wrong slot.

It is not hard , therefore , to take advantage of a temporary artificial shortage of shares after a stock split to ramp up a company 's shares , increase the company 's stockmarket valuation , and use that to acquire more assets , or borrow more money , or whatever . 
 Nishimura 's Mr Nagano , who as a former senior official at the finance ministry was a key participant in the big - bang reforms , says this was an unintended consequence of them . When the flaw became apparent , he says , the authorities should have stepped straight up and admitted it ; for instance , they should have banned any announcements of mergers or acquisitions during the period of artificial scarcity following a stock split . That they did not , Mr Nagano thinks , was perhaps because of Mr Horie 's popularity at the time . 
 Livedoor lessons point not just to a need for thorough overhaul of surveillance and corporate governance . The hardware at the heart of Japan 's market capitalism , at the TSE , has also been tried and found to be sorely lacking . On news of the livedoor raid by prosecutors last month , investors , many of them housewives who had taken up day trading during the bull market , dumped shares in a panic . Orders swamped the exchange , forcing it to close early for the first time in its history . The exchange , says a bank head in Tokyo , is a "" sclerotic , bureaucratised institution without a strategy , unable to think ahead . "" Though the TSE is rushing to upgrade capacity , doubts will remain about its readiness in the face of the more vibrant markets that an economic recovery might be expected to bring . 
 Whether the livedoor mess leads to swifter improvements in disclosure , surveillance and corporate governance , or whether the opposite conclusion is drawn -- that liberalisation should be rolled back -- hangs to an extent on the political contest among those keen to take over from Junichiro Koizumi as prime minister and leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) . 
 For the first time since the LDP 's landslide win last September , the opposition Democratic Party of Japan has found its voice , attacking Junichiro Koizumi and Junichiro Koizumi's reformist allies for allowing unbridled corporate greed . But the strongest criticism comes from within Junichiro Koizumi's own party . In particular , the reputation of the chief architect of Junichiro Koizumi's reforms , Heizo Takenaka , a former economics professor who has many detractors , is badly dented within the LDP , says Takao Toshikawa , editor of Insideline , a political newsletter . Mr Takenaka vigorously championed Mr Horie 's bid for parliament , going down to Hiroshima to campaign for him . Until recently , he had been increasingly mentioned as a contender for the premiership , but if he had such hopes , they have now been dashed . What is more , Mr Takenaka now becomes a liability for the presumed front - runner , Shinzo Abe , the chief cabinet secretary , who had been counting on him to provide the domestic - policy expertise that Mr Abe obviously lacks . 
 There are other areas where reform , broadly defined , is on the defensive in Japan . One has to do with a growing construction scandal , where architects were discovered to have faked earthquake - resistance data for condominiums after the inspection system was deregulated in the late 1990s . Conceivably , this , together with the political effects of the livedoor scandal , could move Japanese policymaking back towards the cosy , more consensual form of politicking from which Junichiro Koizumi did so much to separate Junichiro Koizumi . 
 On the other hand , whatever wrongs Mr Horie is found to have committed at livedoor , some radical changes in public perceptions that he helped bring about are unlikely to revert . The biggest is the concept , recent to Japan , that companies belong to shareholders , not managers . That is not to say a spate of hostile takeovers is imminent . Still , shareholders will increasingly ask managers to listen to them . Even a children 's television programme , "" Weekly Children News "" , describes , in the simplest terms , such things as investments and the benefits of mergers . Given the present harrumphing about livedoor from the old guard , perhaps the programme airs in the wrong slot .

THE five visits to Tokyo's Yasukuni shrine that Junichiro Koizumi has made since he became prime minister in 2001 have thrown relations with Japan's two biggest neighbours, China and South Korea, into the political chiller. Yasukuni, run by Shinto priests, honours 2.4m Japanese servicemen killed in imperialist wars in the 100 or so years after Japan's mid-19th century opening-up. But because 14 executed war criminals, among them General Hideki Tojo, are also enshrined there, Yasukuni has become the site for an exculpatory interpretation of the second world war that plays down or even denies the atrocities that flowed from Japan's militarism, and plays up the notion of Japan as victim not aggressor. Yet roughly 20m Asians died in the 1930s and 1940s, thanks to the Japanese, and many were enslaved, tortured, raped or subjected to medical experiments, including vivisection.
Mr Koizumi has dropped plenty of hints that he does not share this exculpatory version of history. Last August 15th, on the 60th anniversary of Japan's surrender, he offered an unequivocal apology, saying that Japan greatly regretted the suffering that it had caused during the second world war. But his visits to Yasukuni are still viewed with suspicion in those countries that suffered most brutally under Japanese occupation--and Mr Koizumi seems unconcerned about riling them. Last year, both China and South Korea called off summits with Mr Koizumi. Earlier this month, the Chinese Communist Party's official People's Daily compared him to someone who insists on eating ""rat excrement"". This month, too, a Chinese state councillor and former foreign minister, Tang Jiaxuan, told a politician from Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) that there was ""no longer any expectation"" of better relations between the two countries while Mr Koizumi was in power.
Mr Koizumi is due to step down in September, to Chinese and Korean delight. Yet the Yasukuni issue is not likely to fade with his going. For a start, the Japan-as-victim school is no right-wing group on the fringes of Japanese politics: though small, it is a core component of the LDP. Thus, every apology for wartime misdeeds that a Japanese leader offers is swiftly undermined by others in the ruling party. What is more, the two chief contenders to take over from Mr Koizumi as prime minister and head of the LDP, Shinzo Abe and Taro Aso, are both Yasukuni visitors.
Mr Abe has been circumspect in his public comments since becoming chief cabinet secretary last autumn; but in the past he has usually visited Yasukuni on August 15th, the anniversary of Japan's surrender. The more outspoken Mr Aso, the new foreign minister, is, as far as the diplomats under him are concerned, a mounting liability. From time to time, Mr Aso extols the perceived benefits of past Japanese colonialism, notably in Korea and Taiwan. And late last month he said that since Japanese soldiers of the second world war had died in the service of the emperor, the emperor, too, should visit the Yasukuni shrine.
As it happens, after the enshrinement of the war criminals in 1978, Emperor Hirohito stopped visiting Yasukuni, a stay-away continued by his son, Akihito. Indeed, as Jeffrey Kingston of America's Temple University in Tokyo points out, Akihito has taken other actions to distance the monarchy from nationalists keen to refashion Japan's identity around the throne. Last year, for instance, he visited the site of the battle of Saipan, paying respects not just to Japan's dead, but to Americans, islanders and Koreans forced to fight on the Japanese side.
The imperial family, constitutionally bound now to keep out of politics, can influence the debate only indirectly. On the other hand, opposition to a rising mood of nationalism is coming from an unlikely source from within the conservative establishment itself: the Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's--indeed the world's--biggest-circulation newspaper. Under Tsuneo Watanabe, the group's 79-year-old chairman and an eminence grise within the political establishment, the Yomiuri came to be the flag-waver for a more assertive Japan, one that argued for a revision of the pacifist constitution foisted on Japan by General Douglas MacArthur in 1947, and that bristled at any foreign criticism of the Yasukuni shrine.
Recently, however, Mr Watanabe has ordered the Yomiuri Shimbun to change its tune. Yasukuni, he now says, is the source of all Japan's problems with its neighbours; the Yomiuri and its more liberal rival, the Asahi Shimbun, have joined forces to push for a state alternative to the shrine, where the war dead can be honoured with less controversy. The LDP, however, has turned this idea down.
In particular, Mr Watanabe reserves his bile for Mr Koizumi--partly, perhaps, out of personal pique that the prime minister does not hang on his every word, as predecessors did. Equating Tojo with Hitler, Mr Watanabe told the New York Times last week that ""Mr Koizumi worships at a shrine that glorifies militarism. This person Koizumi doesn't know history or philosophy, doesn't study, doesn't have any culture. That's why he says stupid things, like, 'what's wrong about worshipping at Yasukuni?' Or, 'China and Korea are the only countries that criticise Yasukuni.' This stems from his ignorance."" The Yomiuri is now running a series of articles examining Japan's wartime record, and promises to come up with a ""verdict"" by August. It is unlikely, though, to lay the past to rest.","Can Japan ever acknowledge its atrocities of the 1930s and 1940s in a fashion acceptable to its neighbours ?

ON MARCH 9th the Bank of Japan (BoJ) declared that the days of its ultra-loose monetary policy were over and that it was winding down its unorthodox practice, begun five years ago, of flooding the banking system with free money. This drastic measure, known as ""quantitative easing"" was designed to pull Japan out of deflation after the cutting of interest rates to nil had failed to do the trick.
In keeping with modern, open central-banking fashion, the BoJ has also supplied a much-needed peek at the map it will use to steer itself back to a more ""normal"" monetary policy: one that is conducted by varying interest rates, not the quantity of money. Even so, because Japan is about to embark on an unusual journey, the way ahead is bound to contain surprises. 
Evidence of economic recovery has been mounting. GDP grew by 2.8% in 2005 and by 4.2%, year-on-year, in the fourth quarter. Companies' order books are increasingly healthy. Surveys of consumer and business confidence are strong and getting stronger. And after seven long years deflation seems to be gone.
In its bid to beat deflation, the BoJ made a promise: it would keep its ultra-loose policy until inflation was sustainably positive. For some months, the bank has been noting signs of inflation's return. Now prices--at least, measured by the core consumer-price index (CPI)--are rising again. The annual rise in the core CPI (which includes energy but not fresh food) was nil in October and edged up to 0.1% in November and December. January's figure, published on March 3rd, showed a jump to 0.5% (see chart), higher than most people expected. That set everyone thinking that the BoJ would soon move.
Lately, the BoJ's governor, Toshihiko Fukui, had seemed eager to start turning off the tap. He had faced angry opposition from powerful ministers, who claimed that deflation was not yet dead. They had half a point. If energy were excluded (as it is in most countries), January's core CPI number would have been a mere 0.1%. What is more, measured by the GDP deflator, prices were still falling late last year. Still, the evidence of recovery had done much to soften ministers' warnings. But earlier this week Junichiro Koizumi, the prime minister, himself reminded Mr Fukui how disastrous it would be if the bank ended quantitative easing only to have to reinstate it. Nevertheless, by moving now rather than next month, when most people expected it, the BoJ has shown that it will act as it sees fit.
The bank's first, delicate job is managing a smooth end to quantitative easing. In effect, this policy has consisted of stuffing the reserve accounts that commercial banks must keep at the BoJ with free cash. These accounts contain yen30 trillion-35 trillion ($260 billion-300 billion), far more than would be required simply to keep overnight interest rates at zero (about yen6 trillion). The idea was to get banks with shrinking loan books to lend more and so boost the economy. 
There is a danger of mopping up that liquidity too fast, especially if prices ease again (as they might, once last year's rise in energy prices works its way out of the figures). But there is also a danger of mopping too slowly, and letting speculation take hold in markets for financial assets and property. The effect of the BoJ's largesse is already plain in the stockmarket, where day traders buying on margin were a big force behind the market's 40% surge last year. The policy has been felt in all sorts of foreign markets too (see next story).
The BoJ also has the government-bond market to worry about. The bank buys bonds in huge amounts: yen1.2 trillion a month, or two-fifths of all issuance. If it stopped suddenly, yields would shoot up, causing market chaos and a headache for a government whose debt-service consumes 22% of its annual budget. So the BoJ said it would keep buying ""for some time"".
The BoJ says it will take a few months to wind down quantitative easing. Even after that, it could be a while before interest rates are raised above zero--their mark since 1999, except for one disastrous increase in 2000. Futures markets expect a quarter-point increase later this year, although some economists think that soft CPI numbers after this spring will cause the bank to wait until 2007.
But how could the bank signal and then manage a smooth transition? It was committed to quantitative easing until core inflation reached zero; but zero is patently too low a target to be much use in setting interest rates. And given the bank's history, there was always the fear that it may raise rates too soon. The BoJ therefore desperately needed a new framework if it was not to replace relative clarity with opaqueness and risk instability in financial markets. It has therefore given unusually detailed guidance about how it will manage expectations on the way to ending its zero interest-rate policy, and even beyond.
First, it promises that there will be no abrupt change in short-term interest rates. Second, the BoJ has laid out a new framework for monetary policy, which spells out more clearly what the bank means by price stability and how it will pursue it.
Those who fear that the central bank is by nature dangerously hawkish will not be reassured by its conceptual definition of price stability as ""a state where the change in the price index is zero"". This seems to reflect Mr Fukui's belief that the Japanese have long expected lower inflation than elsewhere. Yet many economists think that mild inflation (say, 2%) is better than zero at allowing relative prices to adjust smoothly. And there is a greater risk at zero inflation of a deflationary demand shock.
On the other hand, the bank's policy board has defined a range within which price stability in the longer term might be said to apply and this, 0-2%, is wider than most had expected. It also refers to ""headline"" CPI, which includes the prices of fresh food. The board also made it clear that the BoJ would take into account events with a low probability but high economic costs--demand shocks, presumably. And it said it would review the inflation range annually.
The BoJ has thus made its thinking clear. What is not clear yet, however, is whether the creation of the new framework will put an end to a debate under way in policymaking circles about what the bank's mandate should be. This debate has pitted the government's desire for growth (and tax revenues) against the BoJ's desire for price stability. Until now politicians have not been keen that the BoJ decide its own mandate unilaterally. Financial markets will be far happier with the new state of affairs than with the shouting match of the past few months.","Japan 's monetary policy starts to look almost normal 
 ON MARCH 9th the Bank of Japan ( BoJ ) declared that the days of its ultra - loose monetary policy were over and that it was winding down its unorthodox practice , begun five years ago , of flooding the banking system with free money . This drastic measure , known as "" quantitative easing "" was designed to pull Japan out of deflation after the cutting of interest rates to nil had failed to do the trick . 
 In keeping with modern , open central - banking fashion , the BoJ has also supplied a much - needed peek at the map it will use to steer itself back to a more "" normal "" monetary policy : one that is conducted by varying interest rates , not the quantity of money . Even so , because Japan is about to embark on an unusual journey , the way ahead is bound to contain surprises . 
 Evidence of economic recovery has been mounting . GDP grew by 2.8 % in 2005 and by 4.2 % , year - on - year , in the fourth quarter . Companies ' order books are increasingly healthy . Surveys of consumer and business confidence are strong and getting stronger . And after seven long years deflation seems to be gone . 
 In its bid to beat deflation , the BoJ made a promise : it would keep its ultra - loose policy until inflation was sustainably positive . For some months , the bank has been noting signs of inflation 's return . Now prices -- at least , measured by the core consumer - price index ( CPI)--are rising again . The annual rise in the core CPI ( which includes energy but not fresh food ) was nil in October and edged up to 0.1 % in November and December . January 's figure , published on March 3rd , showed a jump to 0.5 % ( see chart ) , higher than most people expected . That set everyone thinking that the BoJ would soon move . 
 Lately , the BoJ 's governor , Toshihiko Fukui , had seemed eager to start turning off the tap . He had faced angry opposition from powerful ministers , who claimed that deflation was not yet dead . They had half a point . If energy were excluded ( as it is in most countries ) , January 's core CPI number would have been a mere 0.1 % . What is more , measured by the GDP deflator , prices were still falling late last year . Still , the evidence of recovery had done much to soften ministers ' warnings . But earlier this week Junichiro Koizumi Koizumi reminded Mr Fukui how disastrous it would be if the bank ended quantitative easing only to have to reinstate it . Nevertheless , by moving now rather than next month , when most people expected it , the BoJ has shown that it will act as it sees fit . 
 The bank 's first , delicate job is managing a smooth end to quantitative easing . In effect , this policy has consisted of stuffing the reserve accounts that commercial banks must keep at the BoJ with free cash . These accounts contain yen30 trillion-35 trillion ( $ 260 billion-300 billion ) , far more than would be required simply to keep overnight interest rates at zero ( about yen6 trillion ) . The idea was to get banks with shrinking loan books to lend more and so boost the economy . 
 There is a danger of mopping up that liquidity too fast , especially if prices ease again ( as they might , once last year 's rise in energy prices works its way out of the figures ) . But there is also a danger of mopping too slowly , and letting speculation take hold in markets for financial assets and property . The effect of the BoJ 's largesse is already plain in the stockmarket , where day traders buying on margin were a big force behind the market 's 40 % surge last year . The policy has been felt in all sorts of foreign markets too ( see next story ) . 
 The BoJ also has the government - bond market to worry about . The bank buys bonds in huge amounts : yen1.2 trillion a month , or two - fifths of all issuance . If it stopped suddenly , yields would shoot up , causing market chaos and a headache for a government whose debt - service consumes 22 % of its annual budget . So the BoJ said it would keep buying "" for some time "" . 
 The BoJ says it will take a few months to wind down quantitative easing . Even after that , it could be a while before interest rates are raised above zero -- their mark since 1999 , except for one disastrous increase in 2000 . Futures markets expect a quarter - point increase later this year , although some economists think that soft CPI numbers after this spring will cause the bank to wait until 2007 . 
 But how could the bank signal and then manage a smooth transition ? It was committed to quantitative easing until core inflation reached zero ; but zero is patently too low a target to be much use in setting interest rates . And given the bank 's history , there was always the fear that it may raise rates too soon . The BoJ therefore desperately needed a new framework if it was not to replace relative clarity with opaqueness and risk instability in financial markets . It has therefore given unusually detailed guidance about how it will manage expectations on the way to ending its zero interest - rate policy , and even beyond . 
 First , it promises that there will be no abrupt change in short - term interest rates . Second , the BoJ has laid out a new framework for monetary policy , which spells out more clearly what the bank means by price stability and how it will pursue it . 
 Those who fear that the central bank is by nature dangerously hawkish will not be reassured by its conceptual definition of price stability as "" a state where the change in the price index is zero "" . This seems to reflect Mr Fukui 's belief that the Japanese have long expected lower inflation than elsewhere . Yet many economists think that mild inflation ( say , 2 % ) is better than zero at allowing relative prices to adjust smoothly . And there is a greater risk at zero inflation of a deflationary demand shock . 
 On the other hand , the bank 's policy board has defined a range within which price stability in the longer term might be said to apply and this , 0 - 2 % , is wider than most had expected . It also refers to "" headline "" CPI , which includes the prices of fresh food . The board also made it clear that the BoJ would take into account events with a low probability but high economic costs -- demand shocks , presumably . And it said it would review the inflation range annually . 
 The BoJ has thus made its thinking clear . What is not clear yet , however , is whether the creation of the new framework will put an end to a debate under way in policymaking circles about what the bank 's mandate should be . This debate has pitted the government 's desire for growth ( and tax revenues ) against the BoJ 's desire for price stability . Until now politicians have not been keen that the BoJ decide its own mandate unilaterally . Financial markets will be far happier with the new state of affairs than with the shouting match of the past few months .",740,Japan,A29-8209,IN TERM,True,"Junichiro Koizumi , the prime minister , himself",2,True

CHINA'S leaders bridle at the suggestion that the country's growth will be anything other than benign, or that its rise will challenge the world's status quo. But history could prove them wrong. The rapid rise of great powers has a habit of causing bloody confrontation. And when such a power harbours resentment at its past humiliation by others, covets long-lost territories and secretly and rapidly upgrades its military potential, it would seem reasonable for observers to worry. 
To Chinese officials, the Olympic Games in 2008 will symbolise the country's re-emergence on the world stage after more than 150 years of humiliation and isolation by western powers. Many Chinese saw the narrow failure of their bid to host the games in 2000 as the result of malicious western attempts to keep their country in check. When its second attempt succeeded by a comfortable margin, it was seen as a belated recognition by the West that China should be treated as a respectable country. This would be its chance to show itself off as a proud, strong nation. 
Party leaders hope that national pride will help the country to remain stable and united amid turbulent social and economic change. By playing to the public's patriotic sentiments, the party also hopes to strengthen its claim to legitimacy. This has been an important motive behind China' s recent push to become a space power, with the launch of two manned orbital craft in 2003 and 2005. It is possible that later this year China will launch an unmanned spacecraft to orbit the moon, a step towards an eventual moon landing by a Chinese astronaut. 
This strategy of encouraging national pride also carries some risks for the party, particularly if the public feels that the government is not being nationalist enough. It means that whatever action China's leaders take on sensitive issues such as Japan, Taiwan and America will have ""very broad implications for domestic politics"", as Christopher Hughes of the London School of Economics argues in a book just published. The dangers this strategy could pose for international security are even more apparent. 
Ironically, the past few years of China's rapid economic rise and integration with the outside world have also brought a rising number of angry public protests over nationalist issues. In the two biggest and most unruly incidents--demonstrations against America and Britain in 1999 following the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, and anti-Japanese protests in April last year--the government at first appeared to be condoning if not encouraging the outbursts. Those who argued that giving China the Olympics would help tame such nationalism have been proved wrong. 
Nationalist tit for tat
Untamed, that Chinese nationalism risks starting a vicious cycle as nationalists elsewhere respond. The Japanese grumble about Chinese criticism of their wartime record which they regard as politically motivated. Unwilling to be seen as capitulating to China, Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, continues his controversial visits to the Yasukuni Shrine where Japan's wartime history is celebrated. In Taiwan, a new sense of identity is emerging that emphasises the island's cultural and historical distinctness from China. The more China attacks this trend, the more Taiwanese nationalists shout back. 
The growth of nationalist sentiment in China has coincided with a double-digit increase in China's military spending every year since the mid-1990s. An uneasy Japan has been strengthening its security ties with America. It has also been manoeuvring--with some success--to keep China from turning the Association for South-East Asian Nations into the nucleus of a China-dominated grouping of East Asian countries. In north-east Asia, the two countries have territorial disputes that inflame nationalist passions on both sides. 
Fortunately both China and Japan realise that they cannot afford to let these quarrels escalate. Economic interdependence between the two countries has grown by leaps and bounds in recent years. China (with Hong Kong) has helped to lift Japan out of stagnation, becoming its biggest trading partner in 2004. Last year, by Japan's reckoning, the total volume of trade between the two countries was nearly $190 billion. Japan accounted for 11% of foreign direct investment in China in the first nine months of last year, making it the biggest investor after Hong Kong. In October last year, Mr Koizumi appointed an official widely seen as ""pro-China"", Toshihiro Nikai, as his trade minister. 
But China has been refusing to talk to Mr Koizumi since his last visit to the Yasukuni shrine in October. And even when China is talking, the frosty state of relations makes it difficult for the two countries to establish mechanisms for dealing with sudden crises in their relationship. For several hours during last year's anti-Japanese demonstrations in Beijing, nervous Japanese diplomats were unable to reach China's foreign ministry by phone. 
If a Japanese vessel were to collide with a Chinese one in a disputed area of the East China Sea, causing Chinese casualties, it is easy to imagine an outbreak of violent protests in China that could rapidly escalate. Such risks could grow as Chinese navy vessels become more active in the area. A Chinese submarine was spotted near Okinawa in 2004, and last year China briefly deployed warships near its controversial gas-drilling rigs in the East China Sea. Some Japanese diplomats fret that China's Communist Party may not have full control over the military. 
So far, however, both China and Japan, while verbally pandering to nationalists in their respective countries, have tried to avoid going beyond diplomatic skirmishing. Having let last April's protests run for a few days, the Chinese authorities decided to rein them in, apparently concerned about the risk of a serious breakdown in relations with Japan. In recent weeks China's criticism of Japan has become more muted. Perhaps the Chinese are waiting to see what happens when Mr Koizumi steps down in September. 
One problem for China is that its most active nationalists are drawn from the very middle class upon whose support the party depends. Peter Gries of the University of Colorado says that many of those who took part in last year's protests were ""savvy urban yuppies"" rather than the losers from economic reform. Mr Gries describes them as ""computer-literate cyber-nationalists"", well educated and exposed to world politics. The rapid spread of internet technology in China in recent years has provided new forums for nationalists to air their views. Although China's internet censors closely monitor debate on internal political issues, they give diatribes against Japan a much freer rein. 
China may feel that it can afford to give the public leeway to rail against Japan because military conflict with that country is highly unlikely. The two other big preoccupations of Chinese nationalists--Taiwan and its military backer, America--are in a different category, and the government has tried much harder to prevent public sentiment from getting out of hand. 
Let's be pragmatic
Indeed, in the past few months China's handling of Taiwan has shifted direction to become remarkably pragmatic. China has moved swiftly to stem a torrent of protest from Taiwan and the West against a new law adopted in March 2005 that authorised the use of force against the island should it ever try to secede from China. President Hu hosted unprecedented visits by Taiwan's opposition leaders which did much to reassure the Taiwanese public. James Soong, leader of the opposition People First Party, says that during his stay Chinese leaders officially accepted, ""for the first time in history"", that Taiwan and the mainland were ""equal entities"". 
Kenneth Lieberthal, a former National Security Council adviser, says President Hu has apparently decided that unification with Taiwan is simply not feasible during his term of office. Although China continues to concentrate its military modernisation efforts on improving its ability to fight Taiwan and American forces that might try to protect the island, Taiwan has become much less of a sore point between China and America than it was. 
Events in Taiwan in the next couple of years could make China and America more jittery again. In December next year Taiwan is due to hold elections for its legislature and in March 2008 for the presidency. Both China and America are clearly worried that President Chen will use his remaining two years in office to push for confirmation of Taiwan's independent identity. With his popularity at an all-time low, partly because of corruption cases within his party, Mr Chen may well feel inclined to use Taiwanese nationalism to shore up his popularity at home. In the past, Mr Chen has successfully exploited this sentiment to undermine his opponents, who favour closer ties, though not reunification, with the mainland. 
Mr Chen has already unsettled the Chinese and Americans this year by scrapping the National Unification Council, a body that existed in name only to help Taiwan maintain the fiction that it has not abandoned the idea of rejoining China. He has also revived talk of organising a referendum, in 2007, on a new constitution for the island. China objects strenuously to this as a display of sovereign power that Taiwan in fact lacks. America has tartly reminded Mr Chen of his promises not to upset the status quo. Taiwan officials say it is China that should be blamed for having passed the anti-secession law.
The pragmatism of China's leaders could also face new challenges in Hong Kong, which in March next year will hold elections for the post of chief executive and in 2008 for the legislature. China has ruled out universal suffrage for either, and is resisting demands for a timetable to be set for introducing it. 
But China has reason to feel relatively confident. In Taiwan, President Chen would need three-quarters of the members of parliament to approve any constitutional change. Given the opposition's domination of the parliament, that would make it extremely difficult for him to get enough votes for anything that would seriously anger China. And China is happy with indications that Ma Ying-jeou, the charismatic mayor of Taipei and chairman of the opposition Kuomintang party, is the likely front-runner to succeed President Chen. Mr Ma, though not keen on reunification as long as China remains a one-party dictatorship, is no advocate of independence. In Hong Kong, meanwhile, pro-democracy activists have shown no interest in street fights with the authorities.
The relationship that will dominate all others is that between China and America. In the run-up to America's presidential elections in 2008, China's rise is likely to become ever more contentious. America's trade deficit with China, which at $200 billion in 2005 was its biggest with any country, will probably remain very large, particularly in the likely event of China resisting American demands for a substantial revaluation of its currency. Workers in America's industrial mid-west already blame China for the loss of manufacturing jobs. And news that China last year became a net exporter of motor vehicles for the first time might cause further unease. 
David Lampton, an American scholar, has argued that the past few years have seen a ""marked paradigm shift"" in American thinking about China that ""threatens to substitute one flawed framework (a ""weak China"") with another (a ""China on steroids""). This was evident in America's horror at last year's bid by China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), a state-owned company, for Unocal, a California-based oil and gas explorer. It would have been the biggest takeover of a foreign company by a Chinese firm, but CNOOC was forced to withdraw by wildly exaggerated fears in America of a Chinese stranglehold on vital resources. 
Americans have been watching with disquiet as China has cosied up to pariah governments in Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Sudan and Iran to feed its growing hunger for resources. In Iran in particular, China's efforts to keep its economy fuelled could put it in conflict with what America regards as a vital strategic interest: keeping the Arab world free of nuclear weapons. Over the past 13 years, China has moved from being a net exporter of oil to become the world's second-biggest importer, relying on foreign sources for 40% of its demand. So Iran, which supplies 11% of China's oil imports, might need special consideration. 
But China's foot-dragging on Iran could be seen as evidence of the same kind of pragmatism that has dominated the country's relationship with America for most of the period since the end of the cold war. China has advocated persisting with diplomatic efforts. Yet in January, when Russia signalled its willingness to allow Iran's nuclear programme to be referred to the United Nations Security Council, China did not attempt to block the move. China is loth to interfere in other countries' affairs because it fears that others might use such a move to justify interfering in China's. It would therefore be remarkable if the country were to vote in favour of sanctions. But it would be no less remarkable if it were to veto sanctions on its own. 
China's military build-up in the next few years will alarm the Americans, particularly as it becomes clear that its forces would be able to overwhelm Taiwan and inflict enormous losses on the Americans if they chose to intervene. But there are very good reasons why China would be highly unlikely to attack Taiwan, even if it had the capability to do so. Such an attack would devastate China's relationship with the West as well as with other Asian countries, and could cripple the economic growth that the party regards as so vital. The trouble is that planners in the Pentagon cannot afford to bet on it.

NOT long ago the authority of Junichiro Koizumi, Japan's prime minister, looked unassailable. He had risked all on a general election last September to gain backing for his programme of deregulation and a smaller state, and seen his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) romp home with a two-thirds majority. Not only had Mr Koizumi trounced the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), he had also destroyed much of the conservative opposition within his own party.
But Mr Koizumi's ability to exploit his triumph has been dwindling rapidly this year. Part of the prime minister's entertainment value lay in his jousting with conservative opponents; now that most of them are no more, his popularity has fallen. More serious, perhaps, is that a number of recent scandals have become associated with Koizumi-style deregulation. First was an uproar over an architect who faked earthquake-resistance data for new condominium buildings--something he would not have been able to do before inspection standards were changed in the late 1990s.

Shortly after this scandal broke, the government lifted a ban on American beef imports, imposed two years ago during a scare over mad-cow disease. Alas, one of the first new shipments of American beef turned out to include banned bits of bone, for which lax inspection has been blamed.

Mr Horie ran for parliament last September in support of Mr Koizumi, who has now been linked by his enemies with Mr Horie's style of buccaneer capitalism.
With tumbling approval ratings for Mr Koizumi and his cabinet, the cumulative effect of these scandals has been to erode the prime minister's political authority well before he is due to step down in September. The clearest instance of this was defeat for an initiative he had been promising since taking power in 2001: an overhaul of Japan's road-building.

And yet, a committee put in charge of road reforms by Mr Koizumi recently ruled that nearly all expressways under construction should be finished.

 NOT long ago the authority of Junichiro Koizumi's , looked unassailable . Junichiro Koizumi had risked all on a general election last September to gain backing for Junichiro Koizumi's programme of deregulation and a smaller state , and seen Junichiro Koizumi's ruling Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) romp home with a two - thirds majority . Not only had Junichiro Koizumi trounced the opposition Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) , Junichiro Koizumi had also destroyed much of the conservative opposition within Junichiro Koizumi's own party . 
 But Junichiro Koizumi's ability to exploit Junichiro Koizumi's triumph has been dwindling rapidly this year . Part of Junichiro Koizumi's entertainment value lay in Junichiro Koizumi's jousting with conservative opponents ; now that most of them are no more , Junichiro Koizumi's popularity has fallen . More serious , perhaps , is that a number of recent scandals have become associated with Koizumi - style deregulation . First was an uproar over an architect who faked earthquake - resistance data for new condominium buildings -- something he would not have been able to do before inspection standards were changed in the late 1990s . This has left a lot of new homeowners wondering about the soundness of their properties . Shortly after this scandal broke , the government lifted a ban on American beef imports , imposed two years ago during a scare over mad - cow disease .

ON APRIL 7th Japan's main opposition, the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), will get its fifth leader in as many years. Its fourth, Seiji Maehara, was elected only six months ago as a youngish, competent face after a miserable general election for the party in which the supposedly reformist DPJ opposed the reformist plans of the prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, for privatising the postal-savings system. Mr Maehara announced his resignation last week, taking responsibility for a disastrous blunder in February when a colleague waved in parliament an e-mail that he thought was proof of money links between a disgraced internet company, livedoor, and a son of the secretary-general of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The e-mail that Hisayusu Nagata flourished turned out to be fake. Along with Mr Maehara, the DPJ's own secretary-general will also step down, and the blundering Mr Nagata is to quit politics.
Even without this farce, the party had struggled recently to convince the country that it is a viable opposition. According to a poll for the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper, 69% of voters think the DPJ incapable of governing the country. Meanwhile, the absence of an effective opposition, political observers say, has costs for the country as a whole. Mr Koizumi claims to be pushing through many modernisations to government and the economy, but in the absence of an opposition to prod it along the push has slowed. Recently, for instance, Mr Koizumi has failed to stop taxpayers' money going towards building unneeded roads.
In foreign policy, a more cogent opposition would have been better at drawing attention to the neglect into which Mr Koizumi has allowed Japan's relations with its neighbours to fall. Mr Maehara was chosen to lead the DPJ in good part because of foreign-policy expertise, but he rarely seemed to score points. The televised afternoon in parliament in which Mr Maehara hoped greatly to embarrass the prime minister over the alleged livedoor e-mail turned into a humiliation as the old dog took the young puppy and shook him by the scruff of his neck.
That memory is now seared into the DPJ's collective consciousness, which is why it is looking for its next leader not among one of the younger generation of MPs clutching sheaves of position papers, but rather among the party's few grizzled heavyweights. The two chief contenders are Naoto Kan, 59, and Ichiro Ozawa, 63. Mr Kan, a patent lawyer, rose to prominence as a civic activist. Famously, as health minister in a coalition government in 1996, he exposed bureaucrats' cover-up of a scandal involving the spread of HIV-tainted blood. He has already briefly served as opposition leader, in 2002-04, but had to resign during a (relatively minor) scandal over pensions payments.
But as The Economist went to press, it was Mr Ozawa who appeared likelier to win the leadership. This will alarm those party members who pinned their hopes on an open, modernising DPJ. Mr Ozawa is a born backroom dealer who gathered power during a stellar career at the heart of the LDP. In 1993, when his growing number of enemies looked set to pounce, he defected, bringing about the LDP's only (if brief) fall from power in four decades. Mr Ozawa is outspoken in his hopes for a more assertive Japan, which appals the DPJ's many hard-core pacifists. Yet he is probably the only party man with the heft in public to take on the LDP heavyweights, of which, at heart, he remains one.
No matter who wins, DPJ politicians argue, the lesson of the recent calamities is that better party organisation and discipline are urgently needed. Motohisa Furukawa, responsible for the party's welfare policies, says that the e-mail crisis dragged on for far too long because ""we have no war room, no crisis-management groups, no expertise in dealing with these kinds of challenges."" His colleague, Hirofumi Ryu, calls this a life-threatening moment for the party. ""The next general election will be the last chance for us,"" he says. Which is why members may have to swallow Mr Ozawa's appointment.

AN ASCENDING economy, industrialising fast, that challenges the established power; hungry competition over energy resources; disputes over territory or spheres of influence; and nationalisms inflamed on one side by grievance and on the other by the opponent's presumption. It is becoming fashionable in policymaking circles to compare the situation of China and Japan today to that of Germany and Britain a century ago. Kent Calder of Johns Hopkins University, writing recently in Foreign Affairs, quoted Thucydides: fluid perceptions of power and fear are the classic causes of war.
The security perceptions in East Asia are fluid indeed, and so are the realities. China's attempts to modernise its armed forces have brought big increases in defence spending every year for several years, and the shopping-list is still growing: fighter aircraft, frigates, nuclear submarines and now aircraft-carriers. Some of the build-up has to do with China's desire to bring Taiwan back into the fold. But China also has ambitions for a blue-water navy, and seems to be probing at its biggest neighbour's defences as well. In November 2004 the Japanese found a Chinese submarine in their waters near the island of Okinawa. The Chinese claimed this was a mistake, and later apologised, but a dispute between China and Japan flared up last year over some oil-and-gas fields in the East China Sea, and Chinese spy planes have provocatively flown into the disputed airspace since then. 
The lack of openness that accompanies China's military modernisation may reflect the backwardness more than the potency of the army: a Japanese general says that, were he in command of such decrepit equipment, he would not boast about it either. Still, the opaqueness merely adds to the neighbours' concerns about China's long-term intentions.
Profound changes are also under way in the armed forces of Japan and its ally, the United States. After the second world war, America imposed a pacifist constitution on the defeated Japanese. In return, it agreed to guarantee their defence, though they had to pay part of the bill. That is the way it still is. America has some 50,000 troops in Japan, a handful of air bases (including its biggest marine base abroad) and a port for the Seventh Fleet. Now, after nearly ten years of talks and much wrangling, the United States and Japan have at last reached an agreement on how to refresh this long-standing alliance.
It was clear that some changes were due. When the arrangements were put in place, the chief security risk in the region was thought to be an invasion of Japan by the Soviet Union. In 1996, with both risk and country gone, Bill Clinton and Ryutaro Hashimoto, then America's president and Japan's prime minister respectively, said it was time for a review. Nothing has become easier since then. China has continued to rise. The possibility of a war over Taiwan, whose security America also guarantees, remains. Recalcitrant North Korea has developed both nuclear weapons and new missiles to carry them. And, since September 11th 2001, everyone is on the lookout for terrorism.
The new agreement completes the most sweeping reorganisation of American forces in the Pacific since the Vietnam war. By 2014 some 8,000 marines and their families will leave crowded Okinawa, home to half of all American servicemen in Japan, for the Pacific island of Guam, an American dependency. From Guam, the marines are supposed to be able to respond with lightning speed to an array of regional emergencies. Whatever benefits the Americans have brought to Okinawa--in terms of cash, employment and security--they have also earned some hostility, especially when one of their number has raped or murdered a local girl. The marines' Futenma air base, the most unpopular of all the bases in Okinawa, will now be closed, and the land returned to farmers who have grown rich off the Americans' rent and will now grow richer still by selling their acres for development: the base is jammed next to the town of Ginowan. A new floating heliport, controversial but less so than Futenma, is to be built for the marines over a coral reef off Okinawa's less populated eastern coast.
In addition, an American naval air wing now based at Atsugi, just outside Tokyo, will move to Iwakuni, 725 kilometres (450 miles) to the south-west, near Hiroshima; a dozen refuelling aircraft from Futenma will also go to Iwakuni. Other servicemen are also expected to move to Guam, or even Hawaii.
Japan's politicians will be pleased to have reduced a long-standing irritant. For their part, the Americans believe they will be able to react faster to a wider range of possible emergencies--a crisis involving North Korea, say, or Taiwan, or an act of terrorism that might perhaps threaten the crucial shipping lanes of South-East Asia, or indeed anything at all that might happen in the ""arc of instability"" that Pentagon planners see stretching from North Korea to the Middle East.
And that is not all. While America keeps Japan as its main base in Asia, Japan will play a much greater part in its own defence. Politicians in Washington, DC, complain that Japan gets American protection on the cheap, spending just 0.9% of GDP on defence, or $45 billion a year, barely a tenth of America's military budget. The total cost of the new ""realignment"" has not been made public, but Japan has agreed to pay three-fifths of the $10 billion that moving the marines alone will cost. In the long run, says America's chief negotiator, Richard Lawless, Japan will have to fork out at least $26 billion. And the Japanese will have to carry out, and pay for, some of the work that the United States has been doing on their behalf in the past.
Prometheus loosens his bonds
In fact, America's military transformation in Asia could mean an equally profound transformation of the Japanese armed forces. The change is already under way. During the cold war, Japan's own ""ground self-defence forces"" (pacifist Japan's term for its army) laid stress on tank and infantry divisions, with the aim of repelling a Soviet invasion. Since then, Japan's ground forces have shrunk in importance, whereas its navy has grown into a force of considerable reach and sophistication. Japan has recently launched its own spy satellites. A sweeping reorganisation of the self-defence forces last month put the navy, army and air force under a single command for the first time since the second world war.
Japan and America increasingly emphasise the sharing of technology. They are also trying to improve their joint command structure--an essential part of the two countries' new agreement--and they have recently started to test anti-missile systems. Japan's enthusiasm for missile defence leapt in 1998, when North Korea test-fired a Taepodong rocket that crossed the main island of Honshu. North Korea, though, is not the only worry. Japanese defence planners admit in private that missile defence is also being developed with China in mind. After all, the 800 missiles that China has ranged against Taiwan could also reach Japan--and, as a senior American official admits, the defence of Taiwan could not be accomplished without using bases in Japan. To accusations from China of meddling in ""internal"" Chinese affairs, Japan now says it considers Taiwan to be a security concern shared in common with America. 
Expectations are now growing both inside Japan and beyond for the world's second-biggest economy to perform a more muscular role in international security operations. Yet Japan's military modernisation is rubbing up against the limits of the constitution. These have already been stretched, notably by Junichiro Koizumi, prime minister since 2001. After the attacks on the Twin Towers, Mr Koizumi threw Japan's loyalties firmly behind George Bush's ""war on terror"". In late 2001 he won parliamentary backing to send two naval refuelling tankers to the Indian Ocean to help the United States and its NATO allies topple the Taliban in Afghanistan. Though a new law had to be written, and the ships were limited to giving logistical support, this was, by post-war Japan's standards, an unprecedented projection of its military capabilities. 
Later, Mr Koizumi pushed for Japanese peacekeeping troops to be sent to southern Iraq. The 600 troops there are still embarrassingly constrained in their actions--they are, in effect, protected by Australian peacekeepers nearby--but their presence nevertheless marks another bold move by Mr Koizumi. They show that Japan's leaders now see that the national interest may sometimes lie far from home--and that the constitutional taboo on sending Japanese troops abroad can in fact be broken.
The prime minister has proved an acute judge of a changing national mood. What is sometimes called the ""normalisation"" of Japan is increasingly popular. In a poll for the Yomiuri Shimbun last month, for instance, over half of those asked said they favoured changing the constitution in order to allow Japan to play a greater international part. Other polls suggest that most people support Japanese troops' active involvement in peacekeeping. 
A hint of extroversion
The new mood is reflected in the shifts taking place in politics. The landslide of Mr Koizumi's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in last September's general election buried what remained of the pacifist left in Japanese politics. A majority of LDP members of parliament favour changes to the constitution. An amendment drafted by the party last autumn proposes to remove the ambiguities surrounding the role of the armed forces and to underline Japan's right to take part in international operations outside the country's borders. The main opposition group, the Democratic Party of Japan, is also increasingly robust about foreign policy. Its new leader, Ichiro Ozawa, elected last month, has long argued for a more assertive Japan. So constitutional debate, including the possibility of rewriting the pacifist Article 9, is now on the political agenda, even if it is likely to be years before any constitutional change is agreed on.
Whereas Americans, in particular, think that Japan is taking only baby steps towards assuming a greater international role, and are impatient for more, two of its closest neighbours view the prospects of a more activist Japan with rising alarm. Policymakers in China and South Korea claim to detect in Japan's push for ""normalisation"" the dangerous rearming of an historical foe and colonial overlord.
Much of this is overblown. Even the hawkish LDP's latest constitutional draft reasserts Japan's renunciation of war as a sovereign right. And the notion that Japan still harbours territorial designs on either the Korean peninsula or the Chinese mainland (or even Taiwan) is potty. Unfortunately, Japan does itself no favours when it comes to reassuring the neighbours.
Picking at the scabs of history
The problem is that the normalisation of Japan's defence is not being matched by what could be called the normalisation of its nationalism, and the prime minister shares a part of the blame. In his five years in office, Mr Koizumi has five times visited Tokyo's Yasukuni shrine, where the 2.5m servicemen who have fallen in wars since 1868 are honoured, but where the names of 14 Class A war criminals from the second world war are also memorialised. Mr Koizumi claims to visit the shrine as an individual, not an office-holder, and does so, he says, in order to honour the innocent dead. He usually accompanies his visits with a condemnation of Japan's past belligerency. Still, the visits feed into deeply held feelings in China and South Korea that, despite dozens of official apologies, Japan has yet to atone fully and sincerely for its wartime past. The point is also emphasised by school textbooks that gloss over Japan's wartime atrocities, and by continued Japanese reluctance to compensate the victims of Japanese militarism.
Yet the shriller China and South Korea become--venomous anti-Japanese riots broke out in China last year--the more inclined are ordinary Japanese to thumb their nose at the complaints. In that sense, Mr Koizumi merely exemplifies an attitude that seems to find honour in Japan's isolation. And this provides cover for the Japan-as-historical-victim school that exists not just on the far right of Japan's politics, but also as a central if small part of the LDP.
Even so, Japan pays a price for being on bad terms with its neighbours. No summit meetings have been held with China since 2001. If Mr Koizumi meets Chinese leaders at all, he meets them briefly on the fringes of multilateral gatherings. President Roh Moo-hyun of South Korea has also suspended meetings with Mr Koizumi. Diplomats say that Japan's bilateral relations with China and South Korea have been damaged at every level, and former channels of communication closed. A consequence is that Japan is unable to take any regional initiative (over the environment, for instance, or energy use) at the very time it is seeking international ""normalisation"". 
The scratching of historical scabs has also inflamed the many island and seabed disputes in the seas dividing Japan from China and South Korea. China has long challenged Japan's control of the Senkaku islands, a rocky outcrop known as the Diaoyutai in Chinese. More recently, China and Japan have squabbled about some oil and gas deposits below the East China Sea. China has now annoyed Japan by starting to extract some of the gas.
A simmering dispute between South Korea and Japan over two islets, the Dokdo, which Korea controls but which Japan claims and calls Takeshima, has suddenly boiled over. Japan's coastguard said last month that it was sending two unarmed vessels to map the seabed around the blasted rocks, a couple of months before an international hydrographic conference at which South Korea was expected to offer Korean names for some submerged features. Furious, South Korea dispatched armed patrol boats to the area. Diplomats scrabbled to avert a confrontation, and achieved a deal whereby Japan would withdraw its surveyors if South Korea withdrew its list of names. 
The matter is unlikely to stay shelved. President Roh went on television a few days after the deal in belligerent mood to say that ""Japan's present claim to Dokdo is an act of negating the complete liberation and independence of Korea...no compromise or surrender is possible, whatever the costs and sacrifices may be."" Mr Koizumi's offer of a summit was rebuffed.
The incident is a reminder of how suddenly Japan's relations with its neighbours can get out of hand. Plainly, repairs are needed, and plenty of suggestions have been forthcoming. They include joint history projects that might attempt to reach a consensus of sorts about the past; more regional forums; and a national debate in Japan about how to honour the dead and guard a sense of national identity without inflaming neighbours. Some of the more sensible ideas come from Japan's soldiers. One suggests building trust with China by setting up joint search-and-rescue missions and procedures for accidental collisions in an ever-busier sea. 
Infantile paralysis
China will certainly need to play its part. The leadership of China's Communist Party has for so long used anti-Japanese sentiment to bolster its own legitimacy that once-warm feelings in Japan towards the Chinese have cooled, particularly since the anti-Japanese demonstrations last spring, when 24m Chinese, it was claimed, signed an internet petition opposing Japan's bid for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. Such stridency constrains any Japanese leader judged at home to be appeasing China. 
Japanese politicians can be blamed for doing too little to assuage fears by making their case, which is a reasonable one, clearly and unthreateningly. Yet Hu Jintao, the Chinese president, has also made a poor fist of relations with Japan. Though he has written off all hope of improving ties with Mr Koizumi, he is under pressure at home to make a fresh start with Japan after the prime minister goes in September. One Beijing academic likens the two countries in the East China Sea disputes to ""children climbing on the table to fight over a glass of milk"".
Japan's role in the region suddenly seems to be a factor in the LDP race to succeed Mr Koizumi (see page 71). Candidates are under pressure to show the neighbours a measure of good faith, starting by staying away from Yasukuni. Both Japan and China appeared this week to be groping towards better relations. They said their talks over the East China Sea gas fields would restart next week, and their foreign ministers will meet again before long, too.
At some point, mutual suspicions over Taiwan will also have to be dealt with, and on this some Japanese see hope. They argue that Mr Hu's recent rather subtle approach towards the island--courting the opposition Kuomintang, isolating President Chen Shui-bian and his crumbling independence movement, and counting on greater economic integration between Taiwan and the mainland to achieve more than bluster and military threats--could do much to reassure Japan about China's intentions. So there is a chance that Japan and its neighbours could start to put their problems behind them. But that's what it is--a chance, no more than that for now.

In 1996 , with both risk and country gone , Bill Clinton and Ryutaro Hashimoto , then America 's president and Japan 's prime minister respectively , said it was time for a review . Nothing has become easier since then . China has continued to rise . The possibility of a war over Taiwan , whose security America also guarantees , remains . Recalcitrant North Korea has developed both nuclear weapons and new missiles to carry them . And , since September 11th 2001 , everyone is on the lookout for terrorism . 
 The new agreement completes the most sweeping reorganisation of American forces in the Pacific since the Vietnam war . By 2014 some 8,000 marines and their families will leave crowded Okinawa , home to half of all American servicemen in Japan , for the Pacific island of Guam , an American dependency . From Guam , the marines are supposed to be able to respond with lightning speed to an array of regional emergencies . Whatever benefits the Americans have brought to Okinawa -- in terms of cash , employment and security -- they have also earned some hostility , especially when one of their number has raped or murdered a local girl . The marines ' Futenma air base , the most unpopular of all the bases in Okinawa , will now be closed , and the land returned to farmers who have grown rich off the Americans ' rent and will now grow richer still by selling their acres for development : the base is jammed next to the town of Ginowan . A new floating heliport , controversial but less so than Futenma , is to be built for the marines over a coral reef off Okinawa 's less populated eastern coast . 
 In addition , an American naval air wing now based at Atsugi , just outside Tokyo , will move to Iwakuni , 725 kilometres ( 450 miles ) to the south - west , near Hiroshima ; a dozen refuelling aircraft from Futenma will also go to Iwakuni . Other servicemen are also expected to move to Guam , or even Hawaii . 
 Japan 's politicians will be pleased to have reduced a long - standing irritant . For their part , the Americans believe they will be able to react faster to a wider range of possible emergencies -- a crisis involving North Korea , say , or Taiwan , or an act of terrorism that might perhaps threaten the crucial shipping lanes of South - East Asia , or indeed anything at all that might happen in the "" arc of instability "" that Pentagon planners see stretching from North Korea to the Middle East . 
 And that is not all . While America keeps Japan as its main base in Asia , Japan will play a much greater part in its own defence . Politicians in Washington , DC , complain that Japan gets American protection on the cheap , spending just 0.9 % of GDP on defence , or $ 45 billion a year , barely a tenth of America 's military budget . The total cost of the new "" realignment "" has not been made public , but Japan has agreed to pay three - fifths of the $ 10 billion that moving the marines alone will cost . In the long run , says America 's chief negotiator , Richard Lawless , Japan will have to fork out at least $ 26 billion . And the Japanese will have to carry out , and pay for , some of the work that the United States has been doing on their behalf in the past . 
 Prometheus loosens his bonds 
 In fact , America 's military transformation in Asia could mean an equally profound transformation of the Japanese armed forces . The change is already under way . During the cold war , Japan 's own "" ground self - defence forces "" ( pacifist Japan 's term for its army ) laid stress on tank and infantry divisions , with the aim of repelling a Soviet invasion . Since then , Japan 's ground forces have shrunk in importance , whereas its navy has grown into a force of considerable reach and sophistication . Japan has recently launched its own spy satellites . A sweeping reorganisation of the self - defence forces last month put the navy , army and air force under a single command for the first time since the second world war . 
 Japan and America increasingly emphasise the sharing of technology . They are also trying to improve their joint command structure -- an essential part of the two countries ' new agreement -- and they have recently started to test anti - missile systems . Japan 's enthusiasm for missile defence leapt in 1998 , when North Korea test - fired a Taepodong rocket that crossed the main island of Honshu . North Korea , though , is not the only worry . Japanese defence planners admit in private that missile defence is also being developed with China in mind . After all , the 800 missiles that China has ranged against Taiwan could also reach Japan -- and , as a senior American official admits , the defence of Taiwan could not be accomplished without using bases in Japan . To accusations from China of meddling in "" internal "" Chinese affairs , Japan now says it considers Taiwan to be a security concern shared in common with America . 
 Expectations are now growing both inside Japan and beyond for the world 's second - biggest economy to perform a more muscular role in international security operations . Yet Japan 's military modernisation is rubbing up against the limits of the constitution . These have already been stretched , notably by Junichiro Koizumi . After the attacks on the Twin Towers , Junichiro Koizumi threw Japan 's loyalties firmly behind George Bush 's "" war on terror "" . In late 2001 Junichiro Koizumi won parliamentary backing to send two naval refuelling tankers to the Indian Ocean to help the United States and its NATO allies topple the Taliban in Afghanistan . Though a new law had to be written , and the ships were limited to giving logistical support , this was , by post - war Japan 's standards , an unprecedented projection of its military capabilities . 
 Later , Junichiro Koizumi pushed for Japanese peacekeeping troops to be sent to southern Iraq . The 600 troops there are still embarrassingly constrained in their actions -- they are , in effect , protected by Australian peacekeepers nearby -- but their presence nevertheless marks another bold move by Junichiro Koizumi . They show that Japan 's leaders now see that the national interest may sometimes lie far from home -- and that the constitutional taboo on sending Japanese troops abroad can in fact be broken . 
 Junichiro Koizumi has proved an acute judge of a changing national mood . What is sometimes called the "" normalisation "" of Japan is increasingly popular . In a poll for the Yomiuri Shimbun last month , for instance , over half of those asked said they favoured changing the constitution in order to allow Japan to play a greater international part . Other polls suggest that most people support Japanese troops ' active involvement in peacekeeping . 
 A hint of extroversion 
 The new mood is reflected in the shifts taking place in politics . The landslide of Junichiro Koizumi's Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) in last September 's general election buried what remained of the pacifist left in Japanese politics . A majority of LDP members of parliament favour changes to the constitution . An amendment drafted by the party last autumn proposes to remove the ambiguities surrounding the role of the armed forces and to underline Japan 's right to take part in international operations outside the country 's borders . The main opposition group , the Democratic Party of Japan , is also increasingly robust about foreign policy . Its new leader , Ichiro Ozawa , elected last month , has long argued for a more assertive Japan . So constitutional debate , including the possibility of rewriting the pacifist Article 9 , is now on the political agenda , even if it is likely to be years before any constitutional change is agreed on . 
 Whereas Americans , in particular , think that Japan is taking only baby steps towards assuming a greater international role , and are impatient for more , two of its closest neighbours view the prospects of a more activist Japan with rising alarm . Policymakers in China and South Korea claim to detect in Japan 's push for "" normalisation "" the dangerous rearming of an historical foe and colonial overlord . 
 Much of this is overblown . Even the hawkish LDP 's latest constitutional draft reasserts Japan 's renunciation of war as a sovereign right . And the notion that Japan still harbours territorial designs on either the Korean peninsula or the Chinese mainland ( or even Taiwan ) is potty . Unfortunately , Japan does itself no favours when it comes to reassuring the neighbours . 
 Picking at the scabs of history 
 The problem is that the normalisation of Japan 's defence is not being matched by what could be called the normalisation of its nationalism , and Junichiro Koizumi shares a part of the blame . In Junichiro Koizumi's five years in office , Junichiro Koizumi has five times visited Tokyo 's Yasukuni shrine , where the 2.5 m servicemen who have fallen in wars since 1868 are honoured , but where the names of 14 Class A war criminals from the second world war are also memorialised . Junichiro Koizumi claims to visit the shrine as an individual , not an office - holder , and does so , Junichiro Koizumi says , in order to honour the innocent dead . Junichiro Koizumi usually accompanies Junichiro Koizumi's visits with a condemnation of Japan 's past belligerency . Still , the visits feed into deeply held feelings in China and South Korea that , despite dozens of official apologies , Japan has yet to atone fully and sincerely for its wartime past . The point is also emphasised by school textbooks that gloss over Japan 's wartime atrocities , and by continued Japanese reluctance to compensate the victims of Japanese militarism . 
 Yet the shriller China and South Korea become -- venomous anti - Japanese riots broke out in China last year -- the more inclined are ordinary Japanese to thumb their nose at the complaints . In that sense , Junichiro Koizumi merely exemplifies an attitude that seems to find honour in Japan 's isolation . And this provides cover for the Japan - as - historical - victim school that exists not just on the far right of Japan 's politics , but also as a central if small part of the LDP . 
 Even so , Japan pays a price for being on bad terms with its neighbours . No summit meetings have been held with China since 2001 . If Junichiro Koizumi meets Chinese leaders at all , Junichiro Koizumi meets them briefly on the fringes of multilateral gatherings . President Roh Moo - hyun of South Korea has also suspended meetings with Junichiro Koizumi . Diplomats say that Japan 's bilateral relations with China and South Korea have been damaged at every level , and former channels of communication closed . A consequence is that Japan is unable to take any regional initiative ( over the environment , for instance , or energy use ) at the very time it is seeking international "" normalisation "" . 
 The scratching of historical scabs has also inflamed the many island and seabed disputes in the seas dividing Japan from China and South Korea . China has long challenged Japan 's control of the Senkaku islands , a rocky outcrop known as the Diaoyutai in Chinese . More recently , China and Japan have squabbled about some oil and gas deposits below the East China Sea . China has now annoyed Japan by starting to extract some of the gas . 
 A simmering dispute between South Korea and Japan over two islets , the Dokdo , which Korea controls but which Japan claims and calls Takeshima , has suddenly boiled over . Japan 's coastguard said last month that it was sending two unarmed vessels to map the seabed around the blasted rocks , a couple of months before an international hydrographic conference at which South Korea was expected to offer Korean names for some submerged features . Furious , South Korea dispatched armed patrol boats to the area . Diplomats scrabbled to avert a confrontation , and achieved a deal whereby Japan would withdraw its surveyors if South Korea withdrew its list of names . 
 The matter is unlikely to stay shelved . President Roh went on television a few days after the deal in belligerent mood to say that "" Japan 's present claim to Dokdo is an act of negating the complete liberation and independence of Korea ... no compromise or surrender is possible , whatever the costs and sacrifices may be . "" Junichiro Koizumi's offer of a summit was rebuffed . 
 The incident is a reminder of how suddenly Japan 's relations with its neighbours can get out of hand . Plainly , repairs are needed , and plenty of suggestions have been forthcoming . They include joint history projects that might attempt to reach a consensus of sorts about the past ; more regional forums ; and a national debate in Japan about how to honour the dead and guard a sense of national identity without inflaming neighbours . Some of the more sensible ideas come from Japan 's soldiers . One suggests building trust with China by setting up joint search - and - rescue missions and procedures for accidental collisions in an ever - busier sea . 
 Infantile paralysis 
 China will certainly need to play its part . The leadership of China 's Communist Party has for so long used anti - Japanese sentiment to bolster its own legitimacy that once - warm feelings in Japan towards the Chinese have cooled , particularly since the anti - Japanese demonstrations last spring , when 24 m Chinese , it was claimed , signed an internet petition opposing Japan 's bid for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council . Such stridency constrains any Japanese leader judged at home to be appeasing China . 
 Japanese politicians can be blamed for doing too little to assuage fears by making their case , which is a reasonable one , clearly and unthreateningly . Yet Hu Jintao , the Chinese president , has also made a poor fist of relations with Japan . Though he has written off all hope of improving ties with Junichiro Koizumi , he is under pressure at home to make a fresh start with Japan after Junichiro Koizumi goes in September . One Beijing academic likens the two countries in the East China Sea disputes to "" children climbing on the table to fight over a glass of milk "" . 
 Japan 's role in the region suddenly seems to be a factor in the LDP race to succeed Junichiro Koizumi ( see page 71 ) . Candidates are under pressure to show the neighbours a measure of good faith , starting by staying away from Yasukuni . Both Japan and China appeared this week to be groping towards better relations . They said their talks over the East China Sea gas fields would restart next week , and their foreign ministers will meet again before long , too . 
 At some point , mutual suspicions over Taiwan will also have to be dealt with , and on this some Japanese see hope . They argue that Mr Hu 's recent rather subtle approach towards the island -- courting the opposition Kuomintang , isolating President Chen Shui - bian and his crumbling independence movement , and counting on greater economic integration between Taiwan and the mainland to achieve more than bluster and military threats -- could do much to reassure Japan about China 's intentions . So there is a chance that Japan and its neighbours could start to put their problems behind them . But that 's what it is -- a chance , no more than that for now .

IF THERE is one Japanese politician already well into the post-Koizumi era, says a protege, then it is the prime minister himself. Junichiro Koizumi, who has held office for five iconoclastic years, promises to step down in September in order to enjoy good food and music once more--not to mention a private life. But already, says the young parliamentarian, the divorce prime minister's heart is on all those things.
Only six months ago, Mr Koizumi still looked at the top of his game. But a financial scandal that implicated his party has gravely dented his authority, as has a row over his attempt to change the rules on imperial succession to allow for the possibility of a female emperor. With little drive from the prime minister, what remains of Mr Koizumi's reform agenda has stalled. The Diet (parliament) is in session at least until mid-June, but little business is getting done. Even the main legislative goal for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) this session, passing an education bill that promotes the teaching of patriotism in schools (a long-time obsession of cultural conservatives), looks like not passing in time. The prime minister, just back this week from a tour of west Africa and Sweden, appears to have in his diary only one event to which he looks forward--a summit in June with President George Bush meant to mark the reinvigoration of the security alliance between America and Japan. 
It leaves a curious hiatus in Japan's governance, for the bid to succeed Mr Koizumi is not likely to begin for real till the Diet winds up. Still, the nature of the race is already changing in intriguing ways. For instance, with Mr Koizumi a limping duck, it is no longer clear how powerful his endorsement might be for any would-be successor. This is especially so now, since a new factor that has crept into the race is the issue of Japan's diplomatic isolation in the region--to which Mr Koizumi's visits to the Yasukuni shrine, symbol of Japan's past militarism, have greatly contributed.
Usually, foreign policy is not high on Japan's political agenda. Besides, a reservoir of approval for Mr Koizumi's visits exists among the LDP's many hawks. So the change reflects the degree of party concern about Japan's poor international standing; and a number of undecided party factions, as well as potential kingmakers such as the economy minister, Kaoru Yosano, now demand to know what candidates intend to do about it. This does not help the cause of the front-runner, Shinzo Abe, the 51-year-old cabinet secretary. He is a long-time supporter of Yasukuni visits, and in the new mood this could be a liability. This week, Keizai Doyukai, a club for corporate executives that is close to the LDP, became the first big business group to give public warning of Yasukuni's danger to business with China.
By the same token, the odds have improved for Yasuo Fukuda, a grand old party man who belongs to the same faction as Mr Abe. His late father, Takeo, when prime minister in the 1970s, articulated the ""Fukuda doctrine"" of conciliation with Japan's Asian neighbours. Late last month, Mr Fukuda called for a fresh diplomacy in Asia that built on his father's beliefs. The speech seemed to mark his bid for the leadership. Meanwhile, a long-odds successor to Mr Koizumi, Taro Aso, the foreign minister and another Yasukuni-goer, recently declared that when it came to sensitive issues, national interest should trump private beliefs.
On the economy, the differences among candidates turn on whether a rise in the consumption tax is needed to plug a gaping budget deficit and bring down the high levels of debt incurred when Japan tried to spend its way out of slump in the 1990s. Mr Abe insists that revived growth and lower government spending will plug the gap. The finance minister, Sadakazu Tanigaki, is less disingenuous. He says that a hefty increase in the consumption tax is needed sooner rather than later--which probably explains why Mr Tanigaki is already considered the least plausible of the four probable main candidates.","Who will replace Junichiro Koizumi ?

FOR a society so given to miniaturism, Japan is powerfully attached to gigantism in banking. In a study of the banking crisis and economic slump that gutted Japan in the 1990s, Akihiro Kanaya and David Woo, economists with the International Monetary Fund, say that part of the cause was the ""persistent focus of banks on market share"". The banks pursued growth for growth's sake, making new loans at the peak of property and stockmarket bubbles in 1989-90 when that meant taking on riskier and riskier customers at lower and lower margins. 
When those loans went bad, the weakest banks collapsed, but only after they had made another lot of bad loans in the hope of growing their way out of trouble, postponing a banking recovery by another half-decade. From a high point in 1986, when they accounted for a quarter of the Japanese stockmarket's capitalisation, to a low point in 2003, when they spoke for less than 3% of it, the banks have had a gruelling ride. Their lending contracted by one-third, and familiar names disappeared in a wave of mergers and bail-outs. Eleven of the country's biggest commercial and development banks, some of them among the largest in the world, consolidated into three ""megabanks"". 
Industrial Bank of Japan, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank and Fuji Bank were among the big names subsumed into Mizuho in 2000; Sumitomo Bank and Sakura Bank fused into Sumitomo Mitsui in 2001; and in January this year Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi and UFJ, both the product of earlier mergers, completed a merger which once again gave Japan the biggest bank in the world by total assets: Mitsubishi-UFJ Financial Group, or MUFG, with a balance-sheet total of $1.7 trillion, slightly more than that of America's Citigroup. 
That has made MUFG cock of the walk, ahead of Mizuho with $1.46 trillion in total assets and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group with $900 billion. These banks are even bigger than the biggest banks of the pre-crisis days. But are they any better? 
The stockmarket certainly seems pretty keen on them. Bank shares have multiplied in value since the low point struck three years ago. But the big banks' profitability remains low by international standards, and their strategic direction is unclear. They are run by a generation of managers who got where they are today by managing shrinkage, not growth. 
Not only do the banks have to grow again, they have to grow in new directions if they want to boost their profits to international standards. They now have to do well as retail banks, a line of business in which they have been relatively weak but which is the least volatile and most profitable area of banking in most rich countries. Whereas HSBC gets more than 60% of its profits from retail banking and Citigroup more than 70%, the figure for Mizuho is about 42%, for SMFG 15% and for MUFG 16%, says Naoko Nemoto, an analyst with Standard & Poor's. 
The blockage in Japan looks like one of supply, not demand. David Atkinson, an analyst with Goldman Sachs in Tokyo, calculates that the big banks have only 2,700 branches between them in the whole of Japan. One carmaker alone, Toyota, has almost twice as many dealerships. Divide the sales staff of Japan's major banks by the customer base, says Mr Atkinson, and there are only enough staff for at most 55 minutes of personal contact with each customer each year, allowing for about two transactions of modest complexity. By contrast, the average customer of an American retail bank expects to conduct two or three branch transactions per month.
Newer, nimbler banks have been seizing the opportunity. They include Shinsei Bank, re-born from the Long Term Credit Bank of Japan, which collapsed in 1998 and was bought two years later by foreign investors. Its retail banking business has attracted 1.6m customers from a standing start in 2001. A survey by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun newspaper ranked Shinsei the best bank in Japan for customer service last year, followed by Sony Bank, an internet bank launched by the Sony group five years ago. 
The biggest network of them all
The big Japanese banks had even less incentive to develop retail networks while the state-owned post office savings bank offered a cheap alternative. But the savings bank, by some measures the biggest financial institution in the world, is now due to be privatised. Its long-term future is not yet clear (see box, next page). It scarcely matters, however, whether Japan's big banks expect the privatised postal savings bank to be a Godzilla-sized competitor in 12 years' time, or whether they foresee its dwindling from a major to a minor competitor. Either possibility ought to be focusing their minds on the need to strengthen their own retail business. So too should the prospect of rising short-term interest rates, after years of zero rates. Even allowing for a rise in deposit rates as well, banks should be able to get a better return from loans than they have been doing in recent years. 
There are signs that the big Japanese banks have indeed been looking ahead to such things. Moving, as often, in convoy, they have been buying into finance companies which operate credit cards and which lend money at high interest rates to people with poor credit histories. This may yield some short-term profits, but the banks would be eccentric to put too much long-term emphasis on this limited market when they have so many better-heeled customers of their own to whom they could be selling loans. Very probably they have that in mind, and they are buying finance companies to help them understand better how the process works. Fine, though they might acquire the same knowledge more cheaply by hiring a consulting firm or buying a book. 
Building up a branch network can be an expensive and time-consuming process. Mr Atkinson thinks that in the long term MUFG could reasonably aim for 1,500 branches, or two-thirds more than it has at present. It sounds a lot, but what other option does MUFG have? It has huge assets but relatively low profits. If it wants to be valued in the stockmarket at anything like the size of its global rivals, retail expansion is the only large-scale option readily available to it, and to its rivals too. 
And perhaps then, with more proven retail expertise at home, Japanese banks will become a touch more visible abroad, where after the retrenchment of the past decade they are at present hardly visible at all. Which is not to say they are entirely absent, but that their business is mainly in financing Japanese investments and Japan-related trade. As India's economy boomed last year, lending there by Japanese banks tripled to $4.3 billion. But China in particular must present a frustrating spectacle. Its banking system has opened to foreign investment, the potential is immense, Western banks are piling in--yet Japanese banks are standing on the sidelines. 
The timing has been bad for them, because they mostly still need to repay money which the government lent them during the banking crisis. Until they have finished doing that, they can hardly start throwing money around elsewhere. The politics are touchy, too. Japan's pre-1945 empire casts a long shadow. Relations with China have become more fractious during Junichiro Koizumi's term as prime minister, partly because his visits to the Yasukuni war shrine in Tokyo have caused angry protests in China, and partly because Japan is seen as an ally of China's great new rival, America. 
Even if the political climate improves and when Japan's banks have paid off the government, they need to have a banking model worth exporting, whether to China or anywhere else. Such things can be built from unlikely beginnings. Think how useless British banks were at retail in the 1960s, and how much better they are now. Japan has formidable traditions of mass production and of personal service. Put them together, and a great retail banking system could be built on that foundation--equal to the corporate banking system of which the Japanese were justly proud for most of the 20th century.","Japan 's banks have restructured and consolidated .

David Atkinson , an analyst with Goldman Sachs in Tokyo , calculates that the big banks have only 2,700 branches between them in the whole of Japan . One carmaker alone , Toyota , has almost twice as many dealerships . Divide the sales staff of Japan 's major banks by the customer base , says Mr Atkinson , and there are only enough staff for at most 55 minutes of personal contact with each customer each year , allowing for about two transactions of modest complexity . By contrast , the average customer of an American retail bank expects to conduct two or three branch transactions per month . 
 Newer , nimbler banks have been seizing the opportunity . They include Shinsei Bank , re - born from the Long Term Credit Bank of Japan , which collapsed in 1998 and was bought two years later by foreign investors . Its retail banking business has attracted 1.6 m customers from a standing start in 2001 . A survey by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun newspaper ranked Shinsei the best bank in Japan for customer service last year , followed by Sony Bank , an internet bank launched by the Sony group five years ago . 
 The biggest network of them all 
 The big Japanese banks had even less incentive to develop retail networks while the state - owned post office savings bank offered a cheap alternative . But the savings bank , by some measures the biggest financial institution in the world , is now due to be privatised . Its long - term future is not yet clear ( see box , next page ) . It scarcely matters , however , whether Japan 's big banks expect the privatised postal savings bank to be a Godzilla - sized competitor in 12 years ' time , or whether they foresee its dwindling from a major to a minor competitor . Either possibility ought to be focusing their minds on the need to strengthen their own retail business . So too should the prospect of rising short - term interest rates , after years of zero rates . Even allowing for a rise in deposit rates as well , banks should be able to get a better return from loans than they have been doing in recent years . 
 There are signs that the big Japanese banks have indeed been looking ahead to such things . Moving , as often , in convoy , they have been buying into finance companies which operate credit cards and which lend money at high interest rates to people with poor credit histories . This may yield some short - term profits , but the banks would be eccentric to put too much long - term emphasis on this limited market when they have so many better - heeled customers of their own to whom they could be selling loans . Very probably they have that in mind , and they are buying finance companies to help them understand better how the process works . Fine , though they might acquire the same knowledge more cheaply by hiring a consulting firm or buying a book . 
 Building up a branch network can be an expensive and time - consuming process . Mr Atkinson thinks that in the long term MUFG could reasonably aim for 1,500 branches , or two - thirds more than it has at present . It sounds a lot , but what other option does MUFG have ? It has huge assets but relatively low profits . If it wants to be valued in the stockmarket at anything like the size of its global rivals , retail expansion is the only large - scale option readily available to it , and to its rivals too . 
 And perhaps then , with more proven retail expertise at home , Japanese banks will become a touch more visible abroad , where after the retrenchment of the past decade they are at present hardly visible at all . Which is not to say they are entirely absent , but that their business is mainly in financing Japanese investments and Japan - related trade . As India 's economy boomed last year , lending there by Japanese banks tripled to $ 4.3 billion . But China in particular must present a frustrating spectacle . Its banking system has opened to foreign investment , the potential is immense , Western banks are piling in -- yet Japanese banks are standing on the sidelines . 
 The timing has been bad for them , because they mostly still need to repay money which the government lent them during the banking crisis . Until they have finished doing that , they can hardly start throwing money around elsewhere . The politics are touchy , too . Japan 's pre-1945 empire casts a long shadow . Relations with China have become more fractious during Junichiro Koizumi's term as prime minister , partly because Junichiro Koizumi's visits to the Yasukuni war shrine in Tokyo have caused angry protests in China , and partly because Japan is seen as an ally of China 's great new rival , America . 
 Even if the political climate improves and when Japan 's banks have paid off the government , they need to have a banking model worth exporting , whether to China or anywhere else . Such things can be built from unlikely beginnings . Think how useless British banks were at retail in the 1960s , and how much better they are now . Japan has formidable traditions of mass production and of personal service . Put them together , and a great retail banking system could be built on that foundation -- equal to the corporate banking system of which the Japanese were justly proud for most of the 20th century .",740,Japan,A29-8209,IN TERM,True,Junichiro Koizumi 's,2,True

TARA KONO, a vice-minister and member of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), points out a dispiriting feature of the race to succeed Junichiro Koizumi as prime minister in September: none of the potential candidates is talking about the issues that really matter to voters. Mr Kono has a point--especially about pensions.
In Japan, as in most developed countries, the pension system works by taking contributions from those in work to pay for those in retirement. This works fine with a growing population. But Japan's population is now falling, and the proportion that is over 65, at 19.5%, is already the highest in the world. That figure will reach nearly 30% by 2025, as Japan's post-war generation of baby-boomers is now starting to retire. The number of younger people is also falling fast, meaning fewer workers supporting ever more pensioners. 
The government has taken a few steps to deal with the problem. The pension system has two parts. The contributions that employees and employers make to the earnings-related part will go up a notch each year until 2017, and the minimum mandatory retirement age will rise from 60 to 65 between 2013 and 2025. Contributions to the basic state pension, available to everyone, will also go up; the monthly mandatory contribution of yen13,860 ($126) is to be raised by yen280 each year until 2017.
If you think that will solve the problem, says Mr Kono, then you are at odds with the millions who are abandoning their obligations to the system. Currently over 36% of Japanese are not paying contributions towards the basic pension, and the number is growing. The proportion is over 50% among those aged 20-24, and who can blame them? The system will be bankrupt by the time they come to draw on it. So Mr Kono proposes scrapping the contribution system and funding the basic pension out of a consumption tax, with the wealthiest retirees not eligible for benefits.
Another dispiriting feature of the leadership race is that, instead of taking their case to the country, potential candidates are lobbying behind the scenes to get the backing of the LDP lawmakers who will vote for a new party leader. So, unexpectedly, Mr Kono last week declared his candidacy, one built on solid policy issues, pensions to the fore. He thinks he can change the nature of the race.
""Any new leader"", he says, ""has at least to come forward and say what he proposes to do."" Yet none of the four preferred candidates has definitively said he is even running, partly because each has been trying to sew up the backing of the LDP's nine organised factions. Traditionally, factions support just one candidate. A problem for the Mori faction, the biggest, is that two of its prominent members, Shinzo Abe and Yasuo Fukuda, seem bent on running.
Mr Kono, a stripling at 43, is also a member of a faction. Indeed, it carries his name, or rather that of his father, the speaker of parliament's lower house. Meanwhile a senior member of the faction, none other than the foreign minister, Taro Aso, is also expected to run for the leadership. Who cares, says Mr Kono. Factions have lost their main point since multi-seat constituencies were abolished in favour of single-seat ones in 1996. In 2001 Mr Koizumi broke the factions' hold on the political process by refusing to defer to them when appointing his cabinet, but he did not go far enough. Mr Kono says he will kill off factions altogether, by depriving them of their remaining ability to appoint members to powerful committees and as vice-ministers, like himself. After that, not even the factions' weekly ritual, the Thursday lunch, would have much point.","Debating issues in Japanese politics ? What a droll idea

WHAT a difference a few days make. In mid-May over half of those economists surveyed by Bloomberg said that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) would soon raise interest rates--zero since 1999 but for one brief and disastrous episode--perhaps at its policy board's next meeting, on June 14th-15th. After all, they reasoned, Japan's economic recovery was gaining a firm footing, inflation (negative for so long) was on the rise, and central bankers were known to be worried that speculative bubbles might form in financial markets. And the BoJ seemed to some to be preparing for an early rate rise. Since declaring the end to its policy of ""quantitative easing""--flooding the banking system with free money--in early March, it had been draining the system rapidly.
Yet now a rate increase at next week's meeting would come as a shock, even though the inflation gauge most watched, core consumer prices (that is, not counting fresh food), rose by 0.5% in the 12 months to April, the sixth month running in positive territory. Little has happened that might throw Japan's recovery in doubt: for example, first-quarter GDP grew at a rate of 3.1%, year-on-year, and that figure may later be revised upwards. 
What has changed is the global backdrop against which the BoJ has been seeking to raise rates. Since March, the yen's trade-weighted value has risen by 1.7%, largely because the dollar has weakened. (The yen has gained 5% against the greenback, while slipping by 2.3% against the euro.) This amounts, in effect, to a slight tightening of monetary policy. Further, Japan's stockmarket, like others in Asia, has taken a tumble. After falling by 3% on June 8th the Nikkei index closed below 15,000 for the first time since November. When financial markets are skittish, ending the zero interest-rate policy could knock confidence. The BoJ's room for manoeuvre has been suddenly constrained.
Assuming that the central bank leaves rates alone next week, attention will turn to its July meeting. All eyes will be on June's Tankan survey of business conditions, published by the BoJ on July 3rd. If confidence has taken a knock from a stronger yen and lower share prices, says Tetsufumi Yamakawa, of Goldman Sachs, then the central bank's scope will be constrained further. He thinks the central bank will raise rates in mid-August, by a quarter of a percentage point.
However, by then the race within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to succeed Junichiro Koizumi, party leader and prime minister, in September will be in full swing. BoJ officials dismiss the notion that the policy board would discuss anything so squalid as politics. Still, no central bank makes a contentious move during a political high season if it can help it. In other words, a rate move as late as the autumn even becomes possible.
Meanwhile, the BoJ has the tricky job of managing expectations at a time when it has withdrawn excess liquidity equivalent to a fifth of all base money--an action, some say, probably unfairly, that has contributed to global volatility. Recently, volatility returned to Japan's own short-term money market, dormant for so long. Around the end of quantitative easing in March, the amount of money kept in commercial banks' reserve accounts at the central bank was yen30 trillion-35 trillion ($260 billion-300 billion), far more than the minimum of roughly yen6 trillion needed to keep overnight rates at zero. Towards the end of May, liquidity was about yen12 trillion, still well above the supposed minimum, when overnight call rates suddenly shot up. In one day alone the BoJ had to inject yen1.5 trillion to hold rates down.
What had happened? Foreign institutions, lacking domestic banks' huge deposits, seemed suddenly to doubt that funding would remain virtually on tap--so they bid up its price. Liquidity risk, in other words, returned. This is quite normal, says the BoJ, but it will take a time for both the central bank and market participants, whose dealing desks have been unmanned for so long, to get used to the idea.","The Bank of Japan wants to raise rates, but deciding when gets no easier

MORE than any other country, America defines itself by a collective dream: the dream of economic opportunity and upward mobility. Its proudest boast is that it offers a chance of the good life to everybody who is willing to work hard and play by the rules. This ideal has made the United States the world's strongest magnet for immigrants; it has also reconciled ordinary Americans to the rough side of a dynamic economy, with all its inequalities and insecurities. Who cares if the boss earns 300 times more than the average working stiff, if the stiff knows he can become the boss?
Look around the world and the supremacy of ""the American model"" might seem assured. No other rich country has so successfully harnessed the modern juggernauts of technology and globalisation. The hallmarks of American capitalism--a willingness to take risks, a light regulatory touch and sharp competition--have spawned enormous wealth. ""This economy is powerful, productive and prosperous,"" George Bush boasted recently, and by many yardsticks he is right. Growth is fast, unemployment is low and profits are fat. It is hardly surprising that so many other governments are trying to ""Americanise"" their economies--whether through the European Union's Lisbon Agenda or Japan's Koizumi reforms. 
Yet many people feel unhappy about the American model--not least in the United States. Only one in four Americans believes the economy is in good shape. While firms' profits have soared, wages for the typical worker have barely budged. The middle class--admittedly a vague term in America--feels squeezed. A college degree is no longer a passport to ever-higher pay. Now politicians are playing on these fears. From the left, populists complain about Mr Bush's plutocratic friends exporting jobs abroad; from the right, nativists howl about immigrants wrecking the system.
A global argument
The debate about the American model echoes far beyond the nation's shores. Europeans have long held that America does not look after its poor--a prejudice reinforced by the ghastly scenes after Hurricane Katrina. The sharp decline in America's image abroad has much to do with foreign policy, but Americanisation has also become synonymous with globalisation. Across the rich world, global competition is forcing economies to become more flexible, often increasing inequality; Japan is one example (see page 67). The logic of many non-Americans is that if globalisation makes their economy more like America's, and the American model is defective, then free trade and open markets must be bad. 
This debate mixes up three arguments--about inequality, meritocracy and immigration. The word that America should worry about most is the one you hear least--meritocracy.
Begin with inequality. The flip-side of America's economic dynamism is that it has become more unequal--but in a more complex way than first appears (see pages 24-28). America's rich have been pulling away from the rest of the population, as the returns for talent and capital in a global market have increased. Even if American business stopped at the water's edge, Bill Gates and the partners of Goldman Sachs would still be wealthy people; but since software and investment banking are global industries, Mr Gates is worth $50 billion and the average pay-and-benefits package for Goldman's 22,400 employees is above $500,000.
On the other hand, the current wave of globalisation may not be widening the gap between the poor and the rest. Indeed, the headwinds of the global economy are being felt less by Americans at the bottom than by those in the middle. The jobs threatened by outsourcing--data-processing, accounting and so on--are white-collar jobs; the jobs done by the poor--cleaning and table-waiting, for example--could never be done from Bangalore. 
Those at the bottom have different fears, immigration high among them. Their jobs cannot be exported to rival countries perhaps, but rival workers can and are being imported to America. Yet there is surprisingly little evidence that the arrival of low-skilled workers has pulled poor Americans' wages down. And it has certainly provided a far better life for new arrivals than the one they left behind (see page 49).
A long ladder is fine, but it must have rungs
To many who would discredit American capitalism, this sort of cold-hearted number-crunching is beside the point. Any system in which the spoils are distributed so unevenly is morally wrong, they say. This newspaper disagrees. Inequality is not inherently wrong--as long as three conditions are met: first, society as a whole is getting richer; second, there is a safety net for the very poor; and third, everybody, regardless of class, race, creed or sex, has an opportunity to climb up through the system. A dynamic, fast-growing economy may sometimes look ugly, but it offers far more hope than a stagnant one for everybody in the United States.
This is not to let the American system off the hook when it comes to social mobility. Although the United States is seen as a world of opportunity, the reality may be different. Some studies have shown that it is easier for poorer children to rise through society in many European countries than in America. There is a particular fear about the engine of American meritocracy, its education system. Only 3% of students at top colleges come from the poorest quarter of the population. Poor children are trapped in dismal schools, while richer parents spend ever more cash on tutoring their offspring. 
What, if anything, needs to be done? A meritocracy works only if it is seen to be fair. There are some unfair ways in which rich Americans have rewarded themselves, from backdated share options to reserved places at universities for the offspring of alumni. And a few of Mr Bush's fiscal choices are not helping. Why make the tax system less progressive at a time when the most affluent are doing best? 
That said, government should not be looking for ways to haul the rich down. Rather, it should help others, especially the extremely poor, to climb up--and that must mean education. Parts of the American system are still magnificent, such as its community colleges. But as countless international league tables show, its schools are not. Education is a political football, tossed about between Republicans who refuse to reform a locally based funding system that starves schools in poor districts, and Democrats who will never dare offend their paymasters in the teachers' unions. 
The other challenge is to create a social-welfare system that matches a global business world of fast-changing careers. No country has done this well. But the answer has to be broader than just ""trade-adjustment"" assistance or tax breaks for hard-hit areas. Health care, for instance, needs reform. America's traditional way of providing it through companies is crumbling. The public pension system, too, needs an overhaul. 
These are mightily complicated areas, but the United States has always had a genius for translating the highfalutin' talk of the American Dream into practical policies, such as the GI Bill, a scholarship scheme for returning troops after the second world war. The country needs another burst of practical idealism. It is still the model the rest of the world is following.","The world's most impressive economic machine needs a little adjusting

Parts of the American system are still magnificent, such as its community colleges. But as countless international league tables show, its schools are not. Education is a political football, tossed about between Republicans who refuse to reform a locally based funding system that starves schools in poor districts, and Democrats who will never dare offend their paymasters in the teachers' unions. 
The other challenge is to create a social-welfare system that matches a global business world of fast-changing careers. No country has done this well. But the answer has to be broader than just ""trade-adjustment"" assistance or tax breaks for hard-hit areas. Health care, for instance, needs reform. America's traditional way of providing it through companies is crumbling. The public pension system, too, needs an overhaul. 
These are mightily complicated areas, but the United States has always had a genius for translating the highfalutin' talk of the American Dream into practical policies, such as the GI Bill, a scholarship scheme for returning troops after the second world war. The country needs another burst of practical idealism. It is still the model the rest of the world is following.",740,Japan,A29-8209,,False,,0,True

IN A country that very nearly defines itself by its egalitarianism, an anguished debate in parliament, in newspaper columns and on television shows has gathered pace this year about Japan's widening gap between the haves and have-nots. Arch-conservatives and left-wingers alike blame the income gap not just on globalisation clobbering the unskilled, but on the structural reforms and deregulation championed by the prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, and his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Over the past few years, the critics charge, companies that once protected their workers have been able more easily to sack them, or redesignate them as ""non-regular"" staff, who come cheaper. Young adults, even graduates, have suffered in particular, many unable to get full-time work or any work at all.
And as the poor have got poorer, so the rich have multiplied. This year, two entrepreneurs now under arrest for market manipulation and insider dealing--Takafumi Horie, the brash young former boss of livedoor, an acquisitive internet company, and Yoshiaki Murakami, an ex-bureaucrat who turned shareholder activist and corporate raider--have become emblematic of Japan's growing disparities. Commentators seem less offended by their alleged flouting of securities laws than by their drive for profits.
Motonari Otsuru, the senior Tokyo prosecutor investigating them, is explicit. In a speech before the arrests he said: ""We cannot let this become a society where people who sweat from their labour, or who want to work but can't because of restructuring, can be taken advantage of."" The admission on June 13th by the central-bank governor, Toshihiko Fukui, that he was an early investor in the Murakami Fund (see page 88) appears to be further proof of the conspiracy of the rich against the poor.
With the income gap a big topic in the race to succeed Mr Koizumi as prime minister this September, it is worth taking a closer look. Statistical problems always guarantee that the income gap, in any country, is contested ground. Even so, no matter which data are used, the trend looks the same: income inequality in Japan has risen since the early 1980s. The first chart on the next page, using one trusted series, shows the Gini coefficient, a measure of income inequality where 0 represents equal pay for all households while 1 would represent perfect inequality--a single household taking all income. Work by Toshiaki Tachibanaki, an economics professor at Kyoto University, puts Japan behind only the United States, Britain and Italy in income inequality among the big rich economies. It once boasted Scandinavian levels of equality.
Yet a closer look at the reasons behind the rise in inequality reassures somewhat. Fumio Ohtake, at Osaka University, notes that income distribution by age of household head has remained constant. In other words, the rise in the Gini coefficient can mostly be explained as a statistical outcome of Japan's rapidly ageing population. Older people tend to have the widest income disparity, since while some people retire to live on modest pensions, more senior managers get hefty pay rises in the last years of their working life, with pensions afterwards to match. An ageing population therefore scores higher on overall measures of inequality.
This effect counts for much more than any income gap among the young. All the same, that gap has grown among those under 30, according to a 2004 survey. This is probably due to an increase in the number of unemployed and those in part-time work. Between 1990 and 2005, the number of ""non-regular"" workers--ie, those on lower pay with neither full-time contracts nor benefits--rose from less than one-fifth to nearly one-third of the workforce, hitting the young (and working women) disproportionately.
Labour flexibility did much to help Japanese companies escape from piles of debt over the past decade, and partly as a consequence they are now making record profits. They are, indeed, busy hiring workers again, and more full-time ones than part-time. Furthermore, the recovery is spreading to the regions: in April the number of jobless fell by 260,000 from a year earlier, the fifth monthly fall in a row. Graduating students are finding work more easily than in previous years. Recruit, an employment agency, said in a recent survey that in the latest recruiting season, over 60% of students turned down their first job offer. Among the young, higher employment should start to reduce inequality.
The inequality debate will continue, however. Even though Mr Koizumi's most conspicuous reform--privatisation of the postal savings bank--has yet to lead to a single sacking, Japanese often equate deregulation with inequality. Take the taxi industry, for example, which has been opened up. Critics say there has been a fall in pay among drivers since deregulation, yet Mr Ohtake points out that the number of drivers has leapt, thereby reducing inequality. The rise in ""non-regular"" workers in Japan may in fact have narrowed the income gap, because the alternative was probably unemployment. But people do not see it that way. 
Even so, hard choices lie ahead. The growing inequality among the old will be passed on when their children inherit their wealth. If Japan really does care about equality, then a debate about redistribution is on the cards.
More pressing is what to do about the unskilled young who will struggle to find full-time work despite the recovery. Their plight is magnified in Japan by an employment system that still emphasises recruitment directly after school or college: by 30, a part-time worker will find it increasingly hard ever to find a full-time job. Better policy is needed, says Mr Tachibanaki, if a Japanese underclass of the underprivileged, however tiny in comparison to America or Britain, is not to emerge.","An emotional debate about those untouched by the economic recovery

THE course of Japanese monetary policy in the next few months, unclear already, just got murkier. On June 13th the governor of the Bank of Japan (BoJ), Toshihiko Fukui, told parliament that he had invested yen10m ($88,000) in the Murakami Fund, an activist investment fund whose founder, Yoshiaki Murakami, was arrested on June 5th for alleged insider trading. The opposition Democratic Party of Japan called for Mr Fukui's resignation. The government of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) quickly closed ranks. The country's media pack is now hounding the central-bank governor as if he were another celebrity rogue. Suddenly, his future is in the court of public opinion.
Mr Fukui's investment was made in 1999. Before parliament again on June 15th, he said that he preferred to call it a ""contribution"". That he had invested, or contributed, was no real secret: The Economist mentioned it in October last year. Mr Fukui also provided Mr Murakami, a former industry-ministry bureaucrat, with valuable contacts. All this took place when Mr Fukui was still in the private sector. He became governor of the central bank in 2003.
Mr Fukui applied to sell his holding in February, for redemption at the end of June. Amazingly, the governor of the central bank is not obliged to place his investments in a blind trust before taking office. The bank's officials are, however, bound to refrain from any ""profit-making"" activities if the public might detect in them even a whiff of impropriety. They must make that declaration to their division chief or the compliance committee. The delicate issue here is that the head of compliance is the deputy governor, Mr Fukui's underling. Surely, the bank's policymaking board would have been the better arbiter.
Then there is the sale's timing. In late January came the arrest of Takafumi Horie, the brash head of livedoor, an acquisitive internet group, suspected of financial chicanery. Rumours were rife then that the livedoor investigation might bag Mr Murakami, which has happened. Mr Fukui told parliament that by February he ""had begun to have doubts"" about Mr Murakami.
At the time of his sale, the governor was contemplating the biggest decision of his career, an end to ""quantitative easing"", by which the BoJ had for five years flooded the banking system with excess reserves. The end was announced in early March, and as liquidity was drained, so stockmarkets began to tank. After falling by more than 4% on June 13th, the Nikkei 225 stockmarket index is almost a fifth below its peak for the year, reached in April.
An even bigger decision now follows: when to raise interest rates--which have been at zero for most of the past seven years and which the BoJ left unchanged on June 15th. The stockmarket's fall has greatly complicated matters. Despite denials, the decision is complicated further by Mr Fukui's predicament, with no quick resolution in sight. Even if he survives, a sense will remain that some of the hard-won independence that he gained for the BoJ has been eroded, while the ruling party's politicians will argue that the central bank owes them a favour. The chances that interest rates will increase only after the LDP's race to succeed Mr Koizumi in September have just gone up.

AS THIS newspaper went to press, North Korea still looked to be on the brink of test-firing a ballistic missile capable perhaps of carrying a nuclear warhead as far as Alaska. In recent days American satellites have shown activity at a missile facility at Musudan-ri in the country's north-east consistent with filling a Taepodong-2 rocket on the launch pad with liquid fuel. The fuel is hard to siphon back out, and because it is corrosive can stay in the missile only for a matter of days.
Hence the presumption of an imminent firing. On the other hand, says Narushige Michishita of the National Institute for Defence Studies in Tokyo, it is easy to give the false impression of real activity around the missile, so perhaps the North Koreans are faking it. The only sure thing is that monsoon clouds are now closing round, making things harder for American spies, but also for North Koreans wanting to launch and track a missile.
Whether for real or for show, the preparations have caused outrage. George Bush's administration threatens tough action if a missile is fired. The secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, says that any test would be a ""provocative act"". Two Aegis-class cruisers are near the Korean coast, while America's new and largely untested missile-defence system in the Pacific is said to have been made operational.
South Korea has begged Kim Jong-il's regime not to ""put a friend in danger"" by firing the missile. A launch, indeed, would throw the South Korean government's whole policy of engagement into doubt. This week Kim Dae-jung, former president and architect of South Korea's ""sunshine policy"" towards the North, cancelled a planned visit to Pyongyang.
On June 20th Australia's foreign minister, Alexander Downer, gave warning that Australian food aid to North Korea was at risk. Meanwhile Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, who this week announced that his country's 600 ground troops in Iraq were to be brought home, says that his country would ""react severely"" to a launch. When North Korea fired a less far-flying missile over Japan in 1998, it provoked outrage, and pushed the country to join America in developing missile defences.
Divining North Korean motives gets no easier. The six-party talks (involving America, China, South Korea, Japan and Russia) aimed at getting North Korea to give up its nuclear-arms programmes in return for aid, trade and security guarantees have been stalled since last November. North Korea has long wanted to treat with America bilaterally, a notion turned down again this month. The Bush administration says it will not even start to negotiate on other matters until North Korea abandons its programmes for reprocessing plutonium and enriching uranium. Meanwhile, financial sanctions by America over dollar counterfeiting and money-laundering is squeezing a regime that has relied on such activities.
So the posturing--if it does not represent the outward effects of hidden tensions within the regime, which are always possible--looks most like an attempt to grab America's attention and strengthen North Korea's hand. Though the North has succeeded in the first aim, missile theatricals will not help with the second. Until now, it has been possible for North Korea's two chief economic benefactors, China and South Korea, to intimate that American intransigence is chiefly to blame for the six-party talks being stalled. A missile launch would make that case untenable.
Yet the range of options for America and its allies looks limited. Military force is out of the question because of the danger to the South. The United States' new missile-defence system is, to put it charitably, unproven. Few extra sanctions are available to apply pressure on a state that is already so economically isolated.
So the greatest pressure will fall on those countries most engaged with the regime. China (North Korea's only official ally), even though unthreatened by its neighbour's missiles, has expressed worries too. It is urging North Korea and America to get talking about the missiles one-to-one--a sure sign of anxiety. And it will not want to carry even more of the cost of keeping Mr Kim's awful country going. A pain, then, for everyone.","Grabbing attention by going ballistic 
AS THIS newspaper went to press, North Korea still looked to be on the brink of test-firing a ballistic missile capable perhaps of carrying a nuclear warhead as far as Alaska. In recent days American satellites have shown activity at a missile facility at Musudan-ri in the country's north-east consistent with filling a Taepodong-2 rocket on the launch pad with liquid fuel. The fuel is hard to siphon back out, and because it is corrosive can stay in the missile only for a matter of days.
Hence the presumption of an imminent firing. On the other hand, says Narushige Michishita of the National Institute for Defence Studies in Tokyo, it is easy to give the false impression of real activity around the missile, so perhaps the North Koreans are faking it. The only sure thing is that monsoon clouds are now closing round, making things harder for American spies, but also for North Koreans wanting to launch and track a missile.
Whether for real or for show, the preparations have caused outrage. George Bush's administration threatens tough action if a missile is fired. The secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, says that any test would be a ""provocative act"". Two Aegis-class cruisers are near the Korean coast, while America's new and largely untested missile-defence system in the Pacific is said to have been made operational.
South Korea has begged Kim Jong-il's regime not to ""put a friend in danger"" by firing the missile. A launch, indeed, would throw the South Korean government's whole policy of engagement into doubt. This week Kim Dae-jung, former president and architect of South Korea's ""sunshine policy"" towards the North, cancelled a planned visit to Pyongyang.
On June 20th Australia's foreign minister, Alexander Downer, gave warning that Australian food aid to North Korea was at risk. Meanwhile Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, who this week announced that his country's 600 ground troops in Iraq were to be brought home, says that his country would ""react severely"" to a launch. When North Korea fired a less far-flying missile over Japan in 1998, it provoked outrage, and pushed the country to join America in developing missile defences.
Divining North Korean motives gets no easier. The six-party talks (involving America, China, South Korea, Japan and Russia) aimed at getting North Korea to give up its nuclear-arms programmes in return for aid, trade and security guarantees have been stalled since last November. North Korea has long wanted to treat with America bilaterally, a notion turned down again this month. The Bush administration says it will not even start to negotiate on other matters until North Korea abandons its programmes for reprocessing plutonium and enriching uranium. Meanwhile, financial sanctions by America over dollar counterfeiting and money-laundering is squeezing a regime that has relied on such activities.
So the posturing--if it does not represent the outward effects of hidden tensions within the regime, which are always possible--looks most like an attempt to grab America's attention and strengthen North Korea's hand. Though the North has succeeded in the first aim, missile theatricals will not help with the second.

WITH the only world leader to have serenaded him with the Elvis Presley song ""I want you, I need you, I love you"" retiring in a couple of months, President George Bush may soon feel a bit lonesome. For his friendship with Junichiro Koizumi was based on more than just tender words. After the attacks of September 11th, Mr Koizumi threw his country behind America. Stretching Japan's pacifist constitution to its limits, he sent refuelling ships to the Indian Ocean to help America against the Taliban and troops to help reconstruction in Iraq. By inviting Mr Koizumi to Washington on June 29th, Mr Bush wanted to say goodbye and thank you.
The alliance is in far better health than during the 1980s, when American politicians complained of a Japanese economic invasion and a few alarmists even predicted conflict. Mr Koizumi has long looked forward to this trip as his swansong, say aides. Yet something is not quite right. A few weeks ago, Mr Koizumi looked set to be accorded that rarest honour, an address to a joint session of Congress. Now, it transpires, the highlight of the trip will be a pilgrimage with Mr Bush to Graceland, Elvis's home outside Memphis.
Fair enough: Mr Koizumi is an ardent Elvis fan. But the change of venue may spring from worries at the five visits he has made as prime minister to the Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo, which honours Japan's war dead, including 14 Class A war criminals. Suspicion of Japan is strongest in Asia, but there's a bit about in America too. Many servicemen were brutally treated by the Japanese during the war. And American policymakers sometimes fret that Japan's insensitivity makes engaging with a rising China harder.
So, when the possibility of an address to Congress was mooted, Henry Hyde, the chairman of the House International Relations Committee and a war veteran, wrote to the speaker, Dennis Hastert. It would, said Mr Hyde, not be appropriate for Mr Koizumi to use the podium used by Roosevelt to denounce the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour if he then made his annual visit to Yasukuni on August 15th, the anniversary of Japan's defeat in 1945. The idea of an address to Congress melted away.
Still, he and Mr Bush have substantial issues to discuss. Most recently, the importance of America's alliance with Japan has been underlined by North Korea's preparations to test a long-range missile. America and Japan share an obvious interest in persuading Kim Jong Il not to lob missiles in their direction. Japan feels less threatened, however, by Iran's apparent intention to build nuclear weapons. Urged by America to help it isolate Iran, it fears that this would cut off one of its main sources of oil. 
Japan's interests were not exactly the same as America's in Iraq, either, but Mr Koizumi backed Mr Bush in part because the stakes, for Japan, were lower. Its oil supply was not threatened, and its commitment of troops was largely symbolic. For America, however, preventing Iran from going nuclear is of paramount importance, and doing so peacefully depends in part on Japan supporting any sanctions regime. Japanese officials, however, are very keen to see agreement at the UN Security Council--unlikely, given China's reluctance to let the issue interfere with its own quest for oil.
A final tension between America and Japan concerns trade. If the Doha trade talks are not to collapse, both countries must open their farm markets more. Japan is especially reluctant to do so, as was illustrated by a recent spat over American beef, in which fears of mad-cow disease strengthened the hands of protectionists.
What of the future? Given Mr Koizumi's friendship with Mr Bush, many worry that relations between America and Japan may cool after he goes. That will depend on Mr Koizumi's successor. Of the two main contenders, Yasuo Fukuda wants to mend relations with China by, among other things, drawing the Yasukuni sting. The favourite, Shinzo Abe, is more overtly hawkish. But either will surely find that, whatever they feel about America, they need it.

IN THE early hours of July 5th--just minutes after the United States had celebrated Independence Day half a world away with a launch of the space shuttle Discovery--North Korea grabbed the world's attention with a show of its own. From at least a couple of sites, the reclusive country defied repeated international warnings, including from its sole ally, China, and let fly with six missiles directed towards the Sea of Japan. Among them were short-range Scud-type rockets capable of hitting South Korea, Nodong missiles whose range of over 800 miles (1,300 kilometres) puts them in reach of Japan, and a long-range Taepodong-2 ballistic missile capable, in theory, of reaching Alaska or even the west coast of the United States (estimates of its range vary wildly). A further missile, probably a Scud-type, was launched later the same day. Further launches are promised.
Admittedly, the fireworks, which took place at a time of heavy cover from seasonal monsoon clouds, were something of a damp squib. While most of the missiles splashed into the Sea of Japan, 300 or more miles off the Japanese coast, the Taepodong-2, which American spy satellites have watched since it was hauled on to the launch pad and then filled with liquid fuel two weeks ago, seems to have self-destructed 40 seconds after its launch from the Musudan-ri missile facility in the country's north-east. The missiles were probably unarmed. And though North Korea claimed early last year that it had developed nuclear weapons, it is thought unlikely to have a nuclear warhead small enough to put on a long-range missile.
Still, the launches were calculated to provoke. They break a seven-year moratorium that North Korea reaffirmed bilaterally with Japan in 2002 and last year with the members of the six-party talks (also involving America, China, South Korea, Japan and Russia). These are aimed at getting the country to give up its nuclear-weapons programme in return for aid, trade and security guarantees. North Korea claims it is no longer bound by the agreement.
The tests tear away any pretence from North Korean claims that the Taepodong programme is for the launching of innocuous satellites. And by firing off short- and medium-range missiles as well as the Taepodong-2, North Korea has thrown down a challenge not just to America, but to its neighbours, South Korea and Japan, too. Condemning the launches, Japan called immediately for an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council. President George Bush dispatched his chief diplomat on North Korea, Christopher Hill, on a hurried visit to Seoul, Tokyo, Beijing and Moscow.
As ever, outsiders are first trying to divine the motives of North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il. One theory is that North Korea has been feeling hard done by. Attention from America and other big powers, after all, has fallen of late upon Iran (a long-time buyer of North Korean missile technology). Iran is currently being offered enticements to give up its production of uranium, in the form of a lifting of economic sanctions and offers from the West of light-water nuclear reactors. The proffered Iranian deal, indeed, is similar to the one that North Korea signed in 1994 with Bill Clinton's administration, before it was later found out to be reneging on it.
Sanctions followed when the cheating was discovered, and have been tightened. Since last summer, America has cracked down on proceeds from North Korean counterfeiting and on money-laundering from arms and drugs sales. It has frozen North Korean assets in America and forced a bank in Macau to stop acting as a conduit for North Korean funds. These launches, then, might be the regime's desperate attempt to break out of its box. North Korea, says Michael Green of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies and a former administration official, has thrown ""the whole chessboard in the air"" to see if it can start afresh at the negotiating table, this time with its missiles placed squarely on it. If so, it may have miscalculated.
It's different now
When North Korea test-fired a Taepodong-1 in 1998 over northern Japan and into the Pacific Ocean, the shock pushed Mr Clinton's administration for a while to engage more intensively with North Korea, with which America has no diplomatic relations. In recent weeks, North Korea has again urged America to deal directly with it, rather than through the six-party talks from which North Korea has broken off. Yet times have changed since 1998. In 2002 Mr Bush declared the North Korean regime to be part of the ""axis of evil"". The administration now insists that it will not even think of negotiating bilaterally (though two-way contacts under the six-party umbrella would be accepted) with North Korea on any issue until it gives up its programmes for enriching uranium and reprocessing plutonium.
Far from cowing America into backing down, the launch of the Taepodong-2 may reinforce American resolve--the firing was, after all, an abject failure. Though the administration had earlier made clear that it would not follow the urging recently given in the Washington Post by William Perry, Mr Clinton's defence secretary, and Ashton Carter, his chief North Korean adviser, for a pre-emptive strike on Musudan-ri, the launches have strengthened the hand of those arguing for a more muscular approach to the North Korean problem. Deadlines for North Korea to dismantle its nuclear programme may be set and, if they are not met, escalating sanctions imposed. This kind of pressure, some think, might even bring down Mr Kim's regime. For now, America is struggling to find an international consensus on what to do next.
A cacophony of views
Among North Korea's neighbours, Japan--offended, first, by the 1998 missile launch and angry since over the unresolved histories of Japanese citizens abducted in the 1970s and 1980s to North Korea--is the most inclined towards toughness. The government of Junichiro Koizumi immediately barred from Japan's ports the North Korean ferry that plies between the two countries delivering scarce goods and hard currency to the North; charter flights have also been cancelled; and North Korean officials banned from visits. Japan may also block remittances from ethnic Koreans living in Japan.
But, above all, the launches reaffirm Japan's commitment to developing missile defences, based on America's Aegis system at sea and the latest Patriot missiles on land, due to be delivered over the next few months. Parliament recently passed laws speeding up their activation during an emergency. North Korea's actions are driving Japan ever closer to America.
For South Korea and China, North Korea's fireworks are not just a concern, but a deep embarrassment. South Korea has, more than any country, invested capital, political and financial, in its ties with North Korea, even as that investment has helped complicate its relations with America. It warned North Korea off launching missiles, begging it not to ""put a friend in danger"". Now, the launches pose a grave threat to the ""sunshine policy"" of engagement with North Korea that was instigated by Kim Dae-jung in 2000 and carried on by President Roh Moo-hyun. A keener debate about North Korea is bound to ensue. For now, Mr Roh's government has condemned the launches, and says it is ""carefully considering"" cutting off money, food and fertiliser to the North--though private business ties, it is said, will not be affected. South Korea's annual trade, around $1 billion, along with other goodies, is vital in keeping Mr Kim's regime going.
Yet the tests will presumably embarrass China the most. It has invested much diplomatic energy in efforts to bring together the countries most concerned with Korean security issues. Officials hoped that the six-party talks would demonstrate that China, hitherto reluctant to take centre-stage in resolving international disputes, could play the part of a big power.
Only a day before the tests, China had announced that a deputy prime minister, Hui Liangyu, would visit Pyongyang next week. In the secretive style of China-North Korean diplomacy, no agenda for his trip was revealed. Yet Mr Hui was sure to repeat the concern expressed publicly last week by the prime minister, Wen Jiabao, about the possibility of a test.
North Korea's disregard of China's gently worded pleas suggest that China has not been threatening North Korea in private with dire consequences if it did test. But without China's support in the form of fuel and food supplies, North Korea's economy, already barely functioning, would grind very nearly to a halt. However, China fears that putting economic pressure on North Korea would destabilise the country. A huge flow of refugees into China from North Korea--let alone another Korean war--would threaten stability in China itself.
China will be particularly anxious about Japan's response to the tests. It worries that North Korea's nuclear and missile programmes are being used as an excuse by Japanese politicians to push their country into playing a more prominent security role around the world. China believes that this could fuel military rivalry with Japan. It also worries that Japan's missile-defence systems could undermine the deterrent value of its own long-range missiles.
Still, as the Security Council met in emergency session on July 5th, it looked certain that neither China nor, for that matter, Russia, were prepared to countenance anything more than a mild rebuke of North Korea, and would be most reluctant to side with any attempt to impose sanctions. Such a move towards firmness would represent a huge shift in Chinese policy, and jeopardise what little influence remains for the country closest to Mr Kim's wretched regime. It is worth asking, though, what use that influence is.","A ghastly regime causes headaches for ally and foe alike

LIKE a tide pushing inland, Japan's recovery is now touching the economy's remotest parts. What began as a pick-up in exports in 2003 was by the end of last year a recovery clearly rooted in domestic demand. Companies have recently been making record profits, and have rejoiced in full order books. As the gap has narrowed between what the economy actually produces and what it is capable of, demand for workers has increased. Last November inflation, measured by core consumer prices (which exclude fresh food, but include energy), rose for the first time in years. It has been in positive territory ever since. This is the end, then, of Japan's long era of deflation.
In late April, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) declared the output gap to be closed. In May, it was recently announced, core consumer-price inflation rose to an annual 0.6%, from 0.5% in April, while unemployment, at 4%, fell to an eight-year low. The employment picture now strongly favours job-seekers: on average, 107 jobs exist for every 100 applicants. Admittedly, wage rises remain slight for now, perhaps because a large number of part-time workers or those not on regular contracts still exert a moderating force on pay. All the same, a tighter labour market looks set to play a part in pushing consumer prices higher.
The BoJ's governor, Toshihiko Fukui, and other central-bank officials have recently suggested that, for them, the picture for capital expenditure will be the key in deciding when to raise interest rates, which have been at zero for six years. Hence the importance of the bank's latest quarterly Tankan survey of business conditions, released on July 3rd.
The survey showed growing corporate optimism, and a sharp upswing in firms' plans to invest. For instance, large companies of all kinds now plan to boost capital expenditure by nearly 12% in the fiscal year that began in April, compared with plans reported in the March survey to boost spending by less than 3% over the same period. Notable, too, was a marked improvement in conditions reported by non-manufacturers, large and small. A shortage of skilled workers was also confirmed.
Strong business sentiment and a tight labour market: the Tankan survey makes it hard for the Bank of Japan any longer to put off the decision to start ""normalising"" rates--particularly since the stockmarket has now recovered its poise after worrying falls in May and early June. On the survey's publication, the market for euroyen futures instantly priced in the probability of a quarter-point rise at the end of the BoJ's policy-board meeting on July 13th and 14th, along with a further rise of the same magnitude later in the year. Yet with today's rate of core inflation, even a cumulative half-point rise in interest rates would not represent ""normalisation"", for real interest rates would remain below zero--after inflation, you would still be paid to borrow. The prices of euroyen futures indicate a further half-point rise in interest rates next year.
Some (politicians, more than economists) worry that raising rates will slow the economy. The last time the BoJ raised rates, in August 2000, the result was disastrous and policy had to be reversed a few months later. However, with the economy looking hale--real GDP grew by 3.8% in the year to the first quarter--such concerns now look overdone.
If the Bank of Japan did not raise interest rates next week, financial markets would now be surprised; if it did not raise them in August, they would be shocked. That is because of the uncomfortably politicised nature of Mr Fukui's position. The governor's future was last month thrown into doubt by his admission that he had put money into the controversial investment funds of Yoshiaki Murakami, who was arrested on June 5th for alleged insider trading. The timing of the sale of Mr Fukui's stake earlier this year added to the brouhaha. On July 7th the BoJ is expected to announce a new set of rules, drawn up by outsiders, governing its senior officials' investments.
The measures are meant to forestall future controversy. But if the BoJ does not raise rates soon, it will be judged to have bent to political pressure as a result of Mr Fukui's weakened position, a suspicion that would gravely undermine its credibility. As it is, both the finance minister, Sadakazu Tanigaki, and the interior minister, Heizo Takenaka, this week urged the bank not to move, saying that deflation was not yet definitively beaten. In mid-July, a leadership race among the ruling Liberal Democratic Party will begin, for the succession to the prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, who retires in September. The BoJ will not want to be caught in the middle of that if it can possibly help it. Better, in other words, to strike early.

LIKE a tide pushing inland, Japan's recovery is now touching the economy's remotest parts. What began as a pick-up in exports in 2003 was by the end of last year a recovery clearly rooted in domestic demand. Companies have recently been making record profits, and have rejoiced in full order books. As the gap has narrowed between what the economy actually produces and what it is capable of, demand for workers has increased. Last November inflation, measured by core consumer prices (which exclude fresh food, but include energy), rose for the first time in years. It has been in positive territory ever since. This is the end, then, of Japan's long era of deflation.
In late April, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) declared the output gap to be closed. In May, it was recently announced, core consumer-price inflation rose to an annual 0.6%, from 0.5% in April, while unemployment, at 4%, fell to an eight-year low. The employment picture now strongly favours job-seekers: on average, 107 jobs exist for every 100 applicants. Admittedly, wage rises remain slight for now, perhaps because a large number of part-time workers or those not on regular contracts still exert a moderating force on pay. All the same, a tighter labour market looks set to play a part in pushing consumer prices higher.

IN THE week after Kim Jong Il of North Korea fired off seven missiles towards the Sea of Japan, including a long-range ballistic Taepodong-2 that self-destructed soon after take-off, every country with a stake in North Korea's future--even its sole ally, China--has publicly denounced the action. Every country, that is, except South Korea. North Korea is still technically at war with the South, along whose border it masses artillery, tanks and troops. Yet since 2000, South Korea has pursued a ""sunshine policy"" towards North Korea that attempts to engage the hermit state with political dialogue and economic blandishments. Doggedly sunny, the government seems determined not to let this crisis push it off course.
South Korea's president, Roh Moo-hyun, has managed not even to acknowledge the missile firings yet in public. Instead, an odd notice has been posted on the presidential website. Domestic critics of the president's light-handed approach, the notice said, were stuck in the cold war, when South Korean dictatorships would exaggerate the threat from the North in order to increase their control at home. The firing of the Taepodong-2 constituted no crisis, because ""it was not aimed at any particular party."" Japan, rather than North Korea, came in for criticism in the presidential notice: ""There is no reason to fuss over this from the break of dawn like Japan, but every reason to do the opposite."" South Korea's opposition has slated the government for this stance.
But official criticism of Japan has since grown stronger. Some Japanese officials, including Shinzo Abe, the chief cabinet secretary and likely successor to Junichiro Koizumi, the prime minister, have this week raised the possibility of pre-emptive strikes at North Korean missile facilities should an attack on Japan look imminent (though Japan at the moment lacks the capability actually to do it). This brought apoplexy from a presidential spokesman in South Korea, who said it ""exposed Japan's tendency to invade"" other nations; Japan, not North Korea, was responsible for tensions on the peninsula.
South Korea's assiduously muted criticism of North Korea admittedly hides deep concern. Without fanfare, the government said last week that it is suspending the shipments of food and fertiliser on which North Korea depends. Though a planned inter-Korean ministerial meeting this week went ahead in the southern port city of Busan, the government in Seoul stressed that it would not focus on the usual economic exchanges, but rather on the missiles and on stalled negotiations over North Korea's nuclear-weapons programmes. The talks duly broke down. However, business is to continue as usual at Kaesong, the inter-Korean economic zone just across the border in the North.
South Korea's policy of engagement, then, if North Korea itself does not scupper it, is likely to continue. For all the growing debate in South Korea about what the country is getting in return for the sunshine, there is little appetite for an alternative. Among much of the public, an insouciance exists about the North Korean threat. Most South Korean policymakers seem to think that Mr Kim's regime, acutely aware that it has long lost both the economic and military advantage, will strike out only if isolated and provoked.
This means that South Korea's tensions are guaranteed to continue not just with Japan, which is robustly pushing for stronger measures against the North, but also with America. At bottom, South Korea and its ultimate guarantor want different outcomes. President George Bush professes a visceral hatred of Mr Kim, and hopes that the regime will collapse under a combination of internal contradictions and outside pressure. South Korea's engagement policy aims to avert such a collapse, which would present a huge and costly challenge to the South--better, instead, to help North Korea towards prosperity. In polls, South Koreans say they want reunification, but the overwhelming majority believe it should be deliberate, well-planned--and always at least a decade away.
This week, as The Economist went to press, events seemed to be going South Korea's way. Japan agreed to shelve, at least for a few days, a UN Security Council resolution calling for sanctions on North Korea, backed, if necessary, by force. This was intended to give Chinese diplomacy with North Korea a chance to work--China's deputy foreign minister, Wu Dawei, left for Pyongyang on July 10th. Mr Bush's administration also said it was keen to see China rein in a wayward ally. But if such diplomacy fails to get North Korea back to multi-party negotiations, then South Korea's sunshine will stand in growing contrast to American and Japanese hostility towards the North.","South Korea's ""sunshine policy"" continues, for lack of anything better

For though Japan's toughness drew praise from America, Britain and France, among others, an element of hyperbole in its reaction unsettled even some supporters.

His popularity at home rests in part on taking a hard line against North Korea, hitherto over the regime's refusal fully to account for Japanese kidnapped in the 1970s and 1980s. After the firings, Mr Abe even mused publicly about pacifist Japan making pre-emptive strikes on North Korean missile facilities (though Japan lacks the means at present). That enraged Japan's neighbours, South Korea and China, as much as North Korea.
But Japan's assertiveness very nearly came to grief by appearing not to want to give diplomacy a chance to bring the isolated regime back to the six-party talks involving America, China, South Korea, Japan and Russia. Everyone outside Pyongyang agrees these are the best forum in which to solve North Korean issues. While Japan was merely sounding shrill, China encouragingly said it was sending a high-ranking delegation to Pyongyang to talk reason. Under pressure from America, its ally and mentor, Japan agreed to withdraw its Security Council resolution for a few days.
Had China succeeded in bringing North Korea back to the talks, Japan's diplomacy would have looked badly miscalibrated. As it was, the North Koreans snubbed their only ally, to evident Japanese relief. The action returned to the Security Council. China said it would veto a resolution that threatened force. But with its president, Hu Jintao, under pressure to look statesmanlike as a guest of the G8 in St Petersburg, it agreed on July 15th to a compromise, brokered by Britain, that still strongly condemned the missile tests and banned the transfer of missile-related technology to North Korea. At last China had shown a degree of annoyance with its North Korean neighbour, a striking development after years of avoiding even the mildest criticism--indicating, perhaps, that China has run out of other ideas for bringing North Korea to heel.
Some seasoned observers have doubts about Japan's new assertiveness. The problem with being pushy, they say, is that this approach goes down much better at home than it does with those you are pushing about abroad.

RARELY has a tiny change in interest rates been the subject of so much attention. When the Bank of Japan (BoJ) raised overnight interest rates to 0.25 % on July 14th, it was a tiny step and widely anticipated. But it was a giant leap for Japan, where the interest rate has been at zero for most of the past seven years. An interest rate of zero was chief among a range of occasionally desperate measures used to revive the world's second-biggest economy. So the rate rise is an acknowledgment that Japan is supposed to be back on the path to normality. Yet quite what normal is, no one is sure--the Japanese economy has been abnormal for so very long.
Japan's experience is unique. The country's decade and a half of stagnation stands in bleak contrast to the blistering growth that preceded it and that enjoyed more recently by many other rich economies, notably America. Japan is not alone in having had a banking crisis brought on when an asset bubble burst. America had its ""savings-and-loan"" mess in the 1980s. Sweden had a crisis like Japan's in the early 1990s. And in 1997-98, a financial typhoon tore through most of Asia. Yet in all these instances, action was, on the whole, fairly swiftly taken to write off bad debts, clean up banking systems and restore economies to growth. By contrast, Japan was mesmerised. For too long, instead of seeking to bring its financial system back to health, it appeared to place its hopes in great dollops of spending on public works to get the economy moving.
For consolation Japan can say that at least public confidence in its financial system never entirely collapsed--though it came close in 1997-98. Since a widespread run on bank deposits thankfully never happened, the depth of Japan's downturn cannot be compared to America's Great Depression of the 1930s. Still, the cost was great. As Michael Hutchison, Takatoshi Ito and Frank Westermann point out in ""Japan's Great Stagnation"", not since the depression has any other economy experienced Japan's combination of wealth destruction, persistent poor growth, deflation and financial distress. 
Japan was lucky. It began its long malaise as one of the richest societies on earth. But its subsequent performance was abysmal. Between 1990 and 2005, real growth averaged just 1.3% a year. Without the malaise, Japan's GDP would have been about 25% higher in real terms than it is now. In nominal terms, Japanese GDP remains below its 1997 level, thanks to deflation (see chart 1 on next page). Over that same period from 1997, the nominal GDP of neighbouring South Korea, which bore the full brunt of the Asian financial crisis, has risen by 65%; America's is up by 50%. Japan's stagnation, then, represents a great squandering of wealth and opportunity.
The American plan
To understand why this happened and assess Japan's prospects as normality returns, you need to go all the way back to the end of the second world war. At first, Japan's American overlords wanted to rip up the bank-dominated system that had done so much to finance the rise of Japanese militarism--free capital markets and democracy seemed to American idealists, then as now, to go hand-in-hand. Yet by the early 1950s, with a cold war with the Soviet Union and a hot one in Korea, harder noses prevailed. What Americans wanted from Japan was a predictable flow of industrial goods. The Japanese, for their part, argued that banks were the best way to channel scarce resources towards industries that could help rebuild the economy swiftly. So banks, not capital markets, became the chief source of finance. 
As Gillian Tett points out in her book, ""Saving the Sun"", capital markets were not abolished completely; the Tokyo Stock Exchange reopened. Yet the point of shares was not to raise capital, but cement ties with other business groups in an interlocking set of cross-shareholdings. These groups, with a principal bank at their core, became known as the keiretsu. In this system, the strong carried the weak.
For a while it worked spectacularly. Banks, cosseted by protected markets, regulated interest rates and a maternal finance ministry took in households' cheap savings and channelled them towards chosen industries. Savers did not get much in interest, but back then the Japanese were nothing like the consumers they have become. Japan was making things chiefly for export. And the virtue of the system was that everyone had a job. Between 1960 and 1973 the economy grew by 9.6% a year, twice the OECD average. Unemployment, averaging just 1.3% over the same period, was well under half that of the rest of the OECD.
Even after the 1973 oil shock, growth averaging 3.8% a year, as it did up to 1989, was better than most. But by then Japan was bumping up against the constraints of a maturing economy. Creeping deregulation was eating into banks' protected markets at a time when demand for credit was no longer so great. 
By the 1980s, Japan was the world's biggest creditor. But its current-account surplus had become a political thorn in relations with America. The Plaza Accord of 1985 was meant to pull the thorn by blessing a rise in Japan's exchange rate. In 1985-86, the yen rose from yen260 to yen150 against the dollar. Fearing that exports and the economy would slump, the BoJ repeatedly cut interest rates.
Red-hot property
Instead of weakening, the economy took off. The government plugged its budget deficit and the stockmarket shook off the Wall Street crash of 1987. Property markets blossomed, giving the banks a wonderful new source of lending. By the end of 1989, Japanese shares accounted for half the world's stockmarket capitalisation. Land prices soared. A value was famously put on the grounds of Tokyo's Imperial Palace equal to that of California. Then, on December 25th 1989, the BoJ decided to cool the party and raised interest rates.
The effect was bracing, as share prices fell and land dealings dried up. Japanese banks were unusually sensitive to the value of those assets. Four-fifths of bank loans were reckoned to be related to land, which was often used as collateral. Banks also counted as capital a good part of their equity holdings in other firms. As share values fell, so banks' capital levels were threatened. The system of cross-shareholdings began to work against them.
Yet for some four years an eerie calm prevailed. Optimism was still high that asset values would pick up again. Counting on a recovery, banks often lent more to distressed borrowers or tucked problem loans out of sight in subsidiaries. Bank regulators wanted to see no evil.
Only late in 1994 did a sense take hold that something was going badly wrong. Two poorly run Tokyo credit co-operatives had to be bailed out. More credit co-operatives failed and there was trouble at the seven Jusen, housing-loan corporations founded by the big banks. Their losses, reckoned to be yen6.4 trillion ($68 billion), were more than the founder banks could muster. For the first time taxpayers contributed to a bail-out, to prevent contagion. 
Yet the spreading crisis had already touched the country's big banks. Daiwa Bank, one of the biggest, lost $1.1 billion through a fraudulent employee in New York and was ordered by American regulators to close all its United States operations. A domestic problem, as Hiroshi Nakaso of the BoJ, recounts in a paper* on the crisis, now had an international dimension.
In the spring of 1997 the smallest of three long-term credit banks, Nippon Credit Bank, had to be injected with private and public capital. In the autumn a default by a middle-sized stockbroker, Sanyo Securities, paralysed the interbank market. Soon after came the failure of Hokkaido Takushoku Bank, the dominant bank in the northernmost island of Hokkaido, where it had lent billions against resort developments. Shortly after, Yamaichi Securities, one of the biggest brokers, abruptly collapsed. The BoJ supplied liquidity and what remained was later taken over by Merrill Lynch.
Japan's financial system appeared to be on the edge of a meltdown, like much of Asia's at the time. Reassurances were hurriedly made by the finance minister and the BoJ'S governor, and by the following spring yen30 trillion in public funds was made available as capital for troubled banks. Bad loans in the system were admitted to be at least yen60 trillion.
The public injections may have been politically unpopular, but they seemed to calm things down--until the collapse of Long Term Credit Bank (LTCB) in the autumn of 1998. With assets of about $240 billion, this was among the world's biggest banks. As Ms Tett recounts, everything was done to prevent the problems coming to light, including dropping boxes of papers down manholes in the basement when inspectors called--not that the regulators wanted to find too much.
By the time of the collapse of LTCB, the scale of Japan's banking crisis had finally sunk in. Japan strengthened the system for deposit insurance. Public funds boosted the capital of the biggest banks and a newly created independent regulator, since renamed the Financial Services Agency, set out to break the cosy ties between banks and their former regulator, the finance ministry. In 1999 another injection of public money encouraged nine of the country's biggest banks to merge into four ""megabanks"", which have since consolidated further into three.
This fresh start for the banking system should have been a fresh start for the economy, too. But the recovery never happened. In 2001, with recession again threatening, Junichiro Koizumi became prime minister on a reformist ticket. The following year fears of another crisis grew. As share prices fell, the BoJ announced plans to buy equities from banks. 
In 2003 the government finally created a vehicle to clean up bad loans, although doubts about the motives behind this were widespread. And it was not until early 2005 that the banks could claim to have put their bad-debt problems behind them; they are now paying back the public money. After falling for a decade, net lending by banks started to rise again this year. And inflation, measured by ""core"" consumer prices, which exclude fresh food but include energy, has at long last turned consistently positive.
Why did the recovery not arrive earlier? One reason must be that, with the real level of non-performing loans in the banking system undeclared for so long, huge provisioning by the banks merely aggravated a state of financial disruption: banks could not afford to make fresh loans, even to good prospects. Another related reason is that until the banks had cause to deal with their loans, the troubled companies that had taken the loans out had little incentive to restructure. Japanese companies are now in much ruder health, but that is largely because of measures taken only in the past few years.
At the policy level, the government made two huge blunders. The first was to raise the consumption tax in 1997, which wrecked economic confidence. Just as confidence appeared to be recovering in August 2000, the BoJ declared an end to deflation and raised rates. The economy again went into a tailspin and the bank decided to retreat to zero six months later. But with prices falling, the expansionary effect even of a zero rate was lost, since real interest rates remained positive. A radical new measure was tried by the BoJ: in effect, printing money by stuffing the accounts that banks hold at the central bank with free cash. That super-loose liquidity, known as ""quantitative easing"", was withdrawn this spring.
Better prospects
The current economic expansion, which began in 2002, will by the end of this year be Japan's longest since the second world war. But not everyone takes its robustness for granted--the BoJ is constantly warned, by politicians especially, not to repeat its mistake of 2000. Richard Jerram, chief economist at Macquarie Research in Tokyo, points out that whereas the BoJ's favoured measure, core consumer prices, shows inflation running at 0.6%, other valid measures show prices still flirting with deflation. Strong uncertainties remain about Japan's potential future rate of growth, while a cushion is needed against external shocks, such as a slowdown in America or a financial crisis in China. 
In the spring the BoJ published an inflation ""range"" of 0-2%, within which it felt comfortable with 1%. But that does not leave much room on the downside, Mr Jerram argues, when even a zero rate loses its effect once prices fall. Others are more optimistic. With inflation now at 0.6%, monetary policy is actually looser despite the rate rise than it was a year ago, when deflation plus the zero rate kept real rates positive. But on July 20th, in its latest survey of Japan, the OECD also warned the BoJ against raising rates too hastily.
Jesper Koll, chief economist in Tokyo for Merrill Lynch, lists the ways in which the economy today is much stronger than it was in 2000--and well able to shoulder higher rates still. The yen has been weakening, not rising as it had been before August 2000. Bank credit is once again expanding, whereas it had been contracting in 2000. At the same time, borrowing costs have fallen, in real terms, as inflation has started inching up again.
Above all, the financial state of both companies and households is much healthier. Just as banks have cut their bad loans by four-fifths or more, so companies have brought their debts down to levels last seen before the bubble. Meanwhile, they make more efficient use of capital. Where once too many companies did too many things in different sectors, a brusque rationalisation has taken place, says James Ableggen, a business academic. Fourteen oil companies have been cut to four; seven cement companies to three, and 14 pulp and paper companies to three. More needs to be done in inefficient industries, notably electronics, where the temptation is to go back to the old over-investment and diversification. Nevertheless, Japanese firms are making record profits, and are investing to meet demand. With growth of over 3%, year on year, in the non-manufacturing industries, services look set to take up the running made hitherto by manufacturers.
Companies are also hiring. Between 1997 and 2003, employment fell by 2.4m, as people were either laid off or withdrew from the workforce. The trend has now firmly reversed, with unemployment at an eight-year low of 4%. Some reckon households have added about yen100 trillion to their net worth since the 1990s. Since companies and households now have more financial assets than liabilities, higher rates should on balance be of benefit.
The prospect exists, in other words, for future growth of even more than the 2.2% the OECD now dares to envisage. No end of concerns remain. In particular, government finances are in a parlous state, at a time when the population is ageing and shrinking. The government has repeated its commitment to reduce the deficit, largely through spending cuts. At the moment, thanks to economic growth, the initiative has a fair wind with tax revenues higher than expected. But a new prime minister will arrive in September and this adds to uncertainty. Nor can today's robust GDP growth of around 3% be counted on for ever to fill the exchequer. 
Last, there is the concern that Japan's new growth will be uneven. It is the biggest firms, including Japan's chief exporters, that have benefited most from a weak yen and a zero interest rate. Small companies struggled to get financial resources. A survey by the finance ministry finds that profit per worker at large manufacturers jumped from an annualised yen1.6m at the end of 2001 to yen5.4m at the beginning of this year, but at small manufacturers it has barely budged from yen700,000. The picture at non-manufacturing firms tells a similar story. Yet large firms account for only one-sixth of total employment in Japan. Policymakers must watch carefully to see whether the new growth in bank lending benefits smaller businesses--a stated policy of the country's big banks.
This bifurcation is also apparent among the working population, where income inequality now stands above the OECD average. Growing inequality partly reflects Japan's rapidly ageing society, but many Japanese, particularly the young, have found it difficult to find full-time work, with the employment benefits that go with it. A recovering economy might temper this problem.
Now that the BoJ has raised interest rates, however, what comes next is a brave new world. The debate will rage about how much, and when, the BoJ should tighten further as monetary policy is ""normalised""--financial markets appear to expect another quarter-point rise later this year, and half a point next year. But the importance of the BoJ's rate rise, and its earlier draining of its super-loose liquidity, is that private markets and not public charity will henceforth be supplying the credit that makes the economy go round. 
Already, the private price of money, measured by bond yields, has jumped. The paradox, says Mr Koll, is that it may take yet higher rates to unlock money from private lenders, who want to be compensated for risks they are once again prepared to take. It will be a while before markets adapt, and a good deal of volatility can be expected on the way. At heart, though, a country where money is given out by the state for nothing undermines the standing of a market economy. And at least the BoJ has done something about fixing that.

Caption: It looks like brightening up","As Japan emerges from an era of a zero interest rate, the country still needs to put more of its past behind it 
RARELY has a tiny change in interest rates been the subject of so much attention. When the Bank of Japan (BoJ) raised overnight interest rates to 0.25 % on July 14th, it was a tiny step and widely anticipated. But it was a giant leap for Japan, where the interest rate has been at zero for most of the past seven years. An interest rate of zero was chief among a range of occasionally desperate measures used to revive the world's second-biggest economy. So the rate rise is an acknowledgment that Japan is supposed to be back on the path to normality. Yet quite what normal is, no one is sure--the Japanese economy has been abnormal for so very long.
Japan's experience is unique. The country's decade and a half of stagnation stands in bleak contrast to the blistering growth that preceded it and that enjoyed more recently by many other rich economies, notably America. Japan is not alone in having had a banking crisis brought on when an asset bubble burst. America had its ""savings-and-loan"" mess in the 1980s. Sweden had a crisis like Japan's in the early 1990s. And in 1997-98, a financial typhoon tore through most of Asia. Yet in all these instances, action was, on the whole, fairly swiftly taken to write off bad debts, clean up banking systems and restore economies to growth. By contrast, Japan was mesmerised. For too long, instead of seeking to bring its financial system back to health, it appeared to place its hopes in great dollops of spending on public works to get the economy moving.
For consolation Japan can say that at least public confidence in its financial system never entirely collapsed--though it came close in 1997-98. Since a widespread run on bank deposits thankfully never happened, the depth of Japan's downturn cannot be compared to America's Great Depression of the 1930s. Still, the cost was great. As Michael Hutchison, Takatoshi Ito and Frank Westermann point out in ""Japan's Great Stagnation"", not since the depression has any other economy experienced Japan's combination of wealth destruction, persistent poor growth, deflation and financial distress. 
Japan was lucky. It began its long malaise as one of the richest societies on earth. But its subsequent performance was abysmal. Between 1990 and 2005, real growth averaged just 1.3% a year. Without the malaise, Japan's GDP would have been about 25% higher in real terms than it is now. In nominal terms, Japanese GDP remains below its 1997 level, thanks to deflation (see chart 1 on next page). Over that same period from 1997, the nominal GDP of neighbouring South Korea, which bore the full brunt of the Asian financial crisis, has risen by 65%; America's is up by 50%. Japan's stagnation, then, represents a great squandering of wealth and opportunity.
The American plan
To understand why this happened and assess Japan's prospects as normality returns, you need to go all the way back to the end of the second world war. At first, Japan's American overlords wanted to rip up the bank-dominated system that had done so much to finance the rise of Japanese militarism--free capital markets and democracy seemed to American idealists, then as now, to go hand-in-hand. Yet by the early 1950s, with a cold war with the Soviet Union and a hot one in Korea, harder noses prevailed. What Americans wanted from Japan was a predictable flow of industrial goods. The Japanese, for their part, argued that banks were the best way to channel scarce resources towards industries that could help rebuild the economy swiftly. So banks, not capital markets, became the chief source of finance. 
As Gillian Tett points out in her book, ""Saving the Sun"", capital markets were not abolished completely; the Tokyo Stock Exchange reopened. Yet the point of shares was not to raise capital, but cement ties with other business groups in an interlocking set of cross-shareholdings. These groups, with a principal bank at their core, became known as the keiretsu. In this system, the strong carried the weak.
For a while it worked spectacularly. Banks, cosseted by protected markets, regulated interest rates and a maternal finance ministry took in households' cheap savings and channelled them towards chosen industries. Savers did not get much in interest, but back then the Japanese were nothing like the consumers they have become. Japan was making things chiefly for export. And the virtue of the system was that everyone had a job. Between 1960 and 1973 the economy grew by 9.6% a year, twice the OECD average. Unemployment, averaging just 1.3% over the same period, was well under half that of the rest of the OECD.
Even after the 1973 oil shock, growth averaging 3.8% a year, as it did up to 1989, was better than most. But by then Japan was bumping up against the constraints of a maturing economy. Creeping deregulation was eating into banks' protected markets at a time when demand for credit was no longer so great. 
By the 1980s, Japan was the world's biggest creditor. But its current-account surplus had become a political thorn in relations with America. The Plaza Accord of 1985 was meant to pull the thorn by blessing a rise in Japan's exchange rate. In 1985-86, the yen rose from yen260 to yen150 against the dollar. Fearing that exports and the economy would slump, the BoJ repeatedly cut interest rates.
Red-hot property
Instead of weakening, the economy took off. The government plugged its budget deficit and the stockmarket shook off the Wall Street crash of 1987. Property markets blossomed, giving the banks a wonderful new source of lending. By the end of 1989, Japanese shares accounted for half the world's stockmarket capitalisation. Land prices soared. A value was famously put on the grounds of Tokyo's Imperial Palace equal to that of California. Then, on December 25th 1989, the BoJ decided to cool the party and raised interest rates.
The effect was bracing, as share prices fell and land dealings dried up. Japanese banks were unusually sensitive to the value of those assets. Four-fifths of bank loans were reckoned to be related to land, which was often used as collateral. Banks also counted as capital a good part of their equity holdings in other firms. As share values fell, so banks' capital levels were threatened. The system of cross-shareholdings began to work against them.
Yet for some four years an eerie calm prevailed. Optimism was still high that asset values would pick up again. Counting on a recovery, banks often lent more to distressed borrowers or tucked problem loans out of sight in subsidiaries. Bank regulators wanted to see no evil.
Only late in 1994 did a sense take hold that something was going badly wrong. Two poorly run Tokyo credit co-operatives had to be bailed out. More credit co-operatives failed and there was trouble at the seven Jusen, housing-loan corporations founded by the big banks. Their losses, reckoned to be yen6.4 trillion ($68 billion), were more than the founder banks could muster. For the first time taxpayers contributed to a bail-out, to prevent contagion. 
Yet the spreading crisis had already touched the country's big banks. Daiwa Bank, one of the biggest, lost $1.1 billion through a fraudulent employee in New York and was ordered by American regulators to close all its United States operations. A domestic problem, as Hiroshi Nakaso of the BoJ, recounts in a paper* on the crisis, now had an international dimension.
In the spring of 1997 the smallest of three long-term credit banks, Nippon Credit Bank, had to be injected with private and public capital. In the autumn a default by a middle-sized stockbroker, Sanyo Securities, paralysed the interbank market. Soon after came the failure of Hokkaido Takushoku Bank, the dominant bank in the northernmost island of Hokkaido, where it had lent billions against resort developments. Shortly after, Yamaichi Securities, one of the biggest brokers, abruptly collapsed. The BoJ supplied liquidity and what remained was later taken over by Merrill Lynch.
Japan's financial system appeared to be on the edge of a meltdown, like much of Asia's at the time. Reassurances were hurriedly made by the finance minister and the BoJ'S governor, and by the following spring yen30 trillion in public funds was made available as capital for troubled banks. Bad loans in the system were admitted to be at least yen60 trillion.
The public injections may have been politically unpopular, but they seemed to calm things down--until the collapse of Long Term Credit Bank (LTCB) in the autumn of 1998. With assets of about $240 billion, this was among the world's biggest banks. As Ms Tett recounts, everything was done to prevent the problems coming to light, including dropping boxes of papers down manholes in the basement when inspectors called--not that the regulators wanted to find too much.
By the time of the collapse of LTCB, the scale of Japan's banking crisis had finally sunk in. Japan strengthened the system for deposit insurance. Public funds boosted the capital of the biggest banks and a newly created independent regulator, since renamed the Financial Services Agency, set out to break the cosy ties between banks and their former regulator, the finance ministry. In 1999 another injection of public money encouraged nine of the country's biggest banks to merge into four ""megabanks"", which have since consolidated further into three.
This fresh start for the banking system should have been a fresh start for the economy, too. But the recovery never happened. In 2001, with recession again threatening, Junichiro Koizumi became prime minister on a reformist ticket. The following year fears of another crisis grew.

WITH his only viable potential challenger suddenly dropping out of contention late last week, Shinzo Abe, the chief cabinet secretary, looks all but certain to lead his party, and thus the country, from September. That is when Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, retires from front-line politics.
For the past few months, Yasuo Fukuda, a Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) stalwart, the son of a late prime minister and a former chief cabinet secretary himself, had dropped hints about contesting the LDP's presidential election on September 20th. Mr Fukuda judges Mr Abe a policy lightweight, too trusting in small government. He decries the hawkishness in Japan's international relations that Mr Koizumi has propounded and Mr Abe has amplified, especially the visits that both men make to the Yasukuni shrine (above), which enshrines alongside Japan's fallen servicemen 14 wartime figures who were executed for crimes against humanity.
Mr Fukuda, though, has his own shortcomings. At 70, he is not sprightly and, remarkably for a politician, is diffident in public. Still, he had become the focus for the party's disaffected: those in despair at Japan's strained ties with its neighbours, particularly China and South Korea; party veterans alarmed at being frozen out by Mr Abe (who at 51 is from a younger generation), just as they were by Mr Koizumi; and other assorted enemies of the prime minister, Mr Abe's undeclared mentor.
Yet as hopes in Mr Fukuda grew, so did his prevarication. The issue of Yasukuni, which he himself had highlighted, might, Mr Fukuda seems finally to have concluded, give Japan's neighbours too great a sense of a government divided. Mr Fukuda also doubted, says Takao Toshikawa of Tokyo Insideline, a newsletter, whether he had the gumption for the job.
In the end, support for Mr Fukuda ebbed, even within in his own faction. North Korea's provocation by loosing off ballistic missiles on July 5th did no favours for Mr Fukuda's doveish line on foreign policy, says Koichi Kato, a Fukuda supporter who himself led a (disastrous) challenge to the party establishment back in 2000. On July 21st, Mr Fukuda withdrew the challenge that he had not properly thrown down, summing up a political career that never quite lived up to its promise.
In theory, other candidates for the LDP presidency remain, notably Taro Aso, the foreign minister, and Sadakazu Tanigaki, the finance minister. Neither is seriously in contention. So speculation turns to the kind of administration Mr Abe will lead. He has neither Mr Koizumi's force of character, nor his iconoclasm. His government is likely to be a more inclusive one, with nods to the party's older barons, as well as room found for bright young things.
The style of Mr Abe's government will differ from Mr Koizumi's, but its substance may not. For if his grasp of policy is weak, Mr Abe is surrounding himself with advisers who favour smaller government and market-based reforms. In particular, his most vigorous supporter is Hidenao Nakagawa, who exercises immense power as head of the LDP's policy-research council. Along with Heizo Takenaka, the interior minister, Mr Nakagawa has been the architect of Mr Koizumi's domestic policy. Mr Nakagawa will probably keep his post, even if the future of Mr Takenaka, unpopular even among reformers and with no real political base of his own, is less certain.
Whatever the make-up of the next government, a recent signal from the political establishment suggests a new commitment to bring the state's finances under control. After years of spending through the country's long slump, the ratio of gross government debt to GDP stands at 170%, while the budget deficit, though well down from its peak, is over 6% of GDP. 
On July 7th a fiscal plan for the next decade was agreed not just by Mr Koizumi's government but by the ruling party itself. By promising to get the budget back in surplus on a ""primary"" basis (ie, excluding interest payments) by 2011, the blueprint acknowledged that by then an annual yen16.5 trillion ($140 billion) would have to be found, for which spending cuts would make up 70-80%, with tax increases making up the rest. Remarkably, specific cuts were targeted in government programmes. Spending on public works, which has already fallen for six years, will be squeezed further. The government will also be shrunk.
What is more, the plan committed Japan for the first time to a budget surplus even after interest payments, by around 2015; after that, the debt-GDP ratio should start falling. These plans call for a fundamental debate about tax reform, beyond the narrow perennial issue of when to raise the consumption tax, and by how much. For now, a recovering economy is throwing out unexpectedly strong tax revenues, and some of the worst fears about the need for a sharp hike in the consumption tax are fading. Still, the blueprint suggests that sound public finances will be the next government's chief preoccupation.
As for foreign policy, the hawkish Mr Abe may yet produce surprises, thanks perhaps to the late Showa emperor, known before his death as Hirohito. Last week the old diaries of a former head of the Imperial Household Agency were leaked. In them, private conversations with the emperor are recorded, in which he purportedly affirmed that he had stopped visiting Yasukuni because of the war criminals enshrined there in 1978.
The leak gives Mr Abe a chance to draw Yasukuni's sting. On August 15th, the anniversary of Japan's surrender and around the time he is expected formally to announce his candidacy, he usually visits Yasukuni. Should he decline to go this year, claiming deference to the late emperor, he will send a powerful conciliatory message to Japan's neighbours--and to those who oppose him in his party. Should he visit, though, Mr Abe will have proved himself even more cussed than Mr Koizumi.","A post - Junichiro Koizumi world comes into focus as the list of rivals shortens

 In theory , other candidates for the LDP presidency remain , notably Taro Aso , the foreign minister , and Sadakazu Tanigaki , the finance minister . Neither is seriously in contention . So speculation turns to the kind of administration Mr Abe will lead . He has neither Junichiro Koizumi's force of character , nor Junichiro Koizumi's iconoclasm . His government is likely to be a more inclusive one , with nods to the party 's older barons , as well as room found for bright young things . 
 The style of Mr Abe 's government will differ from Junichiro Koizumi's , but its substance may not . For if his grasp of policy is weak , Mr Abe is surrounding himself with advisers who favour smaller government and market - based reforms . In particular , his most vigorous supporter is Hidenao Nakagawa , who exercises immense power as head of the LDP 's policy - research council . Along with Heizo Takenaka , the interior minister , Mr Nakagawa has been the architect of Junichiro Koizumi's domestic policy . Mr Nakagawa will probably keep his post , even if the future of Mr Takenaka , unpopular even among reformers and with no real political base of his own , is less certain . 
 Whatever the make - up of the next government , a recent signal from the political establishment suggests a new commitment to bring the state 's finances under control . After years of spending through the country 's long slump , the ratio of gross government debt to GDP stands at 170 % , while the budget deficit , though well down from its peak , is over 6 % of GDP . 
 On July 7th a fiscal plan for the next decade was agreed not just by Junichiro Koizumi's government but by the ruling party itself . By promising to get the budget back in surplus on a "" primary "" basis ( ie , excluding interest payments ) by 2011 , the blueprint acknowledged that by then an annual yen16.5 trillion ( $ 140 billion ) would have to be found , for which spending cuts would make up 70 - 80 % , with tax increases making up the rest . Remarkably , specific cuts were targeted in government programmes . Spending on public works , which has already fallen for six years , will be squeezed further . The government will also be shrunk . 
 What is more , the plan committed Japan for the first time to a budget surplus even after interest payments , by around 2015 ; after that , the debt - GDP ratio should start falling . These plans call for a fundamental debate about tax reform , beyond the narrow perennial issue of when to raise the consumption tax , and by how much . For now , a recovering economy is throwing out unexpectedly strong tax revenues , and some of the worst fears about the need for a sharp hike in the consumption tax are fading . Still , the blueprint suggests that sound public finances will be the next government 's chief preoccupation . 
 As for foreign policy , the hawkish Mr Abe may yet produce surprises , thanks perhaps to the late Showa emperor , known before his death as Hirohito . Last week the old diaries of a former head of the Imperial Household Agency were leaked . In them , private conversations with the emperor are recorded , in which he purportedly affirmed that he had stopped visiting Yasukuni because of the war criminals enshrined there in 1978 . 
 The leak gives Mr Abe a chance to draw Yasukuni 's sting . On August 15th , the anniversary of Japan 's surrender and around the time he is expected formally to announce his candidacy , he usually visits Yasukuni . Should he decline to go this year , claiming deference to the late emperor , he will send a powerful conciliatory message to Japan 's neighbours -- and to those who oppose him in his party . Should he visit , though , Mr Abe will have proved himself even more cussed than Junichiro Koizumi .",740,Japan,A29-8209,IN TERM,True,Koizumi,11,True

A ceasefire took hold between Hizbullah and Israel after a month of fighting. Negotiations continued at the UN on the size and mandate of a peacekeeping force for south Lebanon. Lebanon began sending troops into the south, but said they would not disarm Hizbullah fighters. As Iran hailed a ""divine victory"", Israelis criticised their government's handling of the war. 
At least 57 people died in a series of blasts in Baghdad (which the Americans attributed to an accidental gas explosion) and nine were killed in an attack on the offices of an Iraqi Kurdish party in the northern town of Mosul. America assigned still more troops to Baghdad to try to contain the sectarian violence. 
Islamist militiamen extended their hold over Somalia by capturing three ports close to the northern region of Puntland, where the administration is hostile to their advance. The internationally recognised transitional government remains holed up in the central town of Baidoa.
The Nigerian president, Olusegun Obasanjo, promised to increase security in the Niger Delta region after the kidnapping of five separate groups of foreign oil workers by militants in recent weeks. Ransoms paid by oil companies for the release of their workers have increased the militants' boldness. 
India stepped up its competition with China for Africa's energy and commodity reserves by unveiling a blueprint to invest $1 billion to develop oil and mining projects in Cote d'Ivoire.
Ethiopia appealed for international help as the death toll from recent flooding rose to 870. Officials are concerned that after a month of storms the country's dams are holding so much water that it could spill on to surrounding towns and villages.
Power grab
California's legislature abandoned a plan to redraw political districts and increase term limits for politicians in the state. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has been pushing the body to introduce changes to the electoral system after his much wider-ranging reform package was defeated at the polls. 
The Census Bureau released a snapshot of the United States' population at mid-decade. Among other things, America's foreign-born population increased to 12.4% in 2005 (from 11.1% in 2000), accounting for around 40% of the population of Los Angeles. 
Provoking
Junichiro Koizumi, the outgoing prime minister of Japan, paid a sixth visit to the controversial Yasukuni shrine, which counts convicted war criminals among the dead soldiers it honours. Mr Koizumi's excursion further angered China and South Korea, especially as it came on the anniversary of Japan's defeat in the second world war. Polls show that most Japanese no longer favour such visits.
An aid organisation based in Seoul claimed that last month's floods in North Korea left almost 55,000 people either dead or missing and 2.5m homeless. Good Friends said the North Korean government is trying to suppress news about the disaster for fear of stirring social unrest. 
The death toll from the worst typhoon to hit China in 50 years reached at least 320. Wind speeds in the storm, which was centred on the south-eastern province of Fujian, hit 216kph (134mph). 
Fighting between Sri Lankan troops and Tamil rebels continued in the north of the country. Schools were closed across Sri Lanka amid fear of rebel reprisals in revenge for an air strike on what the rebels claim was an orphanage in Tamil territory. 
Unravelling the plot
British police continued to question 23 suspects still held in connection with an alleged terror plot to blow up as many as ten planes flying from Britain to America. Pakistani authorities reportedly held another 17 people. Flights at British airports started to return to normal, although increased security measures, such as smaller carry-on bags, seem likely to stay in place. Some airlines claimed Heathrow was unprepared. 
Ukraine's new prime minister, Viktor Yanukovich, visited Russia for talks with his opposite number, Mikhail Fradkov, and Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, who strongly backed Mr Yanukovich's bid for Ukraine's presidency in 2004. Mr Yanukovich, who is seen as pro-Russian, said he had secured a favourable deal from the Russians on the price of gas exports.
The United Nations chose a new representative to run Kosovo. Joachim Rucker, a German diplomat, will take over from Denmark's Soren Jessen-Petersen. Talks on Kosovo's future remain deadlocked.
The Czech Republic may at last acquire a new government, with Mirek Topolanek, leader of the right-wing Civic Democrats, as prime minister. The breakthrough came after a deal on the election of a parliamentary speaker. But Mr Topolanek will, at best, lead a minority government that is unlikely to last long.
Gunter Grass, a German novelist, admitted that he had served in the Waffen-SS during the second world war. The shock of the news was greater because Mr Grass has long acted as the conscience of the nation over war guilt.
Holding on
In Cuba, the authorities released photos and a video of Fidel Castro on his sick bed after an operation for severe intestinal bleeding. The pictures suggested that Mr Castro was recovering but that he remains seriously ill.
A recount of 9% of the votes in last month's presidential election in Mexico ordered by the electoral tribunal was completed. The tribunal did not immediately release the result, but the party of Felipe Calderon, the conservative candidate who won by 244,000 votes out of 42m, said the recount only altered 1,500 votes. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the leftist challenger, claimed the recount showed evidence of massive fraud.
Bolivia's government said it was temporarily suspending its nationalisation of the oil and gas industry because the state oil company lacks the funds and technical capacity to take over production from foreign firms.

WHEN he was running for office in 2001, Junichiro Koizumi, Japan's prime minister, promised to visit Tokyo's Yasukuni shrine every year and to do so on August 15th, the anniversary of the emperor's admission that Japan had lost the war. Mr Koizumi always kept the first part of his promise, but only this week fulfilled the second. In formal morning coat and preceded by a Shinto priest, he spent only ten minutes at the shrine. Yet his visit brought roars of ""banzai"" from the crowd and a storm of disapproval from neighbouring countries.
The shrine is a memorial to 2.5m Japanese war dead, but also the focus for unrepentant militarism. Fourteen top war criminals were secretly enshrined in 1978. A connected museum paints Japan in its wars of 1937-45 as the liberator of Asia, a victim of Western belligerency. Meanwhile, August 15th at Yasukuni is a Bartholomew Fair of thugs, fantasists in military garb, deniers of atrocities and xenophobes peddling conspiracy theories. In previous years Mr Koizumi chose less symbolic dates, emphasising the private nature of his visit. This week it could not have been plainer that he came as prime minister, the first to visit on August 15th in two decades.
Mr Koizumi is no diehard imperialist. He sees the war dead as victims of Japan's own militarism. He does not honour the criminals and has no truck with the museum. His backers say that his statements on these matters are rarely picked up by local critics or by China, which inveighs against him for manipulating history. Besides, they always say, for real abuse why not single out China itself? It uses the past to stoke anti-Japan hatred as a useful tool at home. True, but hardly to the point. Mr Koizumi's feat is to have let a Communist dictatorship wrest the high ground from a pacifist democracy.
The consequences extend beyond the refusal by China and South Korea to hold summit meetings with Mr Koizumi. They make territorial disputes harder to settle and lie at the root of regional opposition to Japan's attempts to gain a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. Mr Koizumi's visits, in short, have undermined his own vision of making Japan more ""normal""--that is, ensuring for it a muscular presence in international affairs commensurate with its huge economy.
Will Mr Koizumi's presumed successor, Shinzo Abe, be any wiser? The chief cabinet secretary has impeccable nationalist credentials, so might be expected to compound the mess. On the other hand, only a right-winger has the authority to draw Yasukuni's sting. And for the first time, polls suggest a majority of Japanese are against their leaders' shrine visits. 
It is not just a matter of avoiding a needless provocation; Mr Abe should kickstart a long-overdue national debate about Japan's wartime responsibility. Somehow, the war criminals enshrined at Yasukuni will have to be removed, even though the shrine has private status. One idea is to turn it into a secular institution, where national leaders, the imperial family and even Chinese dignitaries could pay their respects.
Would China respond? Its leader, Hu Jintao, has also come in for criticism. Instead of harping on about atrocities in the first half of the 20th century, some thoughtful Chinese say, he should emphasise the second half, when Japan was a source of regional stability and a force in China's own modernisation. Japan's desire for ""normalisation"" aims only to build on those benign influences. The trouble is that, with no consensus about the past, Japan's establishment is inept at articulating a better future. That future should start at Yasukuni.","Japan must face up to the past , if it wants to lead in the future

IN THE hamlet of Ogama, a scattering of traditional wooden houses in a steep-sided valley just a ridge away from the Sea of Japan, the forest is claiming back land that had been cleared generations ago for rice and vegetables. By her small patch of mountain potatoes, 71-year-old Setsu Yachida sits down to rub her arthritic hands. Quite frankly, she says, she's lonely. Her husband is dead. Two elderly neighbours she had nursed have also died, and now she lives on her own a long way from the hamlet's few other members. Her children, town-dwellers, beg her to spend a night or two with them, but she refuses, because she would only feel more lonely when she came back. No, she says, she is going to wait for that day, in a couple of years' time, when the whole hamlet moves--lock, stock and ancestral graves--out of the valley for good. No need ever to come back then.
Over the next half century, demographers expect Japan's population to fall to from 128m to 100m. The process began last year, the first peacetime fall in population since records were kept. Yet in the countryside numbers have been falling for decades--and rural Japan will bear a disproportionate share of the future reduction in population. Already, more than two out of five people living in rural communities are 65 or over. Japan's farmers are the world's oldest. Though the absolute number of elderly farmers, at just under 2m, has not changed much since the second world war, the number of younger farmers has plummeted. In 1970 82% of farmers were under 65, last year only 42%. In Ogama the number of households has shrunk from 17 to six in roughly a generation, the population going from over 50 to just three men and six women. 
In Europe and America farmers have a reputation for rugged independence. In Japan farming is sustained by collective effort. Because farms are smaller and more densely packed, irrigation ditches, flood protection, roads and indeed sanitation must be dealt with communally. Mutual duties extend to funeral arrangements. So when strapping sons leave for better-paying jobs in the city, the whole community feels the cumulative effects.
The head of Ogama hamlet is Kazuo Miyasaka, a retired seaman. He says he saw the coming extinction of the place a decade ago and started thinking then about how he and his neighbours might improve their lot. One idea was a golf course, but the valley is too mountainous. After much searching, he was introduced to an industrial-waste company in Tokyo. Mr Miyasaka asked the company whether it would like to use the valley for landfill, if the landowners agreed to move out.
Mrs Yachida and most other residents agreed quite readily. Mr Miyasaka's proposal was for everyone to move together to the edge of Monzen, an agricultural town 25 minutes' drive away with shops and a hospital. By this spring, Mr Miyasaka had brought the several absent landowners round, with canny charm. (He replaced Ogama's tumbledown temple with a new one in the proposed new settlement, reassuring elderly widows that the family graves would not be so much moved as reunited.) Residents say they will get more than enough to build a new house and to pay hospital bills. If the Ishikawa prefectural government gives the nod, this impossibly beautiful valley--a rare glimpse of a lost Japan--will be buried under 150 metres of industrial ash, and Ogama will be the first Japanese community to have voted itself out of existence.
Ogama may be unique. But the trend for rural communities to seek income wherever it can be found, whether from high-security prisons or nuclear-power plants, is likely only to intensify. Under the premiership of Junichiro Koizumi, Japan has slashed local-government remittances and spending on the kinds of public works that used to bring money to the countryside. A decentralisation drive under Heizo Takenaka, the interior minister, is encouraging mergers among municipalities in need of a more secure tax base. In February Monzen, whose population has fallen to 8,000 from 19,000 in the 1950s, merged with nearby Wajima, a larger and more prosperous place by the sea.
Yet some municipalities are in so bad a state that no neighbour would dream of an alliance with them. Half a century ago Yubari, on the northern island of Hokkaido, was a coal-mining town with more than 100,000 people. The last of its mines shut in 1990. Today a population of 13,000 is strung out along the long road up the valley to the old mines at the top. Under its previous mayor Yubari reinvented itself as a tourist spot. It built a theme park in an old mine. An annual international film festival so impressed Quentin Tarantino that the American director named a character after the town. She was Gogo Yubari, a sociopathic schoolgirl. 
Yubari melons, promoted assiduously by its mayor, have gained fame in Japan chiefly for their price--a pair sold this year for yen800,000 ($7,200). But all the promotion cost money. Last month Yubari became the first municipality in 14 years in effect to declare bankruptcy, admitting that it had accumulated yen63 billion in hidden debts, 14 times annual tax revenues. Mr Takenaka says that a new framework for local governments is needed to allow debts such as Yubari's to be forgiven. But it would also have to discourage lending to poorly run localities.
Whether such discipline will actually help depressed rural areas is another matter. As Mr Takenaka himself admits, though parts of the countryside are doing very well--especially bits near big cities, where small-scale farming can even be a part-time occupation-- ""the bad parts are very, very bad"". There is sometimes hope that salarymen will leave the city to reclaim and farm their family land. About 80,000 city-bred types made their way into the countryside last year, though one local official says they rarely put much investment into the land, treating it more as a hobby--and their children rarely follow. When asked, country people tend to say that city folk have forgotten about them.","It's an old folks' home out there

THE news on September 6th that a baby boy had been born into Japan's imperial household for the first time in over 40 years was greeted with relief by a government that had just avoided a constitutional crisis--and with joy by demographers and shopkeepers. The Dai-Ichi Life Institute predicts a mini baby-boom that will produce a bumper crop of potential wives for the little chap, and a welcome yen150 billion ($1.3 billion) boost to the economy.
The as yet unnamed boy, born to Princess Kiko, wife of Emperor Akihito's second son, is third in line to the throne, after the crown prince, 46-year-old Naruhito, and his own father, Prince Akishino, Naruhito's younger brother. The Chrysanthemum Throne is remarkable on several counts. Not only, at 2,600 years, is Japan's easily the world's oldest monarchy, but it also boasts an unbroken male lineage (though eight women have over time stood in as caretaker empresses). What is more, historians of the Imperial Household Agency (IHA) can affirm, the lineage is descended from Amaterasu, the sun goddess born not by Caesarean section, as was the latest little tyke, but from an eye of the god Izanagi.
Yet the boy can expect little of the fun--snowboarding at Verbier, lines of cocaine, teenage romps with first cousins--enjoyed by European royals. The imperial family's treatment would anywhere else count as cruel and unusual punishment. The impenetrable IHA has almost absolute power over the imperial family. The 42-year-old crown princess, Masako, educated at Harvard and Oxford and formerly a high-flyer at the Foreign Ministry, was confined like a factory-farmed animal, forbidden from taking foreign trips with her husband lest this get in the way of reproduction. Though she gave birth to a girl, now four, the pressure from the IHA to produce a male heir contributed to a nervous breakdown, from which she has not fully recovered. Strains between her husband and Prince Akishino seemed to have arisen when Prince Naruhito hinted in public at his anger with the IHA. In other words, Princess Kiko, who is 39, with daughters who are 14 and 11, may have felt pressure to lie back and think of Japan. At any rate, the IHA took no risks; she was whisked to hospital three weeks before the child was due.
The birth comes as a relief to Shinzo Abe, who is expected to take over from Junichiro Koizumi as prime minister at the end of this month. Earlier this year Mr Abe, as the government's chief cabinet secretary, pushed through a bill that allowed for female succession. Though championed by Mr Koizumi, it was anathema to Mr Abe, whose conservative credentials risked being undermined. But then news of Princess Kiko's pregnancy leaked out, and the bill was hurriedly shelved, at least for now.

IT HAS been a thrilling show, but now it is over. On September 20th Japan's Liberal Democratic Party will elect a new leader to replace Junichiro Koizumi, who will formally stand down as prime minister at the end of the month. He is leaving, undefeated at the polls and still popular after five and a half years in the job, only because of term limits imposed by his own party's constitution. But in that brief time he has done more to ""change the LDP, change Japan"", to quote his best slogan, than any politician of his generation. 
Mr Koizumi's achievement is threefold (see page 75). First, he has changed the way politics is carried out in a country that used in effect to be a secretive one-party state, whose leaders emerged from obscure battles between factions convening in smoke- and sake-filled rooms far away from voters' eyes. Mr Koizumi, a rank underdog, snatched the leadership in 2001 only after a huge popular vote from party members forced the hands of the party bosses. He went on to win four elections by appealing, in a way that no Japanese politician had ever even attempted, directly to the electorate. His shaggy hair and natural charisma were refreshing in a party best known for conformity. Most startling of all for Japan, he favoured making big economic reforms. 
Those reforms, the second component of his achievement, have probably been a disappointment to him. Stubbornly resisted by his own party, they have been delayed and partial--most notoriously in the case of the privatisation of Japan's postal savings system, which has too often been a way for politicians to direct citizens' savings to favoured contractors. But at least Mr Koizumi began the work of breaking up the ""iron triangle""--big business, bureaucracy, LDP--making government a bit more accountable, reining in profligate and inefficient spending and in the process starting to tackle Japan's mountainous public-sector debt. 
Partially successful, too, has been Mr Koizumi's quest to let Japan start to play the part it deserves in foreign affairs, his third claim to a place in history. He sent peacekeepers to Iraq, the boldest venture by Japanese troops for half a century, and has worked hard with America to make Japan depend less on America's military umbrella and shoulder more of the burden of its own defence. But he has not succeeded at what ought to have been his priority: the rewriting of Japan's constitution, which renounces war, to assert Japan's right to participate in collective security. At present Japan's peacekeepers are highly constrained, and cannot legally use their firepower to help defend foreign civilians or assist their allies.
A qualified record then, but the point of Mr Koizumi's stint in office is that he has for the first time challenged the comfortable assumptions that have governed Japan since the war. He has attacked entrenched power: of the LDP's own party bosses, of the bureaucrats, and of the victors of 1945, who imposed pacifism on Japan. The big question, however, is whether any of this has changed for good. Perhaps Mr Koizumi is just a latter-day version of the Meiji emperor who, in the late 1860s, wrested power from the shoguns (feudal lords who had usurped it) and set Japan on the path of modernisation. The ""Meiji restoration"" did not last long: a new band of oligarchs and militarists swiftly gathered real power back. 
In the case of China, proceed with caution
Mr Koizumi's successor, it now seems certain, will be Shinzo Abe, currently Japan's chief cabinet secretary. Like Mr Koizumi before him, he is more or less untested and, at 51, relatively young. But he shows little sign of being an iconoclast. Though Mr Abe is a protege of Mr Koizumi's, and is generally numbered in the reformist camp, he has not been one of its truly courageous battlers. Nor does he have much of Mr Koizumi's charisma. The danger therefore exists that he will be able neither to enthuse Japan's voters in the way Mr Koizumi did, nor use personal popularity to force his still-reluctant party further down the road of reform. 
One area where Mr Abe's reforming zeal may exceed Mr Koizumi's is in international relations. He has already committed himself to rewriting the constitution. But the trick is to do this without sending Japan's relations with China into a tailspin. Japan and China are each other's biggest trading partners, and under Mr Koizumi relations have been bad--in part because of Mr Koizumi's provocative habit of visiting the controversial Yasukuni shrine, and in part because China detests Japan's ambition to play a bigger role. Mr Abe is a hawk who entertains dark suspicions about China. He has also been a regular visitor to Yasukuni. If he stays away from the shrine and makes an early fence-mending mission to China, he could do much for Japan's standing in the world. If not, he risks squandering the legacy of a remarkable prime minister.","Junichiro Koizumi's is about to stand down . Will Junichiro Koizumi's revolution last ?

THE 64-year-old who retires as Japan's prime minister on September 30th has earned a reputation as the reformer of the unreformable. During his tenure Japan's governing apparatus has been transformed, its economy has emerged from long years of degenerative decline, and its dealings with the world have been energised and emboldened. For all that, Junichiro Koizumi remains an enigma.
His triumphs derive from the wars he has waged against the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP); yet, as the heir to a political dynasty, he built his career at the heart of that party. He used his personal popularity to trump the faction system that had hitherto controlled Japan's prime ministers; yet for all his charm he is a loner, dining for preference by himself. He has yearned to raise Japan's standing in the world; yet he has persisted in making annual visits to the Yasukuni shrine where the souls of Japan's war dead are venerated, and that has destroyed much of Japan's standing with its neighbours. 
When Mr Koizumi won the party presidency, and thus the prime ministership, in April 2001, the LDP had ruled for all but 11 months of the previous 46 years. Or, rather, it had shared power with the heads of big business and the bureaucrats at the main ministries. This ""iron triangle"" had cosseted business, channelling money into industries that, as part of the bargain, guaranteed a lifetime's work and a comfortable retirement for their employees. And Japan thrived. Indeed, in the four decades after the second world war it was the world's greatest success story.
But the success was not everlasting. By the time Mr Koizumi came to office, scandals, corruption and a lack of accountability had thoroughly discredited a system hijacked by interest-groups, the LDP prominent among them. Factions within the party were vehicles for political patronage, and they had enfeebled successive governments, most of them led by antique prime ministers who would serve a brief and ineffectual term. The system had proved incapable of dealing with the slump that followed the property and stockmarket collapse of 1990, leaving Japan's banks with piles of bad loans.
Successive governments had responded by ramping up the spending on public works. That may have staved off a more vicious deflation, but the spending was adding alarmingly to the country's public debt, just as Japan's population was starting to shrink, and so too its tax revenues. Making matters worse, the public-works spending that was smothering the country in concrete merely reinforced the unsavoury links between the LDP's hacks and their supporters in the construction industries. At the same time it entrenched the powers of the bureaucracy, making change even harder.
The system's inadequacy at home was matched by a feebleness abroad. After Japan's defeat in the second world war, America foisted on it a pacifist constitution that limited its forces to the role of self-defence and forbade it to send them abroad. Though the definition of ""self-defence"" had been gradually stretched, Japan seemed unable to shoulder international responsibilities except through its generous aid budget, or even to protect its own direct interests.
All in all, Japan was in a sorry state in 2001. The post-war success story had become a wretched tale featuring a ""lost decade"" for the economy, years of falling prices, insolvent banks, corrupt politics at home, disrespect and ingratitude abroad. 
Enter the Lionheart
Bidding for the party leadership in 2001, Mr Koizumi came with a reputation for pushing change. He was a critic of the faction system, and obsessed with the need to break up the post-office savings system. But he faced Ryutaro Hashimoto, who had served once already as prime minister and who headed the LDP's most powerful and conservative faction. Mr Hashimoto looked a shoo-in.
Mr Koizumi whipped him, however, by using a mastery of television and the popular press to make a direct appeal to the grassroots. It had never happened before. The elders abhorred Mr Koizumi's calls for painful change (""Reform with no sacred cows"") and his attacks upon the party (""Change the LDP, change Japan""). His directness, his wavy-maned flamboyance and his use of the modern media seemed like a running insult to their way of doing things. Soon, though, it was clear that the Koizumi phenomenon was also good for the party. In the elections for the upper house in July 2001, the LDP had its best result in a decade. 
By Japan's standards, the prime minister's agenda was radical. Within the government, cabinet posts were to be allocated by merit and no longer by faction. Spending on public works was to be slashed, and government borrowing capped. The highway corporation, a great source of pork-barrel spending, was to be broken up. Local governments were to be given more power, but also more responsibility. As for the banks, they would have to acknowledge the full extent of their bad loans and then sort them out to get the economy going again.
Above all, Mr Koizumi was going to privatise Japan Post. This ambition--once shared by his grandfather, who had been postal minister--may seem curious. Yet as well as delivering the mail, Japan's postal system is also the world's biggest bank, with yen320 trillion ($2.8 trillion) in savings and life-insurance accounts funnelled towards favoured public-works projects and a collection of public financial bodies and their clients. Like the highway agency, it lay at the heart of the dismal relationship between Japan's politicians, bureaucrats and interest-groups. To break it up would do much for the distortions running through the economy. The public to whom Mr Koizumi appealed seemed to understand his mission.
From the start, though, Mr Koizumi met resistance. The road-building lobby and backers within the LDP stymied change, restoring highway projects that had been axed. Attempts to privatise the postal system fared no better. Worse, too little was being done about the banks' bad loans, and the stockmarket was becoming alarmed. The further the stockmarket fell, the greater the threat of insolvency to the banks, which treated the value of their shareholdings as capital. As a sense of crisis grew in 2001-02, Mr Koizumi looked like yet another in the line of leaders who had delivered little.
A change in fortune came in 2003. That year Heizo Takenaka, an economist brought in by Mr Koizumi to mastermind domestic reforms, made progress with the banks. He toughened their supervision and forced them and their regulators to face up to their parlous state. At last, a vehicle was created to take on banks' bad loans. The stockmarket turned.
In the autumn of 2003 Mr Koizumi crushed a challenge to his party leadership and won a general election handsomely enough, despite the revival of the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ). A new cabinet appeared to give a sense of purpose. Much of Mr Koizumi's first cabinet had been inherited. However, his second was of his own making. Out went the 81-year-old finance minister and in came a number of young reformists, such as Nobuteru Ishihara, who took charge of the notorious land and transport ministry. Shinzo Abe, an ally, was made the party's secretary-general.
A brighter economy
The recovery that had begun tentatively in 2002 looked more assured as firms began investing again. As companies' profits revived, the banks' bad loans began to fall. Having stood at over 8% of GDP at their nadir in March 2002, they are under 2% today--a drop, says Mr Takenaka, that he had expected to take ten years. The biggest banks have repaid public money. They are starting once more to provide credit to the economy and thus lay the foundation for future growth. It is one of the main accomplishments of the Koizumi era.
In other endeavours, though, Mr Koizumi's government struggled. Hardened operators quickly outmanoeuvred the neophytes brought in to push through privatisation--Naoki Inose, a writer, for the highway corporation, and Mr Takenaka for the post office. Bold proposals were diluted. Though agreement was reached for the highway agency to be split into six, it was to remain in public ownership. As for Japan Post, rather than abolishing its savings and insurance functions altogether, they would continue as separate operations, and privatisation would be deferred to 2017. And despite these large concessions, in August 2005, after a nasty fight, the parliament's upper house narrowly voted the postal plan down.
It was a defining moment, one that Mr Koizumi greeted with relish. He called a snap general election. The DPJ was on the run: though reformist, it had chosen--disastrously as it turned out--to oppose postal privatisation on tactical grounds. But the election was a challenge to the old guard in the LDP too. Mr Koizumi expelled 37 lower-house rebels who had voted against privatisation, and put up allies to run against them. The fight, he told the country, was about a single issue of reform: privatising the post office. The two-thirds majority returned for the LDP and its ruling coalition vindicated him.
His authority now unchallenged, the postal and highway bills quickly sailed through the new parliament. Even if the post office is not yet privatised, says Yasuhisa Shiozaki, a deputy foreign minister and rising star, Mr Koizumi has at a stroke destroyed the country's most powerful political machine, and put an end to pork-barrel politics. He also moved to ""normalise"" foreign and security policy, challenging the limits placed on Japan by its post-war pacifist constitution by sending refuelling tankers to the Indian Ocean and troops to Iraq. He riled China and South Korea by visiting Tokyo's Yasukuni shrine, where among the millions of Japanese war dead who are commemorated are the souls of a number of war criminals.
Yet a new enigma emerged. Although the election had put reform at the centre of politics, and although Mr Koizumi was at the top of his form, he swiftly lost interest in fresh fights, say his colleagues. Early this year the committee he had put in charge of road reform voted to build 9,000km (5,600 miles) of expressways that had first been proposed in the late 1990s. The total cost to the taxpayer will be yen3 trillion. But barely a squeak came from the prime minister. 
Mr Koizumi must step down as party president this month, and so as prime minister. He could, if he chose, exert influence behind the scenes, yet recent behaviour suggests that he will not. Mr Koizumi spent much of the summer on swansong trips abroad, including one to Graceland, with President George Bush. Mr Koizumi says he intends to devote himself to music and the pleasures of the table--not to mention a private life again--and there is every reason to believe him.
The king is dead, long live the king
So will Mr Koizumi's reforming zeal outlast him? It is a mark of change that his successor is presumed to be Shinzo Abe, a man of only 51 years. He is likely to prevail as the next leader of the LDP in the vote on September 20th. Now chief cabinet secretary, he is a Koizumi protege. Most of his main allies--Hidenao Nakagawa, head of the party's policy-research council, Mr Shiozaki, Mr Ishihara, Taro Aso, the foreign minister, and Kaoru Yosano, the economy minister--have played reforming parts during the Koizumi era. 
Mr Abe says he is committed to further deregulation to promote growth. But some foresee a difficulty. Though telegenic, Mr Abe lacks Mr Koizumi's charisma and authority. He will need co-operation within the party to build a governing consensus, or else risk a party revolt. From the outside, says Gerald Curtis, of America's Columbia University, the procedure will look a lot like the backroom politicking that the voters now abhor. It makes reform uncertain.
A brighter view is possible, one that sets Mr Koizumi's reforms in the context of other changes that have been made to the way Japan is governed. The abolition of multi-member constituencies in the mid-1990s and the introduction of public financing of political parties have, for instance, hastened the decline of money politics and factions. Mr Abe himself is leaving his faction, as Mr Koizumi did--an inconceivable move when faction bosses were kingmakers not long ago.
Another change is the way authority has accrued to the prime minister's office within government, and to the secretary-general within the ruling party, a position now in the gift of the prime minister. It means, first, that political advancement hangs more on showing loyalty to the leadership than to your faction. Crucially, it encourages party and government to agree on policy. For example, agreement was reached in July on a fiscal blueprint that is meant to set the country's finances to rights. The plan envisages swingeing spending cuts of up to yen13 trillion a year by 2011. ""No matter what,"" says Mr Nakagawa, the powerful head of the policy-research council, ""we're going to incorporate that July decision in every budget."" Mr Nakagawa insists that reform now flows rudely through the party's veins. 
As for foreign policy, Mr Abe's backers say that the new confidence fostered by Mr Koizumi is here to stay, and that Mr Abe will make a better fist of explaining it to Japan's neighbours. Mr Abe, though like Mr Koizumi a regular visitor to the Yasukuni shrine, and an advocate of a stronger national security, nonetheless appears to think about foreign policy in a more rational way than the strangely emotional Mr Koizumi. Mr Shiozaki says that Mr Abe knows that going to Yasukuni as Mr Koizumi has done would only deepen the mess with Japan's neighbours. This past weekend Japan's deputy foreign minister has been in the capitals of South Korea and China, part of a sudden flurry of diplomatic activity among the three countries. Takao Toshikawa, editor of Tokyo Insideline, a newsletter, predicts that Mr Abe, immediately after becoming prime minister, will break the ice with a visit to Beijing to meet President Hu Jintao.
Mr Abe, carrying forward the Koizumi revolution, may yet prove short-lived as prime minister. He would, for instance, be unlikely to survive an LDP defeat in next July's upper-house elections, which already causes the party concern. Yet if the DPJ won, it would be on a reform ticket: the opposition will not repeat the mistake of opposing change. In other words, even in an LDP defeat, Mr Koizumi's useful legacy will still be discerned.

 Junichiro Koizumi's has earned a reputation as the reformer of the unreformable . During Junichiro Koizumi's tenure Japan 's governing apparatus has been transformed , its economy has emerged from long years of degenerative decline , and its dealings with the world have been energised and emboldened . For all that , Junichiro Koizumi remains an enigma . 
 Junichiro Koizumi's triumphs derive from the wars Junichiro Koizumi has waged against the ruling Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) ; yet , as the heir to a political dynasty , Junichiro Koizumi built Junichiro Koizumi's career at the heart of that party . Junichiro Koizumi used Junichiro Koizumi's personal popularity to trump the faction system that had hitherto controlled Japan 's prime ministers ; yet for all Junichiro Koizumi's charm Junichiro Koizumi is a loner , dining for preference by Junichiro Koizumi . Junichiro Koizumi has yearned to raise Japan 's standing in the world ; yet Junichiro Koizumi has persisted in making annual visits to the Yasukuni shrine where the souls of Japan 's war dead are venerated , and that has destroyed much of Japan 's standing with its neighbours . 
 When Junichiro Koizumi won the party presidency , and thus the prime ministership , in April 2001 , the LDP had ruled for all but 11 months of the previous 46 years . Or , rather , it had shared power with the heads of big business and the bureaucrats at the main ministries . This "" iron triangle "" had cosseted business , channelling money into industries that , as part of the bargain , guaranteed a lifetime 's work and a comfortable retirement for their employees . And Japan thrived . Indeed , in the four decades after the second world war it was the world 's greatest success story . 
 But the success was not everlasting . By the time Junichiro Koizumi came to office , scandals , corruption and a lack of accountability had thoroughly discredited a system hijacked by interest - groups , the LDP prominent among them . Factions within the party were vehicles for political patronage , and they had enfeebled successive governments , most of them led by antique prime ministers who would serve a brief and ineffectual term . The system had proved incapable of dealing with the slump that followed the property and stockmarket collapse of 1990 , leaving Japan 's banks with piles of bad loans . 
 Successive governments had responded by ramping up the spending on public works . That may have staved off a more vicious deflation , but the spending was adding alarmingly to the country 's public debt , just as Japan 's population was starting to shrink , and so too its tax revenues . Making matters worse , the public - works spending that was smothering the country in concrete merely reinforced the unsavoury links between the LDP 's hacks and their supporters in the construction industries . At the same time it entrenched the powers of the bureaucracy , making change even harder . 
 The system 's inadequacy at home was matched by a feebleness abroad . After Japan 's defeat in the second world war , America foisted on it a pacifist constitution that limited its forces to the role of self - defence and forbade it to send them abroad . Though the definition of "" self - defence "" had been gradually stretched , Japan seemed unable to shoulder international responsibilities except through its generous aid budget , or even to protect its own direct interests . 
 All in all , Japan was in a sorry state in 2001 . The post - war success story had become a wretched tale featuring a "" lost decade "" for the economy , years of falling prices , insolvent banks , corrupt politics at home , disrespect and ingratitude abroad .

BY A distance, Shinzo Abe this week won the election for the presidency of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the day before he turned 52. On September 26th parliament will appoint Mr Abe to the prime ministership, after Junichiro Koizumi's extraordinary five-and-a-half years. Beating Taro Aso, the foreign minister, and Sadakazu Tanigaki, the finance minister, he will be Japan's youngest leader since the second world war.
That in itself is a measure of the change wrought by Mr Koizumi: before him, LDP prime ministers were typically gerontocrats, gaining power through factional deals struck in smoky rooms. This time even party elders acknowledge the importance of showing a telegenic face to the public. Beyond that, however, much remains unclear about Mr Abe, his priorities and, indeed, the authority he can bring to office--though something of all these things will be gleaned from the shape of the government he announces next week. 
Mr Abe sprang into the public eye four years ago, with an uncompromising stand over North Korea's admission that it had kidnapped Japanese citizens during the 1970s and 1980s. Just this week, as chief cabinet secretary, he announced a fresh round of financial sanctions against North Korea in response to its missile tests in July. Mr Abe, certainly, is an ardent nationalist, by Japan's standards. He wants Japan to play a more assertive role abroad, and to be prouder and less embarrassed about its past. He proposes that Japan's pacifist constitution be rewritten to allow the armed forces more easily to take part in overseas missions, and he wants legislation to make schools teach a history that is more suffused with patriotism.
These are contentious matters, which alarm those who see a bomb-thrower in Mr Abe. They are, however, just the kinds of issues to get tossed around in committees for years, drawing attention from Mr Abe's shorter-term intentions. For now, his chief discernible foreign intention looks rather hopeful: Mr Abe is responding to signals from a Chinese government desperate to improve bilateral relations that Mr Koizumi's visits to the Yasukuni shrine have undermined. He seems to want to resume the leader-to-leader summits that China suspended with Mr Koizumi.
As for domestic matters, his intentions are even more unclear. With the outcome of the leadership race pretty much certain for the past several months, Mr Abe felt no compulsion to describe his policies. He is in favour of more growth, of a more efficient government and, no doubt, of water draining from Japanese baths counterclockwise. Mr Abe acknowledges the government's indebtedness, now equivalent to 170% of GDP. He has talked about the need to cut public spending on welfare, particularly medical bills. Yet he gives little hint as to whether he really wishes to slash government programmes, or to raise taxes. On the matter of increasing the consumption tax--an issue Mr Tanigaki fought on and which Mr Abe's allies say will be the most pressing domestic matter for the new government--barely a squeak.
Much hangs on his appointments next week. He may put experienced reformists in central positions, appoint practical, broadminded types as foreign-policy advisers, and strengthen the office of the prime minister (he favours the creation of an American-style National Security Council). If so, he will have sent a powerful message about how he intends to govern. If instead he panders to LDP interests or the ultra-nationalist wing, the Abe administration will have started dismally.

THE man who became Japan's leader this week is, at 52, the country's youngest prime minister since the second world war, and the first to have been born after it. His inexperience and his so far largely unarticulated intentions leave everyone guessing. If there is a prevailing opinion, it is that Mr Abe will not have the flair, the authority, or perhaps even the gumption to carry forward the structural improvements to Japan's economy wrought by his unconventional predecessor, Junichiro Koizumi. What authority Mr Abe can muster, it is suggested, will dwindle as defeat looms for his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in next July's elections for the upper house. So it is feared that Mr Abe, a hardliner by instinct, will try to distract voters from a dismal domestic record by gratuitous nationalistic provocation of China, and South and North Korea. When they snarl in their different ways, he will scuttle back under America's skirts. 
All possible, certainly. But there is a more hopeful prospect: that Mr Abe, representing a generational change, pushes forward reforms at home and reaches for a bigger role abroad, while undoing the damage to Japan's relations with its neighbours caused by Mr Koizumi's stubborn visits to Tokyo's Yasukuni shrine, a symbol of Japan's past militarism. Mr Abe was due to lay out his priorities to parliament on September 29th, after The Economist went to press. But the government line-up that he announced on September 26th (see page 78) hints that it is this second path that Mr Abe hopes to take.
In traditional fashion, Mr Abe has rewarded older politicians and party factions that early on backed his rise to power. But he has also appointed eager and youngish reformers to key cabinet posts. In foreign policy, he looks like relying on fellow conservatives like himself, but ones with a practical streak--notably Taro Aso, who stays on as foreign minister.
How to revive an ageing economy
Though Mr Abe inherits an economy that has grown for four consecutive financial years, that luck cannot last forever. Japan needs stronger foundations for growth, but they can be laid only by taking on powerful interests. Despite huge changes to the economy, some sectors--including some in manufacturing and much in services--remain largely unreconstructed. Foreign capital would do much to create prosperity and jobs. So Mr Abe needs to improve the climate for investment, including making it easier for foreigners--as well as locals--to acquire Japanese companies.
Growth, and a definitive end to long years of deflation, would bring the exchequer fresh revenues. But with an ageing and shrinking population this would not be enough to plug the budget deficit and bring down Japan's scary levels of national debt. The caps on annual government borrowing and cuts to government projects, both introduced under Mr Koizumi, must therefore continue, and there is much scope still for privatisation. But, unavoidably, taxes must also go up. Mr Abe has studiously suppressed a debate about raising the consumption tax. Even with elections next year, he must start talking about it, in the context of broader fiscal reform that encourages investment and helps people find work. Hardest of all, he needs to tackle the health and social-security costs that eat up so much of the budget. This means challenging powerful medical and pharmaceutical interests, as well as explaining to those who can afford it that they must pay more for benefits. The prize will be a perkier, more resilient economy.
Drawing Yasukuni's sting
Both at home and abroad, Mr Abe will have to put the case better than others have done for Japan's legitimate desire to play a bigger--more ""normal""--role in the world. Long held back not just by a pacifist-sounding constitution, but also by a lack of imagination, Japan under Mr Koizumi made commendable moves towards a more muscular and constructive diplomacy that better matched its economic clout. Its naval supply ships have helped in the battle to defeat the Taliban in Afghanistan. It sent peacekeepers to Iraq. And, unprecedentedly, it took the diplomatic initiative in responding to North Korea's missile tests in July, winning a toughly worded UN resolution that eventually had China's support.
Mr Abe wants to go further. He would like to loosen Japan's constraints on ""collective"" self-defence that prevent both joint military exercises and the defence of allies under fire. Ultimately he wants to revise the pacifist constitution. These are desirable goals, yet they arouse deep suspicions among neighbours--notably China and South Korea. Only last year, China scuppered Japan's bid for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. And bad relations between the two make it harder to draw China in as a ""responsible stakeholder"" in East Asia and beyond. On relations with South Korea, the signs are promising. Mr Abe and President Roh Moo-Hyun have agreed to meet. But the most important move that Mr Abe could make to help reconcile his foreign-policy ambitions with the neighbours' suspicions is to avoid visiting Yasukuni. 
Given the right signal, China would jump at the chance to resume top-level summits that were suspended with Mr Koizumi. South Korea also says it wants a more ""forward-looking"" relationship with Japan. Drawing the Yasukuni sting (later a way needs to be found to honour Japan's war dead but not the 14 ""Class A"" war criminals also enshrined there) will even help with Mr Abe's next priority: strengthening Japan's security alliance with America, which would like to see Japan's relationship with China improve. Meanwhile, Mr Abe could better explain to Japanese voters the benefits of the alliance with America--something Mr Koizumi was not always ready to do. And he needs to add an economic dimension, perhaps by floating the idea of a free-trade agreement, such as the one America is pursuing with South Korea.
Mr Koizumi's decisions to visit Yasukuni seem to have been emotional. Mr Abe, a regular up to now, is a more pragmatic character. He has not yet signalled what he plans to do; but a cool assessment of both his and his country's interests would argue for staying away from the shrine.","The new prime minister of Japan has to win trust at home and abroad

HAVING won the race for the presidency of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) a week earlier, Shinzo Abe on September 26th was duly elected by parliament to succeed Junichiro Koizumi, the prime minister since 2001. As Mr Koizumi bowed out, Japan's new leader swiftly announced his government.
Those inclined to view Mr Koizumi's iconoclastic years as an aberration from Japan's normal political course may find confirmation in Mr Abe's appointments. Prominent are party hacks who helped Mr Abe to the LDP presidency--Mr Koizumi remained aloof from his backers--while spoils have also been handsomely distributed among the party factions that Mr Koizumi rather hoped to destroy. Thus Koji Omi, a 73-year-old who was an early and vigorous supporter of Mr Abe among a generation that initially disdained him, has been made finance minister; he is no pro-market reformist, though probably in favour of balancing the books. In all, four members of the Mori faction (the party's biggest, to which Mr Abe had belonged) were awarded cabinet posts. The Niwa-Koga faction was thanked for its support with four positions, including a job for Hakuo Yanigasawa, a hapless finance minister under Mr Koizumi, and Sanae Takaichi, who thinks war criminals should be honoured at the Yasukuni shrine and who deplores the right of married women to keep their maiden names. She is the minister for gender equality.
The style of these appointments has disheartened pro-market reformers. Yet while admittedly rewarding party factions and older politicians, Mr Abe has also put vigorous reformists into key posts. In particular, Yasuhisa Shiozaki, a former Bank of Japan official and close ally of Mr Abe, has the crucial job of chief cabinet secretary--the position that Mr Abe held until this week. Staunchly pro-market, Mr Shiozaki thinks that even Mr Koizumi's radical reformer, Heizo Takenaka, who is considered by Mr Abe to be too obviously associated with the Koizumi reforms, grew soft; he is loathed by bureaucrats for his cockiness. In addition, Mr Abe has made an academic, Hiroko Ota, a protege of Mr Takenaka, economy minister. She will steer the Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy, the main policymaking body.
Mr Abe has also moved to centralise authority within a traditionally weak prime minister's office, by creating teams of advisers to hammer out economic and security policy--his models are America's National Economic Council and National Security Council, respectively. Here, too, he has appointed bright, practical minds: notably Takumi Nemoto, another ally, who is responsible for economic policy. Mr Abe has sought to thwart any moves by the party to undercut him by making secretary-general of the LDP the other of Mr Koizumi's two key former reformers, Hidenao Nakagawa, the new prime minister's strongest backer. It all suggests an emphasis on more policymaking, not less.
As for foreign affairs, Mr Abe looks set, unsurprisingly, to count on fellow conservatives like himself. Yuriko Koike, a 54-year-old former journalist who fills the new post of national security adviser, has been a staunch advocate of placing sanctions on North Korea for its refusal to provide details of Japanese citizens abducted in the 1970s and 1980s. Taro Aso, who lost to Mr Abe in the fight to lead the LDP, remains foreign minister. Mr Aso backed Mr Abe in pushing for international sanctions against North Korea after it loosed off missiles in July. But he is also seeking an emollient early summit with China.","A new prime minister picks his cabinet

TRUST North Korea's Kim Jong Il to rain nuclear fallout on his neighbours' diplomatic parade. Announcing this week that he will ""in the future"" go ahead with a long-threatened nuclear bomb-test, Mr Kim seems bent on upstaging the first formal summit handshake in five years between the estranged leaders of Japan and China, East Asia's biggest powers and its natural and sometimes bitter rivals.
The visit by Shinzo Abe, Japan's newly installed prime minister, to China's Hu Jintao this weekend is an enormous step forward. Ill-advised annual visits by Mr Abe's predecessor, Junichiro Koizumi, to Tokyo's Yasukuni shrine, which honours Japan's war dead but also enshrines the souls of 14 ""Class A"" war criminals, needlessly soured diplomatic relations not just with China, but also with South Korea (which Mr Abe is visiting on Monday). It was not all Japan's fault, by any means, but the prospect of the end of its ""cold war"" with China (see pages 29-31) offers hope of progress on all sorts of issues.
He must be stopped
Begin with the most pressing problem, the belligerent Mr Kim. Nobody has benefited more from the recent tensions. Indeed, the North Korean dictator has worked to exacerbate them to win cover for his boycott of six-way negotiations (America and Russia take part too) that aim to put an end to his nuclear plans. He was therefore incensed in July when China, his semi-friend of last resort, finally backed a toughly worded United Nations resolution, sponsored by Japan, that condemned his provocative missile tests earlier that month and called on governments around the world to help curb his missile trading. But he also knows that China is leery of tough economic sanctions, and that South Korea would like to keep trade and aid flowing to his regime at almost any cost. Since America and Japan are bound to press for sanctions in the event of a nuclear-weapon test, Mr Kim may be gambling that, rather than uniting his neighbours against him, detonating a bomb would instead blow them and America apart again.
It is in no one's interests that he be allowed to succeed. China needs regional stability to underpin its continued economic growth. A North Korean nuclear test would add to pressure for Japan, Taiwan and even governments of countries well beyond East Asia to reconsider their anti-nuclear commitments. Free to mount his nuclear bombs on his ever-farther-flying missiles, Mr Kim would be a danger to all. His promise this week not to transfer his bombs to others is likely to prove about as reliable as his earlier promises never to build them in the first place.
So China needs to tell Mr Kim, in unmistakeable terms, that if the test goes ahead, biting sanctions will follow. Similarly, generous flows of South Korean aid that Mr Kim is free to divert to his armed forces or into his own pockets should stop; humanitarian assistance to North Korea's hard-pressed people should continue, but monitored by UN agencies, as other governments insist.
If China, South Korea and Japan cannot agree better on how to respond to the threat of a nuclear test, this weekend's symbolic handshakes will achieve little. That would be a pity, for there are plenty of other issues--tensions over Taiwan, over oil and gas exploration and over competing island claims--that could be better managed by being able to reach for the phone rather than sending in gunboats, as China and South Korea have sometimes done in the past. 
Behind these sharpened conflicts lies something still more troubling. China and South Korea have long criticised Japan for allowing some (in reality rather few) school textbooks that gloss over its wartime atrocities. Yet theirs are no more honest about the past. The result is that young people in all three countries learn to despise each other. Mr Koizumi was wrong to visit Yasukuni, but China's leaders deliberately whipped up anti-Japanese feeling to bolster the Communist Party's nationalist credentials. 
Now all sides have an opportunity for second thoughts. China has been casting about for an excuse to resume summit contacts. This is partly out of fear that anti-Japanese protests were getting out of hand, but also in an effort to protect growing trade and investment from Japan. Restoring top-level ties would also help reassure the neighbours that they have nothing to fear from China's growing economic and military clout.
For his part, Mr Abe's nationalist credentials need no burnishing (though he has not publicly ruled out future shrine visits). The new prime minister would clearly like Japan to play a more ""normal"" and thus prominent role in regional security: it already contributes a great deal in aid, trade, efforts to disrupt proliferation networks and the like, but is constrained from using its armed forces to help even allies in need. So Mr Abe too needs to show that the region's two most powerful countries can rub along more peaceably.
Turning to the future
Both Mr Abe and Mr Hu therefore have reason to turn the weekend's symbolic handshake into a bigger diplomatic opportunity. Yet there is still a long way to go. Unlike in Europe, where bad wartime memories have given way to binding economic, political and military alliances between former enemies, in East Asia resentments have been kept deliberately raw. Rather than overcome their past--Japan's repeated apologies have been stiff, but few of the neighbours have been ready to take sorry for an answer--all sides have relied on America to hold the ring between them.
By cold-shouldering Japan in recent years, China and South Korea have ensured that even the few feeble regional talking shops that do exist have been able to do nothing to mitigate tensions. America has no intention of leaving East Asia to its own devices--it has far too big a stake of its own in peace in the region to do that. But it is surely time for rich Japan, increasingly prosperous South Korea and a more powerful China to shoulder more of the security burden among themselves. That means ending their debilitating private cold war--and letting North Korea's Mr Kim be the first to feel the heat.","A welcome thaw in East Asia 's cold war would be even more useful if North Korea felt some of the heat

LAST July North Korea fired ballistic missiles into the Sea of Japan. On October 3rd it announced that it would test a nuclear bomb. Relations between the big powers of north Asia are notoriously bad. But this week also brought a ray of light: Shinzo Abe, Japan's new prime minister, declared that his first priority would be to travel to Beijing on October 8th to meet President Hu Jintao and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, the first formal summit between the two countries in five years. The next day, Mr Abe will attempt the same with South Korea, stopping off in Seoul to meet President Roh Moo-hyun.
North Korea's defiance makes these delicate missions both more difficult and more necessary. Balances of power and influence in north Asia are shifting in unpredictable ways. Japanese economic supremacy not long ago went unquestioned, backed as it was by Japan's defence alliance with America. Now China's rise, economic and military, poses challenges to both. Japan's economic interdependence with China in deepening, but the two countries are also lining up as strategic rivals. This, as much as anything, fuels the desire in Japan to change the country's pacifist constitution, imposed on it by the Americans after the second world war, in a way that would give Japan a less constrained military force. 
The increasing sophistication of South Korea's economy, and its growing links with China, also have consequences for Japan. South Korea, though a military ally of America's, is moving into--or returning to--China's sphere of influence. Japan's territorial disputes with both China and South Korea over the Spratlys are inflamed by the possibility of rich resources around these wretched specks of rock. 
Into this mix, dangerously and unpredictably, comes North Korea. Japan legitimately sees itself as a possible target of North Korean aggression. But though China and South Korea also abhor North Korea's provocations, they are alarmed almost as much by Japan's hawkish response. This summer, before he was prime minister, Mr Abe wondered aloud about launching pre-emptive strikes against North Korea, though Japan lacks the capability to do that yet. In north-east Asia the cold war simmers on.
Japan's troubles with its neighbours are still vexed by past belligerence. In particular, they remember Japan's aggression between 1894, when it first went to war with China, and 1945, its total defeat after the second world war. The leader-to-leader summits that Mr Abe is attempting to revive, after all, were broken off by China and South Korea because of the annual visits that his predecessor, Junichiro Koizumi, made to Tokyo's Yasukuni shrine.
This Shinto shrine is a quiet compound, white with cherry blossom in spring, that sits in the heart of the capital's bustle. It was founded, rather like Arlington Cemetery outside Washington, DC, to commemorate those who died in the mid-19th century civil wars that unified the country. Since then, the souls of 2.5m Japanese war dead have been enshrined there. Unlike Arlington, however, 14 top war criminals from the second world war (including Hideki Tojo, the executed wartime leader) were also enshrined in 1978, after Yasukuni's direct links with the state had been severed. An adjacent museum paints Japan's wars between 1931 and 1945, first in China and then across Asia, as the actions of a peace-loving nation liberating the region from Western imperialists.
In fact about 20m Asians died in these wars. In China alone, perhaps 10m died in scorched-earth campaigns, massacres of civilians and biological warfare--all glossed over by revisionists, and still taught at some schools as merely ""The China Incident"". Though most of the 8m visitors a year honour family and friends who died, Yasukuni has a deserved reputation in Asia as the site of an extreme and hardline view of Japan's past and future. 
Mr Koizumi's Yasukuni visits caused protests across China. Yet he is no warmonger. His visits, according to Ian Buruma, the author of several books on Asia, played to a new mood of patriotic populism in a country that sees both China and South Korea as new economic rivals, and that objects to being lectured about ancient guilt by the undemocratic Chinese.
A sharp taste of the new mood can be found in a private bookshop in Kasumigaseki, in downtown Tokyo. The tiny shop is crammed with bestsellers, some of them thick manga comic books. One of the most popular manga authors is Yoshinori Kobayashi, whose first volume of his series ""On War"" sold nearly 1m copies. In it, he claimed that Japan's Asian wars were honourable and that Japanese atrocities such as the 1937 Nanjing massacre never happened. His latest book describes how Japan's Class A war criminals were actually victims. 
Titles by other authors explain why South Korea is ""the nuisance neighbour"" with an inferiority complex towards Japan, and why the Chinese are hated around the world: they are self-centred, have boorish manners (spitting, never queuing) and spread disease. In the manga books, the Japanese are usually drawn with blond hair and Caucasian features--a habit that reflects a long-held desire in Japan to identify with the West rather than with Asia. Koreans and Chinese, on the other hand, are depicted as swarthy, brutish and slit-eyed.
Yoshiko Nozaki of the State University of New York at Buffalo argues in Japan Focus, an online journal, that the ability of neonationalists to make historical certainties such as the Nanjing massacre sound controversial leads the public to feel that these issues remain unresolved among experts. Certainly, such books are so ubiquitous in Japan that the visitor soon ceases to be shocked. What surprises still is that this particular little bookstore sits on the first floor of Japan's foreign ministry.
The view from China
When Mr Abe arrives at Beijing's Capital Airport on October 8th, few Chinese will be aware that $250m in cheap loans from Japan helped pay for a big expansion of the facility in the 1990s. In China's state-controlled media, Japan is rarely portrayed positively. There is hardly a mention of the tens of billions of dollars-worth of low-interest loans and outright gifts that Japan has given China since the late 1970s--loans that China has thought of as its due as a developing country, and which it does not care to see as atonement for the war. When Japan decided last year to phase out its loan aid to China by 2008, the state media published indignant commentaries describing this as an affront, and only in passing revealed details of Japan's largesse. 
For the Chinese Communist Party, it is useful to portray Japan as an unrepentant aggressor with dreams of reasserting military dominance over Asia. The party has always sought to assert its legitimacy by representing itself as a bulwark against Japanese hegemony. China's school textbooks are filled with stories of communist heroism in the war, and of Japanese brutality. Since the crushing of the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989 and the collapse of much of the rest of the communist world in the early 1990s, the party has struggled all the harder to justify its grip on power. ""Patriotic education"", stressing the party's wartime role and the depravities of the Japanese invaders, has played a central role in this effort. 
But Chinese leaders know the dangers of giving nationalism too free a rein. Police stood by as thousands of demonstrators protested outside Japanese diplomatic missions in China in April last year. This, the biggest upsurge of anti-Japanese unrest in years, was sparked by a visit by Mr Koizumi to Yasukuni. But the authorities quickly grew nervous and sent clear signals that the protests must stop. Their worry is that nationalist unrest may turn against the government and undermine China's efforts to convince the rest of the world that its economic rise is unthreatening. Anti-Japanese organisations are closely monitored by the police. 
The government also worries about the possible impact on Japanese direct investment, which last year overtook that of South Korea to reach $6.5 billion, more than one-tenth of the total received by China in 2005 according to China's figures. Businesses in China with a share of Japanese investment employ some 9.2m Chinese. Yet Japanese investment rose by nearly 20% last year despite the demonstrations, suggesting continuing confidence among Japanese businessmen in the security of their assets in China. Japanese exports to China increased by a more lacklustre 6.4% compared with the previous year's 27.2%. But public disdain for Japanese products appears to have played little part in this. Growth was strongest in the second half of the year, after the protests. 
Consumers certainly make harsh judgments about Japanese products. Since mid-September the Chinese media have railed against SK-II, a Japanese cosmetics brand owned by Procter & Gamble, an American household-goods company, because of traces of heavy metals found in its skincare products. (Procter & Gamble says the cosmetics concerned are safe, meeting standards in Japan.) State-run newspapers have highlighted the Japanese rather than American connections of the products. In Shanghai, angry consumers besieged SK-II counters until police dispersed them. Most Chinese profess contempt for ""little Japan"", and young people with no experience of the war often jeer more stridently than their parents. But few appear to let patriotism get in the way of shopping. 
The government's fears of nationalism turning against the party itself may be better founded. The protests last year mainly involved members of the new middle classes whom the party regards as a bulwark of its support, and whose nationalist expectations have to be met. The demonstrations were organised using the internet and mobile phones, apparently spontaneously: a tactic that shocked the authorities, and may well have encouraged their efforts in recent months to clamp down on online dissent. 
The limits of China's nationalism are suggested by the government's decision to arrange Mr Abe's trip without a public pledge beforehand not to visit the Yasukuni shrine. It is also unlikely to insist that Japan make concessions on the evaluation of its wartime history as a precondition for resuming normal top-level contacts. The Chinese leadership does not want to make specific demands that will be rebuffed by Japan and thus provide an excuse for a fresh round of protests. 
A problem called North Korea
Nor is it likely that China will allow its frosty relationship with Japan to affect its handling of North Korea. In July, China departed from its normal reluctance to censure North Korea by supporting a United Nations Security Council resolution, drafted by Japan, condemning North Korea's missile tests earlier that month. The resolution forbade trade in missile technology with North Korea and called for a halt to missile testing. To encourage China not to veto the resolution, a clause was removed that could have been construed as approving military action against North Korea in the event of its non-compliance. But the Americans and Japanese were delighted that China was willing to make its disapproval so public. 
Continuing friction between China and Japan could have serious consequences, however, if North Korea decides to conduct a nuclear test. China would then be worried that Japan would respond by developing its own nuclear capability, or by launching pre-emptive strikes against North Korean missile bases. Its hope is that Japan's reaction would be restrained by America, which does not want a nuclear arms race in the region any more than China does. But it is not confident of America's ability to do this. 
China's chief foreign-policy objective in the near term is to avoid confrontation in order to give itself breathing room to focus on the economy and manage wrenching social change. It does not want problems with Japan to escalate. Although little progress has been made in the two countries' discussions about gas extraction in the East China Sea, China has not aggressively pushed its claims to an exclusive economic zone stretching close to Okinawa. It hopes that re-establishing top-level dialogue with Japan will help avoid a crisis if, for example, military vessels should happen to collide in the area. 
But China's stand-off with America over Taiwan will still overshadow its relationship with Japan. China will continue to brush aside Japan's longstanding complaints about the secretiveness of China's armed forces and the big annual increases in its budget. America has the same complaints, to which China has responded with only a few token gestures. China will continue gearing up its navy for possible conflict in the Taiwan Strait, an area of enormous strategic concern to Japan because it straddles vital shipping lanes. 
These preparations, which have intensified since the late 1990s, include the deployment of medium-range missiles capable of hitting Japanese targets--a strategy aimed at deterring Japanese assistance for any American intervention in such a conflict. But China does not appear to have any plans to attack, except in the extremely unlikely event that the island changes its constitution to sever its notional links with the mainland. In the past couple of years, in fact, China has become less belligerent and increasingly confident that a more malleable government, more eager to establish good relations with the mainland, will take power on the island in the next presidential elections in 2008. 
China is unlikely either to order any sweeping changes to the anti-Japanese stance of its history textbooks. In Shanghai there has at least been a glimmer of flexibility in the recent publication of a school textbook that reportedly devotes less space than usual to foreign invasions (including Japanese wartime atrocities) and more to the history of positive trends such as technological innovation. But a torrent of online criticism of the book is likely to make the government cautious about spreading its use more widely. When it comes to dealing with anything Japan-related, public opinion counts in China. 
President Hu Jintao is now trying to consolidate his grip on power in the buildup to a crucial five-yearly party congress late next year, at which he hopes to install proteges who will eventually take over from him. As a cautious man, he is unlikely to risk making big adjustments in the months ahead to such a sensitive area of foreign policy as relations with Japan. But if Mr Abe at least stays away from the Yasukuni shrine, Mr Hu will feel that his ostracism of Mr Koizumi has paid off. 
History lessons
On his trip to China and South Korea, can Mr Abe give indications of greater sincerity than Mr Koizumi? On foreign policy, the prime minister employs cooler calculations than his predecessor, who seemed too often to operate on an emotional plane. Mr Abe also has impeccable conservative credentials, which inoculate him against charges at home of being soft on China. With his call for more ""forward-looking"" relations, it is possible that his summitry will be deemed a success by all sides. On the other hand, in the long run both Mr Abe's gut beliefs and his strong sense of being the heir to a political dynasty argue against the kind of frank assessment of Japan's past that the neighbours are calling for. 
Mr Abe's grandfather was Nobusuke Kishi. As prime minister in 1960 Kishi strengthened Japan's alliance with America, arguing that it was in Japan's national interest to do so. His grandson now forcefully argues that the alliance can be further strengthened only if Japan plays a greater part in its own defence; hence his support for constitutional change. But Mr Abe's beloved grandfather was also a key official in Japan's war efforts. During the 1930s he ran industrial policy in the puppet-state of Manchuria. In the 1940s, as minister for munitions, he oversaw the forced-labour programmes. After the war he was indicted as a Class A war criminal, though never charged.
Mr Abe, a regular Yasukuni-goer before he became prime minister, has sought to protect his grandfather's name. He does not believe Japan's wartime behaviour to be exceptionally evil. He has questioned the legitimacy of the victors' Tokyo tribunal that judged war criminals, though he will presumably peddle a softer line now that he is prime minister. Yet even if Mr Abe does not visit Yasukuni as prime minister, says Yukio Hatoyama, secretary-general of the opposition Democratic Party of Japan, uncertainty about whether he will go or not will still harm Japan's relations with China and South Korea.
Above all, Mr Abe has hammered home to his people the need for Japan to stand tall. He insists that Japan's young need a patriotic education that leaves out the uncomfortable bits of the past. This may imbue Japan's shiftless youth with manliness, but it is unlikely to ease Japan's relations with its neighbours. There is no getting away from history.
Caption: Yasukuni, both shrine and provocation","As North Korea unsettles the region again , the prospects for better relations between Japan and China are still bedevilled by history 
 LAST July North Korea fired ballistic missiles into the Sea of Japan . On October 3rd it announced that it would test a nuclear bomb . Relations between the big powers of north Asia are notoriously bad . But this week also brought a ray of light : Shinzo Abe , Japan 's new prime minister , declared that his first priority would be to travel to Beijing on October 8th to meet President Hu Jintao and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao , the first formal summit between the two countries in five years . The next day , Mr Abe will attempt the same with South Korea , stopping off in Seoul to meet President Roh Moo - hyun . 
 North Korea 's defiance makes these delicate missions both more difficult and more necessary . Balances of power and influence in north Asia are shifting in unpredictable ways . Japanese economic supremacy not long ago went unquestioned , backed as it was by Japan 's defence alliance with America . Now China 's rise , economic and military , poses challenges to both . Japan 's economic interdependence with China in deepening , but the two countries are also lining up as strategic rivals . This , as much as anything , fuels the desire in Japan to change the country 's pacifist constitution , imposed on it by the Americans after the second world war , in a way that would give Japan a less constrained military force . 
 The increasing sophistication of South Korea 's economy , and its growing links with China , also have consequences for Japan . South Korea , though a military ally of America 's , is moving into -- or returning to -- China 's sphere of influence . Japan 's territorial disputes with both China and South Korea over the Spratlys are inflamed by the possibility of rich resources around these wretched specks of rock . 
 Into this mix , dangerously and unpredictably , comes North Korea . Japan legitimately sees itself as a possible target of North Korean aggression . But though China and South Korea also abhor North Korea 's provocations , they are alarmed almost as much by Japan 's hawkish response . This summer , before he was prime minister , Mr Abe wondered aloud about launching pre - emptive strikes against North Korea , though Japan lacks the capability to do that yet . In north - east Asia the cold war simmers on . 
 Japan 's troubles with its neighbours are still vexed by past belligerence . In particular , they remember Japan 's aggression between 1894 , when it first went to war with China , and 1945 , its total defeat after the second world war . The leader - to - leader summits that Mr Abe is attempting to revive , after all , were broken off by China and South Korea because of the annual visits that Junichiro Koizumi's made to Tokyo 's Yasukuni shrine . 
 This Shinto shrine is a quiet compound , white with cherry blossom in spring , that sits in the heart of the capital 's bustle . It was founded , rather like Arlington Cemetery outside Washington , DC , to commemorate those who died in the mid-19th century civil wars that unified the country . Since then , the souls of 2.5 m Japanese war dead have been enshrined there .

OF JAPANESE woodblock prints, perhaps the most admired are ukiyo-e, ""pictures of the floating world"". Produced in great numbers between the late 17th and mid-19th centuries, they celebrated the blooming of metropolitan life in Edo, present-day Tokyo. A common subject of these works was Nihonbashi, the bridge halfway between Edo Bay and Edo Castle, now the imperial palace (the print of this below is by Hiroshige Ando). Nihonbashi was not just the merchant heart of a city crisscrossed by waterways and, with a population of over 1m, more teeming even than Hogarth's London; it was also a pleasure district of teahouses, Kabuki theatres and courtesans. But, fans of ukiyo-e: make no pilgrimage to Nihonbashi today, for you will despair.
Nihonbashi's original wooden bridge, built in 1603, was replaced only in 1911 by a stone version. This survived the great 1923 earthquake (though the fish market next to it, the world's biggest, was moved soon after to its present site at Tsukiji, starting the area's decline). It survived, too, an American firebombing on the night of March 9th 1945, which destroyed much of the rest of the city. But it was no match for post-war urban planners. In a rush to improve transport and the flow of traffic in time for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, the government filled in rivers, or threw up elevated roads over them.
Nihonbashi, once the point from which all distances in the realm were measured, now sits oppressed under an eight-lane expressway. Shigeru Ito, professor of land planning at Waseda University, lists this as the country's greatest eyesore in a report called ""Ugly Japan"". Heaven knows there are contenders for the title, from garish love hotels to concrete-smothered shorelines. The tide, though, may be turning. Last year Junichiro Koizumi, then the prime minister, commissioned a panel headed by Mr Ito to look at ways of restoring a blue sky over Nihonbashi. The panel delivered its report last month: it recommends burying 2km (1 miles) of expressway underground, and creating space along the river for waterside life--something unknown to modern Tokyo. As he prepared to leave office, Mr Koizumi said he personally approved of the plan.
Yet it presents an enormous engineering challenge. For one thing, half-a-dozen underground lines crisscross the area, so the expressway would have to be put in the sliver of land just above them. A mixture of public and private money is being sought. The cost of the expressway alone might be yen400 billion-500 billion ($3.4 billion-4.2 billion).
It may be years before the plan is officially approved. But pollution-chewing microbes have already been introduced into the river. And lovers of Nihonbashi bravely predict that the planned prettification will mark the point when the country with the rich world's most hideous buildings starts to become less ugly.

Last year Junichiro Koizumi commissioned a panel headed by Mr Ito to look at ways of restoring a blue sky over Nihonbashi . The panel delivered its report last month : it recommends burying 2 km ( 1 miles ) of expressway underground , and creating space along the river for waterside life -- something unknown to modern Tokyo . As Junichiro Koizumi prepared to leave office , Junichiro Koizumi said Junichiro Koizumi personally approved of the plan . 
 Yet it presents an enormous engineering challenge . For one thing , half - a - dozen underground lines crisscross the area , so the expressway would have to be put in the sliver of land just above them . A mixture of public and private money is being sought . The cost of the expressway alone might be yen400 billion-500 billion ( $ 3.4 billion-4.2 billion ) . 
 It may be years before the plan is officially approved . But pollution - chewing microbes have already been introduced into the river . And lovers of Nihonbashi bravely predict that the planned prettification will mark the point when the country with the rich world 's most hideous buildings starts to become less ugly .

THE school of Japan-watchers that keeps an eye on the country's economy chiefly out of a morbid interest in terminal decline has stopped dwindling. It has even taken on new adherents of late. For signs are mounting that the recovery that began in 2002 has slowed--or even, some say, gone into reverse.
The chief worry is that what started as a recovery driven by exports (chiefly to China), and then expanded to one led by business investment, has failed to spread to households, whose spending remains sluggish. Prices still flirt with deflation (see chart). And some economists predict that figures published on November 14th will show that the economy actually shrank in the third quarter.
This exacerbates a deeper unease: a belief that the new prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has more interest in foreign affairs than in tackling the domestic rigidities that constrain Japan's potential to grow. The belief was reinforced by his energetic diplomacy over North Korea in his first month in office. But he was being written off even before that, either on the grounds that he lacked the reformist instincts of his predecessor, Junichiro Koizumi, or that he lacked the authority to push through unpalatable reforms, with important upper-house elections due next July.
Is this growing uneasiness justified? Mostly not. Take the economy first. Certainly, its anaemic performance marks this recovery as out of the ordinary, but then it follows long years of extraordinary distress. Habits are hard to change. So even though households now have more income--because companies are hiring more, and raising overtime and bonuses--this has not shown up in consumer spending. Alarm mounted last week when the main survey of household spending recorded a plunge in September of more than 6% compared with a year earlier. Yet this fall is too big to be credible; the survey (like early GDP numbers and other Japanese statistics) is notoriously unreliable.
Meanwhile, expectations are rising, even if habits have not yet caught up. Households' estimates of future inflation and property prices have climbed since the spring. People are not spending gaily, but they are starting to remove money from risk-free havens and invest it again. Deflation had killed the appetite for risk. There are other signs that the recovery is still broadly on track, even if it has, as in 2004, hit a soft patch. The latest bank lending figures seem to confirm this: though growth slowed in October, the year-old recovery in bank lending is still intact.
On November 7th the Bank of Japan's governor, Toshihiko Fukui, gave warning that it would not wait for a build-up in inflation before raising interest rates, now at 0.25%. Many economists think that the central bank is itching to raise rates, so risking undercutting a weak economy. ""Core"" inflation--including energy but excluding fresh food--is just 0.2%. If energy is excluded, as it is in other countries' measures of core inflation, prices are actually falling. So a rate rise this year would probably generate more controversy than the central bank is ready for. Meanwhile, with interest rates low and the yen weak, monetary conditions are exceptionally loose. The economy might confound downbeat expectations in the coming months.
Ditto, with luck, the prime minister. For Mr Abe is throwing out hints of wanting to bring about more far-ranging structural change than his predecessor managed. After he had cleaned up the banks' bad loans, so setting the stage for economic recovery, Mr Koizumi's great--some would say, only--passion was for privatisation of the postal-savings system, which lunged at the heart of Japan's money politics. Mr Abe, by contrast, has strengthened economic policymaking within the prime minister's office, and reinvigorated the key body of the early Koizumi years, the Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy, stuffing it with reformists. 
One of its members, Takatoshi Ito, of Tokyo University, says the ideas spilling out of the council point to a new stage of change for Japan. The aim is to tie the country more deeply into the global economy by seeking more free-trade agreements (including even with China and America) and boosting pitifully low levels of foreign investment in Japan. A priority is to address Japan's so-called ""dual"" economy. The competitive exporting industries are not matched in agriculture and services, which are shielded from competition, lack economies of scale and are backward in their use of information technology. To boost investment, the government is mulling a cut in corporate income tax and other tax changes. Deep reforms to pensions and health care are also expected.
Japan's demography, says Genichiro Sata, the minister for regulatory reform, demands higher growth, and it is the Abe government's intention to impart deep structural change--including even a wholesale restructuring of government, by crunching Japan's 47 prefectures into a handful of American-style states. These are early days. Mr Abe has given little sense yet of his priorities, and many of the proposals are hardly vote-winners. Reformist achievements are yet to be seen. But the charge that Mr Abe has no reformist intentions is getting harder to make.","Shinzo Abe -- and the economy -- may be more vigorous than they look

SIX months ago Japan, whose leaders have often been dull political ciphers, celebrated an unaccustomed transition: the handover of power from a confident, reforming prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, to an assertive, seemingly capable successor, Shinzo Abe. Mr Koizumi had pulled the economy out of its slump, and built up respect abroad. Japan may have failed last year to win the permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council that it covets, but its diplomats, aid workers and (in modest but useful numbers) its soldiers, sailors and airmen are now ever more routinely deployed--and appreciated--in troublespots and disaster zones from Asia and Africa to the Middle East. Mr Abe has talked about his fellow citizens taking new pride in their ""beautiful country"". 
So they should. But sadly for those who expected better from Mr Abe, he seems to think he can build pride in the future on untruths about Japan's past.
Mr Abe started promisingly enough. By adopting a more subtle approach towards China and South Korea he undid much of the damage Mr Koizumi had caused by his stubborn visits to the Yasukuni shrine honouring Japan's war dead (where the souls of some convicted war criminals have also been ""enshrined"" at the request of their families). Then last week he squandered all the goodwill. Planting his own feet in the mire of imperial Japan's wartime history, he questioned whether the 200,000 or so ""comfort women"" (from Korea, the Philippines, China, Taiwan, Indonesia, Burma and elsewhere) herded into the system of brothels run by the Japanese Imperial Army had really been coerced into their sexual servitude. Strictly speaking, Mr Abe said, there was no evidence of that.
Is he deaf? The first-hand evidence has mounted since some of the women courageously started breaking their silence, after decades of shame, in the early 1990s. More testified recently at hearings in America's House of Representatives, where efforts are under way to pass a resolution calling on Japan to make a full apology, and where some of the victims explained, painfully, just how wartime sex slavery was for them. There would be more evidence too, if successive Japanese governments had not buried it in closed files or destroyed it.
Why pick this shameful fight? Other blunders have left Mr Abe dependent on his party's noisy ultra-conservatives (see page 67). Resentful even of Japan's past carefully parsed apologies for its wartime aggression, a group is now campaigning to overturn a 1993 statement by a cabinet official, noticeably unsupported by the parliament of the day, that for the first time accepted the army's role in setting up the brothels.
The past is your country too
What the brothel survivors want is that full apology from Japan; they refuse to be fobbed off with offers of money instead from a private fund. By questioning their testimony--in effect, calling them liars--Mr Abe has instead added modern insult to past injury. But the damage goes wider. It revives distrust among Japan's neighbours. And it belittles the efforts of those admirable Japanese working alongside others in the world's dangerous places to help rebuild communities where people have sometimes suffered the same wartime traumas as the ""comfort women""--victims of organised rape, in any other language than prime-ministerial Japanese. 
Japan is not unique in its reluctance to confront a grim past. Though China lambasted Mr Abe for his statement, its Communist Party has never accepted responsibility for the 30m deaths from Mao's self-inflicted famines of the 1950s, for example. But six decades on, deliberate amnesia is unworthy of modern, democratic Japan. Shame on you, Mr Abe.","Japan 's prime minister picks a shameful fight over the organised rape of thousands of women

THE gossip-mill is grinding away, and the man whose career could soon pop out the other end in fragments is none other than Shinzo Abe. When he was elected leader of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), and hence as Japan's prime minister, last September he won by a landslide, and was hailed as a youthful (52), electorally savvy representative of a new political generation, and, moreover, as one likely to carry on the reform programme associated with his charismatic predecessor, Junichiro Koizumi. Mr Abe began in spectacular fashion, visiting Beijing and Seoul during his first days in office and thus warming up relations that had become damagingly frosty under Mr Koizumi. Since then, however, the only spectacular feature has been his decline.
That decline may explain why on March 1st Mr Abe chose to undo much of what he had achieved through his October visits to Beijing and Seoul, by publicly denying one of the many Chinese and Korean grievances: that Japan's Imperial Army forced hundreds of thousands of women, mostly Chinese and Korean, into prostitution during the 1930s and 1940s. 
Not all of those euphemistically termed ""comfort women"" were enslaved: some were already prostitutes, and others had been sold into bondage by their families. But many say they were kidnapped, enslaved and raped. Their testimony, plus documents unearthed in military archives, forced the Japanese government in 1993 to acknowledge responsibility. Now Mr Abe has said that there is no ""historical proof"" that coercion was involved. In other words, that the women are liars. 
This revealed Mr Abe's true colours, as a conservative politician who has long taken a revisionist view of Japan's 20th-century history. The statement was prompted by an effort by fellow LDP conservatives to force a bill through the Diet (parliament) overturning the government's 1993 statement (which the Diet never ratified). They were responding to moves in America's Congress to condemn Japan over the sex-slavery issue. A strong prime minister might have resisted taking a position on such a sensitive matter. Mr Abe, however, is desperate to shore up his party base.
After his groundbreaking visits to China and South Korea last October, and no doubt helped by North Korea's nuclear test the very day he left Beijing, the new prime minister's approval rating was in the high 70s. Now it has slumped below 40%. That is far from disastrous, by the low standards of the ten forgettable prime ministers Japan endured between 1987 and 2001. But it is poor by the standards of the starry Mr Koizumi, who took office in that year and remained popular for most of his five-year term. And it is dangerous for two bigger reasons: there are local elections for prefectural governors and city mayors in April, and a critical set of elections for parliament's Upper House in July, in which the government's majority could be at stake; and there is a mood for revenge among the many older Liberal Democrats who feel Mr Abe leapfrogged them to gain the leadership last September.
The Japanese public has turned against Mr Abe not because of foreign policy or historical debates but for economic reasons. For all the government's boasts that Japan is enjoying its longest period of growth since 1945, the Japanese are not feeling much benefit in their purses and wallets. The boast is true only if you ignore deflation, and while ordinary Japanese like falling prices, they do not like the fact that their incomes have risen only slowly--as much because of longer hours worked as because of higher wages. In nominal terms (ie, not adjusted for price changes), Japanese output remains below that of 1997. Recent economic growth has produced record company profits, but a tight labour market has not seen wages rise much. In this respect, things were no better under Mr Koizumi, but at least he seemed to be doing something about it by shaking things up. By comparison, Mr Abe looks clueless.
Dreaming of Lionheart
Actually, his problem is subtler than mere cluelessness. He is torn between dealing with the politically potent topic of inequality--in an ageing Japan, the income gap is widening--and making further reforms to encourage future growth. The only thing he has done so far has made both problems worse, however: his government clamped down on the interest rates chargeable by consumer-finance companies on loans to Japan's poorest borrowers. This looked popular, but some say it has choked off their borrowing and helped to depress consumer spending. 
Worse still, when he has had a political clue it has led him in the wrong direction. Mr Koizumi pulled off the remarkable trick of attacking his own political party, eventually kicking out LDP Diet members when they rebelled against his flagship programme of postal privatisation. That laid the ground for his triumph in the 2005 general election. Mr Abe, keen to curry favour with his party's old guard, has now readmitted 11 of the rebels. At a stroke, that has changed his public odour from breath of fresh air to the usual LDP halitosis.
Whether he will actually be dumped, however, depends on how badly the LDP fares in the July Upper House elections. Fortunately for Mr Abe, the opposition Democratic Party of Japan is also in disarray, with its leader, Ichiro Ozawa, in poor health and at war with his own colleagues. Yet that may not save Mr Abe, such is the mood against him. Strange stories have been circulating about how cabinet ministers have so little respect for him that they do not bother to stand up when he enters the room. The rival most often mentioned as his budding successor is Taro Aso, the bumptious foreign minister, who is also a conservative and currently cuts a more dashing figure than his boss. 
Another name, though, is increasingly being whispered: Junichiro Koizumi.

WHEN he signed a security pact with Australia this week, Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister, at a stroke doubled the number of Japan's allies. Until now, Japan has had formal security ties only with America, under whose protection Japan, with a pacifist constitution, has sat since the second world war.
Even if it falls well short of a mutual-defence treaty, to some Australians the agreement signed by John Howard in Tokyo on March 13th is unwarranted. After all, Japan came close to invading their country during the war; Australian prisoners-of-war were brutally treated in Japanese camps; and only a couple of weeks ago Mr Abe had brought ignominy upon himself by denying that foreign ""comfort women"" had been coerced into working in wartime military brothels. Elderly Australian women are among those who have testified otherwise. Yet the world moves on and in Mr Howard's view ""Australia has no better friend or more reliable partner within the Asia-Pacific region than Japan."" Mr Abe spoke of a ""shared destiny"". 
So if it is now important that the two countries be allies, the natural question is, against whom? To ask this, both sides insist with prim faces, is entirely to miss the point. Co-operation between the two countries has deepened on several levels. Until last July, Australian troops had protected Japanese ones doing reconstruction work in southern Iraq. Nearer to home, peacekeeping troops have worked side-by-side in Cambodia and Timor-Leste. 
Alexander Downer, the Australian foreign minister whose own father was a prisoner of the Japanese for more than three years, talks up their co-operation in disaster assistance after the Indian Ocean tsunami of late 2004. The two countries' aid programmes in Asia have shared objectives. Thus the agreement's provisions for regular meetings involving the two sides' foreign and defence ministers, joint military exercises, and more formal arrangements for sharing information would all improve humanitarian missions. 
A security agreement is a symbolic way of building up those new aspects of the relationship, says Mr Downer. The two sides will also negotiate a free-trade agreement to strengthen economic ties. All good stuff. But the louder the denials from both sides, the more evident is the main catalyst for the security pact: the rise of China.
That may come as a surprise to some. Australia has often had to defend itself against charges from human-rights groups and others of sacrificing democratic principles for profits in its dealings with China, which has an inexhaustible appetite for the commodities, such as iron ore and uranium, that Australia is able to supply. But as an Australian diplomat explains: ""China is a good, constructive commercial partner, but in terms of ideas and values, it will never be anywhere near as close to us as Japan. Its quite clear: Japan is our best friend in Asia.""
Australia's security posture has long been a cause for wariness in China, particularly because of its alliance with America and the possibility that Australia might come to America's aid in a war with China over Taiwan. Still, as long as the new pact does not imply Australian support for Japan in its territorial disputes with China in the East China Sea, China's government will attempt to hide its displeasure. Economic ties come first.
As for Mr Abe, the pact is of a piece with a more robust foreign policy for Japan that was begun by his predecessor, Junichiro Koizumi. Before sending troops to Iraq, Mr Koizumi had also dispatched supply ships from Japan's so-called Self-Defence Forces to the Indian Ocean to help with the war in Afghanistan in 2001. 
Since he came to office last September, Mr Abe has redoubled Mr Koizumi's commitment to Japan's alliance with the United States, but wants to do more than just shelter under America's wing. He has pushed for faster deployment of missile-defence systems in the face of North Korean provocation. He has turned the Japanese Defence Agency into a full ministry, with a seat in the cabinet. And he wants the pacifist article nine of the constitution to be revised. Mr Abe has sought a new partnership with India, while building security ties with South-East Asia. 
It all amounts to a strategy of balancing China's geopolitical reach: Japan, in other words, is not about to roll on its back to let China be the region's top dog. Mr Abe's domestic ineptitude may mean a short term in office, as the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and its coalition partner face crucial elections for parliament's upper house in July. Even if so, Japan's emerging regional posture is likely to survive him.","But China has reason to suspect Japan 's military flirtation with Australia 
 WHEN he signed a security pact with Australia this week , Shinzo Abe , the Japanese prime minister , at a stroke doubled the number of Japan 's allies . Until now , Japan has had formal security ties only with America , under whose protection Japan , with a pacifist constitution , has sat since the second world war . 
 Even if it falls well short of a mutual - defence treaty , to some Australians the agreement signed by John Howard in Tokyo on March 13th is unwarranted . After all , Japan came close to invading their country during the war ; Australian prisoners - of - war were brutally treated in Japanese camps ; and only a couple of weeks ago Mr Abe had brought ignominy upon himself by denying that foreign "" comfort women "" had been coerced into working in wartime military brothels . Elderly Australian women are among those who have testified otherwise . Yet the world moves on and in Mr Howard 's view "" Australia has no better friend or more reliable partner within the Asia - Pacific region than Japan . "" Mr Abe spoke of a "" shared destiny "" . 
 So if it is now important that the two countries be allies , the natural question is , against whom ? To ask this , both sides insist with prim faces , is entirely to miss the point . Co - operation between the two countries has deepened on several levels . Until last July , Australian troops had protected Japanese ones doing reconstruction work in southern Iraq . Nearer to home , peacekeeping troops have worked side - by - side in Cambodia and Timor - Leste . 
 Alexander Downer , the Australian foreign minister whose own father was a prisoner of the Japanese for more than three years , talks up their co - operation in disaster assistance after the Indian Ocean tsunami of late 2004 . The two countries ' aid programmes in Asia have shared objectives . Thus the agreement 's provisions for regular meetings involving the two sides ' foreign and defence ministers , joint military exercises , and more formal arrangements for sharing information would all improve humanitarian missions . 
 A security agreement is a symbolic way of building up those new aspects of the relationship , says Mr Downer . The two sides will also negotiate a free - trade agreement to strengthen economic ties . All good stuff . But the louder the denials from both sides , the more evident is the main catalyst for the security pact : the rise of China . 
 That may come as a surprise to some . Australia has often had to defend itself against charges from human - rights groups and others of sacrificing democratic principles for profits in its dealings with China , which has an inexhaustible appetite for the commodities , such as iron ore and uranium , that Australia is able to supply . But as an Australian diplomat explains : "" China is a good , constructive commercial partner , but in terms of ideas and values , it will never be anywhere near as close to us as Japan . Its quite clear : Japan is our best friend in Asia . ""

""LET us imagine"", says Lin Chong-pin, president of Taiwan's Foundation on International and Cross-Strait Studies, ""how President Hu Jintao in his dreams might wish the opening of his Beijing Olympics to be."" Not only, says Mr Lin, will he have brought the world's finest athletes there, but also its artists and celebrities. So far, so plausible. He will also have, on his right hand, the leader of the communists' civil-war foe, the Kuomintang, newly elected in the spring of 2008 as president of Taiwan. And on his left a beaming Dalai Lama, thankful to be back on Chinese soil once more after an exile of nearly 50 years. ""It would"", says Mr Lin, ""be the heavenly dynasty all over again, and the barbarians coming to worship."" That this happy vision, though technically possible, is still implausible provides insights into the paradox of China's rise.
On the one hand, China appears over the past decade to have signed up wholeheartedly to an international order, of globalised trade and rules-based relations among states, that was not of its making--even as America, the chief architect of that order, has partly walked away from it, with its ""coalitions of the willing"" and growing opposition to unfettered trade.
China has signed up because it realises it is probably globalisation's greatest beneficiary. This, more than anything, explains the country's remarkable levelheadedness in its dealings with the United States ever since the last crisis in bilateral relations, in 2001, when an American spy plane collided with a Chinese fighter. The levelheadedness has paid off. For as American power has been distracted in the Middle East, so Chinese power has moved up. 
A touch of the diabolic
On the other hand, Chinese intentions about what to do with its power in the long run remain deeply ambiguous. If China sees its constellation as heavenly--and the Chinese, like the Americans and the French, have a sense of manifest destiny--neighbours see hints of the diabolic.
Perhaps the growth in the military budget reflects China's growing wealth and prestige, along with a desire to protect its rising shipments of oil and other commodities: the country seems bent on building a blue-water navy. Understandable, perhaps, within China's terms of reference, to have a military strength capable of deterring Taiwan from declaring independence. But why missiles with a range to hit Japan? Why, in January, did China test-fire a rocket to destroy an old weather satellite, when it insists no one is more committed to the peaceful development of space? And why, last autumn, did a Chinese submarine suddenly pop up next to the Kitty Hawk, an American aircraft carrier? 
Equally, what is China doing building roads, ports and pipelines in Myanmar and Pakistan, connecting west and south-west China with the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean? The point could simply be to help the development of backward Chinese regions. But these links could equally serve as future supply routes for the Chinese navy. For Brahma Chellaney, at the Centre for Policy Research in Delhi, the conclusion is plain: along with the planned extension of the new Qinghai-Lhasa railway, which could in theory bring military material up quickly to the Tibetan border, ""it amounts to a strategic squeeze of India.""
India's government is less willing than some of its intellectuals to see China's actions as a strategic squeeze. Nevertheless, it is trying to balance China's advances. Noting that the West's abandonment of Myanmar in the absence of democratic change opened the way for Chinese influence, India is trying to make its own advances to the awful regime there. ASEAN is doing the same. 
Thus China's rise is quietly bringing about an opposite, if not yet equal, reaction. Japan's relations with China are much improved since the anti-Japanese riots two years ago sparked by visits by the then prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, to Yasukuni, Tokyo's militarist war shrine. As soon as Shinzo Abe became prime minister last September, he made a fence-mending trip to Beijing. North Korea's nuclear games may also have pushed Japan and China closer. 
As for Taiwan, China currently calculates that in next year's presidential election a pliable Ma Ying-jeou, the KMT's favoured son, will succeed the independence-minded Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party. Mr Ma's election prospects, however, have got murkier since his indictment in February over alleged misuse of funds during his time as Taipei's mayor. And even if he does win, China may face disappointments. 
It believes it has an understanding with the KMT (whose elder statesman, Lien Chan, visited the mainland in a groundbreaking trip two years ago) that Taiwan is a part of China. Certainly, Mr Ma says he will push for closer economic co-operation and wants Taiwan to be a ""peacemaker not a troublemaker"". But he also says the Taiwanese want to keep the status quo--in other words, a sovereign Taiwan that is independent in all but name. ""We will not pursue talks on reunification,"" Mr Ma insists. ""The matter will have to wait until the mainland becomes democratic and prosperous.""
The home front
Doubts about China's intentions, however, stem perhaps less from its actions overseas than the values that underpin its behaviour at home. After all, China's political and economic affairs are still run with what is essentially a Leninist apparatus of state. The state's instinct is to co-opt those within the empire who question the political orthodoxy--or if that does not work, to deal with them harshly. Thus the Dalai Lama is vilified, and Tibetans are demeaned in their own land. Over Taiwan, China reserves the right to nuke what it says are its own people.
As the Dalai Lama puts it: ""Mr Hu's constant emphasis on a 'harmonious society' suggests that something is missing."" China is wracked by social inequality, environmental damage and government corruption. Beijing's preparations for the Olympics are a heart-rending metaphor for this. The games have provided a pretext for an orgy of official corruption and cultural vandalism which in a few brief years has all but destroyed a unique historical city. A few scraps have been left for touristic consumption. Beijing's inhabitants have been shunted into tower blocks on the city's edges. In their place rise vast bombastic structures, architects' and politicians' self-indulgences with no civic context.
A constant theme heard from thoughtful Chinese is that China's rise lacks a moral underpinning, and that a moral vacuum lies at the heart of Chinese life. The Dalai Lama puts the blame on the Communist Party's ""radical atheism"" and predicts that ""sooner or later, a spiritual or moral culture will have to come to fill an internal emptiness; externally, there will have to be rule of law, democracy, freedom of the press.""
A slow enriching of both public and private life may already be under way. Non-government organisations to tackle social and environmental issues have grown hugely in number since earlier this decade. Some corners of the press have pushed the frontiers of what they can write about. And across China evidence is growing of a resurgence of spiritual and religious inquiry. 
All the same, raw and volatile forms of nationalism lurk just beneath a usually placid surface. They erupted in 1999 when NATO bombs struck the Chinese embassy in Belgrade during the Kosovo war, and again in anti-Japanese riots in the spring of 2005. Internet chatrooms are full of vituperative anti-foreign sentiment.
The memories of past horrors in China--foreign occupation, civil war, the cultural revolution--have made older Chinese generations into advocates of a peaceful region. All the same, the current leaders ignore popular sentiment at their peril. Passing on the lessons of history to a younger, more nationalistic generation that never experienced horrors at first hand is China's ""big problem"", says Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's elder statesman.
All this feeds into the neighbours' surviving suspicions about China's intentions, despite a decade-long charm offensive. So long as China is not satisfied within its own borders, how can it be satisfied in the world?
In the long run, this will place limits on Chinese power and influence. It is not just America's allies such as Japan and Taiwan that want it to stick around for a long while yet. ASEAN countries also need the United States to balance China. Singapore recently signed an agreement allowing American forces greater access; Indonesia and America have resumed bilateral military contacts; and Vietnam wants to forge a strategic alliance with its former enemy.
There is also, Thailand's recent military coup notwithstanding, Asia's general embrace of democracy. Michael Green of Georgetown University, a former Asia director at America's National Security Council, sees it as a tremendous potential source of ""soft"" power for America. Whereas China rigidly sticks to its policy of non-interference in the affairs of other nations, ASEAN has moved on. Malaysia's prime minister, Abdullah Badawi, says ASEAN's hallowed principle of non-interference must be ""updated"". A new draft of ASEAN's governing charter says that regional stability rests on ""the active strengthening of democratic values, good governance, the rule of law"", and so on.
Such sentiments around Asia might, at the very least, stand in quiet opposition to Chinese power. But if China embraced some of them for itself, who can guess at the limits to its celestial realm?

THE way the Chinese like to put it, the trip to Beijing last October by Japan's new prime minister, Shinzo Abe, ""broke the ice"". The two countries' relationship had been plunged into the chiller by the provocative visits of Mr Abe's predecessor, Junichiro Koizumi, to Yasukuni, the Tokyo war shrine that glorifies Japan's militarist past. Now, the trip that Wen Jiabao will make to Tokyo and Kyoto on April 11th-13th, the first visit to Japan in more than six years by a Chinese prime minister, will be the ""ice-melter"". Optimism abounds on both sides. But it is wishful thinking to expect the problems between Asia's two biggest powers to be reduced to a few puddles of warm water.
For now, China is determined to do everything to make Mr Wen's trip a success. Take the issue of the so-called ""comfort women"". Mr Abe has in the past month caught himself up in an uncalled-for furore by refusing to admit that the Japanese imperial army coerced Korean, Chinese and other women to work in brothels in the second world war. This managed to offend even Japan's staunch ally, the United States. Yet the Chinese government, usually quick to take historical offence, has studiously ignored the fuss. Indeed, over more recent abductions that Mr Abe cares very deeply about--of ordinary Japanese kidnapped by North Korea during the 1970s and 1980s--Mr Wen himself expresses sympathy for Japanese concerns.
As for the Yasukuni shrine, to which Mr Abe has traditionally been a more committed visitor than has Mr Koizumi, the Chinese believe that they have an understanding from him that he will not go while he is prime minister. Afterwards, says one Chinese policymaker, he can even go and live at Yasukuni, for all the Chinese will care.
If this minimum requirement--no prime ministerial visit, or at least no public one, to Yasukuni--is met, then the Chinese government seems determined to build a new ""strategic partnership"". Japan seems inclined to reciprocate. In a surprisingly short time, a wide range of topics has come up: economic and environmental co-operation; mechanisms to ease territorial disputes in the East China Sea, complicated by possibly large deposits of gas and oil; even confidence-building measures between the two countries' armed forces.
Mr Wen's visit will formalise a new cabinet-level dialogue on economic co-operation. In addition, Japanese firms will be offered the chance to bid for nuclear-power projects, as well as for parts of proposed high-speed railway lines between Beijing and Shanghai, Beijing and Wuhan, and Dalian and Harbin in Manchuria--whose railways imperial Japan once controlled. Japanese investment and know-how will be sought for environmental projects, including on energy efficiency.
The dispute in the East China Sea is potentially explosive. The hydrocarbon deposits fall on both sides of the median line between the two countries that Japan says should be the boundary between their respective exclusive economic zones. China does not recognise the boundary, and is already extracting gas from a field which straddles it. Progress over the dispute appears slow--a seventh round of bilateral talks ended last week in Tokyo. Yet participants say that understandings have been reached in important areas. In particular, China has accepted that the solution lies not in focusing on prickly issues of territoriality, but on joint development of the disputed fields. The haggling is now over precisely which areas should be developed. Meanwhile, Chinese officials say their vessels carefully avoid crossing the disputed boundary. There is talk of establishing a hotline between the Japan Coast Guard and the China National Oceanic Bureau, to co-ordinate search-and-rescue missions in an increasingly crowded sea.
Dates, damn dates
Military relations also appear to be warming. A similar hotline is expected between the two countries' navies, partly in order to prevent incidents such as accidental collisions at sea from escalating. Defence ministers plan reciprocal visits. The official Chinese press also reflects the new warmth. Nanfeng Chuang, a weekly magazine, reported on April 1st that Japan ""naturally"" had concerns about China's military expansion, given its territorial disputes with its neighbour--a departure in the press from the usual claims of a resurgent Japanese militarism. Now there is talk of an official visit to Japan later this year by the Chinese navy, with the prospect (hard, until recently, to imagine) of the five-starred red flag flying in Tokyo Bay.
In a rare honour, Mr Wen has been invited to address Japan's parliament, where he will suggest that China is rising, but along a peaceful incline; he will invite Japan to share it. As well as meeting politicians and Emperor Akihito, Mr Wen has asked to chat to students and farmers. He is also to meet the head of Soka Gakkai, Japan's largest Buddhist organisation, with 8m households. The charm offensive, says a Chinese diplomat, is meant to show people that China has a ""new idea"" about Japan. This is unlikely ever to extend to support for Japan's bid for a permanent seat on the United Nations' Security Council. But with so many other obstacles blocking UNSC reform, that can be overlooked.
China's push for better relations involves some political risk at home--and not least because Mr Abe, having opened to China, has to survive upper-house elections in the summer. The months ahead are studded with sensitive anniversaries related to Japan's wartime depredations in China. Any of these could rekindle the anti-Japanese sentiment that erupted into unruly demonstrations in 2005. China's state media emphasise that this year should be celebrated as the 35th anniversary of ""normalised"" relations with Japan. Yet ordinary people are more likely to note that July 7th will be the 70th anniversary of the start of Japan's all-out invasion, and December 13th that of Japan's worst atrocity in China, the Nanjing massacre. Last month an adviser to China's parliament proposed that September 18th be named as a ""day of national calamity"" because of Japan's occupation of Manchuria beginning on that day in 1931. The icebergs are melting, but historical issues still make up their underwater mass.","A concerted effort to improve relations in the shadow of historical grudges

There is talk of establishing a hotline between the Japan Coast Guard and the China National Oceanic Bureau , to co - ordinate search - and - rescue missions in an increasingly crowded sea . 
 Dates , damn dates 
 Military relations also appear to be warming . A similar hotline is expected between the two countries ' navies , partly in order to prevent incidents such as accidental collisions at sea from escalating . Defence ministers plan reciprocal visits . The official Chinese press also reflects the new warmth . Nanfeng Chuang , a weekly magazine , reported on April 1st that Japan "" naturally "" had concerns about China 's military expansion , given its territorial disputes with its neighbour -- a departure in the press from the usual claims of a resurgent Japanese militarism . Now there is talk of an official visit to Japan later this year by the Chinese navy , with the prospect ( hard , until recently , to imagine ) of the five - starred red flag flying in Tokyo Bay . 
 In a rare honour , Mr Wen has been invited to address Japan 's parliament , where he will suggest that China is rising , but along a peaceful incline ; he will invite Japan to share it . As well as meeting politicians and Emperor Akihito , Mr Wen has asked to chat to students and farmers . He is also to meet the head of Soka Gakkai , Japan 's largest Buddhist organisation , with 8 m households . The charm offensive , says a Chinese diplomat , is meant to show people that China has a "" new idea "" about Japan . This is unlikely ever to extend to support for Japan 's bid for a permanent seat on the United Nations ' Security Council . But with so many other obstacles blocking UNSC reform , that can be overlooked . 
 China 's push for better relations involves some political risk at home -- and not least because Mr Abe , having opened to China , has to survive upper - house elections in the summer . The months ahead are studded with sensitive anniversaries related to Japan 's wartime depredations in China . Any of these could rekindle the anti - Japanese sentiment that erupted into unruly demonstrations in 2005 . China 's state media emphasise that this year should be celebrated as the 35th anniversary of "" normalised "" relations with Japan . Yet ordinary people are more likely to note that July 7th will be the 70th anniversary of the start of Japan 's all - out invasion , and December 13th that of Japan 's worst atrocity in China , the Nanjing massacre . Last month an adviser to China 's parliament proposed that September 18th be named as a "" day of national calamity "" because of Japan 's occupation of Manchuria beginning on that day in 1931 .

SINCE becoming prime minister last September, Shinzo Abe has done plenty of travelling. Straight off, he made a fence-mending trip to China and South Korea, with whom Japan's relations had deteriorated under his predecessor, Junichiro Koizumi. In January he visited Europe, chiefly to emphasise that Japan was a staunch democratic partner on NATO's eastern flank. This week, shortly after visiting Washington for talks with George Bush, he toured the Middle East, the fount of more than three-quarters of Japan's oil.
Mr Abe's men say his travels paint an emerging vision: while the alliance with America remains the cornerstone of Japan's security policy, Mr Abe is also pushing once-passive Japan to pursue its own, more muscular course. For in Asia, says an official, Japan is playing ""a huge great game"" in which it must compete with a rising China and a newly confident Russia for resources, power and prestige.
His first trip as prime minister to meet Mr Bush was overshadowed by Mr Abe's comments, in March, questioning the Japanese army's wartime role in forcing women into military brothels (see next article). Howls of international protest forced him into a sort-of apology. He repeated it to Mr Bush, who ""accepted"" it--as if the president spoke for the victims. This choreographed pas de deux prevented the issue overwhelming all others.
Mr Bush warmly approves of Mr Abe's fence-mending with neighbours who had been antagonised by Mr Koizumi's provocative visits to Yasukuni, Tokyo's war shrine. America needs Chinese co-operation, even leadership, in dealing with a North Korea that went nuclear last October. And in the longer run, it wants to tie China in as a ""responsible stakeholder"" of the international system. Neither goal is served if Japan riles its neighbours with high-handedness over its wartime past.
Mr Abe was welcomed, too, for insisting that Japan should play an ever more energetic role in the alliance. After he left Washington last weekend, Japan's foreign minister, Taro Aso, and the defence minister, Fumio Kyuma, sat down with their American counterparts, Condoleezza Rice and Robert Gates. With North Korea's missiles in mind, the Americans emphasised their country's commitment to defend Japan against conventional and nuclear threats--in effect reaffirming that Japan is protected by America's nuclear umbrella.
America also promised to bring forward the deployment by Japan of two American-made anti-ballistic missile systems. And with a view as much towards China's military rise as the North Korean threat, America even hinted it might sell Japan the advanced F-22 Raptor stealth fighter (though it later backtracked).
Japan is keen to play a greater part in its own defence, including through increased military co-operation. However, this has been hampered by the Japanese government's interpretation of the constitution. In particular, collective self-defence has been ruled out of bounds. As things stand, for instance, Japan may not shoot down a North Korean missile headed for the United States, or come to the aid of an American ship under attack. However, before his American visit Mr Abe's government announced a review of the interpretation.
A right to collective self-defence underpins Mr Abe's broader ambition, which is to ensure that Japan can play a bigger role in international security. As an example of the constraints, Japan's 600 ground troops deployed in Iraq until last year were unable to use force. On May 3rd, the Japanese constitution's 60th anniversary, Mr Abe proposed rewriting it--including perhaps the clause declaring Japan pacifist.
Japan's great game is dressed up in the values of humanitarianism, democracy and the rule of law. It seeks closer ties with democratic India and recently formalised a security alliance of sorts, only Japan's second, with Australia. Mr Aso speaks of an ""arc of freedom and prosperity"" from Japan, swinging through India via moderate Middle Eastern states into Europe. China and Russia, unsurprisingly, see this as a bid to contain them.
However, Mr Abe's trip to the Gulf this week illustrated how pragmatism is lurking behind the facade of Japan's talk of spreading democracy. While China is signing energy deals around the world, cosying up to even the nastiest regimes, Japan's attempts to secure its long-term oil supplies have gone awry. Last autumn the Iranians forced it to cut sharply its stake in the Azadegan oilfield in Iran, in which it had invested much time and money. Shortly after, Japanese stakes in the huge Sakhalin-2 gas project were slashed when the Russian state muscled in. Japanese concessions in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have also been lost.
So this week Mr Abe sought to restore his country's supply lines. A deal was announced that gives Saudi Arabia oil-storage facilities on Japan's southern island of Okinawa in return for preferential Japanese access to them in emergencies. The Japan Bank for International Co-operation announced a $1 billion loan to Abu Dhabi as a downpayment on long-term oil contracts. Mr Abe did not upset his hosts with any unwelcome talk about democracy but he did propose a more active, ""multi-layered"" relationship with the region, for example offering Japan as an honest broker in the Arab-Israeli conflict. His mixture of idealism and pragmatism, added to a more confident style at home, seems to be doing him some good. For the first time since he came to office, the Nikkei daily reports, the prime minister's hitherto dismal approval ratings have risen.","Shinzo Abe wants a more assertive foreign policy but Japan 's energy dependence is forcing it to be more pragmatic

A COUPLE of months ago, Shinzo Abe was being written off as yet another of Japan's many short-lived, forgettable prime ministers. Today pundits are scrambling to unwrite their articles of dismissal. Mr Abe himself talks about serving five years. His popularity ratings have recovered after a plunge that began almost from the moment he took office last September. And whereas earlier this year the secretary-general of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) upbraided cabinet members for not standing up or stopping chatting when the prime minister entered the room, today even his enemies in the LDP think Mr Abe might turn out to be an asset, rather than a liability to the government in this year's most important political battle, the election in July for half the seats in parliament's upper house.
Mr Abe's term started splendidly enough, when he went to Beijing and Seoul to mend rifts that his charismatic predecessor, Junichiro Koizumi, had helped widen. At 52, Mr Abe was relatively youthful. He talked of restoring the country's self-respect and sounded tough over the emotive issue of Japanese kidnapped during the 1970s and 1980s by North Korea. Above all, he promised to carry on Mr Koizumi's reforms.
But then Mr Abe began to lose fans and not influence people. He readmitted to the LDP 11 politicians whom Mr Koizumi had expelled for voting against his main reform, the privatisation of the postal-savings system. That suggested Mr Abe preferred back-room politics to pushing for change. His new minister for deregulation was exposed for fiddling expenses, and had to resign. His health minister, Hakuo Yanagisawa, said the main function of Japanese women in an era of population decline should be as ""breeding machines"". And in early March Mr Abe himself sparked a furore by denying that Japan's Imperial Army had forced possibly hundreds of thousands of women, mainly from Korea, China and Taiwan, into sexual slavery during the second world war.
The turnaround in Mr Abe's fortunes appears to have begun in April. During the first visit in over six years by a Chinese prime minister, Wen Jiabao's fixed grin was the visible sign of how much relations had improved between the two countries. It suggested that Mr Abe was justified in thinking Japan could be more assertive yet have better relations with neighbours.
More importantly, he seems to be choosing some useful fights at home over reform. He has trained his sights on amakudari--literally ""descent from heaven"", the practice of finding cushy jobs for retiring bureaucrats in the industries they once regulated. The practice reinforces bid-rigging and other corrupt practices.
The government envisages banning contacts between ministries and organisations into which bureaucrats are typically parachuted, and creating an independent job-placement agency. These proposals are unlikely to win parliamentary approval before the upper-house election. Senior bureaucrats and their political supporters have already expressed indignation about them. Yet the initiative shows a certain Koizumi-like flair. It identifies a target for reform, flushes out resistance, and allows the prime minister to define himself by attacking the old-guard opposition within his party.
Sadakazu Tanigaki, Mr Koizumi's last finance minister and a rival to Mr Abe for the LDP leadership, argues that ""the prime minister is not doing enough to tackle pragmatic issues"", preferring to concentrate on things like ""patriotic education"", changing the pacifist constitution and what Mr Abe calls, with the greatest vagueness, ""shedding the postwar regime"". The prime minister's backers reply that Mr Abe's pragmatic side will soon be on view.
The government is keen to make Tokyo's backward financial markets more competitive, which would boost the local economy and help raise pitifully low rates of return for savers. On May 16th, after months of discussion, Mr Abe approved an initiative to deregulate Japan's aviation market, speed up customs procedures, inject a smidgen of entrepreneurialism into Japanese agriculture and boost foreign direct investment. On May 24th he was expected to lay out proposals for how Japan can do its bit to cut global greenhouse-gas emissions in half by 2050.
Whether such initiatives gain much traction remains unclear. And even if they do, not everyone thinks the turnaround in Mr Abe's fortunes will necessarily help the ruling coalition in the July election. Local races are decided on the strength of the candidates and their organisations as well as on government policy. But assuming the ruling party can cobble together a majority in the upper house, Mr Abe's prospects of remaining prime minister have just got brighter.","After a lamentable start , the prime minister gets his mojo back

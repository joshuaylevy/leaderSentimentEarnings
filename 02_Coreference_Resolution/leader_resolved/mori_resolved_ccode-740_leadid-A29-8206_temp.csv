ALTHOUGH Tony Blair has his detractors, nobody expects Britons to be burning his effigy 400 years hence. And yet Mr Blair, with his parliamentary majority of 176, is setting off a bigger bang under the British constitution than Guy Fawkes ever contrived with all his sacks of gunpowder. Unlike the Gunpowder Plot, Mr Blair's attempt to rearrange the British constitution cannot be given a single neat date. It has not come as one big bang but in a dozen bills pushed piecemeal through Parliament over more than two years. Because these bills have come into force at different times, and because the British people tend to be bored by constitutional matters, some have attracted less attention than they deserve. But, as our survey after page 56 argues, their cumulative impact will be revolutionary. They will eventually change not only the way in which Britain is governed but also the meaning_ of ""Britain"" itself. 
This will be true even if Mr Blair's devolution of power to new parliamentary bodies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland does not one day result, as it may, in an independent Scotland or a united Ireland. Merely by summoning these bodies into being, he has undermined the supremacy of the Westminster Parliament, which many hold to be the one fixed point in Britain's constitution. Lawyers may argue that the doctrine had already been breached by the Treaty of Rome, which led to the European Union, or that the law still empowers Westminster to dissolve the new institutions it has created. But legal quibbles count for little when set against the political fact that Britain's central government has given away powers that it will never dare to take back now that devolution has been consecrated by referendums. 
Mr Blair's political opponents, especially those in the Conservative Party, cannot decide whether to portray these and other constitutional changes as an act of careless vandalism or as a deliberate plot to destroy a political union that has worked well for almost 300 years. Either way, they accuse New Labour of leading Britain to the brink of disintegration. It is threatened from below by separatist sentiment in the Celtic fringe. It is threatened from above by the European Union's inexorable whittling away of British economic and political sovereignty. In the meantime, the Conservatives say, the central institutions that pinned the union together-including the very Parliament which Winston Churchill once described as ""the shrine of the world's liberties""-are being weakened by ill-advised reforms such as the removal of the hereditary peers from the House of Lords with little or no thought as to who or what will replace them. 
The opposition exaggerates, as oppositions are wont to. And yet, in one sense, much of what the Tories say is true. A MORI poll published in our survey this week contains a startling finding. It is that 44% of people in Britain expect the European Parliament and Eu to have most power over their lives in 20 years' time, compared with only 22% who think that the Westminster Parliament will have most power. In Scotland, only 8% of respondents expect Westminster to remain dominant. It seems altogether possible that the Scots will one day abandon the partnership they forged with England when it was a rising power in the 18th century for a new one with the European Union. 
In another sense, Mr Blair's critics are wrong. Some of his reforms may be unstable. For example, Scotland is overrepresented in British politics, an unfairness which the English majority may well come to resent. The reforms are also incomplete: it would, for example, be a scandal if Mr Blair were to confine his reform of the upper house to eliminating the hereditary peers, who had no business being there but did at least offer some small independent check on an over-mighty executive. But these defects argue for remedies, not against having started along the path of reform in the first place. 
Vandal versus control freak 
Conservatives are right to prize Britain's history of political stability. But stability is not the same as standing still. One thing that has made Britain stable has been its readiness to embrace change, for example by the widening of the franchise which ushered in mass democracy. A bitter exception was the refusal to grant home rule to Ireland, a mistake which Mr Blair has had the wisdom to avoid in Scotland. When New Labour took power in 1997, the constitution was ripe for change. Respect for Parliament had fallen to all-time lows; the Scots were alienated; local government was in a mess; civil rights were inadequately protected. Above all, Britain's constitution had long vested too much power in the executive, unchecked by a robust legislature or independent judiciary. 
Seen this way, the disturbing thing about Mr Blair is not his constitutional activism. It is the opposite: the impression he gives of having introduced reform without enthusiasm, as an unwanted inheritance from Old Labour, which rubs against his centralising instincts, and which he now considers complete. That is why the prime minister devolves power to the Celtic fringe but not to England or its regions; offers London an elected mayor but tries to block the most popular candidate; half-reforms the Lords but spares the Commons, which matters far more. Mr Blair's weakness is that there is too little of Guy Fawkes in him, not too much. ","The prime minister is a radical constitutional reformer-and yet a strangely reluctant one

HOW to describe what is happening to Britain? Let's start with the flag, and then move-via a psychiatrist's couch-to discussing a skeleton. 
In 1997, British Airways decided to scrub the Union Jack off the tails of its airliners and replace Britain's flag with pictures of jackals from Africa and other ethnic designs. Its chief executive, Bob Ayling, said that the airline was no longer a British company with global operations, but a global company that happened to be headquartered in Britain: ""We are proud to have been born and raised in Britain,"" he explained. ""But we want to show Britain as modem, not imperial... We still have our Beefeaters, but we now lead the world in restaurants and in fashion."" 
With 600 of his business coming from nonBritish customers, you can see what Mr Ayling was worried about. Lady Thatcher couldn't. The former prime minister made her displeasure known by draping her handkerchief over a model of the offending tail wing. 
She may have been more squeamish than most. Their flag has not lately meant much to the British. It is common in America for suburban flagpoles to sport Old Glory. In Britain, a householder who planted the Union Jack on his lawn would strike neighbours as barmy, or as a member of some rightwing sect. After Tony Blair's election in May 1997, Labour Party officials handed out little Union jacks to party workers, who waved them on his arrival in Downing Street. Again, this would not seem out of the ordinary in most other countries. Some British commentators found it contrived, and disturbing. 
why do the British have trouble with their flag? Maybe they have outgrown the need for national emblems. Maybe Britain is as cosmopolitan and relaxed as Mr Ayling wanted his airline to be. But there is a less comforting possibility. After the end of empire, it is possible that this flag no longer does the business. It is, anyway, an odd flag: a superimposition of emblems-the crosses of St George (for England), St Andrew (for Scotland) and St Patrick (for Ireland). This flag reminds Britons that they are not so much a nation, and certainly not an ethnic nation, as a political union of separate nations. 
The flags of the component nations seem to be enjoying a revival. Last summer, Britain launched a daring experiment in devolution. For the first time since 1707, the Scots now have their own Parliament in Edinburgh, and the Welsh their own national assembly in Cardiff. As a result, the Scottish saltire and the red dragon of Wales are much more in evidence. Soccer fans in England have taken to daubing their faces with the red-on-white English cross of St George. ""That flag has been somewhere in the collective memory,"" remarked one writer. ""We all knew it was up in the attic somewhere, but we could not quite remember what it was for."" 
The other flag that is cropping up more commonly in Britain is the star-spangled blue banner of the European Union. Again, the meaning of this flag is mysterious. Like the United Kingdom, the Eu is a political arrangement. But it is an arrangement that keeps on changing-from what many Britons thought would be a mere common market when they joined in 1973 to a nascent political union which is now trying to build a common foreign and defence policy. The star-spangled blue banner is a flag that British people might one day be required to fight and die for. 
Does a muddle over flags signify that Britain is having an identity crisis? Foreigners never tire of Dean Acheson's remark that Britain has lost an empire and never found a role. But the American secretary of state said this way back in 1962, when a lot of British people now slipping into middle age had not even been born. If you put Britain on a psychiatrist's couch today, you would find little trace of postimperial trauma. With the economy humming nicely under a popular government, Britain has seldom seemed less troubled about where it stands in the world. One visiting journalist caught the mood of relaxed hedonism in an article for the New York Times. The British, he reported, had ""finally stopped seeking a role and started getting a life"". 
But what if, instead of putting the whole of Britain on the psychiatrist's couch, you reserved the treatment for its ""chattering classes"" (Britain's disparaging term for its writers, politicians and intellectuals)? You would find a paradox. Just when most people look relaxed about politics, the chatterers are churning out angry books and pamphlets with titles such as ""The Death of Britain"" (by John Redwood, a Conservative politician); ""The Abolition of Britain"" (Peter Hitchens, a right-wing columnist); ""How to be British"" (Charles Moore, editor of a conservative newspaper); ""Who Do We Think We Are?"" (David Willetts, Conservative politician), and so on. As we shall see, it is no coincidence that the bulk of this soul-searching comes from the Conservative end of politics, which Mr Blair's New Labour Party smashed in the 1997 election. But the chatterers are not all on the right. And they are on to something. 
Rearranging a skeleton 
A political union that up-ends its political arrangements is running a risk. In just over two years of office, New Labour has already introduced a dozen constitutional bills. Because they have been pushed piecemeal through Parliament by a government with an overwhelming majority, most have become law with little public controversy. Since their effect will come to be felt at different times, public opinion so far has been fairly untroubled. But their cumulative impact will be revolutionary. 
A state that has been highly centralised is passing power downward (to regions and nations such as Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland), sideways (to the Bank of England, which has been given freedom to set monetary policy) and upward (to the European Union). The House of Commons is booting the hereditary peers out of the House of Lords. New systems of proportional representation have been introduced for elections in Scotland and Wales, and for the European Parliament, in place of Britain's time-honoured system of first-past-the-post. London-which already feels more like an independent republic than a capital city-is to get its first-ever elected mayor. Other cities may follow. 
Even if the programme of constitutional reform were to stop there, all this would add up to what its designers like to call ""a new constitutional settlement"". But it is not going to stop there. Mr Blair has promised at some time (though here he is in no hurry) to hold yet another referendum, this one on whether to extend proportional representation to general elections. That would change the centuryold pattern of British politics. A country in which power has swung like a pendulum between the Conservatives and Labour could become a country of multi-party coalitions. The Conservatives say that Mr Blair is doing this in order to make a permanent alliance with the Liberal Democrats and lock the Tories out of power for ever. 
The pleasing finality of that phrase, ""new constitutional settlement"", is therefore misplaced. There is nothing settled about it. Earlier this year, the Constitution Unit, a think-tank attached to University College, London, predicted that it would take a decade or more for the consequences of Mr Blair's reforms to reveal themselves. And when they do, they may take their own inventor by surprise. 
This is big stuff. So why do so few people care? Partly because of habit. The British people are so little fascinated by the constitution that they never bothered to write one down. When pollsters ask the British what they worry about, the constitution comes a long way behind health, crime or the economy. But this is only part of the explanation. The other is simply a time lag. Mr Blair is changing the skeleton of the constitution. It will take a while for the changes to show up in the body politic. 
The new parliaments and assemblies set up in Scotland, Wales and (if it is ever able to start work) Northern Ireland have not had time to make their presence felt. The English, who make up more than eight out of ten of the British population, were not consulted in the referendums which led to their creation. Moreover, the new bodies have only just started work. Two are dominated by New Labour, so their relations with the New Labour government in Westminster have been fairly smooth. Far from heralding the break-up of the United Kingdom, devolution for Scotland and Wales has so far been a quiet affair, even a bit of a let-down. 
But this is only the beginning. Nobody knows how politics will look when the new parliaments flex their muscles, or when different parties rule in Cardiff, Edinburgh and Westminster. Nor will devolution remain of interest only to the peripheral nations. With power passing downward to the devolved parliaments, and upward to the European Union, it is inevitable that Britain's central political institutions will change as well. 
This could be painful. Britain is a highly centralised state-more so, in the view of Vernon Bogdanor, of Oxford University, even than France, the paradigm of centralised government. He argues that until its recent experiment with devolution, Britain had been, among the stable democracies, the largest of the unitary states apart from Japan. No other democracy sought to manage so large a population through a single parliament. This not only makes the internal devolution of power a difficult thing for Britain to get used to; it compounds its European difficulties as well. ""Our conception of parliamentary sovereignty"", Mr Bogdanor says, ""makes it difficult for us to accommodate ourselves to structures of government, such as that of the European Union, whose raison d'etre is that of power-sharing."" 
Devolution, constitutional reform, the rules of the Eu: these issues do not set conversations on fire in the saloon bar of the Dog and Duck. But add them together, and you find a nation rebuilding its constitutional skeleton from skull to toe. The alterations may be invisible for a while, but people sense the underlying change. In a poll for this survey (see box, page 4), MORI asked which body-their local council or parliament, the Westminster Parliament, or the European Parliament-people in Britain expected to have most influence over their lives in 20 years' time. Almost half (44%) of respondents expected the European Parliament and the EU to have most influence. Less than a quarter plumped for the Parliament in Westminster. Britain is liable to look in the mirror one morning and find that it does not recognise itself any more. ","Is one of the world's most durable states dissolving itself?

THE Millennium Dome was always intended to be a symbol. Tony Blair says that it is meant to ""show Britain as a country confident about the future"". The prime minister's critics have suggested that it is actually a metaphor for the whole New Labour project: a large, grandiose exterior was commissioned, and only afterwards did anyone think about what to put inside it. The dome also gives literal meaning to one of the phrases applied both to New Labour and to the Clintonites in the United States. They are said to practise ""big tent"" politics, in which as many people and groups as possible are signed up to the cause. on the opening night of the dome, even the queen seemed to be briefly enlisted as an extra in the New Labour project. 
But the lukewarm reception for the Millennium Dome is threatening to reflect on the government. Rather than providing a showcase for a modem country and a dynamic government, it is being widely condemned as an incompetently run disappointment. A MORI poll commissioned for The Economist this week shows that the British public seem underwhelmed: 56% of respondents thought the dome should never have been built; only 38% were prepared to pronounce it a success; and fewer than 40% of those asked agreed with Mr Blair's assertion that the millennium evening celebrations in Britain displayed a new sense of ""confidence and optimism"". if the dome was meant to generate a ""feelgood"" factor, it seems-so far-to have failed. 
Part of the problem is that the dome was over-sold from the beginning. Mr Blair declared that it would be ""the greatest show on earth"". it would enter the history books alongside the Great Exhibition Of 1851, which heralded the industrialisation of Britain, and the Festival of Britain Of 1951, which captured the mood of national revival after the second world war. On millennium eve, the prime minister had predicted, the eyes of the world would be on London. Greenwich, the site of the dome, was proclaimed as ""the home of time"" and therefore the natural focus for the world's celebrations. The biggest and best fireworks demonstrations in the world would be along the banks of the Thames. 
The fireworks were indeed memorable and spectacular. But it was notable that the European editions of both Newsweek and Time featured photos of the Eiffel Tower, illuminated by fireworks, on their millennium covers. An atmosphere of low farce hung over the celebrations in London. The London Eye, a giant ferris wheel near the Houses of Parliament was declared open by Mr Blair, but had already been declared too unsafe to operate that night. it is not expected to be operational until the beginning of February. A promised ""river of fire"", shooting along the Thames, never materialised. 
And thousands of guests for the dome's opening night failed to get their tickets on time,and had to queue for hours in a freezing tube station. Since these unfortunates included many B-liSt celebrities and opinion formers, such as the director-general of the BBc and the editor of the Guardian, the dome was off to a bad start in the battle to win over public opinion. 
once inside the big top, some of the opening-night guests were aghast to find that they had been handed tokens entitling them to a free drink of ""Five Alive""-a sort of fruit juice. As they struggled to exchange these for champagne in time for midnight, fights broke out at the bars. The minister responsible for the dome, Lord Falconer, has issued a public apology for the chaos. All parties to the shambles-the government, the police, the New Millennium Experience Company-have spent an undignified week trying to shift the blame. 
The troubles of the dome continued once it opened to receive paying guests. Even some people who had been big supporters of the project pronounced themselves disappointed. Polly Toynbee, a journalist, wrote that: ""It is a deep disappointment. it doesn't work on any level, from the purchase of a cup of coffee to any bit of really good fun."" other commentators were equally downbeat. in retrospect, the warnings of Stephen Bayley, a designer who resigned early from the project, seem prescient. Mr Bayley had given a warning that the design of the dome's contents was too dominated by the concerns of sponsors and politicians, and lacked a single,creative overlord to give it coherence. Many of the 14 ""zones"" have been criticised for preachy content and tacky presentation. 
All this irritation may disappear. The British have a well-deserved reputation for knocking people and projects that they have previously built up. Some visitors seem to like the dome. The Body Zone has drawn favourable notices and long queues. The logistical problems may be ironed out. The dome's opening times have already been extended to allow more people to visit the most popular ""zones"", and more staff (and stiltwalkers) are now on hand to entertain those caught in the notorious queues. 
To some extent the government is protected against a backlash by the fact that the project was originally conceived by the last Conservative government-although Mr Blair could have cancelled it when he came to power. Michael Heseltine was the Tory minister who originally did most to launch the dome. He was there with Mr Blair on new year's eve, and pronounced the whole event a triumph. Since then he has fallen suspiciously silent. 
in fact, many Tories feel that the dome has already been unfairly exploited by New Labour for propaganda purposes. The shadow spokesman for culture, media and sport, Peter Ainsworth, laments the way in which the queen was roped into ""a New Labour spectacular"". Mr Ainsworth also dislikes the ""pedagogic"" approach in most of the zones. Many of them reflect themes close to Mr Blair's heart, such as lifelong learning and flexible working skills. 
Mr Blair has nailed his colours firmly to the dome's (dozen) masts. In the face of the criticism, the government even rashly promised to make London the world centre for future new year's eve celebrations, a pledge that will annoy the Scots. But the Tories will be hoping that the current sense of public disillusionment with the dome may take some of the gloss off the whole New Labour project. ","More than half the British public think it was wrong to build the Millennium Dome. Will this damage the government? 
THE Millennium Dome was always intended to be a symbol. Tony Blair says that it is meant to ""show Britain as a country confident about the future"". The prime minister's critics have suggested that it is actually a metaphor for the whole New Labour project: a large, grandiose exterior was commissioned, and only afterwards did anyone think about what to put inside it. The dome also gives literal meaning to one of the phrases applied both to New Labour and to the Clintonites in the United States. They are said to practise ""big tent"" politics, in which as many people and groups as possible are signed up to the cause. on the opening night of the dome, even the queen seemed to be briefly enlisted as an extra in the New Labour project. 
But the lukewarm reception for the Millennium Dome is threatening to reflect on the government. Rather than providing a showcase for a modem country and a dynamic government, it is being widely condemned as an incompetently run disappointment. A MORI poll commissioned for The Economist this week shows that the British public seem underwhelmed: 56% of respondents thought the dome should never have been built; only 38% were prepared to pronounce it a success; and fewer than 40% of those asked agreed with Mr Blair's assertion that the millennium evening celebrations in Britain displayed a new sense of ""confidence and optimism"". if the dome was meant to generate a ""feelgood"" factor, it seems-so far-to have failed. 
Part of the problem is that the dome was over-sold from the beginning. Mr Blair declared that it would be ""the greatest show on earth"". it would enter the history books alongside the Great Exhibition Of 1851, which heralded the industrialisation of Britain, and the Festival of Britain Of 1951, which captured the mood of national revival after the second world war. On millennium eve, the prime minister had predicted, the eyes of the world would be on London. Greenwich, the site of the dome, was proclaimed as ""the home of time"" and therefore the natural focus for the world's celebrations. The biggest and best fireworks demonstrations in the world would be along the banks of the Thames. 
The fireworks were indeed memorable and spectacular. But it was notable that the European editions of both Newsweek and Time featured photos of the Eiffel Tower, illuminated by fireworks, on their millennium covers. An atmosphere of low farce hung over the celebrations in London. The London Eye, a giant ferris wheel near the Houses of Parliament was declared open by Mr Blair, but had already been declared too unsafe to operate that night. it is not expected to be operational until the beginning of February. A promised ""river of fire"", shooting along the Thames, never materialised. 
And thousands of guests for the dome's opening night failed to get their tickets on time,and had to queue for hours in a freezing tube station. Since these unfortunates included many B-liSt celebrities and opinion formers, such as the director-general of the BBc and the editor of the Guardian, the dome was off to a bad start in the battle to win over public opinion.

THE most far-reaching inquiry into drugs legislation fora quarter of a century will call next month for the decriminalisation of cannabis use and a fundamental shake-up of Britain's drugs laws. The findings of a committee set up by the Police Foundation, an independent research body partly funded by the Home Office, will provoke controversy and put pressure on the government to rethink its approach to drugs. 
The committee is not an official body, but it is widely seen as a quasi-Royal Commission,set up with the tacit encouragement of the government. There are two chief constables among its members, and its secretariat includes former Home Office officials. The inquiry is chaired by Lady Runciman, a former member of the government's Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs. It has spent two-and-a-half years examining the current state of the law. 
The committee has concluded that the 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act is arbitrary and inconsistent, and imposes heavy demands on the criminal justice system to little public benefit. its most controversial recommendation is that possession of cannabis should never attract a prison sentence, but should instead be subject to fines or other penalties. At present possession of cannabis can be punished by up to seven years injail. The latest Home Office figures on sentencing indicate that about 5oo people were imprisoned in 1997 for possession of cannabis. And yet trade in cannabis and its use is an entrenched part of British life-as Jack Straw, the home secretary, well knows. His own teenage son was caught offering to sell cannabis to two reporters a couple of years ago. 
Though removing the threat of prison for possession of cannabis is technically described as ""depenalisation"" rather than ""decriminalisation"", it would inevitably be viewed as moving Britain towards the more liberal Dutch approach. Cannabis is freely available in the Netherlands for sale in ""coffee shops"" in small quantities. The cost of five grammes, the maximum amount that can be legally purchased, is about 11-50 ($19). enough to make about a dozen cigarettes. Britain will not go this far, since the possession of marijuana will remain illegal even if the committee's recommendations are accepted. But ""depenalisation"" of soft drugs in Britain would be likely to lead to tacit acceptance of the sale of cannabis-much as the police currently allow brothels to function under the guise of massage parlours, even though allowing premises to be used for prostitution is illegal. 
The committee will also call for significant changes to the classes and schedules of controlled drugs. The current act fails to distinguish sufficiently between hard and soft drugs. At present Ecstasy, a derivative of amphetamine, is grouped with heroin among the most dangerous Class A drugs, subject to the heaviest penalties for misuse. But 500,ooo people are widely estimated to use Ecstasy each weekend in clubs. The report recommends that it should be downgraded and treated like cannabis as a soft, relatively harmless drug. 
The report is also expected to call for a significant relaxation in the prohibition of the use of drugs such as cannabis for medical reasons. And it believes there should be a revision of the fuzzy border between supply and possession. Under two grammes of cannabis, it suggests that possession should be treated as a minor civil offence. Above two grammes, there could be a charge of supply, but the committee is expected to stress that the law should distinguish between social and commercial supply. Some of its members are said to be appalled by cases in which teenagers have been sent to prison for supplying a small group of friends with a single tablet of Ecstasy each. 
Many of the committee's recom- I mendations would bring the law into line with Police Practice. ""Sending a drug addict to prison is like sending a drunkard to a brewery,"" one expert noted. Nearly half of all drug offences already attract merely a caution. And simple possession of soft drugs is rarely prosecuted. Edward Ellison, former head of Scotland Yard's Drug Squad, argues: ""There is no evidence that a repressive policy on drugs works."" 
But other police officers disagree. Asa resuit, the zeal with which drugs offences are pursued can depend on chance, or the policies of particular police forces. Two Cambridge care workers, charged with allowing their clients to deal in hard drugs in a day Centre, were recently imprisoned for four and five years. 
The government's response to the committee's report is likely to be cautious. Tony Blair, and Mr Straw, believe that the time is not ripe for radical reform. Other ministers, such as Clare Short, the secretary for overseas development, believe privately that the law is ""barking mad"". With a general election approaching, the government will probably want to play for time, possibly by referring the issue to its own advisory council. A measure of its current hawkish position was the home secretary's outright rejection of a recent report by a House of Lords select committee, which recommended that marijuana should be made available for medical purposes. 
Public opinion appears, however, to be moving in favour of fundamental change. A recent MORI poll found that 80% want the laws against cannabis relaxed, and only 17% believe that possession of cannabis should be illegal as at present. Mo Mowlam, the minister responsible for coordinating the government's drug policy,claimed this week that considerable progress had been made since the appointment of Keith Hellawell, a former chief constable of West Yorkshire, as ""drugs czar.""But there is so far little evidence that the government's policy is making inroads into drug-related crime. At least a third of crime in urban areas is drug-related, and nearly half of all house burglaries and thefts from cars are committed by drug users. 
Britain continues to have a worse record for illicit drug use than any of its European neighbours. A study of all 15 EU countries by the European Monitoring Centre for drugs found that three times as many young Britons aged 15-16 said they had experimented with Ecstasy as French or Germans. Young Britons were also much more likely to have used hallucinogens and amphetamines and to have abused solvents. 
The theory that a more permissive approach to soft drugs leads many to experiment with hard drugs has not been borne out in the Netherlands. That country has a lower prevalence of hard-drug addicts per head (1.6 per woo) than France (2-4), Britain (2.6), Italy (3.0) and Switzerland (5.o). if young adults wish to use soft drugs, argue Dutch officials, it is better that they should do so in a setting in which they are not exposed to the criminal sub-culture surrounding hard drugs, Hence the famous coffee shops of Amsterdam. The Dutch Aids-prevention programme, with its distribution of free needles and extensive treatment programmes, also compares well with those of other countries. Nearly 40% of Aids victims across Europe are intravenous drug users, compared withjust over io% in the Netherlands.

A memo leaked to the Guardian this week reveals that Tony Blair's government, the champion of everything new and anything wired, is designing an electronic ""knowledge network"" for Whitehall. This promises at the click of a mouse to provide ministers with the ""best three arguments"" or ""best five facts"" in support of any particular government policy. Naturally, it is all in service of the public interest. The idea is to put across the government's ""core message"" so that citizens can get the ""full facts without going through the distorting prism of media reporting"". 
Good idea. The only pity is that the knowledge network is not up and running right now, when ministers sorely need it. Instant access to the best five facts might have strengthened the assertion of Alan Milburn, the health secretary, that the National Health Service is coping very well thank you with the present ""epidemic"" of flu, which in the distorting prism of media reporting appears to have caused chaos in hospital wards up and down the country. The knowledge network might have rescued the reputation of the Millennium Dome, a wonder of the Blairite world that has been wantonly transformed into an object of ridicule by the distorting prism of media reporting. And Jack Straw must have heard zillions of good arguments before deciding to limit the right of Britons to trial by jury, so reversing the position he held in opposition. Absent the knowledge network, the distorting prism of Bagehot is unable to remember the best threeof them. 
All governments succumb to mid-term paranoia, and most to the delusion that all would be well but for the hostility of the media. over the past fortnight, Mr Blair has seemed especially bruised by the refusal of the nation's pundits to be suitably amazed by the Millennium Dome. Although the queues that marred its opening have shrivelled away, the media verdict remains that the show in Greenwich is a disappointment: at best a nice day out, not the once-in-a-lifetime experience the government intended it to be. 
Why should the prime minister care so much? Because it has already become a cliche to draw a parallel between the fate of the Dome and the performance of his government. There is much that Mr Blair can be justly proud of, He has avoided the recession forecast by the Conservatives and overseen a peace agreement in Northern Ireland. But the government, like the Dome, is staggering under the weight of unrealistic expectations. 
Life under New Labour was not supposed to be just a nice day out. Mr Blair keeps on promising so much more: nothing less than a ""new politics for a new century"". He entered office with a new philosophy, the Third way, that was supposed to revolutionise the provision of public services. He remains the promoter of a historychanging ""project"" to reform Britain's electoral system, introduce proportional representation, and unite New Labour with fellow progressives in the Liberal Democrats. And he claims to have a geography-defying plan to lead Britain into the heart of Europe through the mechanism of the single currency. it became obvious this week that the philosophy. the project and the policy on Europe are all in a bad way. 
Mr Blair reiterates ad nauseam his five best facts and three best arguments in favour of monetary union. But public suspicion (blame that distorting prism) of the euro seems only to be hardening. The latest moRI poll has only 27% in favour of joining, 561/. against. So although the prime minister promised this week not to ""bounce"" Britain into a referendum on the euro immediately after his presumed victory in the next election, the real fear among his europhile ministers is that he will not risk a referendum on the euro at any time in his second term. 
Mr Blair reiterates ad nauseam his promise to the Liberal Democrats that he intends to stand by his pledge to hold a referendum on electoral reform, albeit not in the life of the present Parliament. But in repeating this undertaking yet again in the House of Commons this week, not even Mr Blair could suppress a rueful smile. Recent consultations inside his own party are said to have shown strong support for the existing system-the three best arguments for keeping it being that it gave Labour a majority Of 179 in the last general election. So another planned monument to Blairism may have to be put on hold. 
Not many voters will care about Mr Blair's failure to reform the electoral system. Failure to reform the health service would hurt him a lot more. Opinion polls show that voters care more about this issue than any other. Even education comes a distant second. And yet thanks to the visiting flu virus, against which too few people were vaccinated, New Labour now gives exactly the impression that Mr Blair wants to avoid: not exceptional government, not even government as usual, but government in the grip of the usual winter flu crisis. What happened to the new thinking promised by the Third Way, or the promise that the NHS would be run so much better in the hands of the party that invented it? 
There are answers, or at least excuses. The flu has put the hospitals of many other countries under strain (best fact).

FOR many years governments of both parties have boasted about Britain's success in attracting foreign direct investment (FDI). Britain attracts more inward investment than any country in the world, except the United States. Between 1987 and 1998,26% of all FDI into the 15 current European Union countries went to Britain. 
While boasting about foreign investment is an old tradition, so is warning that Britain is imperilling FDI if it stays out of Europe's single currency, the euro. One top Foreign office mandarin recalls sounding the alarm to Margaret Thatcher at the Madrid summit of the then European Community in 1989. ""1 was wrong then,"" he says, ""but I'll be right eventually."" 
Not so far. In 1998 FDI into Britain was the highest ever, and in the first nine months of 1999, estimates Ciaran Barr of Deutsche Bank, it was on course for another record. 
All the same, there are now some mutterings from foreign investors. A fortnight ago Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary, told the New Statesman: ""Recently, for the first time, big inward investors are telling me that we need to make a decision on the euro early in the next parliament."" The Guardian newspaper pointed the finger at a Toyota boss in Japan who it said had told Mr Byers that ""if the present situation continues then at the very least it will be impossible to expand Our UK operations. if there is no change in the longer term, then we would have to decide whether even our existing operations should continue."" 
Toyota's British subsidiary describes such quotes as ""inaccurate"". Like many other inward investors, it says the company is worried about the strength of the pound against theeuro: no wonder, given that it exports 70% of the output of its Derby factory to other European countries. ""But we did not say,"" said a spokesman, ""that we intend pulling out of the UK."" indeed, Toyota is just completing a E150M ($245m) investment in a factory in North Wales, which will make engines for the new French-built Yaris model. 
There is no doubt that staying out of the euro-zone increases uncertainty for some investors. Anyone serving the euro-zone from Britain must either live with sterling's variability against the euro or hedge against exchange-rate fluctuations as far as they can. At the moment the strength of the pound against the euro is causing headaches. This week, at the equivalent of almost DM3.17, sterling was at its highest since 1989. Not surprisingly, many companies would dearly love to lock in a lower exchange rate. 
Take Nissan's British car-making subsidiary. It exports 75% of the output of its Sunderland factory, mainly to the euro-zone. According to the Economist intelligence Unit, a sister company of The Economist, Nissan Sunderland has the highest productivity of any car plant outside Asia. This week it started producing the Almera model, to add to the 27o,ooo Micras and Primeras it made last year. Yet the exchange rate is hurting. John Cushnaghan, managing director of the subsidiary, says: ""We are strongly in favour of joining the euro as soon as sterling reaches a competitive level. Future investment in the UK Will undoubtedly be affected by staying outside the euro."" 
So far, though, Britain's absence from the euro seems to have had no adverse effect on investment, even in the sterling-sensitive car industry. Garel Rhys, professor of motor industry economics at Cardiff University Business School, points to a swathe of recent investments by Ford, Honda and others,made even though it was clear that Britain would not be in the euro from the outset. Rover, owned by Germany's BMW, plans to spend L3.3 billion in Britain by 2005. A new engine factory at Hams Hall in Warwickshire, for instance, will turn Out 450,000 petrol engines a year, half of which will go into BMWs made in Germany. That said, Rover describes the high pound as ""very damaging"". As a hedge against exchange-rate fluctuations, it is planning to reduce its dependence on British suppliers from 90% to 50% over the next four or five years and is asking British suppliers to invoice it in euros. 
Although car makers enjoy a high political profile, as a group they are in fact relatively small investors (see chart). And foreign investors in financial services, say, are likely to be less concerned by the currency issue. 
In a MORI poll last autumn, 84% of businesses said that British membership of the euro would make no difference to their investment decisions. For many companies, Britain is simply a big market that can only be served properly through a local presence. Consider Microsoft and oracle, the world's two biggest software companies, which employ 850 and 4,500 people respectively in Britain, Both have offices at a Reading business park, housing British sales, marketing and customer-support operations. oracle's office, its biggest in Europe, also handles marketing for the region. Microsoft also has a research lab in Cambridge, which benefits from links with the university. Originally, says Oracle, Britain was chosen as the site of its first European subsidiary because of ""the common language, the technology-friendly culture and more flexible labour laws than the rest of Europe."" 
Look also at Britain's biggest recipient Of FDJ: the financial industry. Although some feared that the City would suffer because Britain was outside the euro, it thrived last year. Its share of foreign-exchange trade, of which it is the leading centre, went up. And in the third quarter of last year, 58% of euro-denominated Eurobonds were issued in London, up from 48% in the first quarter. Foreigners are still keen to buy the few bits of the City they do not already own: this week America's Citigroup snaffled the investment-banking arm of Schroders (see page 72). 
Does all this mean that if Britain stays outside the euro, it need have no fear of losing FDI? Not necessarily. Some investors doubtless assume that Britain will join eventually: they are prepared to put up with fluctuations against the euro for a few years, but not for ever. This may explain why many American corporations, who are by far the biggest investors in Britain, have paid little attention so far to Britain and the euro. However, Joseph Quinlan, an economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York, argues that ""Britain's arms-length stance toward the EMU does come at some expense to the us firms that have made the UK central to their European strategies."" 
Even the seemingly impregnable City is not entirely out of the woods, says Graham Bishop of Salomon Smith Barney, an investment bank belonging to Citigroup. ""The first 12 months were fine,"" he says; ""what about the next 12 years? With Britain out, is there a risk that the evolution of a single financial market may not favour the City?"" 
Still, the portents are good for now. Investment is booming. And as long as the pound stays so high, few exporters, foreignowned or not, will rush to join the euro. ","Is Britain's absence from the European single currency really likely to deter foreign investors? 
FOR many years governments of both parties have boasted about Britain's success in attracting foreign direct investment (FDI). Britain attracts more inward investment than any country in the world, except the United States. Between 1987 and 1998,26% of all FDI into the 15 current European Union countries went to Britain. 
While boasting about foreign investment is an old tradition, so is warning that Britain is imperilling FDI if it stays out of Europe's single currency, the euro. One top Foreign office mandarin recalls sounding the alarm to Margaret Thatcher at the Madrid summit of the then European Community in 1989.

SHE departure of the head of government in most countries is quite an event: it raises the possibility of change. Not in Japan, though. After Keizo Obuchi's stroke last weekend, Japan has had to find a new prime minister. No one, however, seems to be looking for any other change; that, most Japanese seem to think, can wait until after the general election, due sometime before the autumn. Indeed, the new man may only serve as a stop-gap. Then a permanent replacement for Mr Obuchi can be found, it is said, and he can ponder some changes. Alas, Japan cannot afford to be so relaxed. 
Not that Mr Obuchi has been a failure. On the contrary, although he once described himself as ""very, very ordinary"", he has done much to end Japan's worst post-war recession. He had staked his reputation on delivering economic growth of at least o.6% for the financial year that ended in March and it looks as though the official figures, when they are published in the summer, will show he has achieved it. Growth of o.6% may seem modest, but Japan is often like a supertanker with the tiller locked. A change of course can be achieved only with immense effort: indeed, if Mr Obuchi has got any growth at all, it will have taken a staggering 35 trillion ($325 billion) in public spending to achieve it. 
Unfortunately, Japan cannot afford to go on running its economy this way. A new leader is required, who could act to unleash the country's enterprise and restore the confidence of its consumers. And he should waste no time in securing a mandate from the voters for the changes that are needed. But that does not seem to be the way that minds have been working in the upper echelons of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Mr Obuchi's successor is to be Yoshiro Mori, the LDP's secretary-general, an archetypal politician of the old school (see page 39). No one expects him to last beyond the election. 
The good news is that some people in the LDP may be thinking of bringing the election forward. Mr Obuchi wanted it in the early autumn, because it would then follow better economic news and all the publicity that will attend the prime minister's role at the G8 meeting of the rich world's leaders, plus Russia, in Okinawa in July. But some LDP leaders, worried about the party's dwindling support and hoping no doubt for a sympathy vote, want the election earlier. They are right, albeit for the wrong reasons. An early poll would be good for Japan. Whatever the result, it would provide a new government with a new term of office, instead of an interim one muddling along for six months of uncertainty. 
Muddling along is often the way of consensus-style government in Japan. It may not always lead to disaster, but at present there is work to be done. Urgent economic issues and preparations for the summit are high on the agenda. Mount Usu, a volcano on the island of Hokkaido, is rumbling. And then there is the aftermath of the political eruption caused by Mr Obuchi's rejection of the latest in a series of demands from one of his coalition partners, Ichiro Ozawa, the Liberal leader. Mr Ozawa was forced out as a result, although some members of his party have remained in the ruling coalition. 
In most other countries such events in a leaderless vacuum might amount to a crisis. Not in Japan: the stockmarket hit its highest level of the year this week and the yen rose. That was because Japan is so insulated against change that everyone knows things will go on as expected: the legislative agenda is already in place for the rest of the current session of the Diet (parliament) and the important budget and taxreform bills have already been passed. 
Thief of time 
The trouble is that not much is likely to happen about Japan's long-postponed reforms either. With an election looming, there is already pressure to ease off anything that might upset voters. Several advisory commissions appointed by Mr Obuchi may never report. They have been looking into new ideas about how to reform all sorts of things, from the Diet to education, welfare and the police. 
All of which adds up to one word: delay. The politicians will keep up their factional infighting while the bureaucracy continues to set policy. The real transition from such feudal ways may have to await another generation. Unfortunately, that may also be the generation that inherits all the problems being dodged today: the consequences of a greying society, banks burdened with debts, companies unrestructured and a public sector deep in deficit. Fixing Japan then will not be a job for a Mr Ordinary. The time to get on with it is now. ","It needs a new prime minister with a mandate , soon

WITH Keizo Obuchi incapacitated by a stroke and lying in a coma, the ]apanese cabinet resigned this week so that a new prime minister could be installed. On April 5th, once the barons of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) had done their backroom deals, the leadership was handed to Yoshiro Mori, the party's secretary-general. This is what most people had expected. Mr Mori, a burly man who is fond of rugby, is a politician in the traditional mould: a safe party man not known to instigate policy who can be relied upon to continue Mr Obuchi's legislative agenda. Once again, political life goes on much as before in Japan. Except that Mr Mori is, at best, merely a temporary stand-in. 
At 62, the new prime minister is the same age as his predecessor and like him a product of Waseda University, which has produced many of Japan's leading politicians. His career is exactly what is expected of a future leader: a former journalist with a right-wing tabloid newspaper, he has successfully defended his seat in Komatsu nine times and served as minister of education, international trade and industry and, most importantly in Japan, construction. In late 1998, he inherited the leadership of the LDP's third-largest faction. 
There is also the whiff of scandal. Along with several of his LDr colleagues, Mr Mori was found to have made a financial killing during the Recruit ""shares-for-favours"" affair in 1989. Later, during the ""money-and-mob"" scandal of 1992, prosecutors alleged that Mr Mori had offered a gang of right-wing thugs Y2m ($19,ooo) to end a smear campaign that was being waged against his boss, Noboru Takeshita, a former prime minister. An oil trader facing charges of tax evasion, bribery and fraud also claimed in 1997 to have given Mr Mori and several other LDr politicians large payments. Mr Mori denies these allegations strenuously. 
In his first act on taking office, Mr Mori reappointed exactly the same cabinet that had served Mr Obuchi. Into his old job he promoted Hiromu Nonaka, who held a minor post in the LDr. Mr Nonaka, an influential figure, was the power behind the throne in Mr Obuchi's first cabinet in 1998. He was forced into the shadows after a shuffle in October, primarily because of his unremitting hatred of Ichiro Ozawa, the leader of the Liberal Party. Mr Ozawa and his supporters had joined the LDP-led coalition earlier last year. But Mr Obuchi's last act as prime minister was to eject Mr Ozawa from the coalition, rather skilfully. So the LDP no longer has to be nice to him. 
Before being rushed to hospital in the early hours of April znd, Mr Obuchi had met the Liberal leader and called his bluff over his many threats to leave the coalition if his demands were not met. Mr Ozawa had no option but to go. However, 26 of the 5o members of his party refused to follow him into the political wilderness. They formed a new group called the Conservative Party and have been welcomed into the ruling alliance by the cnP and its other coalition partner, the Buddhist-backed New Komeito. Mr Ozawa is now a spent force, which will certainly make life easier for the new prime minister. 
The confrontation with Mr Ozawa is seen by some as hardly helping Mr Obuchi's long-standing heart illness. Whether or not the row played a role in inducing his stroke, the government delayed revealing the seriousness of Mr Obuchi's illness. 
Mr Mori will try to finish off the task his predecessor set: getting japans fragile economy back on its feet. To save the country from financial meltdown, Mr Obuchi introduced public-spending measures worth more than Y35 trillion, much of which was designed to benefit the building industry. He also cut taxes by Y6 trillion and set aside Y60 trillion to bail out Japan's deeply indebted banks. Mr Obuchi had staked his career on getting the economy growing again, by at least 0.6%0 of GDP during the fiscal year that ended in March. 
On the up again 
The enormous amount of public spending has had its effect. Over the past year, the Japanese economy has slowly ceased its downward spiral. Overall, the economy was still in recession during the first three quarters of the past financial year. But, from January to March, growth has been strong. Few people now doubt that Mr Obuchi's o.6%o target will be easily achieved. The trouble is that the seasonally-adjusted figures that will prove it will not be available until early June. So, any bragging about economic revival by the LDP will have to wait until then. 
That raises a tricky issue for Mr Mori: when to call the general election that must be held before October t9th, when the present four-year term of the lower house of the Diet (parliament) ends. His predecessor was planning to call the election after the summit meeting of the G7 leaders of the rich world, plus Russia, which is to be held this year in Okinawa in late July. Apart from hoping to boost his waning popularity by being seen on television hobnobbing with other world leaders, Mr Obuchi viewed the Okinawa summit as a feather in his cap. 
It was, of course, Japan's turn to hold the summit this year, but it was Mr Obuchi's idea to hold it in the congenial surroundings of Japan's most southerly prefecture. By doing so he hoped to buy off local residents who have been objecting to the decision to build a new American helicopter base in Okinawa. The summit would bring Okinawa some useful publicity and, more tangibly, a huge building boom. 
Mr Obuchi was also intending to use the summit to present himself as the spokesman for Asia, a role he has tried to shape for himself during overseas visits. Mr Mori, however, is a man with his feet firmly planted in his own prefecture's rural mud and someone who has never acquired much of a taste for global statesmanship. Many Asian leaders therefore fear that Japan will now be less generous with the aid that Mr Obuchi had been doling out in the region. 
Of more immediate concern to Mr Mori's colleagues is the coming election. Some have badgered the new prime minister to call a snap poll. The idea is that this would capitalise on the public outpouring of sorrow at seeing Mr Obuchi struck down so tragically. The new prime minister, however, is not expected to do that. He will probably go to the polls in early June, earlier than Mr Obuchi had planned, but safely after the cnr figures are published. 
Mr Mori is nothing if not a pragmatist. He knows he is merely a stop-gap prime minister whose main job is to steer the party through a general election without losing too many seats. Japan will then need a heavyweight leader who can get on with the serious tasks that still confront the country. Above all, that person will have to start to deal with the painful process of reducing the country's woeful level of long-term debt. Thanks to Mr Obuchi's generous spending, Japan now has the largest public-sector debt in the developed world: it stands at 174% of GDr, according to some measures. 
The man being groomed to take over is Koichi Kato, a former diplomat who leads the second-largest faction of the LDP. He got on the wrong side of Mr Obuchi by daring to oppose him when he was making a bid for a second term as party president, and thus prime minister. Once the election is over, Mr Kato is likely, however, to emerge on top. ","Yoshiro Mori has taken over as Japan 's prime minister , although few people think Yoshiro Mori will be in the job for long 
 WITH Keizo Obuchi incapacitated by a stroke and lying in a coma , the ] apanese cabinet resigned this week so that a new prime minister could be installed . On April 5th , once the barons of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) had done their backroom deals , the leadership was handed to Yoshiro Mori's . This is what most people had expected . Yoshiro Mori , is a politician in the traditional mould : a safe party man not known to instigate policy who can be relied upon to continue Mr Obuchi 's legislative agenda . Once again , political life goes on much as before in Japan . Except that Yoshiro Mori is , at best , merely a temporary stand - in . 
 At 62 , Yoshiro Mori is the same age as Yoshiro Mori's predecessor and like him a product of Waseda University , which has produced many of Japan 's leading politicians . Yoshiro Mori's career is exactly what is expected of a future leader : Yoshiro Mori , Yoshiro Mori has successfully defended Yoshiro Mori's seat in Komatsu nine times and served as minister of education , international trade and industry and , most importantly in Japan , construction . In late 1998 , Yoshiro Mori inherited the leadership of the LDP 's third - largest faction . 
 There is also the whiff of scandal . Along with several of Yoshiro Mori's LDr colleagues , Yoshiro Mori was found to have made a financial killing during the Recruit "" shares - for - favours "" affair in 1989 . Later , during the "" money - and - mob "" scandal of 1992 , prosecutors alleged that Yoshiro Mori had offered a gang of right - wing thugs Y2 m ( $ 19,ooo ) to end a smear campaign that was being waged against Yoshiro Mori's boss , Noboru Takeshita , a former prime minister . An oil trader facing charges of tax evasion , bribery and fraud also claimed in 1997 to have given Yoshiro Mori and several other LDr politicians large payments . Yoshiro Mori denies these allegations strenuously .

DESPITE being bedridden for the past year, Noboru Takeshita, a master puppeteer, has been running Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) from his pillows-shaping political events, big and small, throughout the land. But the stringpulling from behind the scenes is about to fall slack. On May 1st, after 42 years in the Diet (parliament), Mr Takeshita announced that he was retiring from politics. Turmoil has now broken out within the party as its lesser barons, caught off guard once again by the wily old manipulator, try to snatch the cords of power. 
A month ago, the 76-yearold Mr Takeshita, though racked with spinal pain, had every intention of standing for a 15th term in the forthcoming general election, which is expected to be held on June 25th. What made him change his mind was the collapse of Keizo Obuchi, the last of the proteges he had anointed as prime minister. Mr Obuchi suffered a stroke on April 1st and remains in hospital, paralysed and on a life-support machine. His demise seems to bring an era to an end. 
Mr Takeshita was the embodiment of Japan's ""1955 political system"", in which the LDP ruled with comfortable majorities in both the upper and the lower house of the Diet. The LDP kept its grip on power partly by using its regulatory powers to protect the small shopkeepers, farmers, manufacturers and building firms who were its core supporters, partly by gerrymandering rural districts. This forced the predominantly urban opposition parties to collect up to three votes for every LDP vote in order to win a seat. The opposition, led by the Japanese Socialist Party (as it was then called), was kept tame by under-the-table handouts and an understanding that the LDP and its proxies would not contest the third or fourth seats in many of the bigger multi-seat constituencies. 
Mr Takeshita thrived in such a world of consensus politics, quietly preparing the ground so things could happen by agreed compromise. Though forced to resign in 1989 after only two years as prime minister as a result of the Recruit ""shares-for-favours"" scandal, Mr Takeshita still had the final say on who should get the top jobs in politics. The last of his lieutenants to be made prime minister were Ryutaro Hashimoto and Mr Obuchi. Though belonging to a different factional family within the LDP, Mr Obuchi's successor, Yoshiro Mori, won the job only after Mr Takeshita had given his approval. 
And that is the problem. The political faction Mr Takeshita created in 1987 and later handed over to Mr Obuchi was the biggest, best endowed and, above all, the most cohesive. Now, with Mr Takeshita and Mr Obuchi out of the picture, and several stalwarts such as Seiroku Kajiyama also deciding to call it quits, the LDP's kingmaker faction is bereft of talent at the top. Its up-and-comers are in their 50s, and at least five years away from being considered ready to become leader. 
Insiders expect the present chief cabinet secretary, Mikio Aoki, aged 65, an upperhouse member from Mr Takeshita's district in western Japan, to take over the faction for the time being. It would be the first time that someone from the less-than-influential upper house had played such a role. More to the point, the mild-mannered Mr Aoki, though well-liked in parliament, commands little respect from the party rank and file. Pundits believe that a stronger character, such as Hiromu Nonaka, the LDP's secretary-general, will be made joint leader to help keep the troops in line. 
Come what may, however, few expect the old Takeshita faction to maintain its former influence and cohesion. Equally, none of the LDP's three other main factions-one led by Koichi Kato, another by Mr Mori and the third by Taku Yamasaki-is big enough to take command. And if the LDP does as badly as expected in the coming election, its structure could begin to fall apart. Japanese politics would then be in for a period of big change. 
If the party were to split along ideological lines, its more liberal, reform-minded members would be expected to form up behind an internationalist such as Mr Kato, a former general secretary of the party. Mr Kato was relegated to the sidelines by Mr Obuchi for having the temerity to challenge him for the leadership. From the wilderness, Mr Kato has continued to attack the LDP for its ill-considered spending on public works and for propping up troubled banks and building companies. 
Optimists say Japan's economic reconstruction would accelerate dramatically if reformers such as Mr Kato and like-minded colleagues from other factions, including Mr Yamasaki and Junichiro Koizumi, a former health minister, could only get their act together. A few years ago, the liberal wing of the LDP hoped that the ""YKK"" trio would be the next to take command, and help steer the party away from its profligate ways. 
Pessimists fear that the LDP's more reactionary wing may prevail, with the party remaining heavily committed to big publicspending programmes and special-interest politics. Many in the party would support such an outcome. More than 100 LDP members recently formed a group to get the government to abandon further economic reforms, claiming they were turning voters off; the worry is that, apart from wanting to turn the clock back, an LDP under the sway of conservatives such as the party's policy chief, Shizuka Kamei, could easily turn xenophobic as well as reactionary. Welcoming back old nationalists like Ichiro Ozawa-one of Mr Takeshita's former lieutenants who stormed out of the LDP in 1993 with his followers after losing the succession battle to Mr Obuchi-would be only the beginning. 
What if a more reactionary LDP decided it wanted a super-nationalist like Shintaro Ishihara back within the Fold? The outspoken governor of Tokyo is easily the most charismatic politician in Japan. Mr Ishihara, who wrote the book ""A Japan That Can Say No"" with Sony's late boss, Akio Morita, left the LDP in disgust because of its weak-kneed ways. He is literate, intelligent, energeticand unfortunately holds some ugly views about foreigners. His current targets for abuse are China and the Korean and Taiwanese communities within Japan. Last week he made headlines with an attack on ""expansionist"" China. He was quoted as saying, If Japan gives way in the face of this expansionism, this will spread throughout Asia.Japan now feels a crisis over China. We are in a state of cold war, which in some ways is more dangerous than the old cold war. 
The thought of an LDP under Mr Ishihara's populist influence is alarming. That is why, once the election is over, the fight for the soul of the party will really begin. ","As the old political masters bow out , who will take power in the ruling party ?

And they all show that New Labour's extraordinarily long honeymoon with the electorate is now officially over. This has been a poor year for Labour, with its lead over the main opposition parties being eroded. Britain is seeing the resumption of normal politics. 
The worst news for the Labour Party came from the latest icM poll. This puts Labour on 41% in terms of voting intentions, down four points from the previous month. It is the first time that the party has polled below its May 1997 general election performance of 43%. The icM poll also shows that the Conservatives have moved up two percentage points on April to 34%, as have the Liberal Democrats to i8%. This means that Labour's lead over the Tories is now only seven points, the lowest since the election. And Tony Blair has fared even worse. His net approval rating has collapsed from +34 points a year ago to only +i now, with 44% of voters saying that they are satisfied with the job he is doing and 43% dissatisfied. 
Gallup also shows a dip in support for Labour, although less steep than rcM's. Its poll shows a fall of three points for Labour in voting intentions from last month, down from 509: to 47%. For most of this parliament, the level of support for Labour has stood at 50-55%. And Mr Blair's approval rating has also begun to slip, down a.a points on April, from 52.8 to 50.6. 
On the other hand, Gallup's poll (unlike ICM'S) offers little cause for Tory optimism. The Tories have actually slipped a point, down from 32 in April to 31. That still gives Labour a very healthy lead of i6 points. And the approval rating of William Hague, the Tory leader, remains stuck at a near-disastrous 18%o. Another polling organisation, MORI, points out that its latest approval rating for Mr Blair at 52% is only just short of Mrs Thatcher's rating at the high point of her popularity during the Falklands war in 1982. So suggestions that Mr Hague will be waltzing through the door of io Downing Street in a year's time still look premature. 
Labour puts its current setbacks in the polls down to a number of things. Party strategists have little doubt that Mr Hague's adoption of a more right-wing position on ""bogus"" asylum seekers and law and order have helped the Tories. At the same time the government has suffered a number of setbacks-notably over its cack-handed attempts to prevent Ken Livingstone becoming mayor of London. 
But Mr Blair has a not-so-secret weapon, which may soon send his poll ratings soaring. In about two weeks' time his wife Cherie is due to give birth to the couple's fourth child.

A SURE sign that Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is about to make a disastrous showing in the coming general election is the way the country's leading conservative newspaper, Yomiuri Shimbun, has become so rattled. Instead of its usual measured tone when dealing with politics, it has offered emotional outbursts about the opposition's unfair tactics.It is clear that the unfortunate Yoshiro Mori, who became prime minister after Keizo Obuchi collapsed on April and, and later died, will win no votes for the LDP on June 25th. His approval rating in the opinion polls plummeted to 19% in May from 41% in April, the lowest ever for a Japanese prime minister who is about to fight a general election. 
Out in the constituencies, LDP officials are hurriedly taking down the prime minister's picture and cancelling plans for him to speak. Low as it is, Mr Mori's popularity could sink lower. On May 30th, four of the main opposition parties tabled a no-confidence motion in the Diet (parliament) arising out of Mr Mori's remarks to a Shinto political league about Japan being a ""divine nation with the emperor at its centre"". 
Cracking the whip 
The prime minister certainly meant no harm. He was a member of a now-defunct group of right-wing Diet members who sought to revive the spirit of the old Meiji constitution, which enshrined the emperor as ""sacred and inviolable"". But Mr Mori does rather put his foot in it. Earlier, he claimed that the ""imperial rescript on education"" of 1890, which laid the foundation for]apanese militarism and emperor worship, was not all bad. Unabashed by the reaction to his latest remarks, Mr Mori professed to have nothing to feel sorry about. But that was before the LDP's chieftains cracked the whip and forced the prime minister to bow deeply and make a formal apology. 
Hiromu Nonaka, the LDP's tough secretary-general, reminded Mr Mori that he was prime minister 24 hours a day and whenever he opened his mouth he did so as the leader of the country. Unfortunately, the prime minister only made matters worse for himself, and the LDP: he offered regrets but then refused to retract his remarks. 
The opposition parties cannot believe their good fortune. What is so worrying for the LDP is that Mr Mori's gaffe, which harps back to Japan's militaristic past, has not in it-- selfbothered many people. The Japanese are far too sensible to fear for their democratic institutions. But they are appalled by the prime minister's lack of political astuteness. Mr Mori has become that most unacceptable of things in Japan: an embarrassment. 
Some senior Lnr members have even been talking about dumping Mr Mori before the june z5th election or getting the polling day put off for a month or two. That is now impossible. The Diet was due to be dissolved on June 2nd. To limit the damage, the ruling party has started telling its supporters in the field to plan for an even worse election result than previously expected. Hidenao Nakagawa, a senior party official and a close friend of the prime minister, puts the party's expectations at no more than 215 seats (down from its present 267) out of what will be a 480-seat lower house. By Mr Nakagawa's reasoning, anything better than that ought to be considered a success, and Mr Mori might then be spared from resignation. 
Although a considerable loss, such an outcome could still give the Lnr, with its two small coalition partners, the New Komeito and the Conservative Party, a majority in the house and allow it to keep control of the main committees. But the Buddhist-backed New Komeito is still smouldering over Mr Mori's allusions to the ethnic purity of statesponsored Shintoism, and may demand Mr Mori's head as the price for staying in the coalition. The New Komeito was given the final say about making Mr Mori prime minister. He should really have been more respectful of New Komeito's main sponsor, the Soka Gakkai, whose founder, Tsunesaburo Makiguchi, was imprisoned during the war because of his opposition to state-sponsored Shintoism. 
As the campaign gathers pace, the LDr leadership is doing its utmost to keep the prime minister out of harm's way. A record turnout is expected, another plus for the opposition. Mr Nonaka must be regretting that he manipulated events to put the amiable but disaster-prone Mr Mori in charge. ","TOKYO

WALK up Dogenzaka slope in the Shibuya shopping district of inner Tokyo, and you would not know that there has been a recession in Japan. The young and not-soyoung spill out of the neon-bright stores with their designer-label shopping bags, gulp latte at Starbucks, download their email on i-mode cell-phones dangling from their necks, and chatter incessantly about cool new things to do, see and buy. 
On the surface, Japan looks as prosperous, content and law-abiding as ever, and much more relaxed as well. Sararimen strap-hanging their way to work these days are as likely to wear a sports jacket as the once-ubiquitous blue suit and tie (the tie pinned, military-style, to a starched white shirt). Below the surface, however, and away from the bright city lights, cracks have begun to snake their way through the corporate masonry. 
Last Sunday's election showed signs of a deep, and general, unease. Because the weather was miserable, the turnout was very low by Japanese standards. Even so, the 62% of voters who managed to emerge from their futons still gave Yoshiro Mori's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its two small coalition partners a serious pummelling. Although the coalition managed to hang on to power and preserve a working majority, the LDr lost its own majority in the newly slimmed-down lower house of the Diet. It ended up with 233 seats, down from 271. 
It was not just that voters were annoyed with Mr Mori, who took over as prime minister on April 5th after his predecessor, Keizo Obuchi, suffered a stroke. Mr Mori had, it is true, made numerous gaffes on taking office, including the remark that Japan was ""a divine country with the emperor at the centre"". But almost half of Japan's loom eligible voters do not support any particular party these days. Their frustration is with the whole system, and with the LDp as the system's entrenched representative. There is a widespread feeling that the country is in dire need of a whole range of social as well as economic reforms, but that the govemment-bound by its powerful ties to special interests-is incapable of doing the job. 
Anyone younger than 50 in Japan grew up in an era when incomes were doubling every decade. But the 1990s were a different story. In 1990-91 the bubble economy collapsed, ushering in stagnation that lasted a decade: Japan's deepest and longest slump in more than 50 years. The recession hit family incomes especially hard. Bonuses, if paid at all, have been slashed;wage rises are out of the question; overtime is a thing of the past. 
Worst of all, loyalty to the company-the bedrock upon which Japan Inc was built-is no longer being rewarded. Older workers, who are costlier because of Japan's seniority pay system, are being told unceremoniously to leave. Unemployment, barely heard of a decade ago, has hit an official 5% (measured properly, it is at least 7%), and is set to climb still further, even as the Japanese economy begins its slow recovery. The unemployed can be seen in the parks; some live in neat cardboard boxes, beside small gardens which They carefully tend to fill up the hours. 
According to opinion polls, one family in eight has a member who has recently been made redundant (risutora, or ""restructured"", in the bitter workers' jargon), or expects to be made so shortly. One in five youngsters looking for a first job have been unable to find one. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan's policy of zero interest rates has mercilessly squeezed the savings of a rapidly ageing population. Little wonder that suicides have risen by 53% since 1991. 
Crime, too, has risen sharply, especially among the young. Not since the 1950s have Japanese city centres been places to avoid after dark; but now gangs of young thugs go in search of easy targets, particularly drunken sararimen. Meanwhile, schoolgirl prostitution has become one of the biggest headaches for the police. If only for the vicarious thrill, one in three girls of high-school age admits to having dialled one of the ""telephone clubs"" that match callers with men willing to pay for sex. 
In Japanese classrooms (once famous for the cheerful obedience of the children), incidents of teachers being threatened with knives or beaten with baseball bats have become so common that they are no longer front-page news. Instead, reporters find bloodier incidents to cover. There are now more hours of bloody mayhem every week on Japan's Tv screens than on America's. And for all these signs of breakdown, economic, moral or social, voters naturally blame the party that has been so long in power. 
The lone persimmon tree 
Apart from a ten-month blip in 1993-94, the Lne has governed Japan continuously since it was formed in 1955 by a merger of two conservative parties. Its role then was to counter the surging influence of Japan's left-wing parties; there was a real fear, though it seems strange now, that Marxism might take the country over. Before long, however, the Lnr had declared a truce with the Japan Socialist Party, and both sides set about carving up the benefits of the economic miracle that was gathering pace. 
With order-books full as exports boomed and with skilled labour starting to run short, the companies co-opted the trade unions by offering training, health care and a job for life. Within a few years, Japan's once belligerent unions had been broken up and transformed into thousands of small company associations that became, in effect, part of the management. From that moment, the ideological left lost its influence in Japan. Unrestrained, the LDP turned its attention to promoting the interests of its three main groups of supporters: farmers, small shopkeepers and the construction industry. 
After the samurai, farmers were the most privileged group in Japan's old feudal hierarchy. And the LDP has protected them as thoroughly as any feudal lord. The party fought tooth and nail to keep Virginia tobacco out of Japan, so that off budget subsidies could be fed to tobacco-growing farmers from Japan Tobacco, the governmentowned cigarette monopoly. Everywhere else in the world where Virginia tobacco competes freely, it gets around 30% of the market. in Japan, the LDP has managed to keep its share to no more than 3%. 
Rice-growers have been treated even more kindly. For years, foreign rice was banned in Japan, save for an annual 14,000 tonnes of Thai rice needed by Okinawan brewers for a local tipple. But in 1992, when, under the Uruguay Round of world trade negotiations, all non-tariff barriers were to be replaced by measurable tariffs, the LDP refused to comply. It took six years to persuade Japan to accept tariffs on foreign rice, rather than an outright ban. And even then the Lnr had the last word. It set the tariff at Y351 ($2.70) per kilogramme, three-and-a-half times the price of American rice. 
Yet rice is no longer Japan's staple food. Wheat, in the form of bread and noodles, provides the bulk of people's calories these days. With the government's stockpiling granaries full to the brim, Japanese farmers have long been paid not to produce the stuff. In the lowlands of Japan, terraced paddy fields have become a rare sight. Farmers drain their fields and plant fruit or vegetables instead. Increasingly, however, they are letting the land lie untended. Thanks to the LDP, Japanese farmers need do no more to collect their subsidies each year than plant a lone persimmon tree. 
Year after year, the ruling party managed to convince ordinary citizens that high prices were in their own best interests. Consumers were told that, yes, prices might be a little higher than elsewhere, but they ensured reliable supplies of food, maintained the quality of Japanese goods and, of course, helped to keep everyone fully employed. No matter that Japanese housewives paid up to eight times the American price for rice, five times the American price for beef, fruit and processed food, and three to four times as much for travel, clothing and telephone calls. 
It could not go on. Japan's demographics, as the LnP has known for years, were working remorselessly against the party's machines. In short, the party's hard-ore supporters in the countryside were dying of old age. Back in the mid-1960s, one in three Japanese lived in a household of farmers. By 1995, only one in 20 was part of a family that worked the land. Many had moved with the children into the cities; many more had been interred in the local temple's ground. Thanks to gerrymandering and migration, the rural constituencies went on for years enjoying three times the voting clout of their urban counterparts. But nature worked inexorably: one way or another, between the mid-1960s and the mid-1990s, the LDP lost some 20m supporters. 
Quintessence of dust 
Japan's once-vast network of small retailers has shrivelled, too. Twenty years ago, neighbourhood streets were lined with poky stores that stacked up their goods on the pavement for all to see. Inside, the obaasan (grandmother) would quickly take a duster to anything the customer asked to see. With discounting unheard of and inventories paid for by the producer, goods cost the shopkeeper nothing to keep on the shelves. So they gathered dust while waiting for a customer to pay the full price. 
For years, these shops have been dying off or selling out. The retail law that had long protected them from the big discount chains was watered down in the early 1990s under pressure from American trade officials, who wanted to help Toys ""R"" Us gain a foothold in Japan. The result is that convenience stores operated by Seven-Eleven, FamilyMart, Lawsons, Circle x and other national chains have replaced most of the little shops-which, as well as selling dog-eared items, also campaigned vigorously for the LDP. 
The LDP has gone out of its way to preserve its one remaining big prop, the 6m workers in the construction industry. The banks have been arm-twisted into forgiving billions of yen owed by insolvent building firms, and the government has dumped an extra ono trillion of taxpayers' money into the struggling economy over the past eight years-mostly as public-works projects. 
Some Y1 trillion of that money went on the Akashi Kaikyo bridge, between Kobe and Awaji island in Osaka Bay. When the bridge opened a few years ago, officials announced that they expected 37,000 cars a day to use it. In the same breath, they cheerfully admitted that, before the bridge was built, only 100-200 cars made the crossing each day by ferry. Now that the tourist novelty has worn off, less than a tenth of the bridge's expected traffic shows up on a typical weekday. And even with largesse like this, debt-ridden building firms continue to fall like flies. 
Despite the erosion of its support, the Lnp has proved unable to shift its focus away from producers and towards consumers. This myopia did not matter as long as the economy continued to expand and corporate profits trickled down even to the lowliest of workers. But the recession that has gripped Japan for the better part of a decade has forced employers to tear up the ""social compact"" they had with the government. 
Under this informal arrangement, companies were protected from over-aggressive competition at home by a careful balance of government regulation and licensing, while being allowed to charge high prices and shelter their profits from excessive taxation. In exchange, they undertook to hire more employees than they needed and not to fire them when times got hard. For their part, employees accepted the long hours, modest pay and poor conditions because the company promised to look after them, if not for life, at least for a good number of years. 
It is this part of the agreement that has collapsed. Since 1997, up to im people a year have been ""restructured"" out of their jobs-ie, forced to quit against their wishes. Bosses rely heavily on peer pressure, bullying and other tricks to force their unwanted workers to leave. The result is deepening social division and bitterness, both inside and outside the office. And redundancies are expected to continue at this rate for three or four more years, until Japanese companies have finally reduced their inflated headcounts to globally competitive levels. 
Dependent old, profligate young 
None of this anxiety was reflected in the parties' campaign statements. None offered specific ideas as.to how to modernise the economy; how to create a million new jobs a year; how to cap surging health costs while improving the quality of care; how to make it easier for mothers to work; and, above all, how to cope with the country's rapidly ageing population, including plugging the gaping holes in the pension schemes. 
The Japanese, better educated and wider-read than their western counterparts, are well aware of the problems in store. Demographers have often told them that the population will hit a peak of 128m (up from today's 127m) in 2007s, and will then begin to decline quite quickly. Less crowded cities might seem attractive, but not if they are full of old people with few youngsters to do the jobs and keep the services working. Today, there are four workers in Japan to support every elderly dependant. By 2025, there will be only 2.2 workers for every pensioner. 
The Japanese want to know what impact all this will have on their own pensions, as well as on their lives and the lives of their children. The ""national burden"" (taxes plus welfare costs as a proportion of cDr) is currently 36%-much the same as in America, but less than the European average. By 2025, if nothing is done, the Japanese figure will have soared to over 60%. 
Yet doing nothing is precisely what voters have come to expect of their political leaders. And when politicians make specific proposals, they tend to reveal just how out of touch they are. Earlier this year, for example, the government announced more public holidays so that people could give the economy a boost by taking trips and going shopping. Young women, however, are already shopping in unbridled fashion, and they have been the saving of Japan. There are now 7m working women in their teens and aos; they are better educated, more widely travelled and more ready to experiment than Japan's young men; and, since they live at home and pay little in the way of rent and taxes, they have on average more than Y150,000 ($1,400) a month to blow on clothes, cosmetics, music, holidays and dining out. 
These women are a revelation to Japan. They look different: having been brought up on cereals and dairy products instead of the rice and pickles of the generation before, they are a good deal taller than their mothers, and rarely have the bow legs that came from sitting on their calves instead of on a chair. And they are older when they marry: around 27. Because these young women stay out of the marriage pool much longer than their mothers did, fertility rates have plummeted in Japan to fewer than 1.4 children for each woman, down from more than 2.1 in 1970. This preference for the good life rather than motherhood is the reason why the Japanese population is set to crash-and why the pensions system needs retooling. 
The third opening 
Twice before, Japan has remade itself from top to bottom. In 1868, after Commander Perry's gunboats had entered Tokyo Bay and demanded the right to trade, Japan ended its three centuries of self imposed isolation, threw out its military government, restored the Meiji emperor, industrialised frantically and caught up with the West within 3o years. 
Then, after the surrender in 1945, Japan jettisoned all the vestiges of its militaristic past and built a modem democracy that laid the foundations for its emergence as an economic superpower 30 years later. Many of Japan's social, business and economic norms today are relics from that era. 
That is the nub of the problem. The system that Japan perfected from the i95os onward was designed for an industrial society in its early stages of economic development. It is totally unsuited to a post-industrial world. Thus, Japanese schools all teach virtually the same curricula, all in the same way, all at the same time. Their job, in effect, is to produce cannon-fodder for the manufacturing sector, not oddball characters who can dream up whole new industries. 
The Pokemon cards and Nintendo games that have overrun the world are mere hints of the creativity that could be unleashed in Japan. They have escaped despite the system. In a post-industrial world that is driven more than ever by iconoclasts drawn from the cleverest 25% of a country's population, Japan is at a serious disadvantage. And what goes for Japanese education applies equally to the country's 1950s-style management, administration and politics. 
Outsiders often worry that, being relatively new, Japanese democracy may be only skin-deep. Not so. Most of the democratic institutions that were restored during the post-war occupation-universal suf frage, the parliamentary system, a free and varied press, a modem legal system-were not thrust on an unwilling people but demanded by the Japanese themselves. If anything, the problem with Japan today is that its democratic institutions are almost too powerful and not flexible enough to deal with changing times. 
The Japanese people sense that the time has come for a ""third opening""-the introduction of a wholly new way of doing things comparable to the Meiji restoration or General MacArthur's post-war reforms. What goes unmentioned, however, is that the Meiji restoration destroyed the livelihoods of a ruling class of 1.5m samurai; and that the post-war reforms introduced by the Allied powers drove 200,000 wartime leaders from office. In both cases, the structure of governance was changed dramatically. 
That is why Japan's political parties want nothing to do with reform. It is also the reason why Japanese voters are becoming increasingly independent, and ready to punish those who would try to turn back (or stop) the clock. Mr Mori's new administration is expected to be short-lived. What follows for the LDP and its coalition partners is anyone's guess. Some time in the near future, there is going to be serious political deadlock in Japan. But out of that will come, doubtless with pain and struggle, the ""third opening"" of Japan that will pitch the country into the brave new post-industrial world.

In 1990 - 91 the bubble economy collapsed , ushering in stagnation that lasted a decade : Japan 's deepest and longest slump in more than 50 years . The recession hit family incomes especially hard . Bonuses , if paid at all , have been slashed;wage rises are out of the question ; overtime is a thing of the past . 
 Worst of all , loyalty to the company - the bedrock upon which Japan Inc was built - is no longer being rewarded . Older workers , who are costlier because of Japan 's seniority pay system , are being told unceremoniously to leave . Unemployment , barely heard of a decade ago , has hit an official 5 % ( measured properly , it is at least 7 % ) , and is set to climb still further , even as the Japanese economy begins its slow recovery . The unemployed can be seen in the parks ; some live in neat cardboard boxes , beside small gardens which They carefully tend to fill up the hours . 
 According to opinion polls , one family in eight has a member who has recently been made redundant ( risutora , or "" restructured "" , in the bitter workers ' jargon ) , or expects to be made so shortly . One in five youngsters looking for a first job have been unable to find one . Meanwhile , the Bank of Japan 's policy of zero interest rates has mercilessly squeezed the savings of a rapidly ageing population . Little wonder that suicides have risen by 53 % since 1991 . 
 Crime , too , has risen sharply , especially among the young . Not since the 1950s have Japanese city centres been places to avoid after dark ; but now gangs of young thugs go in search of easy targets , particularly drunken sararimen . Meanwhile , schoolgirl prostitution has become one of the biggest headaches for the police . If only for the vicarious thrill , one in three girls of high - school age admits to having dialled one of the "" telephone clubs "" that match callers with men willing to pay for sex . 
 In Japanese classrooms ( once famous for the cheerful obedience of the children ) , incidents of teachers being threatened with knives or beaten with baseball bats have become so common that they are no longer front - page news . Instead , reporters find bloodier incidents to cover . There are now more hours of bloody mayhem every week on Japan 's Tv screens than on America 's . And for all these signs of breakdown , economic , moral or social , voters naturally blame Yoshiro Mori . 
 The lone persimmon tree 
 Apart from a ten - month blip in 1993 - 94 , Yoshiro Mori has governed Japan continuously since Yoshiro Mori was formed in 1955 by a merger of two conservative parties . Yoshiro Mori's role then was to counter the surging influence of Japan 's left - wing parties ; there was a real fear , though it seems strange now , that Marxism might take the country over . Before long , however , Yoshiro Mori had declared a truce with the Japan Socialist Party , and both sides set about carving up the benefits of the economic miracle that was gathering pace . 
 With order - books full as exports boomed and with skilled labour starting to run short , the companies co - opted the trade unions by offering training , health care and a job for life . Within a few years , Japan 's once belligerent unions had been broken up and transformed into thousands of small company associations that became , in effect , part of the management . From that moment , the ideological left lost its influence in Japan . Unrestrained , Yoshiro Mori turned Yoshiro Mori's attention to promoting the interests of Yoshiro Mori's three main groups of supporters : farmers , small shopkeepers and the construction industry . 
 After the samurai , farmers were the most privileged group in Japan 's old feudal hierarchy . And Yoshiro Mori has protected them as thoroughly as any feudal lord . Yoshiro Mori fought tooth and nail to keep Virginia tobacco out of Japan , so that off budget subsidies could be fed to tobacco - growing farmers from Japan Tobacco , the governmentowned cigarette monopoly . Everywhere else in the world where Virginia tobacco competes freely , it gets around 30 % of the market . in Japan , Yoshiro Mori has managed to keep Yoshiro Mori's share to no more than 3 % . 
 Rice - growers have been treated even more kindly . For years , foreign rice was banned in Japan , save for an annual 14,000 tonnes of Thai rice needed by Okinawan brewers for a local tipple . But in 1992 , when , under the Uruguay Round of world trade negotiations , all non - tariff barriers were to be replaced by measurable tariffs , Yoshiro Mori refused to comply . It took six years to persuade Japan to accept tariffs on foreign rice , rather than an outright ban . And even then Yoshiro Mori had the last word . Yoshiro Mori set the tariff at Y351 ( $ 2.70 ) per kilogramme , three - and - a - half times the price of American rice . 
 Yet rice is no longer Japan 's staple food . Wheat , in the form of bread and noodles , provides the bulk of people 's calories these days . With Yoshiro Mori's stockpiling granaries full to the brim , Japanese farmers have long been paid not to produce the stuff . In the lowlands of Japan , terraced paddy fields have become a rare sight . Farmers drain their fields and plant fruit or vegetables instead . Increasingly , however , they are letting the land lie untended . Thanks to Yoshiro Mori , Japanese farmers need do no more to collect their subsidies each year than plant a lone persimmon tree . 
 Year after year , Yoshiro Mori managed to convince ordinary citizens that high prices were in their own best interests . Consumers were told that , yes , prices might be a little higher than elsewhere , but they ensured reliable supplies of food , maintained the quality of Japanese goods and , of course , helped to keep everyone fully employed . No matter that Japanese housewives paid up to eight times the American price for rice , five times the American price for beef , fruit and processed food , and three to four times as much for travel , clothing and telephone calls . 
 It could not go on . Japan 's demographics , as Yoshiro Mori has known for years , were working remorselessly against Yoshiro Mori's machines . In short , Yoshiro Mori's hard - ore supporters in the countryside were dying of old age . Back in the mid-1960s , one in three Japanese lived in a household of farmers . By 1995 , only one in 20 was part of a family that worked the land . Many had moved with the children into the cities ; many more had been interred in the local temple 's ground . Thanks to gerrymandering and migration , the rural constituencies went on for years enjoying three times the voting clout of their urban counterparts . But nature worked inexorably : one way or another , between the mid-1960s and the mid-1990s , Yoshiro Mori lost some 20 m supporters . 
 Quintessence of dust 
 Japan 's once - vast network of small retailers has shrivelled , too . Twenty years ago , neighbourhood streets were lined with poky stores that stacked up their goods on the pavement for all to see . Inside , the obaasan ( grandmother ) would quickly take a duster to anything the customer asked to see . With discounting unheard of and inventories paid for by the producer , goods cost the shopkeeper nothing to keep on the shelves . So they gathered dust while waiting for a customer to pay the full price . 
 For years , these shops have been dying off or selling out . The retail law that had long protected them from the big discount chains was watered down in the early 1990s under pressure from American trade officials , who wanted to help Toys "" R "" Us gain a foothold in Japan . The result is that convenience stores operated by Seven - Eleven , FamilyMart , Lawsons , Circle x and other national chains have replaced most of the little shops - which , as well as selling dog - eared items , also campaigned vigorously for Yoshiro Mori . 
 Yoshiro Mori has gone out of Yoshiro Mori's way to preserve Yoshiro Mori's one remaining big prop , the 6 m workers in the construction industry . The banks have been arm - twisted into forgiving billions of yen owed by insolvent building firms , and Yoshiro Mori has dumped an extra ono trillion of taxpayers ' money into the struggling economy over the past eight years - mostly as public - works projects . 
 Some Y1 trillion of that money went on the Akashi Kaikyo bridge , between Kobe and Awaji island in Osaka Bay . When the bridge opened a few years ago , officials announced that they expected 37,000 cars a day to use it . In the same breath , they cheerfully admitted that , before the bridge was built , only 100 - 200 cars made the crossing each day by ferry . Now that the tourist novelty has worn off , less than a tenth of the bridge 's expected traffic shows up on a typical weekday . And even with largesse like this , debt - ridden building firms continue to fall like flies . 
 Despite the erosion of Yoshiro Mori's support , Yoshiro Mori has proved unable to shift Yoshiro Mori's focus away from producers and towards consumers . This myopia did not matter as long as the economy continued to expand and corporate profits trickled down even to the lowliest of workers . But the recession that has gripped Japan for the better part of a decade has forced employers to tear up the "" social compact "" they had with Yoshiro Mori . 
 Under this informal arrangement , companies were protected from over - aggressive competition at home by a careful balance of government regulation and licensing , while being allowed to charge high prices and shelter their profits from excessive taxation . In exchange , they undertook to hire more employees than they needed and not to fire them when times got hard . For their part , employees accepted the long hours , modest pay and poor conditions because the company promised to look after them , if not for life , at least for a good number of years . 
 It is this part of the agreement that has collapsed . Since 1997 , up to i m people a year have been "" restructured "" out of their jobs - ie , forced to quit against their wishes . Bosses rely heavily on peer pressure , bullying and other tricks to force their unwanted workers to leave . The result is deepening social division and bitterness , both inside and outside the office . And redundancies are expected to continue at this rate for three or four more years , until Japanese companies have finally reduced their inflated headcounts to globally competitive levels . 
 Dependent old , profligate young 
 None of this anxiety was reflected in the parties ' campaign statements . None offered specific ideas as.to how to modernise the economy ; how to create a million new jobs a year ; how to cap surging health costs while improving the quality of care ; how to make it easier for mothers to work ; and , above all , how to cope with the country 's rapidly ageing population , including plugging the gaping holes in the pension schemes . 
 The Japanese , better educated and wider - read than their western counterparts , are well aware of the problems in store . Demographers have often told them that the population will hit a peak of 128 m ( up from today 's 127 m ) in 2007s , and will then begin to decline quite quickly . Less crowded cities might seem attractive , but not if they are full of old people with few youngsters to do the jobs and keep the services working . Today , there are four workers in Japan to support every elderly dependant . By 2025 , there will be only 2.2 workers for every pensioner . 
 The Japanese want to know what impact all this will have on their own pensions , as well as on their lives and the lives of their children . The "" national burden "" ( taxes plus welfare costs as a proportion of cDr ) is currently 36%-much the same as in America , but less than the European average . By 2025 , if nothing is done , the Japanese figure will have soared to over 60 % . 
 Yet doing nothing is precisely what voters have come to expect of their political leaders . And when politicians make specific proposals , they tend to reveal just how out of touch they are . Earlier this year , for example , Yoshiro Mori announced more public holidays so that people could give the economy a boost by taking trips and going shopping . Young women , however , are already shopping in unbridled fashion , and they have been the saving of Japan . There are now 7 m working women in their teens and aos ; they are better educated , more widely travelled and more ready to experiment than Japan 's young men ; and , since they live at home and pay little in the way of rent and taxes , they have on average more than Y150,000 ( $ 1,400 ) a month to blow on clothes , cosmetics , music , holidays and dining out . 
 These women are a revelation to Japan . They look different : having been brought up on cereals and dairy products instead of the rice and pickles of the generation before , they are a good deal taller than their mothers , and rarely have the bow legs that came from sitting on their calves instead of on a chair . And they are older when they marry : around 27 . Because these young women stay out of the marriage pool much longer than their mothers did , fertility rates have plummeted in Japan to fewer than 1.4 children for each woman , down from more than 2.1 in 1970 . This preference for the good life rather than motherhood is the reason why the Japanese population is set to crash - and why the pensions system needs retooling . 
 The third opening 
 Twice before , Japan has remade itself from top to bottom . In 1868 , after Commander Perry 's gunboats had entered Tokyo Bay and demanded the right to trade , Japan ended its three centuries of self imposed isolation , threw out its military government , restored the Meiji emperor , industrialised frantically and caught up with the West within 3o years . 
 Then , after the surrender in 1945 , Japan jettisoned all the vestiges of its militaristic past and built a modem democracy that laid the foundations for its emergence as an economic superpower 30 years later . Many of Japan 's social , business and economic norms today are relics from that era . 
 That is the nub of the problem . The system that Japan perfected from the i95os onward was designed for an industrial society in its early stages of economic development . It is totally unsuited to a post - industrial world . Thus , Japanese schools all teach virtually the same curricula , all in the same way , all at the same time . Their job , in effect , is to produce cannon - fodder for the manufacturing sector , not oddball characters who can dream up whole new industries . 
 The Pokemon cards and Nintendo games that have overrun the world are mere hints of the creativity that could be unleashed in Japan . They have escaped despite the system . In a post - industrial world that is driven more than ever by iconoclasts drawn from the cleverest 25 % of a country 's population , Japan is at a serious disadvantage . And what goes for Japanese education applies equally to the country 's 1950s - style management , administration and politics . 
 Outsiders often worry that , being relatively new , Japanese democracy may be only skin - deep . Not so . Most of the democratic institutions that were restored during the post - war occupation - universal suf frage , the parliamentary system , a free and varied press , a modem legal system - were not thrust on an unwilling people but demanded by the Japanese themselves . If anything , the problem with Japan today is that its democratic institutions are almost too powerful and not flexible enough to deal with changing times . 
 The Japanese people sense that the time has come for a "" third opening""-the introduction of a wholly new way of doing things comparable to the Meiji restoration or General MacArthur 's post - war reforms . What goes unmentioned , however , is that the Meiji restoration destroyed the livelihoods of a ruling class of 1.5 m samurai ; and that the post - war reforms introduced by the Allied powers drove 200,000 wartime leaders from office . In both cases , the structure of governance was changed dramatically . 
 That is why Japan 's political parties want nothing to do with reform . Yoshiro Mori is also the reason why Japanese voters are becoming increasingly independent , and ready to punish those who would try to turn back ( or stop ) the clock . Mr Mori 's new administration is expected to be short - lived . What follows for Yoshiro Mori and Yoshiro Mori's coalition partners is anyone 's guess . Some time in the near future , there is going to be serious political deadlock in Japan . But out of that will come , doubtless with pain and struggle , the "" third opening "" of Japan that will pitch the country into the brave new post - industrial world .",740,Japan,A29-8206,IN TERM,True,Yoshiro Mori 's ruling Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ),40,True

IF IT smells, put a lid on it, goes an old Japanese proverb. But it is the wrong prescription for the 30-odd lawsuits that have been lodged in California against Japanese companies such as Mitsubishi and Mitsui on behalf of many Asians and some Allied prisoners of war who were forced into slave labour during the second world war (see page 59). 
The response of both the government and the companies to all such claims has been to point to the 1951 San Francisco peace treaty. Besides waiving ""all reparation claims of the Allied Powers, other claims of the Allied Powers and their nationals"" against Japan, the treaty empowered the allies to seize Japanese property to pay reparations to former servicemen. By 1952, America had seized $90m of Japanese assets and paid some of it to former prisoners of war. Germany made no such settlement after its defeat, says Japan, so the $5.2 billion fund organised by its government last year to compensate wartime slave labourers is not a precedent. 
This hard-line defence has fended off lawsuits in Japan itself. But it may not work in California. As German firms have found to their cost, there is now a well-organised lobby with political clout in America. The shameless theatrics of Edward Fagan, the American lawyer who championed the reparation claims against the German companies, look ominous. Mr Fagan launched his class-action suit against the Japanese companies on the anniversary of Pearl Harbour in December. 
There is certainly an unappealing whiff of blackmail about these latest suits. Yet a quick settlement of them is in all likelihood in Japan's commercial interests. Otherwise the hostility that has begun to build in America, where Japanese exporters sell so many goods, could do serious damage. 
A settlement would also be morally right, despite the passing of time. The surviving labourers, especially the many who were not POWs, have a strong case for compensation from somebody: the question is who. To land the bill on today's shareholders seems capricious. In many cases, the companies and their managers changed when Japan's pre-war zaibatsu were broken up. And it is hard to argue that today's shareholders have reaped huge benefits firm uncompensated slave labour. The underlying perpetrator of these and other crimes was the then government; it is right that its successor should settle claims today, although companies might be invited to make voluntary contributions to any settlement fund. 
Guilty men 
There is another good argument for such a government-- organised settlement. Demands for reparations are becoming entangled with the whole question of Japan's war guilt and contrition. One bill before America's House of Representatives demands, along with reparations, an apology from Japan for its war actions; California's state government has also asked for an ""unambiguous apology"". 
Exasperated Japanese officials maintain that the country has already satisfied foreigners wanting apologies. But the wording of these apologies suggests that the government is still seeking a compromise with those in Japan who are struggling to come to terms with the facts of Japanese history. 
In recent years, a stream of senior Japanese politicians has found it necessary to deny colonial brutality in Korea, the rape of Nanking in China or the ill-effects of Japanese expansion in Asia. The current prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, has himself wondered aloud in parliament whether Japan really launched a war of aggression against its neighbours. It is no wonder that allied prisoners of war, Asian slave labourers, ""comfort women"" and other victims should still be seeking justice.

DURING his almost eight-year stint in the White House, Bill Clinton has had to remember the names of seven different prime ministers of Japan. Before leaving of fice next January, the American president could be welcoming an eighth. The biggest impression given by Japan's new cabinet, which was announced on July qth, is that it is strictly a temporary affair. A whole new government line-up, including the possible replacement of Yoshiro Mori, who became prime minister in April after his predecessor Keizo Obuchi had a stroke, is now expected within five months; perhaps even less. 
Mr Mori's leadership was given only grudging acceptance in the general election on June 25th, which saw the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (r.Dr) lose its majority but remain the largest party in the important lower house of the Diet (parliament). Even so, opinion polls taken since then suggest that astonishingly three out of four Japanese have no expectations whatsoever for Mr Mori's coalition government. More than ever, the r.ne is now hostage to its two main, but small, coalition allies, the Buddhistbacked New Komeito and the dwindling Conservative Party. Two out of three people in Japan, the polls suggest, would like to see the gaffe-prone Mr Mori go. 
Apart from trying to keep the economy's tentative recovery on track, Mr Mori's only real task is to see Japan safely through the summit meeting of the Group of Seven countries plus Russia in Okinawa later this month. Hence the diplomatic experience of Yohei Kono was required, which is the main reason he was kept on as foreign minister. Likewise the octogenarian Kiichi Miyazawa has remained as finance minister,despite expressing a strong desire to leave the government. Both men are considered to have a safe pair of hands and are well regarded by Japan's G7 partners. 
Taichi Sakaiya, another minister with international credibility who had asked to be excused, agreed reluctantly to stay as head of the Economic Planning Agency. Mr Sakaiya, a former bureaucrat turned author, has won plenty of respect for refusing to fudge the lacklustre GAP figures as much as his predecessors did. Neither Mr Miyazawa nor Mr Sakaiya would have agreed to remain in the cabinet for another term if they had thought it was going to last for any length of time. 
Hangovers from the previous cabinet aside, most of Mr Mori's new ministers are time-servers from the ruling party who have been appointed more for their loyalty than their talent. As a result, the new cabinet's average age is the highest since 1990. The LDP's four main factions could easily have fielded more suitable candidates, but opted not to waste their best men on what they clearly see as only an interim administration. 
As delighted as they were to be told that the chance had finally come for a ministerial post, most of the new cabinet members were adamant about the one job they would not take: the construction portfolio. This is normally a plum post for any up-and-coming LDP leader, bringing with it lots of favours that will later be returned by construction firms grateful for the government's generous spending on public works. 
Unfortunately, though, that now looks like a dangerous job. Yet another bribery scandal has emerged within the Lne. Eiichi Nakao, a former construction minister, was arrested on June 30th on suspicion of receiving Y30m ($285,000) in kickbacks from a construction firm called Wakachiku in return for public works contracts. On July 3rd, the Tokyo public prosecutor's office raided the construction ministry, searching offices and confiscating documents, as the scandal spread and other informants chipped in. 
Initially, the LDP's secretary-general, Hiromu Nonaka, and the new chief cabinet secretary, Hidenao Nakagawa, had allocated the powerful construction post to Tadamori Oshima. But when he balked and no other takers could be found within the LDr itself, the job was offered to Chikage Ogi, the 67year-old leader of the New Liberal Party. Mrs Ogi, a former actress in a musical troupe, was supposed to get the education post. ""Why me?"" she fumed when informed that instead she was being given construction. Because everyone else, she was told, feared the mounting media scrutiny of their connections to the construction industry. 
How far the LDP's latest scandal will reach is still a matter for speculation. Some believe it could grow more troublesome and force Mr Mori to take responsibility and resign, in much the same way as the late Noboru Takeshita was forced out of office a decade ago over the Recruit ""shares-forfavours"" scandal. One way or another, Mr Mori is in for a rough time when the Diet convenes this autumn. The opposition demands that key witnesses in the Wakachiku scandal are made to testify before the Diet. 
But if the LDP's latest scandal does not bring down the present government first, then something else surely will. The most likely cause is a package of administrative reforms that is set to go into effect on January ist 2001. In a bid to streamline Japan's cumbersome government administration, the present 21 ministries and agencies are to be lumped together to form is super-ministries plus a beefed up cabinet office. In the process, the number of cabinet posts will be trimmed from 19 to a dozen or so. The easiest way to do that will be with a reshuffle after the budget has been compiled in December. 
The name that the outgoing President Clinton might then have to conjure with could be Mr Kono, providing the foreign minister can be persuaded to stay on even longer, or Koichi Kato, a former general secretary of the party who was relegated to the sidelines by Mr Obuchi after having challenged him for the leadership. Neither would be a bad choice. Both are competent politicians and, with any luck, could at least be relied upon to end the embarrassment that the Japanese evidently feel about their current leadership.

 But if the LDP 's latest scandal does not bring down the present government first , then something else surely will . The most likely cause is a package of administrative reforms that is set to go into effect on January ist 2001 . In a bid to streamline Japan 's cumbersome government administration , the present 21 ministries and agencies are to be lumped together to form is super - ministries plus a beefed up cabinet office . In the process , the number of cabinet posts will be trimmed from 19 to a dozen or so . The easiest way to do that will be with a reshuffle after the budget has been compiled in December . 
 The name that the outgoing President Clinton might then have to conjure with could be Mr Kono , providing the foreign minister can be persuaded to stay on even longer , or Koichi Kato , a former general secretary of the party who was relegated to the sidelines by Mr Obuchi after having challenged him for the leadership . Neither would be a bad choice . Both are competent politicians and , with any luck , could at least be relied upon to end the embarrassment that the Japanese evidently feel about their current leadership .",740,Japan,A29-8206,IN TERM,True,"Yoshiro Mori , who became prime minister in April after his predecessor Keizo Obuchi had a stroke",11,True

Still smarting from a hiding at the polls and a corruption scandal that seemed briefly to threaten his cabinet, the hapless Mr Mori has had to endure yet more abuse for his government's decision to bail out Sogo, a hopelessly indebted retailer. So much for that plan. On July 11th, senior officials from the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which dominates Japan's ruling coalition, told Sogo that public money would not be forthcoming after all. The next day, Sogo filed for bankruptcy. 
Sogo has debts of Y1 .87 trillion ($17.3 billion), so its bankruptcy has rekindled fears about the health of Japan's financial system. For now, the big banks look in reasonable shape. Sogo's main bank, Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ), even claims that the retailer's demise will not affect its profits. But as Brian Waterhouse of HSBC, a British bank, points out, Sogo also borrowed heavily from Japan's myriad small and undercapitalised credit unions and agricultural cooperatives. Mr Waterhouse suspects these loans are unsecured, leaving lenders especially vulnerable. 
Even the big banks may not be immune from the mess that could follow Sogo's collapse. Mr Mori had the final word on Sogo because of the nationalisation and resale of Long-Term Credit Bank, now called Shinsei Bank. Under foreign ownership and new management, Shinsei has been taking a harder look at its loan portfolio than is customary in Japan. It has already forced several big companies into bankruptcy. When the Lor indicated it wanted Sogo saved, Shinsei sold its loans back to the government as a first step towards a debt-forgiveness deal. Now that this lifeline appears to have been severed for one important borrower, it will be difficult for the government to rescue others. 
Other weak Shinsei customers also in deep trouble include big construction companies and non-bank financial firms. In the past week, shares in Kumagai Gumi, a building firm that wants its debts forgiven, have fallen by more than 300. Nor may Shinsei be the only bank in Japan that intends to play by a new set of rules. In August, Nippon Credit Bank, which was also nationalised and was recently sold to a consortium led by the Internet investor, Softbank, plans to relaunch itself. 
For all the cheers going up for Sogo's collapse, Mr Mori's about-face points to the disorganised shambles that often passes for policymaking in Japan. The decision to pull the plug on Sogo seems as arbitrary as the earlier one to save it. Nagasakiya, a big department-store chain, was allowed to collapse earlier this year. Marui Imai, a Hokkaido-based retailer, was bailed out by the government in 1998. There may even be a case for bailing out some of the companies that now seem destined to follow Sogo to the bankruptcy courts. But that would require a clear policy, political courage and punishment for incumbent managers and shareholders. So far, the LDP has delivered none of these things. In their absence, the fate of Japan's weakest companies seems to be in the hands of a lynch mob. ","IN THE end , it was all too much for Yoshiro Mori's .

""It's only in Japan that 40-somethings are considered brats:"" Even in Japan, however, brats occasionally have their day. A new group of ""young"" politicians from the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which dominates the coalition government, has begun to rattle the party's elderly executive. 
It is led by Mr Ishihara's 43-year-old son, Nobuteru. The 50 members of the Diet (parliament) who have joined the group, which calls itself ""Make a Tomorrow for the LDP"", are already making their mark. Last week, the government hastily abandoned an unpopular plan to bail out Sogo, a politically connected department store. This embarrassing reversal was not only a concession to the public's displeasure at propping up the ailing retailer. It also looked like a panicky move to quell rebellion within the LDP's own ranks, especially among its younger members. This week, the younger Mr Ishihara and his followers had been planning to voice their opposition to the proposed bailout of the department store. 
Nor has Sogo's ensuing bankruptcy settled the quarrel. Agitated young politicians such as Taro Kono, who calls the LDP's leadership ""blind"", are still spoiling for a fight. Even more seasoned members of the group, among them Yasuhisa Shiozaki, are showing some spirit. After a meeting this week between the new group and party bosses, Mr Shiozaki said he came away with the feeling that he had been ignored. 
In part, critics like Mr Kono and Mr Shiozaki are venting the sorts of frustrations felt by ambitious, younger people in all traditional Japanese organisations. With promotion based strictly on seniority, the climb to the top of the greasy pole can take a lifetime. The LDP's own seniority system, which regulates the struggle for power between the party's competing factions, is particularly rigid. The average age of the cabinet is 66. Six out of 19 ministers are over 70, and one is 80. It is no surprise that Nobuteru Ishihara's group contains the LDP's most promising young talent. Their confidence, charisma and international outlook make this generation of politicians especially frustrated by the distant, elderly old coves who run Japan. 
The group is also united by a hardheaded appraisal of the LDP's poor showing in the lower-house election last month. Party elders blame the LDP's customary weak support in the cities, which was certainly reflected in the results in the 300 constituency seats. But far more troubling, argues Mr Ishihara's group, were the party's losses among the 180 remaining seats decided by proportional representation. Less than half of those who voted for Mr Kono also cast their ballots for the LDP. This pattern was consistent throughout Japan, both in the cities and in the LDP's traditional strongholds in the countryside. Mr Shiozaki says his party label was a liability during the campaign, although he sits for a rural constituency. He left party posters in their boxes and asked campaign helpers to avoid mention of the Lne. Again, young LDP politicians argue that the party's seniority system is to blame. They say voters feel that the dinosaurs who run the party seem hopelessly out of touch with what modem Japanese want from their politicians. The prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, an old-style dispenser of pork with few obvious modem political skills, wins the approval of just 20% of opinion-poll respondents. Worse, says Mr Kono, the LDr, after a brief flirtation with reform, has recently been going backwards. 
Party elders may take the view that rebellions have come and gone before, and that this one will fizzle out. One feature of Nobuteru Ishihara's group is the number of second-generation politicians it contains. Mr Kono's father, Yohei, is foreign minister. The father of Makiko Tanaka, another prominent member, was once prime minister. Privileged and protected as they are, there is some doubt whether Nobuteru Ishihara and his like have the stomach for a real fight. Their crueller critics call them ""bon bon""-poor little rich kids who have been fed expensive foreign sweets all their lives. 
No one, however, should overlook the widening split between reformers and conservatives in the party. Reform-minded LDP heavyweights such as Koichi Kato have been lying low. But Mr Kato may soon use Nobuteru Ishihara's group to press his own case for being made prime minister. Ultimately, the LDP's young turks could even have the deciding say in whether the party achieves an accommodation between its warning halves. They are already talking about fielding their own candidate for the election of the party's next president, and thus the country's prime minister. He will not be a dinosaur.

SINCE the debacle in Seattle last year, when efforts to launch a round of global trade talks went up in a puff of tear gas, there has been much hand-wringing about the need to make another push for a big new round. But in this case, bigger need not be better. A bigger agenda haggled over by more participants to lesser effect-that, alas, is what a new round of ministerial-level trade negotiations at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) would probably mean. In practice, hopes that a meeting to launch this might take place by the end of 2000 are little more than wishful thinking. This is fortunate: the delay might well be for the best. Coming so soon after Seattle, any meeting would need to be a stunning success to avoid being judged a catastrophic failure, and would also run the risk of a repeat of Seattle-style chaos. 
At their summit last month in Okinawa, the richest nations endorsed a call from Yoshio Mori, Japan's prime minister, for a new round. Since then, Pascal Lamy, the Eu's trade commissioner, has touted the idea around South-East Asia, having previously promoted it in North America. Britain's trade and industry minister, Stephen Byers, has since added his voice to the chorus. As they know, in the short term they are wasting their breath. There is the small matter of an American election in November. The Clinton administration's priority before then is to see through the normalisation of trade relations with China. Political difficulties over China's own accession to the WTO are also emerging, because of the disputed status of Taiwan. With such obstacles in the way, nothing grand is likely to be possible until next year. 
Nor are these the only political roadblocks. Although the new round is to have as its hallmark the admirable goal of lowering the barriers to developing countries' exports, support for the talks outside the rich countries is mixed. And for good reason: the last important set of trade talks-the Uruguay Round that wound up in 1994-had the same goal. It of fered promises from America and the Eu of market access for emerging economies. But few changes have materialised in the markets for crops and textiles-the goods in which developing countries often have a comparative advantage. In fact, the levels of farm subsidies in both America and the Eu have actually risen. It is not surprising that poor countries are unconvinced about the merits of a new round. 
Rather than bulldoze one through, rich-world politicians might do better to try to ease the poor countries' worries. India, a growing power at the WTO, is particularly sceptical. It wants first to see revisions to existing agreements and a follow-through on old pledges-and was this week celebrating a victory at the WTO against the Eu on its textile exports. But, like many emerging economies, it has its hands full trying to comply with existing WTO rules on intellectual property and foreign investment. 
It is telling that even some of the WTO's own bureaucrats have trouble mustering much enthusiasm for a new round. They have two powerful arguments: that the reform of WTO rules might proceed more easily in rolling negotiations, than if it is entangled in a compromise-laden jumbo package of reforms; and, second, that sorting out disputes case-by-case-as is happening now-may be more productive than seeking extensive WTO mandates on specific issues. 
Build on success, not failure 
Despite the well-publicised rows, resolving differences has in fact been one of the WTO's successes. The Sanitary and Phytosanitary Committee, for instance, which deals with foodsafety and health, has considered ioo cases since its creation, and only three have required action by panels of the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body (DSS). Through the nss's rulings, which have largely been respected by both complainants and respondents, an extensive ""case law"" has developed. 
Losers have often complained about the practice of using case law from disputes to clarify vague rules. But it might be a better way to make progress than a full-blown ministerial meeting. For now, plodding progress with the occasional stepping-on of toes is preferable to the all-or-nothing risks of a post-Seattle round. There will be a time (and, with luck, even a safe place) for a new round. That time is not now. 
However, if the rich countries really want to galvanise support for a round, perhaps they should set an example. Why not start with some unilateral reductions in trade barriers? There is no reason to wait for a round to ease market access for poor countries. For disillusioned countries such as India, some such act of good faith might even start to dispel the mistrust that poisoned efforts last time around.

As the prime minister disports himself on the tennis courts of Tuscany, he can draw comfort from the knowledge that rarely has a governing party been in such a strong position in the run-up to an election. 
Both Gallup and ICM agree that the party's lead over the Conservatives has widened in the past month.

The opinion poll results have predictably given rise to rumours that the government might be tempted to capitalise on its good fortune by staging an early election this autumn before the new session of parliament begins in November.

None of this, however, is good news for the Conservative leader, William Hague. His party is still bumping around in the polls at 34% according to icM, at 32% according to Gallup. With an election probably less than a year away, the Tories are still far from making a serious challenge.

Though they are rather less hostile to visitors today, the country remains remarkably closed. Compared with most other rich countries, Japan has a tiny foreign population (see chart). Now the government is in the middle of its first big rethink of immigration rules in ten years and some changes are expected. 
A visit to a Tokyo hospital shows why they are needed. A few weeks ago doctors treating a Chinese man found bruises on his stomach and chest and a fracture two centimetres (about an inch) long in his skull. His beating, by an immigration officer at Tokyo's Narita airport, was not unusual. According to a former security guard, people kept at the airport's two detention centres are often beaten.Only nikkeijin, or foreigners of Japanese descent, may come to work in Japan as unskilled labourers. A barrage of regulations restricts the intake of skilled workers to a trickle. Illegal workers are pursued and deported with a zeal that justifiably alarms human-rights groups. 
But now the government is worried that without more migrants, especially computer-literate ones,Japan may fall behind its economic rivals. The country's booming information-technology industry is desperately short of skilled workers.

Taking their cue, officials at the justice ministry's immigration office say they may soon ease the rules for such migrants. 
Much more controversial is the ministry's suggestion that Japan should open its doors to lots of low-paid, low-skilled nursing assistants, a proposal championed by Nikkeiren,Japan's employers' federation.

The nursing plan echoes an unofficial policy during the boom of the 198os.

Not so among outsiders. According to a United Nations report this year, Japan is greying so quickly that it will need to import over 600,000 workers annually until 2050 to keep its working population stable. By then, if Japan follows the UN's advice, nearly a third of its population will be of foreign descent. That thought may fill most Japanese with dread. But they cannot ignore their dwindling numbers for ever. ","THE Japanese once put foreigners to death for trespassing on their islands . 
 Though they are rather less hostile to visitors today , the country remains remarkably closed . Compared with most other rich countries , Japan has a tiny foreign population ( see chart ) . Now the government is in the middle of its first big rethink of immigration rules in ten years and some changes are expected . 
 A visit to a Tokyo hospital shows why they are needed . A few weeks ago doctors treating a Chinese man found bruises on his stomach and chest and a fracture two centimetres ( about an inch ) long in his skull . His beating , by an immigration officer at Tokyo 's Narita airport , was not unusual . According to a former security guard , people kept at the airport 's two detention centres are often beaten . Only nikkeijin , or foreigners of Japanese descent , may come to work in Japan as unskilled labourers . A barrage of regulations restricts the intake of skilled workers to a trickle . Illegal workers are pursued and deported with a zeal that justifiably alarms human - rights groups . 
 But now the government is worried that without more migrants , especially computer - literate ones , Japan may fall behind its economic rivals . The country 's booming information - technology industry is desperately short of skilled workers . Europe and America , which have similar shortages , have put together schemes to attract computer programmers from India , China and elsewhere .

TOKYO 
ALONG with its statesmen, Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has had its fair share of rogues. There was Shin Kanemaru, the ""don of dons"", who was discovered in 1992 with $50m in cash, bonds and gold bars stashed in his office. The late Noboru Takeshita, who was forced from office a decade ago following the Recruit ""shares-- for-favours"" scandal, once declared that he deserved to die ""a thousand times"" for his sins. So it has been with a certain weariness that voters have greeted the news that the vDe is again vowing to clean up Japanese politics. So far, the mood seems justified. Even before a new anti-graft bill reaches parliament, which re-opened this week, claims were being made that it was full of holes. 
The arrest, in June, of Eiichi Nakao, a former construction minister and LDP grandee, only added to the suspicion. Mr Nakao has been charged with accepting Y60m ($566,000) in bribes from Wakachiku, a construction company. Prosecutors claim he promised to favour the firm with publicworks contracts. Wakachiku is said to have got the money from Heo Young Jong, a property developer with ties to the Yamaguchigumi, Japan's biggest crime syndicate. 
Rumours are circulating in Nagatacho, Tokyo's political district, that prosecutors have enough evidence to arrest at least one member of the cabinet, although so far they have failed to act. It is suggested that the LDP has managed to kill the investigation. But public prosecutors enjoy some independence. A more likely reason for their reluctance to nobble the cabinet, if true, is that they fear losing in court. Bribery is hard to prove in Japan. Because prosecutors cannot use sting operations, wiretaps or plea-bargaining to secure convictions, they must rely on slippery circumstantial evidence. They must also prove that officials were in a ""position of authority"" to peddle influence in exchange for bribes. It is thanks to the courts' strict interpretation of this rule that many high-profile cases have ended in acquittal. 
The LDP does not have an obvious front man for its clean-up. As well as the anti-graft bill, Yoshiro Mori, japan's unloved prime minister, has been trying to draw up a code of conduct for politicians, which would attempt to get them to clean up their image by, for instance, not visiting brothels. But because of Mr Mori's own dubious ethics, this has quickly turned into an uphill struggle. In July, Mr Mori had to apologise for making Kimitaka Kuze his cabinet minister in charge of cleaning up the finance industry. This was a post which Mr Kuze occupied for only 27 days before he resigned over suspect payments from a bank. Mr Mori has told parliament he knew about the payments before appointing Mr Kuze, but thought they posed no problem. Meanwhile, Mr Mori is suing a magazine for alleging he was arrested during a trip to a brothel as a student in 1958. 
Nor has the opposition Democratic Party escaped the mire. Its noisy championing of tougher rules for bribe-taking was brought to a swift halt this month with the arrest of Joji Yamamoto, a Democratic Party politician. Mr Yamamoto is accused of embezzling the publicly-funded salary of a nonexistent staff secretary, a practice which is reported to be widespread. 
The irony in all this is that politics really do seem to be getting cleaner. The abolition of multi-seat constituencies in 1993 did away with the intra-party competition for votes which had hugely boosted the demand for political funds. Laws passed in the same year put tough controls on corporate donations. Of the Y152 billion of revenues that Japan's political parties reported last year, just Y15 billion came from big business. Business donations have not been lower since 1976. 
This is encouraging a new style of politics, especially among younger politicians. Older politicians in rural seats still practise trusted methods, securing a hard vote with hard cash channelled through a network of personal connections. Younger politicians in urban seats have begun to organise looser, policy-based support groups over the Internet that require far less money to run. 
The much-maligned anti-graft bill may be strengthened during its passage through parliament. The opposition says the bill does not cover the activities of politicians' private secretaries, a particularly useful loophole in a country where documents are still signed with a personal seal instead of the hand. One-off payments will be subject to the new rules, but regular payments will not. Crucially, however, prosecutors may no longer need to prove the power of authority in a bribery case to secure a conviction. ","Japan

Since 1997, by contrast, although the party has suffered defeats in elections to the European Parliament, local councils and the London mayoralty, almost no one has dared suggest that Labour will fail to win the next election comfortably. The main reason for this enduring faith in the governing party's electoral prospects has been the message coming from the opinion polls. These have consistently predicted a comfortable Labour victory at the next general election-which does not have to be called until 2002, but which most people expect to be held next May. 
Little wonder then that the results of four polls published in the last week have left pundits as well as ministers in disarray. For all the surveys suggested that Labour's apparently impregnable lead-still no less than 15 points on average in August-has suddenly disappeared in the immediate wake of the fuel crisis. The best news the latest polls could find for Labour was one from Nor that simply put the Conservatives neck and neck with Labour. The worst was a Gallup reading that put Labour no less than five points behind. 
It is true that because of the current peculiarities of Britain's electoral map, the NoP resuit-if it was replicated evenly across the country-would still be enough to deliver an overall Labour majority. In 1997 the electoral system was particularly kind to Labour because its votes piled up in the right parts of the country. But ifthis pattern is not repeated at the next election-and it was broken in this year's local election results-then even the Nor figures would see Mr Blair reliant on Liberal Democrat support to stay in power. The voting totals shown by Gallup would see Labour lose its overall majority under any circumstances-and would deliver the Tories an overall majority of 17 if (as in the local elections) they do particularly well in key marginal seats. 
But, says many a pundit sagely, this is all but a temporary blip. The public will forget the fuel crisis soon enough. After all, voters have still not forgiven the Conservatives for the disasters of the last government, let alone developed any confidence in William Hague, the Tory leader. And with the economy still performing strongly, there is little reason why the public should feel aggrieved about Mr Blair's period in office. 
However, a look at what happened to John Major, Mr Blair's predecessor as prime minister, should scotch the belief that Mr Blair will automatically enjoy a speedy recovery. For at one time Mr Major was, like Mr Blair, a very popular prime minister. After taking office in November i99o, his satisfaction rating rarely dipped below 50%, up to and including the April 1992 general election. But then along came ""Black Wednesday""when the Major government was humiliatingly forced to devalue the pound and quit the European exchange-rate mechanism. 
After that, Mr Major became a very unpopular prime minister indeed. Now the fuel crisis seems to have dealt Mr Blair a similar blow. Even before the petrol blockades went up, only 4596 of the public were saying that they were satisfied with his performance as prime minister. Mr Blair has been below 50% in the ratings for most of this year. Now, according to MORI, Mr Blair's rating has fallen to just 32%-just as Mr Major's rating fell from 47%a to 33% immediately after Black Wednesday. For Mr Major there was no recovery. Within a few weeks his rating was down to no more than 21%. 
If Mr Blair suffers a Major-like fall in his personal popularity, the next big question will be whether he, like Mr Major, loses control of his own party. So far, electoral popularity has enabled Mr Blair to maintain a near-iron discipline within his party. But with this now in question, he runs some risk of imitating Mr Major's fate here too. 
Under Mr Major the Tories' unpopularity and their internal divisions fed on each other-the worse the Tory leader did in the polls, the more his party played up, and the weaker he looked. Of course, Mr Major suf fered from some unique problems, in particular a tiny Parliamentary majority and the Tories' deep divisions over Europe. But Mr Blair has problems of his own. Already the fuel crisis has helped to bring the tension between Mr Blair and Gordon Brown, his chancellor, to the surface. Suggestions in a new book that Mr Brown lied about his knowledge of a huge donation to the Labour Party from Bernie Ecclestone> a motor-racing baron, have led to Tory calls for the chancellor's resignation. And suspicions in the Brown camp that Mr Blair's people briefed Andrew Rawnsley, the book's author, will not do much for government unity. 
Divisions lower down the Labour hierarchy may also emerge as the party's Mrs begin to fear for their political future. If the latest polls are right, one in four Labour Mrs can no longer be sure that they will survive the next election. On rcM's figures, for example, Labour could expect to win at most 310 seats, more than roo fewer than in 1997. Labour Mps whose careers are in jeopardy may well be more inclined to rebel against the party leadership. In particular, Mr Blair and Mr Brown may find themselves under heavy pressure at next week's Labour Party conference to make some dramatic and expensive gesture towards pensioners. 
Of course, popularity is not a leader's only weapon in the struggle to control his own party. Another tool that can come in handy is personal loyalty. The trouble is that since he became leader Mr Blair has relied on his party's respect, rather than its love. If respect is eroded, he may find he has few bonds of loyalty to fall back on. 
So what is a beleaguered prime minister to do? His best tactic, with both his party and the public, may be to look forward to the future rather than wallow in past recrimination. With much of his 1997 manifesto already implemented-and an election looming-he needs to lay out a picture of where he wants to take the country. If Mr Blair can conjure up a compelling vision of the future, he may be able to arrest the sense of drift that has afflicted his government over the past year.

MOST party conferences are rallies of the faithful, involving much noise and littie consequence. But the Labour Party conference that has just wound up in Brighton mattered-not just for the party, but for the standing of the government across Britain. 
A recent visitor to lo Downing Street was struck by an almost perceptible whiff of panic in the corridors, as ministers squabbled over how to respond to the government's plunge in the opinion polls. Labour activists headed to Brighton, bewildered by the government's precipitous loss of popularity, and alarmed by the spectacle of an apparently out-of-touch administration, keener on fighting internal battles than on responding to public complaints. 
Forceful conference speeches by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, the chancellor, seemed to have restored party morale. Both men were rewarded with prolonged ovations. Their speeches were well balanced: just enough contrition to avoid accusations that ministers were wriggling away from their mistakes, combined with promises to buy off public and party anger that stopped short of exposing the government to charges of panic or headlong retreat. Mr Brown's speech was aimed mainly at the party; Mr Blair's was directed chiefly at the country, and set out the government's case for being granted a second term of office. It would be a clear choice, he claimed, between a government committed to improving education, health and transport, and an opposition set on cutting tax at the expense of public services. 
The strain Mr Blair was under was emphasised by the sweat that, by the end of his speech, had soaked his shirt. He was on trial and he knew it. Not the least of his troubles is the failure of the Millennium Dome. With hindsight, ""I should have listened to those who said that governments shouldn't try to run big visitor attractions,"" he acknowledged. The troubles of the Dome may look small but they are deadly because they raise questions about New Lahour's priorities, as well as about its managerial and economic competence. Unlike other troubles, the Dome cannot be soothed by the Treasury's bulging coffers. 
Two other issues dominated the conference, however: fuel tax and pensions. So far as the party was concerned, pensions mattered above all. The bitter reaction of pensioners to this year's index-linked increase of just 75P ($1.10) on the basic state pension of L67.50 a week was widely blamed for the loss of hundreds of Labour seats in the local elections last May. Since then, public anger has, if anything, grown. 
It spilled over at a fringe meeting in Brighton, when hundreds of angry pensioners shouted down Jeff Booker, the social-security minister, demanding that the government restore the link between pensions and earnings that was abolished by Margaret Thatcher's government. The protesters argue that linking pensions to prices (which rise more slowly than earnings) means that pensinners are failing to share in Britain's growing prosperity. The government replies that ""restoring the link"" will impose an intolerable fiscal burden on future generations. It prefers to ""target"" new money at the poorest pensioners through means-testing. 
Both Mr Brown and Mr Blair strove hard to sell this message to the conference. Mr Blair was rewarded with thunderous applause when he said that he had ""got the message"" that a 75p rise in pensions was unacceptable. Mr Brown made clear that all tim pensioners would be better off over the next two years. Other ministers promised that the next rise in the basic state pension would be well above the rate of inflation. There was also an explicit pledge to raise the meanstested minimum income for poor pensioners from L78 to L90. 
To no avail 
But none of this was enough to stifle a conference revolt. The day after receiving the prime minister's speech in such rapture, the conference voted for a motion to restore the link between pensions and earnings. It was the first time Mr Blair has lost a major conference vote since he became the Labour Party's leader. 
Over the other issue to bedevil the government-high fuel prices-most of the pressure is coming from the public, not the Labour Party. Indeed, party activists loudly cheered John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, when he said that no government can ""re-negotiate (taxes) at a refinery gate, under threat of 60 days' notice."" The chancellor made clear he had no intention of doing so. He accepted, however, that a tripling in oil prices in 18 months could not be defended and said he understood the difficulties it was causing for motorists, business and consumers. 
His aides insisted later that the government would not retreat on fuel prices. The difficulty, one said, had to be remedied not by reductions in fuel taxes but by OPEC increasing oil production. Mr Brown's prebudget statement, due in a few weeks' time, is almost certain to disappoint those who manned the barricades. But while ministers may be talking tough in public they have no desire to trigger further protests at the refineries. Quite probably, Mr Brown's statement will also promise that fuel duties will no longer be linked to inflation, and will produce a package of measures aimed at helping hauliers. Whether this will be enough to woo back angry motorists-or even to head off further protests-is doubtful. 
The recent publication of detailed inside accounts of tensions in government have done nothing to ease strains between ministers. Predictably, one of the prime causes of those tensions, the Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, led calls for unity at a conference fringe meeting. The greatest danger to New Labour, he said, was that it might fall apart in squabbling camps. ""If you lose your message"", he noted, ""you lose your audience, and if you lose your audience, you will lose an election."" Mr Mandelson's message certainly applies to the struggle within the party over pensions-but, as the prime minister knows all too well, it also applies to the feud between Mr Brown and Mr Mandelson, his closest confidants. Putting them jointly in charge of the party's coming election campaign is a gamble. 
Labour's difficulties can easily be exaggerated. A MORI poll published on September 28th-but taken before Mr Blair's speech-showed the party re-establishing a narrow lead over the Tories, with Labour on 37 points and the Tories on 35. For in truth Labour's position remains strong: it can point to the lowest unemployment and the lowest inflation for more than a generation, together with rising investment in public services. Comparing this with the record of previous Labour governments, Mr Blair can hardly complain. 
One casualty of recent events, however, could be plans for an election in May or June, after a vote-winning budget in March. If Labour trails in the polls over 'the next few months, the election is bound to be delayed. Some ministers are already arguing that it should be postponed until the autumn to allow increases in pensions and other public spending to win the public round. ","Despite a bravura conference speech, Tony Blair's control over his party has weakened and he has still to win back the voters' confidence 
MOST party conferences are rallies of the faithful, involving much noise and littie consequence. But the Labour Party conference that has just wound up in Brighton mattered-not just for the party, but for the standing of the government across Britain. 
A recent visitor to lo Downing Street was struck by an almost perceptible whiff of panic in the corridors, as ministers squabbled over how to respond to the government's plunge in the opinion polls. Labour activists headed to Brighton, bewildered by the government's precipitous loss of popularity, and alarmed by the spectacle of an apparently out-of-touch administration, keener on fighting internal battles than on responding to public complaints. 
Forceful conference speeches by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, the chancellor, seemed to have restored party morale. Both men were rewarded with prolonged ovations. Their speeches were well balanced: just enough contrition to avoid accusations that ministers were wriggling away from their mistakes, combined with promises to buy off public and party anger that stopped short of exposing the government to charges of panic or headlong retreat. Mr Brown's speech was aimed mainly at the party; Mr Blair's was directed chiefly at the country, and set out the government's case for being granted a second term of office. It would be a clear choice, he claimed, between a government committed to improving education, health and transport, and an opposition set on cutting tax at the expense of public services. 
The strain Mr Blair was under was emphasised by the sweat that, by the end of his speech, had soaked his shirt. He was on trial and he knew it. Not the least of his troubles is the failure of the Millennium Dome. With hindsight, ""I should have listened to those who said that governments shouldn't try to run big visitor attractions,"" he acknowledged. The troubles of the Dome may look small but they are deadly because they raise questions about New Lahour's priorities, as well as about its managerial and economic competence. Unlike other troubles, the Dome cannot be soothed by the Treasury's bulging coffers. 
Two other issues dominated the conference, however: fuel tax and pensions. So far as the party was concerned, pensions mattered above all. The bitter reaction of pensioners to this year's index-linked increase of just 75P ($1.10) on the basic state pension of L67.50 a week was widely blamed for the loss of hundreds of Labour seats in the local elections last May. Since then, public anger has, if anything, grown. 
It spilled over at a fringe meeting in Brighton, when hundreds of angry pensioners shouted down Jeff Booker, the social-security minister, demanding that the government restore the link between pensions and earnings that was abolished by Margaret Thatcher's government. The protesters argue that linking pensions to prices (which rise more slowly than earnings) means that pensinners are failing to share in Britain's growing prosperity. The government replies that ""restoring the link"" will impose an intolerable fiscal burden on future generations. It prefers to ""target"" new money at the poorest pensioners through means-testing. 
Both Mr Brown and Mr Blair strove hard to sell this message to the conference. Mr Blair was rewarded with thunderous applause when he said that he had ""got the message"" that a 75p rise in pensions was unacceptable. Mr Brown made clear that all tim pensioners would be better off over the next two years. Other ministers promised that the next rise in the basic state pension would be well above the rate of inflation. There was also an explicit pledge to raise the meanstested minimum income for poor pensioners from L78 to L90. 
To no avail 
But none of this was enough to stifle a conference revolt. The day after receiving the prime minister's speech in such rapture, the conference voted for a motion to restore the link between pensions and earnings. It was the first time Mr Blair has lost a major conference vote since he became the Labour Party's leader. 
Over the other issue to bedevil the government-high fuel prices-most of the pressure is coming from the public, not the Labour Party. Indeed, party activists loudly cheered John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, when he said that no government can ""re-negotiate (taxes) at a refinery gate, under threat of 60 days' notice."" The chancellor made clear he had no intention of doing so. He accepted, however, that a tripling in oil prices in 18 months could not be defended and said he understood the difficulties it was causing for motorists, business and consumers. 
His aides insisted later that the government would not retreat on fuel prices. The difficulty, one said, had to be remedied not by reductions in fuel taxes but by OPEC increasing oil production. Mr Brown's prebudget statement, due in a few weeks' time, is almost certain to disappoint those who manned the barricades. But while ministers may be talking tough in public they have no desire to trigger further protests at the refineries. Quite probably, Mr Brown's statement will also promise that fuel duties will no longer be linked to inflation, and will produce a package of measures aimed at helping hauliers. Whether this will be enough to woo back angry motorists-or even to head off further protests-is doubtful. 
The recent publication of detailed inside accounts of tensions in government have done nothing to ease strains between ministers. Predictably, one of the prime causes of those tensions, the Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, led calls for unity at a conference fringe meeting. The greatest danger to New Labour, he said, was that it might fall apart in squabbling camps. ""If you lose your message"", he noted, ""you lose your audience, and if you lose your audience, you will lose an election."" Mr Mandelson's message certainly applies to the struggle within the party over pensions-but, as the prime minister knows all too well, it also applies to the feud between Mr Brown and Mr Mandelson, his closest confidants. Putting them jointly in charge of the party's coming election campaign is a gamble.

IN THE past few years, Japan's politicians have managed to transform the country's public debt from something of hill-like proportions into something truly mountainous. The government is about to make the mountain even bigger, with yet another spending package. Financial folk have been sounding the alarm for years. Now, a few reformist politicians are joining in. This week Junichiro Koizumi, a senior, reform-minded member of the Liberal Democratic Party, which dominates the ruling coalition, said that the government's profligate policies risked causing a fiscal crisis. Even a few of the old guard are getting cold feet. 
As well they might. Although the latest proposed package is not that large-in reality it is worth just under Y4 trillion ($37.4 billion)-it comes on top of the Y120 trillion that the government has spent since 1992 to get the economy moving. Central-government debt, which has grown by 50% over the past four years, topped Y500 trillion in April. Add in local-government and other government-guaranteed debt, and gross public debt is now Y675 trillion-or 136% Of GDP, by far the worst among rich countries. 
The rapid increase in the country's gross debt burden is hurting Japan's creditworthiness. Earlier this month, Moody's, a creditrating agency, downgraded Japan's domestic debt once again, to Aa2, two notches below its best rating, even though Japan is the world's biggest creditor nation. Can the government carry on splurging in this way? 
Certainly, much of the money that it has been spending has been squandered on wasteful building projects or ill-thought-out information-technology schemes. if it continues to inject the economy with fiscal laxatives, the money ought to be better spent But the bigger question is whether it can afford much more of anything. 
Your word is my bond 
Despite the dismal state of its finances, the government still manages to borrow extraordinarily cheaply: ten-year bond yields are below 2%. This is because Japan's battered financial institutions, mainly its banks and life insurers, want to buy only risk-free domestic assets, and because inflation is not considered likely. That will not last for ever: if government debt continues to grow at its present rate, they may start to realise that Japanese government bonds are not the risk-free investments that they still consider them. Yields will then rise-and, if history is any guide, quite sharply. 
That would not only jack up the government's interest bill; it would also cripple the already weak financial sector and snuff out the recent glimmers of recovery among nonfinancial firms. Investment bankers say that some Japanese companies are so worried about rising public debt leading to a bondmarket crash or to inflation (how else to get rid of debts of this size except by printing money?) that they are trying to shrink their domestic operations and expand their foreign ones. If more companies-and investors-follow suit, those who have grimly predicted capital flight and a collapsing currency, could yet be vindicated. 
To make matters worse, the government and the Bank of japan disagree on economic policy. The Bank thinks that the economy is over the worst,which is why it raised interest rates in August, albeit only to 0.25% The government, on the other hand, says that Japan's economy is still fragile, which is why it wants to carry on spending. Even as the government tries to prop up corporate Japan, the central bank's policy has the opposite effect, increasing deflationary pressures and keeping the yen high. 
With no inflation in sight, it was probably premature for the Bank to raise interest rates. it would perhaps have been better to have run a looser monetary policy (by printing money) and a tighter fiscal one, either by cutting spending or by raising taxes. Unfortunately, the government has little appetite for either. The last time that taxes were raised was in 1997, when consumption taxes were put up, helping to tip the country back into recession. Cutting spending holds little appeal to the likes of Yoshiro Mori, the prime minister, who is a firm believer in traditional pork-barrel politics. It was probably the lack of political leadership that forced the hand of the Bank, which thinks of itself as Japan's only credible institution. 
Advocates of fiscal reform need not despair. Pro-reformers within the LDP, led by Koichi Kato (widely viewed as the leading candidate to replace Mr Mori), while not proposing actual spending cuts, are at least opposing new spending plans. The Democratic Party, the leading opposition party, is calling for a 30% reduction in public-works spending, and it is gaining popularity in urban Japan. In a recent poll by the Sankei Shimbun, a centre-right newspaper, twothirds of respondents opposed the new stimulus package. But can Japan afford to wait? It does not require an overly vivid imagination to worry that Japan's inability to make ends meet might one day cause a great deal of pain.

""THE most successful, the most determined and the most upbeat Conservative conference we have seen in years."" William Hague's description of his party conference in Bournemouth this week is more than political hyperbole. After years of disarray, the Tories appear to have refound their nerve. 
True, after the collapse in the government's opinion-poll ratings following the fuel, Dome and pension debacles, the opposition could hardly fail to make some impact. And given the traumatic recent history of Tory defeat, strife and disunity, the comparison with the past is hardly demanding. Nevertheless, the Tories are at last back in business. With an election probably only months away, their recovery is just in time. 
Much of the credit for this must go to Mr Hague. His popularity with the public may still be at rock bottom. The last MORI poll put his personal rating at minus 33, one of the lowest scores ever recorded by an opposition leader. But though he may not be loved by the public, his political talents are at last beginning to be appreciated by his party. He has soothed the rancorous divisions that threatened to extinguish the Tories as a party of government. And there is no doubt about his skills as a platform performer, whether in responding to questions from activists or in delivering full-blown speeches. 
In his winding-up speech to conference, Mr Hague was expected to dismiss New Labour as a soap opera: a fashion that had gone out of fashion. By arguing that the electorate want a Conservative government ""ready to govern for all the people"", he confirmed that one of the themes of the conference was the Tory attempt to reach out beyond its core vote. The week was marked by a series of policy initiatives, from urban renewal to pensions-some clearly borrowed from George Bush's presidential campaign--designed to show that this was a party which believed in ""compassionate conservatism"". 
It was a theme on full display in a speech by the shadow chancellor, Michael Portillo, who appealed to his party to show tolerance, respect and support for all people, whatever their background, race or sexual orientation. Mr Portillo's transformation from right-- wing ideologue to touchy-feely liberal clearly baffled some of his audience. They had expected a hard-hitting attack on Labour's financial profligacy, with at least some details of Tory spending plans and fiscal proposals. Instead they got an intensely personal address, delivered in conversational style, about the need for inclusivity. This was not the speech of a shadow chancellor who expected to be directing the nation's financial affairs in a few months' time. It appeared to be more the speech of a leader-in-waiting who was biding his time. 
The only specific commitments given by Mr Portillo were that a Tory government would cut taxes on business and enterprise, cut duties on fuel, restore the married couple's tax allowance and provide encouragement to increase private spending on health. There was no response to Labour's charge that there is a fib billion ($23.3 billion) hole in the Tory pledge to cut taxes while maintaining spending on health, education, transport and other public services. 
The reluctance to spell out the party's tax and spending plans in advance of an election may be understandable. But the impression that this is a party still in recovery rather than an alternative government in waiting was emphasised by a fuzziness over policy in many key areas from education and health to transport and defence. The party's draft manifesto was greeted with such a yawn that only ib% of party members bothered to vote on its ioo policy proposals. The vacuum has been filled by opportunistic promises to cut fuel taxes and increase pensions. These may have given the Tories an upward blip in the polls. But eventually, the party's credibility will (one hopes) demand well-thought-out, costed proposals. 
Mr Portillo and Mr Hague's attempts to stress the ""inclusive"" nature of modem conservatism were damaged by a false note struck by the shadow home secretary, Ann Widdecombe. A conference heroine, she played her audience skilfully with a catalogue of apparently tough anti-crime measures including a demand for ioo fixed-- penalty fines for possession of marijuana. But even within the Tory party this proposal was widely regarded as impractical and out of touch. Within 24 hours Miss Widdecombe was having to back away from her idea. 
Her starring role at the conference stems partly from one of the weaknesses of the modem Tory party-its lack of women in key posts. It has only 14 female Mrs compared with Labour's 101. And not one of the 20 safe Tory seats whose Mrs are retiring at the next election has a woman candidate. Steven Norris, who was appointed by Mr Hague to improve the Tories' appeal to minorities, says the party needs to address this quickly. It had too readily abandoned the idea of positive discrimination, he told a meeting. Lord Tebbit, a former party chairman, muddied this message, telling the sac that most women were unsuited for politics because of its confrontational nature. 
But generally it was the ""inclusive"" message which came through most strongly at the conference. In recent years the Tory Reform Group, which is on the left of the party, has seemed out of tune with the Tory mainstream. But in a new pamphlet, ""Restoring the Balance"", it caught the current mood by asserting that ""we did not lose the last election because we were insufficiently right-- wing."" Its authors-Damian Green, a front-- bench spokesman on the environment, and Ian Taylor, an HcP who left the Hague shadow cabinet because he could not accept the new harder line on Europe-argued that regaining the trust of voters depended on making a credible commitment to publicly funded health and education services. 
Indeed the party has begun to look almost strangely united. Europe remains the only major issue dividing the Tories. But even this running sore appears to be marginally less virulent as a result of the Danish rejection of the euro. With the prospects of an early British referendum receding, the advocates of Britain joining the euro have become more resigned, and therefore more relaxed. 
Despite the latent bitterness over Europe--""If I thought this lot had any serious chance of winning, then I really would be worried,"" said one europhile MP--the Tory party is less troubled than it has been at any time since its 1997 defeat. For the first time, it has begun to talk to those outside its core supporters. There are even signs that the voters have begun to listen to what is being said. The Conservatives may not yet look like an alternative government, but they have begun to be a credible opposition.

Not since the upper-house elections in 1998 has Koichi Kato held office in the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has dominated Japanese politics almost since its birth in 1955. Mr Kato's resignation in the summer of 1998 as the party's secretary-general, along with the prime minister of the time, Ryutaro Hashimoto, brought to a limp end a historic programme of reforms which, on paper at least, promised revolution. 
So far, Mr Kato has been denied a second chance, as he and his supporters in the LDP'S ""anti-mainstream"" have gently drifted ever farther from the currents of party power. But opportunity has begun to beckon again. The economy is on the mend, and the free-spending policies that replaced reform as recession struck look increasingly to have run their course. According to recent opinion polls, only one voter in 20 now supports the government's economic policies. Sooner or later Yoshiro Mori, who lacks the personal charm of his predecessor, Keizo Obuchi, will step down as prime minister. Mr Kato's supporters make no bones of the fact that they want their man to succeed him. 
The Hashimoto reforms that Mr Kato championed so eloquently now look over-- ambitious. The six reforms-of the bureaucracy, the public finances, the economy, banking, social security and education-pitted the LDP's leaders against the entrenched interests of their own party. Mr Kato wanted nothing less than to turn Japan upside down. Bureaucratic reform would break the state's power over the economy. Economic deregulation would strengthen market forces. A new politics would return power to the politicians. Economic and political reform were two sides of the same coin, thought Mr Kato: Japan had to put more trust in its own people to run things, and less in its governing elite. But the intricate institutional arrangements that bind businessmen, politicians and bureaucrats together in Japan's well-organised polity made such a reform programme hard work. 
Mr Kato now says that the Japanese people themselves were not ready for ""radical spiritual change"". State-led growth may have stifled economic choice. But it also offered the comfort of government protection. The result of reform was confusion and alarm at the sudden responsibilities of the marketplace, and a yearning to turn the clock back. The otherwise unpopular Mr Mori appeals to this mood, with his nostalgia for pre-war society. 
One thing Mr Kato has now learned is to dress his liberalism in conservative colours. Reform has become a dirty word in Japan, bringing to mind the pain of financial crisis, job losses and bankruptcies. In theory, he could took outside the LDP to push his agenda, taking the party's proreformers with him. But other politicians have trodden this path and failed. Radical reform from within the Lnr will fail too, Mr Kato says, and for the same reason: it runs against the thinking of the local community leaders who form the bedrock of LDP support. If he is to succeed, Mr Kato reckons, he must win the trust of these local leaders. That suggests a more cautious programme-one that preserves the direction of reform but tempers the speed. 
Mr Kato knows he cannot provoke a crisis. If he did, he would be vulnerable to charges of party disloyalty. Neither, though,can he afford to wait for ever. At 61, he will soon be eligible to become speaker of the house, an honorary position that would mark the end of his ambitions. Probably, he will wait until after next summer's upper-house elections. If the LDP does badly, Mr Mori will have to resign, clearing the way for Mr Kato to make a bid for the party leadership next autumn. 
Mr Kato does not yet have enough support within the parliamentary party to claim the top job. Most of the one's factions are at best ambivalent towards his ambitions. Besides his own faction, the second-biggest (see chart), he can count on the support of only one other, that led by Taku Yamasaki. To seize power, he must win over Mr Hashimoto's faction, the powerful keiseikai. 
Mr Hashimoto himself is a friend, but he is boss of the keiseikai in name only. The real kingpin is Mikio Aoki, with whom Mr Kato enjoys much cooler relations. To warm things up, Mr Kato has recently supported Mr Aoki's push to change the upper-house electoral system. But he must be equally careful not to cede too much to Mr Aoki, lest, in familiar Japanese fashion, he becomes a puppet whose strings are pulled from behind the scenes. 
Yet Mr Kato does have one or two useful qualities. Like a Japanese Al Gore, he may lack charisma. But he is a forceful debater and powerful thinker, equally at ease with Japanese and western elites. In contrast, it is hard to put a finger on what, if anything, Mr Aoki stands for beyond his personal advancement and the welfare of his faction. He simply does not measure up to Mr Kato, so it is hard to see how he might control him. ""For the first time in a decade, we could have a prime minister who is his own man,"" says Takao Toshikawa of Tokyo InsideLine, a newsletter. The end result may fall short of the revolution Mr Kato used to like talking about. But at least on this occasion he may be able to carry the rest of Japan with him. ","IT SAYS much about present government activity in tapan that its most accomplished reformer has become a symbol of frustrated political ambition . Not since the upper - house elections in 1998 has Koichi Kato held office in the Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) , which has dominated Japanese politics almost since its birth in 1955 . Mr Kato 's resignation in the summer of 1998 as the party 's secretary - general , along with the prime minister of the time , Ryutaro Hashimoto , brought to a limp end a historic programme of reforms which , on paper at least , promised revolution . 
 So far , Mr Kato has been denied a second chance , as he and his supporters in the LDP 'S "" anti - mainstream "" have gently drifted ever farther from the currents of party power . But opportunity has begun to beckon again . The economy is on the mend , and the free - spending policies that replaced reform as recession struck look increasingly to have run their course . According to recent opinion polls , only one voter in 20 now supports the government 's economic policies . Sooner or later Yoshiro Mori's , will step down as prime minister . Mr Kato 's supporters make no bones of the fact that they want their man to succeed him . 
 The Hashimoto reforms that Mr Kato championed so eloquently now look over-- ambitious . The six reforms - of the bureaucracy , the public finances , the economy , banking , social security and education - pitted the LDP 's leaders against the entrenched interests of their own party . Mr Kato wanted nothing less than to turn Japan upside down . Bureaucratic reform would break the state 's power over the economy . Economic deregulation would strengthen market forces . A new politics would return power to the politicians . Economic and political reform were two sides of the same coin , thought Mr Kato : Japan had to put more trust in its own people to run things , and less in its governing elite . But the intricate institutional arrangements that bind businessmen , politicians and bureaucrats together in Japan 's well - organised polity made such a reform programme hard work . 
 Mr Kato now says that the Japanese people themselves were not ready for "" radical spiritual change "" . State - led growth may have stifled economic choice . But it also offered the comfort of government protection . The result of reform was confusion and alarm at the sudden responsibilities of the marketplace , and a yearning to turn the clock back . Yoshiro Mori appeals to this mood , with Yoshiro Mori's nostalgia for pre - war society . 
 One thing Mr Kato has now learned is to dress his liberalism in conservative colours . Reform has become a dirty word in Japan , bringing to mind the pain of financial crisis , job losses and bankruptcies . In theory , he could took outside the LDP to push his agenda , taking the party 's proreformers with him . But other politicians have trodden this path and failed . Radical reform from within the Lnr will fail too , Mr Kato says , and for the same reason : it runs against the thinking of the local community leaders who form the bedrock of LDP support .

REVOLUTIONARY banners do not yet hang from the parliament buildings in Tokyo. But Japanese politics is nonetheless being shaken by a thousand small acts of rebellion.On October 15th, voters in Nagano, a sleepy rural backwater, chose as their new governor a playboy novelist, Yasuo Tanaka, a man with no party connections. In a Tokyo by-election a week later, government and opposition candidates alike were rejected in favour of Etsuko Kawada, an independent candidate who shot to fame campaigning against a government cover-up of the sale of HIV-contaminated blood products in the mid-1990s. All over Japan lately, voters have been turning their back on mainstream politicians and voting instead for comedians, sportsmen, entertainers and other oddball characters. Not surprisingly, the Japanese have begun to wonder where this is leading. 
One common thread is a deep disillusionment with the whole political system. The economy still falters. Business leaders and bureaucrats seem only to want to pass the buck. Society wanders aimlessly this way and that. The Japanese crave a strong leader. Instead, they have Yoshiro Mori, a puppet prime minister who fluffs his lines even when he has them written for him. 
Mr Mori's latest gaffe may be his most inept yet. As the rest of the world attempts a delicate diplomatic re-engagement with North Korea, Mr Mori has managed to set Japan's laggardly diplomacy back still further. One of the main sticking points between the two countries has been the alleged abduction in the 1970s and early 1980s of ten Japanese nationals by North Korean agents. North Korea, however, insists they are ""missing persons"". In a meeting with the British prime minister, Tony Blair, last week, Mr Mori let slip that Japan had suggested in 1997 that these ""missing Japanese persons"" be ""found"" somewhere outside North Korea. This has enraged Japan's hawks, who demand that North Korea own up and apologise, upset the foreign ministry, and led to calls for Mr Mori's resignation, even from within his own party. 
Matters of importance await the government's attention: economic rejuvenation, for instance, and repairing the government's awful finances. But all Mr Mori's recent ef forts seem to have been spent on rigging the electoral system so that his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which dominates the coalition government, does not lose quite so heavily in next year's upper-house elections. The rot of money politics, meanwhile, spreads right through the party. 
Nor, though, do the opposition parties offer an alternative. A bewildering series of coalition governments since the LDP lost its iron grip on Japanese politics in 1993 has left the impression that the first priority of all parties is power, not policies. Further blurring party lines, the biggest opposition group, the Democratic Party, contains former LDP politicians. Corruption scandals taint everyone. Tokyo had its by-election because a Democratic Party politician was caught embezzling the publicly-funded salary of a non-existent secretary. It was already known that floating voters were the biggest force in Japanese politics. Now, they may be the majority. Opinion polls before the Nagano election suggested 62% of the electorate was uncommitted to any party. 
No one knows where these currents will run or whom they will propel to power. Foreigners fret about the rise of nationalist strongmen such as Shintaro Ishihara, the governor of Tokyo. The Japanese worry more that these new political forces lack direction. The new politicians have no common message or platform. They only want, as Ms Kawada said after her win this week, to create ""a new kind of politics"". 
But perhaps the Japanese are looking in the wrong place to make sense of it all. Rapid economic growth put politics to sleep in Japan. In its place came unthinking obedience to authority. In a more bracing economic climate, the Japanese have begun to wake up. ","Japan

NOBODY expects much from the ageing leaders of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which rules Japan at the head of a rag-tag coalition government. But even by the LDP'S rock-bottom standards, the three-month-old cabinet of Yoshiro Mori, Japan's bumbling prime minister, is turning into a bit of a shocker. Bits of Mr Mori's own party are in open revolt. The newspapers loathe him. His only friend in the cabinet, Hidenao Nakagawa, has just been felled by sex and money scandals. Not since the late 198os, in the twilight of the LDP'S long monopoly on power, has a Japanese prime minister been so unpopular with the public. Yet on the poor man staggers, a public punch-bag kept dangling in place by the cynical calculations of those who really run the party. So bad are the LDP'S prospects that nobody wants his job just yet. 
What makes this more than just a sorry farce in an inscrutable bit of Asia is Japan's large, sickly and potentially dangerous economy. Thankfully, growth has at last begun to return here and there. However the economy is by no means out of danger yet (see pages 75-77). The recovery is still vulnerable-to more problems with Japan's alarmingly weak banks, to deflation, to a public-sector debt crisis, to a nasty jolt from abroad, or simply to a sudden loss of confidence amid the confusion and pain of wrenching change. But from Mr Mori comes nothing but dither and neglect. Important economic reforms are delayed or shelved. The government's awful finances go untended. What little Japan has achieved is being put at risk. This year alone, no less than four different ministers have been put in charge of the financial clean-up. Mr Mori's latest choice, Hideyuki Aizawa, is 81 years old. 
The deeper crisis in Japan, however, lies with the legitimacy of the government itself. Simply put, the LDP and its coalition partners do not represent the wishes of the majority: they do not even come close. Rural voters, who because of Japan's skewed electoral system have three times the votingpower of town-dwellers, are pampered with tax breaks and trade protection. The majority who live in the cities pay through the nose. The elderly have their jobs and pensions preserved at the expense of the young. Producers have the ear of government. Consumers are neglected. The cost of the handouts needed to keep a lid on all the bubbling discontent threatens to overwhelm the state. Like the Kansai International Airport, an egregious waste of public money perched on a man-made island in the bay of Osaka, Japan's ""construction state"" is sinking slowly into the mud. 
How, then, to get at the problem? In good times, rule by consensus has helped to knit the Japanese together. But in bad times it protects the powerful from the consequences of their actions. Nobody has responsibility, so nobody feels the need to take it. Bank presidents go unpunished for poor lending. Company bosses run their firms into the ground, then retire to some comfy sinecure. It is no good attacking Mr Mori for all this. The real power in the LDP lies elsewhere, diffused and concealed. 
And its voters deserve better 
Nor do the opposition parties offer a clear alternative. The Democratic Party, the largest of the lot, is stuffed with former LDP men. Now that the LDP no longer commands a majority on its own, it has had to rule in ever-shifting coalition governments, taking in at one time or another almost everyone but the Communists. Further muddying the choice at the ballot box, Japan's best hope for a new style of politics may actually lie within the LDP itself-with reformist party barons such as Koichi Kato, for instance, or with some of his younger supporters, such as Yasuhisa Shiozaki. But until that happens, and with no clear choice before them, voters are turning away from mainstream political parties, picking independent candidates or simply staying at home. 
The LDP does all it can to cling to power, fiddling the electoral system and trying to keep the country's eyes off the bad news. In the end, though, not even its leaders can ignore the uncomfortable fact that Japan is a democracy. So, without a proper sense of its own legitimacy, the LDP retreats instead to a sort of craven politics that tries desperately not to offend anyone. That is why Japan finds the deregulation its economy badly needs so difficult-why, in fact, the politicians have such a difficult job changing anything. 
Something has to give. The worry outside Japan is that a nationalist strongman, such as Shintaro Ishihara, Tokyo's canny governor, will harness the massive floating vote and use it to propel himself into power. Fortunately though, in the absence of, say, a Chinese threat, Japan seems to be embracing foreigners and foreign things with as much enthusiasm as ever, and is unlikely to want to turn its back on the world. 
More likely, some new political order will form out of the 
present set-up. The neatest solution would be to redraw party lines, the better to reflect ideological differences and so to give voters a clearer choice. But that requires bold action, and nobody is willing to take the risk. Voters' choices seem erratic, and politicians who have left the LDP for new pastures have not done well. In the end, the LDP will probably have to engineer its own revival. It has already had one shot at championing deregulation and consumer-oriented politics. Financial crisis and recession brought that to a premature end. But the logic that drove the party to this experiment presses more keenly today than ever. ","Its politics are in crisis .

2000-11-04,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224063431/fulltext/247FF87C6B74EF3PQ/59?accountid=14657,"Japan's economic recovery appears still to be on track. But the risks of a derailment are rising 
IT ALL seemed to be going so well. The alarms of the 1997 banking crisis had faded. Government spending had lifted the economy out of recession. Growth had at last begun to spread to the private sector. Yet the past few months have not been happy for Japan's convalescent economy. Far from accelerating towards the heady growth that had come to seem normal in the decades up to 1990, the recovery has started to look anaemic at best and endangered at worst. Less than three months after raising interest rates for the first time in ten years, even central-bank officials have begun to mutter about an outside risk of another recession. 
At first blush, the prospect ought to be brighter than that. Japan's recent recession ended with two quarters of bracing growth. The Economist's consensus poll of economic forecasters puts growth at 1.9% this year and 2.1% next. The Bank of Japan has just released forecasts of its own, suggesting growth of h2.3% this year. Such predictions are much stronger than most economists were making a year ago. 
Some structural changes have also been taking place. The country's banks are at last trying to merge their way out of trouble. Its big companies have begun to enjoy the fruits of restructuring, and a high-tech manufacturing base promises new growth industries in IT, multimedia and the Internet. Some brave souls have even been leaving the shelter of traditional big employers for their own start-ups. Until mid-April, the stockmarket was duly roaring its approval, up by nearly 60% in 18 months (see chart 2 on next page). 
It is not roaring any more. This week the Nikkei 225 briefly fell below 14,500, to its lowest level since early 1999. Investors in Japan are, of course, worried about the same things as investors everywhere else: the risk of war in the Middle East, high oil prices, a tech-- stock crash that might foreshadow a hard landing in America. But the broader point is that the economic euphoria of a few months ago has evaporated, as the long slog that is needed to bolster the fragile Japanese economy has become painfully clearer. 
Thus, restructuring continues, but at a crawl. Tokyo's boardrooms are full of talk about job cuts, buy-outs, spin-offs and mergers; but, barring a handful of important exceptions such as Sony and Honda, Japanese companies still lack the leadership needed to force through change. Some big companies are belatedly collapsing under their debts, cheering Japan's reformers with thoughts of a new economic order; but they also point to more pain ahead. There is still hope for the new high-tech industries; but a bubble in the stockmarket had magnified their economic importance many times. Since the high-tech crash began in February, their share prices have slid lower and lower. 
Most of all, perhaps, Japan's malaise reflects the drift in Nagatacho, Tokyo's political district. The economy remains in delicate health. But the cabinet of Yoshiro Mori, Japan's prime minister, continues to beat a retreat from many economic reforms. Mr Mori seems to spend more time throwing parties in his rural constituency than applying his mind to pressing affairs of state. The leadership of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP which dominates the coalition government, is weakening almost by the day: most recently, Mr Mori has lost one of his few friends in the government, the chief cabinet secretary, Hidenao Nakagawa. So dim are the party's immediate prospects that nobody even wants to take Mr Mori's place. Everybody but the LDP, it seems, can see the awful train wreck that lies ahead for the government's dreadful finances. But there is no word about how to clean things up. 
Political drift, lopsided growth 
This drift is a worry because the growth looks so lopsided. Some bits of the economy are surging ahead. Demand for computers, mobile phones and other high-tech kit is racing along. Encouragingly, it is domestic demand that is driving most of this. Domestic computer shipments, for instance, are growing at 38% a year, boosted mostly by sales to households. Subscriptions to mobile phones continue to rise, propelled by the popularity of handsets that offer access to the Internet. As Japanese consumers flock to the web, demand is surging for the nuts and bolts from which the Internet is built. 
Because Japan manufactures so much of this high-tech hardware, from silicon wafers to semiconductors, and from integrated circuit-boards to the finished goods themselves, this narrow burst of demand is lifting a big chunk of manufacturing industry. Eyecatching big electronics companies such as NEc are forecasting bumper profits. So, too, are companies in more obscure corners of Japan's high-tech industry, such as Hoya, which makes glass disks for computer hard drives and other precision-engineered components. Mitsubishi Electric plans huge new investment in the production of flash memory chips for mobile phones. Towa, which makes chip-making machines, expects profits to rise more than eightfold this year. 
Demand for IT goods has begun to spread to the entire corporate sector. Most big Japanese companies still have IT systems built around mainframes. But with profits soaring, they have begun to invest heavily in Internet-based technology, hoping to retool themselves for e-commerce-even if few are yet ready to follow the American example of redesigning their whole corporate structures around the Internet. Most are outsourcing their IT to other companies, which are pouring billions of dollars into massive computer-server ""farms"": sophisticated office blocks that house 5,000 or more top-end computer servers apiece. As usual in Japan, says Ben Wedmore of HSBC, a British bank, everybody has jumped at the same time. 
This business investment cycle has some way yet to run. The Japanese sales of America's Cisco Systems, which makes the routers that direct Internet traffic, are growing at 7o0% a year, and the growth rate has risen tenfold in nine months. Until recently, Microsoft's sales in Japan were miserable: software was tailormade by big mainframe makers such as NEc and Fujitsu. But Microsoft's future now looks brighter. Domestic shipments of the operating systems that companies now favour, notably Windows NT, are forecast to rise by 20% a year until 2004. All this points to a new pattern of IT investment by Japanese companies, which is driving growth in demand for a whole range Of IT goods and services at 30-50% a year, according to Mr Wedmore. 
old-economy worries 
Outside the high-tech sector, corporate Japan looks much less cheerful. The big car companies are doing well, buoyed by strong demand in America. But heavy industries such as chemicals and steel are still plagued with overcapacity, despite belated attempts at mergers. The efforts of the big trading houses to reinvent themselves as nimble new-economy firms lack conviction. Construction companies, property developers and big retailers still labour under the massive debts that they ran up more than ten years ago, during Japan's bubble period. 
Most important, consumer demand-- three-fifths of the economy-is still soft, and looks likely to stay that way for quite a while to come. Household spending has steadied somewhat; there is even the odd sign that spending in some areas might rise a little. The jobs market is certainly improving in places. For the first time in three years, according to a survey by the Nikkei newspaper, Japan's leading business daily, big companies plan to hire more graduates when the new year starts next April. The Bank of Japan says that employment is ""moderately improving"". Part-time jobs are being created at a faster rate than ever. All this good news may at last be cheering up Japan's irrepressibly gloomy households. The Economic Planning Agency's index of consumer sentiment has risen for five straight months in a row. 
Several things may yet dampen spirits. Big companies are not shedding many jobs, but they are stealthily cutting pay packets, mostly under the guise of new pay-for-performance schemes, say consultants. Despite rising demand for workers, unemployment could stay stubbornly close to record levels. The number of job seekers in Japan has barely fallen, suggesting a growing mismatch between supply and demand in the jobs market as some industries boom even as others continue to struggle. 
Those Japanese who have stopped spending because they worry about their pensions, the future cost of health care or the government's sorry finances still have lots to fret over. Reforms to state pensions have set the system on a more stable footing. Companies have begun to write off holes in their pension schemes against profits. But some problems, especially at smaller companies (which employ four-fifths of the workforce), are still not being recognised. And looming over all this are worries about the government's finances. Gross public debts already top 110% of GDP. With the budget still deep in the red, this debt mountain will keep growing for a few years yet. The Japanese know that, some time soon, these debts must be brought under control through spending cuts, tax increases, or both. 
Deflation also lingers, curbing the desire to buy things today that may cost less tomorrow. Land prices continue their long, destructive slide. Office rents follow them. Consumer prices are falling at around 0.55% a year, and there are even signs that the rate of price deflation may be increasing, not slackening. High-profile bankruptcies still shock the Japanese-most recently of two big life insurers, Chiyoda, which collapsed with Va.9 trillion ($27 billion) of debts, and Kyoei, which went under with liabilities of X4.5 trillion ($41 billion). 
The gloom of the past few weeks has, indeed, become so pronounced that it has raised fresh doubts about the wisdom of the Bank of Japan's decision in August to raise interest rates from zero to 0.25%. This week, it published an inflation forecast showing prices continuing to fall. The interest-rate rise in August looks still more dubious, given three other big worries lying ahead. 
Bank blues 
The first is that the banks might tip Japan back into financial crisis. Loans are souring, as bankruptcies and the bad debts they leave behind keep mounting. Both are expected to set records this year. Requests for debt waivers are also rising, especially in the problem-- ridden construction sector. More are likely to follow, in the property, trading, chemicals, oil and retail industries. 
Falling asset prices are also weakening bank balance sheets. Urban land prices have fallen by as much as 80% since their peak in the early 199os, and they are expected to fall further. Because they rarely make provisions for loans backed by property, the banks have found plunging land prices especially painful. Meanwhile, the stockmarket's recent tumble is again wringing unrealised gains out of the banks' massive share portfolios, which they can count as equity capital. Some analysts reckon that, if the stockmarket falls by another 59c, most banks will see these gains turn into losses instead. 
None of this would be quite so alarming were the banks repairing their core businesses. They are not. So far, there is little evidence that they are restructuring in earnest. Banks the world over tend to make most of their money on deposit spreads, or the difference between what the market charges to lend to them and the less rewarding interest rates that banks pay their depositors. Because short-term interest rates are so close to zero, the only way that Japan's banks can reestablish this deposit margin is to charge for the privilege of depositing money in their vaults: good business sense maybe, but, given current hostility towards the banks, not good politics. So the banks keep weakening. Moody's, an American rating agency, gives the average big Japanese bank a financial-strength rating of E+ (on a scale Of A to E), suggesting ""very weak intrinsic financial strength, requiring periodic outside support"". This puts the health of Japan's banking system only a notch above Croatia's. 
None of this need mean a second banking crisis, and hence a nasty shock to the economy. For that to happen, the government would have to withdraw its support for the industry. So far the government has nationalised two big banks, recapitalised the rest and guaranteed all deposits until 2002 (a deadline that the central bank says can be extended if necessary). These steps have persuaded investors that the government is prepared to support the big banks at all costs. ""The systemic support of Japan's banking system is stronger than ever,"" says Thomas Keller of Moody's. So banks' credit ratings have improved recently, even as their underlying financial strength has weakened. 
A second big worry is oil prices. The problem is not so much their direct impact. Dearer imports will hurt, but less than in the 1970s when oil use was much higher relative to GDP. But the bigger worry is the effect that high oil prices might have on the health of Japan's trading partners. Export growth has played a key role in hauling the economy out of recession. As a share of GDP, for instance, exports of goods and services will probably hit a record in the third quarter of 2000. 
A lot of this growth has come from demand for computers, mobile phones, telecoms equipment and other high-tech goods, especially among Japan's Asian neighbours. in the year to August, calculates Nikko Salomon Smith Barney, an investment bank, Japan shipped 50% of its electrical-machinery exports, 60% of its IT-related exports and 68% of its electronic-components exports to the rest of Asia. In each category, year-on-year order growth was 15%. Yet high oil prices could knock growth off course in these more oil-dependent countries. 
A bigger worry still is America, where high oil prices threaten to combine with a nervous stockmarket, weakening demand and rising inflation to end the long economic boom. Japan's car industry, which ships nearly 40% of its exports to America, looks vulnerable. Exports are sustaining profits at healthy companies like Toyota and Honda. They are also playing an indispensable role in helping to turn around the finances of deeply troubled manufacturers such as Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors. In the half-year to September, Nissan's exports rose by 6.7%; Mitsubishi Motors' by 15.2%. 
The debt burden 
These threats loom larger when set against the backdrop of Japan's awful public finances (see chart 3), which could suck the government into a vicious debt trap of everhigher interest payments on its spiralling debts. Nobody knows exactly when this moment might come. That depends largely on the bond market which, so far at least, refuses to entertain thoughts of panic: ten-year bond yields are stuck at a miserly 1.8%. If growth falters for long, however, the arithmetic would challenge even the most optimistic assumptions about the future. Modest growth may not be enough to pull Japan back from the brink. Bank of Japan officials suggest the job requires growth of ""something more than ado"" a year for several years. Yet the Bank's deputy governor, Yutaka Yamaguchi, admitted this week that the economy's potential growth rate may be less than 2%. Japan desperately needs to raise its game. 
The prescriptions are wearily familiar by now. Japan has been wrestling with the challenges of deregulating the moribund bits of its economy ever since the mid-198os when the then prime minister, Yasuhiro Nakasone, launched a programme of supplyside reforms. But, encouragingly, there has been some progress recently. For example, barriers to competition in telecoms, electricity, finance and retailing are slowly coming down. Among listed companies, accounting and disclosure rules are being brought into line with international standards. This should make managers pay closer attention to how they use labour and capital. For the first time in a century, Japan is rewriting its commercial code, with a view to encouraging restructuring and the financial engineering that is now used in every financial market except Tokyo. As these reforms prise open old industrial structures, growth is springing up among discount retailers, innovative consumer-finance firms and independent telecoms companies. Yet the government could be doing a lot more to promote growth. A modest agenda, for instance, might include one or more items from the following list: in financial services, privatise the vast post office savings bank and the Housing Loan Corporation, which dominates the mortgage market; in telecoms, break up Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which shuts other carriers out of the market, and set up an independent regulator; set up independent regulators for the electricity and gas sectors, and accelerate deregulation; change the rules so that foreigners can offer legal services; reform land and inheritance tax so that owners have an incentive to sell property; strengthen competition policy and set the trust-busters loose on the big keiretsu, the corporate groups that still choke competition; and introduce some semblance of a market economy to the agricultural and construction industries. 
Despite the recession, the financial crisis and the government's rising debt burden, the Japanese still reckon they have time to do all these things; time to calibrate differences of opinion, to arrive at a consensus and to slow down change to ease the pain for those who lose from reform. The market will be the ultimate judge of that. As one central-bank official puts it, however: ""It is very hard to get the politicians to take reform seriously when bond yields are less than 2% "" That may change sooner than many now expect. ","Japan 's economic recovery appears still to be on track . But the risks of a derailment are rising 
 IT ALL seemed to be going so well . The alarms of the 1997 banking crisis had faded . Government spending had lifted the economy out of recession . Growth had at last begun to spread to the private sector . Yet the past few months have not been happy for Japan 's convalescent economy . Far from accelerating towards the heady growth that had come to seem normal in the decades up to 1990 , the recovery has started to look anaemic at best and endangered at worst . Less than three months after raising interest rates for the first time in ten years , even central - bank officials have begun to mutter about an outside risk of another recession . 
 At first blush , the prospect ought to be brighter than that . Japan 's recent recession ended with two quarters of bracing growth . The Economist 's consensus poll of economic forecasters puts growth at 1.9 % this year and 2.1 % next . The Bank of Japan has just released forecasts of its own , suggesting growth of h2.3 % this year . Such predictions are much stronger than most economists were making a year ago . 
 Some structural changes have also been taking place . The country 's banks are at last trying to merge their way out of trouble . Its big companies have begun to enjoy the fruits of restructuring , and a high - tech manufacturing base promises new growth industries in IT , multimedia and the Internet . Some brave souls have even been leaving the shelter of traditional big employers for their own start - ups . Until mid - April , the stockmarket was duly roaring its approval , up by nearly 60 % in 18 months ( see chart 2 on next page ) . 
 It is not roaring any more . This week the Nikkei 225 briefly fell below 14,500 , to its lowest level since early 1999 . Investors in Japan are , of course , worried about the same things as investors everywhere else : the risk of war in the Middle East , high oil prices , a tech-- stock crash that might foreshadow a hard landing in America . But the broader point is that the economic euphoria of a few months ago has evaporated , as the long slog that is needed to bolster the fragile Japanese economy has become painfully clearer . 
 Thus , restructuring continues , but at a crawl . Tokyo 's boardrooms are full of talk about job cuts , buy - outs , spin - offs and mergers ; but , barring a handful of important exceptions such as Sony and Honda , Japanese companies still lack the leadership needed to force through change . Some big companies are belatedly collapsing under their debts , cheering Japan 's reformers with thoughts of a new economic order ; but they also point to more pain ahead . There is still hope for the new high - tech industries ; but a bubble in the stockmarket had magnified their economic importance many times . Since the high - tech crash began in February , their share prices have slid lower and lower . 
 Most of all , perhaps , Japan 's malaise reflects the drift in Nagatacho , Tokyo 's political district . The economy remains in delicate health . But the cabinet of Yoshiro Mori's continues to beat a retreat from many economic reforms . Yoshiro Mori seems to spend more time throwing parties in Yoshiro Mori's rural constituency than applying Yoshiro Mori's mind to pressing affairs of state . The leadership of the Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP which dominates the coalition government , is weakening almost by the day : most recently , Yoshiro Mori has lost one of Yoshiro Mori's few friends in the government , the chief cabinet secretary , Hidenao Nakagawa . So dim are the party 's immediate prospects that nobody even wants to take Yoshiro Mori's place . Everybody but the LDP , it seems , can see the awful train wreck that lies ahead for the government 's dreadful finances . But there is no word about how to clean things up . 
 Political drift , lopsided growth 
 This drift is a worry because the growth looks so lopsided . Some bits of the economy are surging ahead . Demand for computers , mobile phones and other high - tech kit is racing along . Encouragingly , it is domestic demand that is driving most of this . Domestic computer shipments , for instance , are growing at 38 % a year , boosted mostly by sales to households . Subscriptions to mobile phones continue to rise , propelled by the popularity of handsets that offer access to the Internet . As Japanese consumers flock to the web , demand is surging for the nuts and bolts from which the Internet is built . 
 Because Japan manufactures so much of this high - tech hardware , from silicon wafers to semiconductors , and from integrated circuit - boards to the finished goods themselves , this narrow burst of demand is lifting a big chunk of manufacturing industry . Eyecatching big electronics companies such as NEc are forecasting bumper profits . So , too , are companies in more obscure corners of Japan 's high - tech industry , such as Hoya , which makes glass disks for computer hard drives and other precision - engineered components . Mitsubishi Electric plans huge new investment in the production of flash memory chips for mobile phones . Towa , which makes chip - making machines , expects profits to rise more than eightfold this year . 
 Demand for IT goods has begun to spread to the entire corporate sector . Most big Japanese companies still have IT systems built around mainframes . But with profits soaring , they have begun to invest heavily in Internet - based technology , hoping to retool themselves for e - commerce - even if few are yet ready to follow the American example of redesigning their whole corporate structures around the Internet . Most are outsourcing their IT to other companies , which are pouring billions of dollars into massive computer - server "" farms "" : sophisticated office blocks that house 5,000 or more top - end computer servers apiece . As usual in Japan , says Ben Wedmore of HSBC , a British bank , everybody has jumped at the same time . 
 This business investment cycle has some way yet to run . The Japanese sales of America 's Cisco Systems , which makes the routers that direct Internet traffic , are growing at 7o0 % a year , and the growth rate has risen tenfold in nine months . Until recently , Microsoft 's sales in Japan were miserable : software was tailormade by big mainframe makers such as NEc and Fujitsu . But Microsoft 's future now looks brighter . Domestic shipments of the operating systems that companies now favour , notably Windows NT , are forecast to rise by 20 % a year until 2004 . All this points to a new pattern of IT investment by Japanese companies , which is driving growth in demand for a whole range Of IT goods and services at 30 - 50 % a year , according to Mr Wedmore . 
 old - economy worries 
 Outside the high - tech sector , corporate Japan looks much less cheerful . The big car companies are doing well , buoyed by strong demand in America . But heavy industries such as chemicals and steel are still plagued with overcapacity , despite belated attempts at mergers . The efforts of the big trading houses to reinvent themselves as nimble new - economy firms lack conviction . Construction companies , property developers and big retailers still labour under the massive debts that they ran up more than ten years ago , during Japan 's bubble period . 
 Most important , consumer demand-- three - fifths of the economy - is still soft , and looks likely to stay that way for quite a while to come . Household spending has steadied somewhat ; there is even the odd sign that spending in some areas might rise a little . The jobs market is certainly improving in places . For the first time in three years , according to a survey by the Nikkei newspaper , Japan 's leading business daily , big companies plan to hire more graduates when the new year starts next April . The Bank of Japan says that employment is "" moderately improving "" . Part - time jobs are being created at a faster rate than ever .

Two of Russia's richest magnates, Boris Berezovsky and Vladimir Gusinsky, said they would not return home soon to face (separate) charges of financial impropriety. 
At least 150 people, mostly Austrians and Germans, were killed in a fire in a funicular train carrying skiers through a tunnel above the Austrian resort of Kaprun, near Salzburg. 
Reinhard Klimmt, Germany's Social Democrat transport minister, resigned after he had been fined over a football-club scandal in Saarland, where he had previously been premier. 
Egyptian ways 
At the end of Egypt's election, the ruling National Democratic Party won 388 of the 454 seats in parliament-rather fewer than usual. Despite intimidation, the Muslim Brotherhood, though technically banned, won 17 seats. Twelve people were killed during the campaign. 
The conflict in the West Bank and Gaza escalated, with ever more bloodshed. After four Israelis were shot dead, Israel put several Palestinian cities under blockade. Another deadline for declaring independence was missed on November isth. Instead Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement called on Palestinians to ""realise sovereignty"" by liberating occupied territory. 
Islamic countries, meeting in Qatar, gently invited members to cut relations with Israel and pledged financial aid for the Palestinian struggle. Iraq's rehabilitation in the Arab world hastened. A senior Iraqi also had talks with Kofi Annan, the UN'S secretary-general. 
Leah Rabin, the widow of Yitzhak Rabin, died of cancer. After her husband's murder, she had become a champion for Israelis who believed the Oslo accords represented the foundation of a negotiated peace. 
As fresh British marines arrived to defend Freetown, Sierra Leone's capital, against rebel attack, the government and rebels signed a 30-day truce at a meeting in Nigeria. 
A big UN conference on global warming got under way in the Netherlands.

SO MUCH for Koichi Kato's long game. All autumn, Mr Kato and his reform-minded followers in Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) have prepared patiently for the right moment to make a push for power, reckoning on next summer at the earliest. By accident or design, however, they find themselves pitched into a real contest much sooner. Already Yoshiro Mori, Japan's unpopular prime minister, looks finished. Mr Kato will now want to press home his advantage. ""The voice of the people will prevail in the end,"" he told reporters this week. 
Unusually for Japan, Mr Kato may be right. An old ally, Taku Yamasaki, has been quick to pledge his support. With the opposition parties preparing to back a no-confidence vote in parliament as soon as November zand, Mr Kato now has to persuade his supporters to vote against their own prime minister, inviting their possible expulsion from the LDP. Party hacks have already been working on the rebels. But, to general surprise, Mr Kato's supporters are holding fast, at least for the moment. Faced with more determined opposition than the party expected, Mr Mori's support is crumbling. If two-thirds of Mr Kato's and Mr Yamasaki's combined factions join the opposition to vote against Mr Mori, he will lose. If the LDP rebels merely abstain, he can survive. 
Everyone now waits to see how Mr Kato plays his hand. His liberal economic thinking puts him closer to the reformist half of the Democrats, the biggest opposition party, than to the LDP's conservative mainstream. This invites thoughts of an LDP split, a broad political realignment and a new coalition government, with Mr Kato at the helm. Some of the younger members of Mr Kato's faction have been working to build loose ties with the Democrats recently, even suggesting that they co-operate on policy. On November 15th, Mr Kato himself met opposition leaders, claiming, improbably, that they talked only about the economy. Despite these manoeuvrings, Mr Kato still says he does not want to leave the LDP. 
For now, Mr Kato should probably be taken at his word. After flirting briefly with reform in the mid-1990s, the LDP's recent lurch back towards special-interest politics has convinced some of Mr Kato's more hotheaded supporters that the party is beyond rescue. But, for all its shortcomings, the LDP and the organised vote at its heart still offers a stable, albeit shrinking, political base and ready access to campaign funds. 
More likely, Mr Kato will be hoping to press his case with the LDP's elderly executive. The party will not want an open fight. That would risk a general election in which, thanks to Mr Mori's bungling leadership, the LDP could expect a hiding. Nor, though, will the party barons meekly defer to Mr Kato's claim to the top job, with all the loss of face that this would entail. Instead, they may offer to bring the LDP'S leadership election forward to next month. Even then, Mr Kato may not be assured of victory. Mainstream factions are considering a third candidate. 
One possible replacement is Yohei Kono, Japan's foreign minister. If Mr Kono's old rivalry with Mr Kato scuppers this choice, the LDP may instead pick junichiro Koizumi, whose mischievous indiscretions are said to have drawn Mr Kato into his present fight. A third candidate is Masahiko Komura, a former foreign minister. But Mr Kato seems in no mood to compromise. Party barons must now decide whether they ought to offer him more, or to call his bluff.

EVEN as Japanese political squibs go, it was a pretty damp one. Koichi Kato, the leading light on the reformist wing of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), had briefly threatened fireworks by planning, with his allies, to vote against the country's hapless prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, in a no-confidence motion. Since the LDP, even with its coalition partners, holds only a slender majority in the Diet (parliament), that would have forced Mr Mori either to resign or to call a fresh election. Instead, on November 20th Mr Kato backed off, demonstrating how weak the reformists still are, and how tenacious the LDP'S gerontocrats can be (see page 99). After a weekend of arm-twisting by party bosses, who control the party's election coffers, half of Mr Kato's faction deserted him. Tearfully staging what he called an ""honourable retreat"", Mr Kato then abstained from the vote. The Tokyo stock exchange greeted the survival of Mr Mori, best known for a series of verbal gaffes that have sent the cabinet's approval rating in opinion polls crashing below the 20% mark, by sliding still further. 
Deeply unpopular, and with an uncanny knack for getting himself into trouble, Mr Mori is unlikely to survive for long. Mr Kato's failed rebellion may have prolonged his reign a bit. But the greater damage has been to the cause of reform. When Mr Mori is eventually dumped, whether that is soon or after he takes the rap for what is sure to be a dismal LDP showing in elections to the Diet's Upper House next July, Mr Kato is now most unlikely to succeed him. Party elders will not want to reward so unprecedented a display of insubordination. There are other reformers, such as Junichiro Koizumi, who bravely (but unsuccessfully) proposed privatising Japan's post office, but they lack Mr Kato's abilities and stature. 
Blocked within his own party, Mr Kato has sometimes hinted that he might leave the LDP altogether, and throw in his lot with the main opposition party, the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ). A strengthened DPJ would at least be able to present Japan's voters with a choice of governments at the next election. The great weakness of the Japanese political system has been the absence of any real competition for votes: the LDP has held power continuously since its foundation in 1955, with just one ten-month break in 1993-94. 
But Mr Kato may have difficulty taking many of his supporters with him. Besides, the opposition parties still lack credibility. They are widely seen as being stuffed with LDP deserters, and lacking new ideas. Half of Japan's voters say they do not support any particular party, and at a prefectural election this month, a candidate backed by both the LDP and the DPJ was rejected in favour of an independent. More likely, Mr Kato will stay with the LDP and fight from within. 
The follies of a one-party state 
There is still much to fight for. Japan's reformists point out that, ever since its economy first went into decline in 1991, the LDP has been tackling the problem the wrong way: by throwing money at it. This has more than doubled Japan's government debt, which now stands at over $5 trillion, or some 110%. of GDP, the highest among industrialised countries. Yet this has failed to revive the economy, which despite temporary rallies shows no sign of returning to even European, let alone American, levels of growth. Meanwhile, such profligate government spending tends to crowd out more efficient private money, and to make consumers cautious. One credit-- ratings agency has already downgraded Japan's debt to Aa2, a worrying trend in the world's second-largest economy. 
What Japan ought to be doing is precisely what the LDP finds hardest: deregulating the economy, which is now badly handicapped by government red tape, such as the high telecoms charges that are allowing other Asian countries to overtake Japan in e-commerce. But that means tackling Japan's special-interest groups: the construction industry, the retailers, the post office, the farmers, NTT, the banks. As so often happens in one-party states, these have all developed unhealthily close links with the ruling party, which is correspondingly reluctant to take them on. 
What Mr Kato has realised, but the LDP leadership still refuses to see, is that this kind of support is no longer enough. Thanks partly to electoral reform, and partly to the growth of the DPJ, it is much harder for the LDP to win elections than it used to be. The party needs to reach out beyond its traditional support-base to the ordinary voter. But as long as it is led by politicians like Mr Mori, there is not much chance of that. ","Koichi Kato 's failure to seize the prime minister 's job is bad news for the country 
 EVEN as Japanese political squibs go , it was a pretty damp one . Koichi Kato , the leading light on the reformist wing of Japan 's ruling Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) , had briefly threatened fireworks by planning , with his allies , to vote against Yoshiro Mori's , in a no - confidence motion . Since the LDP , even with its coalition partners , holds only a slender majority in the Diet ( parliament ) , that would have forced Yoshiro Mori either to resign or to call a fresh election . Instead , on November 20th Mr Kato backed off , demonstrating how weak the reformists still are , and how tenacious the LDP 'S gerontocrats can be ( see page 99 ) . After a weekend of arm - twisting by party bosses , who control the party 's election coffers , half of Mr Kato 's faction deserted him . Tearfully staging what he called an "" honourable retreat "" , Mr Kato then abstained from the vote . The Tokyo stock exchange greeted the survival of Yoshiro Mori's , by sliding still further . 
 Deeply unpopular , and with an uncanny knack for getting Yoshiro Mori into trouble , Yoshiro Mori is unlikely to survive for long . Mr Kato 's failed rebellion may have prolonged Yoshiro Mori's reign a bit . But the greater damage has been to the cause of reform . When Yoshiro Mori is eventually dumped , whether that is soon or after Yoshiro Mori takes the rap for what is sure to be a dismal LDP showing in elections to the Diet 's Upper House next July , Mr Kato is now most unlikely to succeed Yoshiro Mori . Party elders will not want to reward so unprecedented a display of insubordination . There are other reformers , such as Junichiro Koizumi , who bravely ( but unsuccessfully ) proposed privatising Japan 's post office , but they lack Mr Kato 's abilities and stature . 
 Blocked within his own party , Mr Kato has sometimes hinted that he might leave the LDP altogether , and throw in his lot with the main opposition party , the Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) . A strengthened DPJ would at least be able to present Japan 's voters with a choice of governments at the next election . The great weakness of the Japanese political system has been the absence of any real competition for votes : the LDP has held power continuously since its foundation in 1955 , with just one ten - month break in 1993 - 94 . 
 But Mr Kato may have difficulty taking many of his supporters with him . Besides , the opposition parties still lack credibility . They are widely seen as being stuffed with LDP deserters , and lacking new ideas . Half of Japan 's voters say they do not support any particular party , and at a prefectural election this month , a candidate backed by both the LDP and the DPJ was rejected in favour of an independent . More likely , Mr Kato will stay with the LDP and fight from within . 
 The follies of a one - party state 
 There is still much to fight for . Japan 's reformists point out that , ever since its economy first went into decline in 1991 , the LDP has been tackling the problem the wrong way : by throwing money at it . This has more than doubled Japan 's government debt , which now stands at over $ 5 trillion , or some 110 % . of GDP , the highest among industrialised countries . Yet this has failed to revive the economy , which despite temporary rallies shows no sign of returning to even European , let alone American , levels of growth . Meanwhile , such profligate government spending tends to crowd out more efficient private money , and to make consumers cautious . One credit-- ratings agency has already downgraded Japan 's debt to Aa2 , a worrying trend in the world 's second - largest economy . 
 What Japan ought to be doing is precisely what the LDP finds hardest : deregulating the economy , which is now badly handicapped by government red tape , such as the high telecoms charges that are allowing other Asian countries to overtake Japan in e - commerce . But that means tackling Japan 's special - interest groups : the construction industry , the retailers , the post office , the farmers , NTT , the banks .

IT WAS all too much in the end for Koichi Kato, the leader of an ill-fated rebellion I from inside the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which rules at the head of Japan's coalition government. A motion of no confidence in Yoshiro Mori, the prime minister, awaited a vote in parliament. Opposition parties were already in their seats, expecting the backing of Mr Kato's rebels. Yet, fighting back the tears, Mr Kato urged his supporters not to vote against the LDP after all. Only Mr Kato and Taku Yamasaki, his old friend and ally who had stuck with him to the last, would defy the party, inviting their certain expulsion. But even this last honourable gesture was denied to Mr Kato. As he prepared to leave for parliament, his supporters thronged around him, imploring ""Katosensei"" not to fall on his sword. Mr Kato collapsed into a chair, a broken man, his dreams of reform shattered around him. 
Public drama like this is rare indeed in Japan's carefully scripted politics. Yet for a brief, inspiring couple of weeks, Mr Kato's well-intentioned efforts to change the LDP'S stubbornly old-fashioned ways helped to lift some of the cynicism that has settled so firmly over Mr Mori's cabinet this year. Mr Kato's website was swamped with messages of encouragement. Newspapers rallied to his support. In train stations and in the streets, straw polls delivered an overwhelming vote in favour of Mr Mori's resignation. Now, the Japanese feel betrayed once again by their leaders, and Mr Kato has been branded an unprincipled coward. 
That seems harsh. But Mr Kato has shown himself to be sorely lacking in basic political skills. His mistyeyed faith in the will of the people was no match for the hobnailed boot of Hiromu Nonaka, the veteran LDP lawmaker whom the party picked to stamp out the rebellion. As Mr Kato humbly acknowledged this week, he thought only of his lofty goals, not about the grubby business of how to achieve them. Mr Nonaka outfought him at every turn, once again confirming his reputation as the hardest man in Japanese politics. Fittingly enough, the knockout blow came on the night of November i8th, when a dozen or so of Mr Kato's 45-strong faction met Mr Nonaka's emissary in Tokyo's Miyako Hotel. Their loyalty, it is whispered, was secured in the party's time-honoured fashion, with bags full of crisp Yio,ooo (roughly, $90) notes for future campaign funds. With his faction split, Mr Kato was finished. 
The LDP is in no mood to celebrate. Mr Mori limps on for now. But with only weeks to go before a cabinet reshuffle to prepare for sweeping administrative reforms in the new year, the party is in a desperate mess. Its liberal wing, which Mr Kato led, is broken and alienated. Young reformers are pitched against their ageing leaders. Even the LDP'S conservative mainstream is split on whether Mr Mori should struggle on. Some want a fresh face to fight next summer's Upper House elections which, at this rate, the party looks like losing heavily. 
For all these reasons, Mr Mori may still resign soon. Shifting factional politics now favour as his replacement Yohei Kono, the foreign minister, whose supporters look likely to merge with Mr Kato's defectors and inherit his faction's name. 
Even then, the LDP faces a most uncertain future. Mr Kato was challenging the power of the handful of elderly autocrats who run the party. Among them are Mr Nonaka, Shizuka Kamei, head of the LDP's powerful policy research council, and Mikio Aoki, who was given control of the party's most important political-funding network by Noboru Takeshita, a former prime minister who died earlier this year. Unlike Mr Takeshita, however, the party's current leaders seem to lack the touch that is needed to unite the LDP's broad church. Like Mr Mori, Mr Aoki is uninspiring, while Mr Kamei is an intemperate blowhard whose far-right views no-one takes seriously. Power increasingly defaults to Mr Nonaka, the LDP's secret policeman who, with his extensive files on party members' peccadillos, rules in a climate of fear. Mr Kato's rebellion was as much about the failings of the LDP'S leadership as about his own ambitions. 
These ambitions, first and foremost, were to open the party's eyes to the crisis in its support base. Before electoral reforms in 1993 abolished Japan's multi-seat constituencies, LDP politicians could secure a seat with 150/. or less of the popular vote. So long as the party's favoured candidate was properly plugged in to the local organised voteconstruction company workers, post-office employees, and so on-re-election was more or less a formality.Japan's present mixture of proportional representation and single-seat constituencies demands politics with a much broader appeal, pitched more squarely at the urban consumer. In the most recent general election, held in June, the LDP won just 28% of the popular vote. Gerrymandered constituencies and an improbable coalition with the Buddhists keep the party in power for now. But with its vote slipping all the time, the LDP still looks only one election away from disaster. 
So far, however, the party has failed dismally in its efforts to adjust to these harsh new realities. It champions the informationtechnology revolution; but its many politicians who are bankrolled by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the incumbent monopolist, hold back sorely needed change. The party's grubby meddlings degrade the efforts of the bureaucrats to clean up the banks. As the state's debts mount, even the minority who benefit from the LDP'S largesse are beginning to entertain doubts about the wisdom of its policies. Revolts over unwanted public-works projects have recently broken out all over the country, propelling independent candidates to power in local elections on the promise that they will attack the state's profligacy. 
Maybe, after this week's drama, the LDP will finally catch on that it must either change or face ruin. More likely, those voters who had held a sort of despairing hope in the party's ability to remake itself will now switch allegiance to the opposition, accelerating the LDP's demise. Perhaps sensing his own rising fortunes, Yukio Hatoyama, the leader of the Democrats, the biggest opposition party, gave a surprisingly spirited performance in parliament this week, slamming the LDP for its drift further and further away from the concerns of ordinary Japanese people.

Al Gore went on fighting after two court decisions went against him in his bid to contest the result of the presidential vote-count in Florida. First, the federal Supreme Court refused to uphold (or reject) the decision of the Florida Supreme Court to extend the deadline for hand recounts, and sent the case back for the court to explain its reasons. The next day, a Florida circuit court upheld the state's results, giving George W. Bush a winning margin of 537 votes. Mr Gore appealed against the ruling.

First , the federal Supreme Court refused to uphold ( or reject ) the decision of the Florida Supreme Court to extend the deadline for hand recounts , and sent the case back for the court to explain its reasons . The next day , a Florida circuit court upheld the state 's results , giving George W. Bush a winning margin of 537 votes . Mr Gore appealed against the ruling . Mr Gore was encouraged by a federal appeals - court ruling that rejected Mr Bush 's request to throw out the results of manual recounts in Florida . 
 Meanwhile , Mr Bush tried to consolidate his probable position as president - elect . For the first time , he received an intelligence briefing from the CIA . He told his aides in Texas , however , that they should continue calling him "" Mr Governor "" . 
 There were rows in Chile over General Augusto Pinochet . A Chilean court suspended procedures for his arrest on charges of murder and kidnapping , pending his appeal , while President Ricardo Lagos met armed - forces chiefs to discuss the issue . 
 In his first actions as Mexico 's president , Vicente Fox sent a bill on indigenous rights to Congress , as a step towards trying to settle the Zapatist rebellion in the south - eastem state of Chiapas . 
 In a setback for Venezuela 's President Hugo Chavez , fewer than io% of the electorate in a referendum backed a controversial government proposal to oust trade - union leaders . 
 Colombia 's President Andres Pastrana renewed until the end of January an arrangement under which troops have been withdrawn from a "" demilitarised "" zone to facilitate peace talks with the FARc guerrillas . The talks have been stalled for months . 
 Time for friends 
 At the start of the impeachment trial of President Joseph Estrada of the Philippines , a count of his supporters in the Senate suggested that they could be sufficient to prevent his conviction on charges of corruption . Police were on "" red alert "" for possible clashes between foes and friends of the president . An opinion poll gave Mr Estrada a popularity rating of 41 % , up from 35 % in November . 
 Yoshiro Mori sought to bolster Yoshiro Mori's shaky government with the inclusion of two former prime ministers in Yoshiro Mori's cabinet , together with other veterans . 
 Taiwan called on America to lift its ban on visits by Taiwanese officials . President Chen Shui - bian said he feared that Taiwan 's interests were being sacrificed while America was "" engaging "" China . 
 Australia is to increase its spending on defence by almost $ 13 billion during the next decade . The government said Australia would focus on regional threats and contribute more to peacekeeping forces . A defence report complained that Australia could expect littie help from "" useless "" New Zealand . 
 A collision in the Indian state of Punjab between a passenger train and a freight train killed 46 people . It was the 253rd train accident in India this year . 
 Nice work 
 Amid last - minute wrangling and violent protests by anti-- globalisation activists , leaders of the European Union 's 15 countries gathered in the French city of Nice , where they hope to change the rules of the Union to allow countries mainly from Central Europe to join . France said it was reluctant to let the Eu 's voting system be changed so that Germany would have a bigger say in Eu decisions . 
 Responding to EU plans for a rapid - reaction military force , America 's outgoing defence secretary , William Cohen , said that NATO should not be allowed to become a "" relic of the past "" . 
 France 's President Jacques Chirac became more deeply embroiled in a party - funding scandal when an aide during his time as mayor of Paris was arrested . 
 A court in Russia found an American guilty of spying and jailed him for 20 years . 
 Supreme decisions 
 With parliamentary elections due on Sunday , violence broke out in Cote d'Ivoire after the Supreme Court ruled that a leading candidate from the north , Alassane Ouatarra , was not eligible for election . The decision ranged northerners against southerners , and Muslims against Christians . 
 Ghana held a presidential election . The Supreme Court modified the rule that voters ' identification cards had to carry photographs . The main opposition party gave warning that this made fraud more likely . 
 Local elections were held in South Africa after a badtempered campaign . The turnout was low , and the opposition Democratic Alliance did relatively well . 
 The United Nations ' secretary-- general , Kofi Annan , visited Sierra Leone and Ethiopia , to show support for the two UN peacekeeping operations in west and east Africa . 
 Defence ministers representing some combatants in Congo 's war agreed to withdraw troops from frontline positions . But fighting carried on in at least one part of Congo and the rebels in control of another part rejected the deal .

IT WAS with mixed feelings that Japan viewed Yoshiro Mori's cabinet reshuffle on December 5th. The prime minister has put together a new team to prepare for government reforms, due in January, that are meant to move power from the bureaucracy to the politicians. The reforms were first proposed in 1996, after a number of scandals involving bureaucrats. But with Mr Mori's own Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) conspicuously unreformed, the mandarins suddenly do not look quite such a bad lot after all. 
However, the reshuffle has brightened things up a shade or two in Nagatacho, Tokyo's political district. Despite Mr Mori's entreaties, Taichi Sakaiya, a reform-minded novelist with a gift for publicity, has left the cabinet, taking with him what little goodwill the government enjoyed. Surprisingly, though, Mr Mori has managed to bag Ryutaro Hashimoto, a reformist former prime minister. Appropriately, Mr Hashimoto's ministerial duties are to oversee those reforms which may give Japanese politicians more of a say in the way taxes are spent. 
Most pleasingly, Hakuo Yanagisawa is also back, heading the government's efforts to clean up the banking industry. Mr Yanagisawa's first enervating crack at this job, in 1998, won him plaudits. After November's failed rebellion by the LDP's frustrated liberals, party grandees have sensibly added a reformist gloss to the new government. 
Whether these changes at the top will mean more enlightened policies depends, in part, on the uncertain fortunes of Shizuka Kamei, who heads the LDP'S powerful policy-research committee. Mr Kamei is one of the tribe in parliament close to the construction industry, traditionally the LDP'S most generous supporter. His outdated ideas have met with worryingly little resistance recently, helping reverse the scant progress Japan has made towards economic reform. 
But Mr Kamei's luck may at last be running out. He owes his power to his unflinching support for Mr Mori, who battles on despite his deep unpopularity both among the party rank and file and with the public. In a power play, Hiromu Nonaka resigned as the LDP'S secretary-general on December ist, signalling his abrupt withdrawal of support for Mr Mori, and left both the prime minister and Mr Kamei looking isolated. 
In fact it is Mr Nonaka, Japan's master politician, who now holds all the cards. Mr Nonaka is no policy wonk: he left school at 15 to become a railwayman. But it will not have escaped his notice that the reform agenda pushed by Koichi Kato, the leader of the party's failed rebellion, was an instant hit with the public. Even now, Mr Kato's offices are swamped with messages of encouragement. Most likely, Mr Nonaka will want to ditch both Mr Mori and Mr Kamei in the spring, after the party's annual conference, leaving the LDP a few precious months to patch things up before next summer's Upper House elections. That, at long last, might signal a real change of direction. ","TOKYO

In the corridors outside, children walk hand-in-hand, politely singing out greetings. The school buildings are spartan, but spotless. The sports ground is a model of efficient organisation. 
It is the thousands of well-run schools like Mr Kawabe's, a large, state-run junior high school sandwiched between Tokyo and Yokohama in run-down Kawasaki, that make educational reform such a prickly issue in Japan. Every parent can see that the system has frayed a little at the edges recently. Truancy rates are rising. There are more reports of violence and bullying. Far less obvious, though, is the need for sweeping change. By conventional measures, Japanese schools still look hard to beat. Some 97% of children stay at school until they are i8, and over a third go on to university (see chart). They may have lost the top spot, but Japan still ranks among the first five countries for its children's ability in science and mathematics. As the education ministry begins its most ambitious reforms in more than half a century, there are understandable worries that Japan will fritter away its record of success. 
The reformers do not belittle these achievements. But they do argue that, in harder-to-measure ways, Japan's schools are failing badly. Traditional Japanese teaching methods stress passive rote-Teaming. Thought is frowned upon. Weaknesses are meticulously ironed out, but so are strengths: children get extra tuition in their worst subjects, not their best ones. Uniform education standards have been pursued with an obsessive efficiency. On any one day, it is said, children all over Japan will be studying the same page from the same text book (the same used to be said of French children). The system fits the hiring needs of the bureaucracy and Japan's mass-manufacturing industries beautifully. For jobs that require innovation or initiative, however, the Japanese find themselves at sea. 
Until recently, the education ministry was among the most zealous proselytisers for this system. Its officials carefully filtered the variety out of textbooks. Hoping to snuff out aberrant individualism, the ministry introduced detailed rules governing uniforms, haircuts and codes of conduct. But with future jobs said to depend on innovation and new, creative industries, the bureaucrats want more variety again. From 2002, nearly one-third of the curriculum for primary and junior high schools will disappear, with deep cuts made in all major subjects. Filling the gaps will come new ""integrated studies"". No textbooks and, claims the education ministry, few guidelines will be issued by bureaucrats. Schools and students will be free to study whatever interests them, from religion to pollution and foreign affairs. 
The ministry is equally keen that children should develop a fuller life outside the classroom. From 2002, Saturday-morning classes will disappear from state education. Anxious parents wondering what to do with the strangers in their living-room need not worry. The ministry has set up a ""system for promoting parent-children activities"" and plans healthy recreation in libraries, museums, children's halls and the like. As part of a broader pattern of devolution, the ministry is encouraging local education boards to come up with their own ideas to enrich children's lives outside school, a task in which civic groups have begun to get involved. 
Teachers and teaching methods face more scrutiny, too. The ministry's teachertraining programme is getting an overhaul, with a view to encouraging more stimulating classes. Much of the teaching at Mr Kawabe's school is the usual dull fare. But, here and there, the odd splash of colour has begun to appear. In a domestic-science class, three boys are making a presentation for a new washing-powder advertisement. In an English class, two teachers working as a teamanother education-ministry innovationget the classroom involved in an arcane grammar lesson. Teachers who fail to measure up to the new demands may find themselves in a different job, or on lower pay. The ministry is drafting legislation for performance-related pay, and to let it move bad teachers to different jobs in the public sector. 
Not so fast 
Opposition to the ministry's plans comes from several quarters. Conservative politicians are up in arms about the ministry's worryingly liberal drift, arguing that misplaced western-influenced ideas have undermined traditional Japanese morality and created a rash of discipline problems in the classroom. The prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, is a self-confessed admirer of bits of the notorious i9th-century Imperial Rescript on Education, which paved the way, in the 1930s, for the mass indoctrination of Japanese children in emperor worship. 
Many parents worry that reforms will lower education standards. Cynics wonder whether the education ministry's deeplyrooted top-down thinking may not be inconsistent with its desire to create independent individuals. But at least the bureaucrats are trying to show the Japanese that there is another way. It is up to them to take it.

Tony Blair and his retinue got little sleep at the European Union's hardfought summit in Nice, which ended in the early hours of Monday morning. Nonetheless, on Monday afternoon, the prime minister strode into Parliament, smug as Henry v after Agincourt, to enumerate his foreign victories. He then strode out again having added a domestic one. He gave William Hague a battering in the one place (the Commons chamber) where the Conservative leader usually prevails; and on the one subject (the nation's imminent disappearance into the snapping jaws of a federal Euro-state) that Mr Hague had seen as a reliable vote-earner in the coming general election. 
Bagehot does not have space to list all the triumphs Mr Blair claimed from Nice. Some of them pale a little under a strong light. But there is no doubt that the government has now given itself what its spin doctors call a good pre-election ""narrative"" on Europe. 
In Nice, Mr Blair helped to change the EU's rules so that it can at last take in new members from Central Europe, a policy long favoured by all of Britain's main parties. He did so while increasing Britain's voting weight in the Council of Ministers. To avoid paralysis as the club grows, the EU will in future require unanimity in fewer areas of decision-making. But at Mr Blair's insistence, the veto will remain in ""red-line"" areas such as taxation and social security. The government claims to have averted whatever danger the new EU rapid-reaction force might have posed to the primacy of NATO. Mr Blair says that this force (Britain had the word. ""army"" excised from the communique) can do its modest jobs only in cases where NATO had declined to do these itself And all this, said Mr Blair, crowned a run of success. Whereas the Conservatives had made Britain into a pariah on the mainland, he had fought Britain's comer while exercising ""real authority and influence"". Had he not defended Britain's opt-out on border controls in Amsterdam in 1997, and negotiated a fairer budget deal in Berlin in 1999? Why, in Lisbon this year he had even talked the mainland into sharing his vision of market-friendly economic reform. 
In point of fact, a few of Mr Blair's European partners sound rather less enthralled. The day after Mr Blair played Henry v in his own Parliament, Romano Prodi, the EU'S president, grumbled to the European one about the ""intransigence"" of countries that refused in Nice to let the EU settle matters such as taxation and social regulation by majority voting. France's President Chirac let it be known that he shared Mr Prodi's disappointment with leaders who had defended their short-term national interest ""to the detriment of a long-term vision"". But (to mix a metaphor just for the hell of it) this rap over the knuckles is music to Mr Blair's ears. For it so happens that Mr Blair's short-term interest is to win re-election, and-as all the polling numbers show-Mr Prodi's long-term federal vision happens to be anathema to British voters. With an election on the way, the faint damns of his fellow Europeans area price Mr Blair is happy to pay in return for earning the faint praise of the Eurosceptical press. After Nice, instead of its usual blast against his European policy, the Sun congratulated itself for having been first to alert Mr Blair to the menacing Euro-taxes and Euro-passports that he was able to beat off there. How bad can the summit have been if it left Johnny foreigner fuming? 
Why, though, did the Conservatives have to let Mr Blair turn a good summit for him into such bad news for them? Only because, against the advice of Francis Maude, their own shadow foreign secretary, they marched into a well-prepared trap. 
Mr Blair has struggled for months to deflect attention from his hugely unpopular plan to join Europe's single currency. He has done this by saying little about the euro and lots about the merits of Britain remaining a member of the EU. The Tories' sensible retort was that no serious party advocated leaving the EU. But Mr Hague promises now that, if elected, he would refuse to ratify the Nice treaty as it stands. This is not only a bit rich from the party that signed the Single European Act and the Maastricht treaty. It would also trigger a crisis in British relations with the Union and probably delay its enlargement. By making the threat, Mr Hague allowed Mr Blair to tell the House of Commons that the true agenda of many Conservatives was to put Britain ""next door to the exit sign in Europe"". 
What has got into Mr Hague? Maybe he really does see Nice as the slippery slope to a federal state; some of his shadow ministers opposed Maastricht tooth and nail. Or, more likely, sheer desperation has invited miscalculation. 
Picture the Tory leader poring late at night with puffy eyes over those opinion polls. The numbers dance and blur, but no matter how you count them, all point to electoral defeat. The one filament of hope comes from the data on Europe. Funny, this, but a MORI poll last September found that if voters were asked whether Britain should remain in the EU, 46% would vote to leave and 43% to stay, with only 11% undecided. Attitudes towards the single currency were even more hostile: 22% would vote to join the euro and 70% not to, with a mere 8% undecided. Perhaps it is not so foolish to fight an election as the party that, provoked enough,just might decide to quit the Eu altogether. 
Except that polls deceive. For the same survey also showed that whereas 46% of respondents trusted Mr Blair to make decisions about Britain's future in Europe, only 35% trusted Mr Hague. Moreover, their hostility fades when they are offered a larger range of choices. In June MORI found that only 10% would rule out euro membership for at least ten years (roughly Tory policy) and 12% would rule it out for ever. But 58% agreed that they would ""like to hold a public debate before deciding whether or not to join after a referendum"". That-to the extent that he intends to say anything about the euro before the election-is precisely Mr Blair's policy. ","NEVER from France returned more happy men . Tony Blair and his retinue got little sleep at the European Union 's hardfought summit in Nice , which ended in the early hours of Monday morning . Nonetheless , on Monday afternoon , the prime minister strode into Parliament , smug as Henry v after Agincourt , to enumerate his foreign victories . He then strode out again having added a domestic one . He gave William Hague a battering in the one place ( the Commons chamber ) where the Conservative leader usually prevails ; and on the one subject ( the nation 's imminent disappearance into the snapping jaws of a federal Euro - state ) that Mr Hague had seen as a reliable vote - earner in the coming general election . 
 Bagehot does not have space to list all the triumphs Mr Blair claimed from Nice . Some of them pale a little under a strong light . But there is no doubt that the government has now given itself what its spin doctors call a good pre - election "" narrative "" on Europe . 
 In Nice , Mr Blair helped to change the EU 's rules so that it can at last take in new members from Central Europe , a policy long favoured by all of Britain 's main parties . He did so while increasing Britain 's voting weight in the Council of Ministers . To avoid paralysis as the club grows , the EU will in future require unanimity in fewer areas of decision - making . But at Mr Blair 's insistence , the veto will remain in "" red - line "" areas such as taxation and social security . The government claims to have averted whatever danger the new EU rapid - reaction force might have posed to the primacy of NATO . Mr Blair says that this force ( Britain had the word . "" army "" excised from the communique ) can do its modest jobs only in cases where NATO had declined to do these itself And all this , said Mr Blair , crowned a run of success . Whereas the Conservatives had made Britain into a pariah on the mainland , he had fought Britain 's comer while exercising "" real authority and influence "" . Had he not defended Britain 's opt - out on border controls in Amsterdam in 1997 , and negotiated a fairer budget deal in Berlin in 1999 ? Why , in Lisbon this year he had even talked the mainland into sharing his vision of market - friendly economic reform . 
 In point of fact , a few of Mr Blair 's European partners sound rather less enthralled . The day after Mr Blair played Henry v in his own Parliament , Romano Prodi , the EU 'S president , grumbled to the European one about the "" intransigence "" of countries that refused in Nice to let the EU settle matters such as taxation and social regulation by majority voting . France 's President Chirac let it be known that he shared Mr Prodi 's disappointment with leaders who had defended their short - term national interest "" to the detriment of a long - term vision "" . But ( to mix a metaphor just for the hell of it ) this rap over the knuckles is music to Mr Blair 's ears .

George Bush became the 43rd president of the United States after an election of unprecedented drama and confusion. Al Gore, the Democratic candidate, narrowly won the popular vote, but victory in the electoral college depended on the result in Florida, where Mr Bush was ahead by only 500 votes. Claims of irregularities and a volley of lawsuits to force or stop recounts followed. Florida's Supreme Court ruled that partial recounts should continue; the United States Supreme Court intervened to rule that they should not. That in effect settled the result, five weeks after election day. 
The Institutional Revolutionary Party lost power in Mexico, after seven decades, to Vicente Fox, a former Coca-Cola manager. 
In an extraordinary saga in Peru, Alberto Fujimori won a controversial third term as president in a rigged election, only to be driven from office months later by scandals involving his intelligence adviser, Vladimiro Montesinos. 
The United States stepped into Colombia's quagmire, approving $1.3 billion in mostly military aid intended to wrest control of the country's main drug-producing area from the FARC guerrillas. The FARC suspended peace talks with the government, while right-wing paramilitaries grew in strength. 
The Pinochet affair trundled on. Britain released the former dictator after 17 months, on health grounds. Chile's Supreme Court ruled that he could be prosecuted at home for disappearances, but the Appeals Court quashed an arrest order against him on technical grounds. 
Canada's prime minister, Jean Chretien, gambled on an early election, and won. He gained a third consecutive parliamentary majority, seeing off the challenge of a newly formed right-wing party. 
Europe's leaders 
Vladimir Putin took over as Russia's acting president from an ailing Boris Yeltsin at the end of 1999, and won a presidential election in March. 
Slobodan Milosevic was turned out of office, with the help of mass demonstrations, after losing a presidential election in Yugoslavia to Vojislav Kostunica. 
The least belligerent of Kosovo's political parties, led by Ibrahim Rugova, won local elections in the rebel province administered by the UN. 
Angela Merkel replaced Wolfgang Schauble as the leader of Germany's opposition Christian Democratic Union in an effort to freshen up a party tainted by the fund-raising scandal surrounding ex-Chancellor Helmut Kohl. 
France, which took over the Eu's six-month rotating presidency in July, held a summit in Nice. The EU'S 15 leaders agreed on the minimum reforms needed to embrace more countries as members, mainly from Eastern Europe. The earliest any might join is reckoned to be 2004. 
Spain's prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar, and his centreright People's Party retained power by winning, for the first time, an outright majority in parliament in a general election. 
Giuliano Amato, a technocrat, took over from Massimo D'Alema, an ex-Communist, as Italy's prime minister, at the head of roughly the same centre-left coalition. 
In a referendum, the Danes rejected a proposal to adopt Europe's single currency, the euro. 
Austria's far-right Freedom Party joined the centre-right People's Party in a ruling coalition, prompting the rest of the Eu to cold-shoulder Austria, though the Freedom Party's head, Jorg Haider, stayed out of the government. 
Peace postponed 
The Israelis and Palestinians failed to agree on a permanent peace. Instead, a sequence of events led to a new intifada (uprising). The Israelis responded with ferocity. After 300 Palestinians and 38 Israelis had been killed, both sides again started peace talks. 
President Muhammad Khatami's reform movement in Iran won a parliamentary election but suffered bad setbacks, including the closing of liberal-minded newspapers. 
Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, launched a campaign to occupy white-owned farms, attacking the opposition Movement for Democratic Change. He won a parliamentary election but the economy shrank, disastrously. 
A savage two-year border war between Ethiopia and Eritrea ended with Eritrea's defeat. The two countries signed a peace agreement. 
In Cote d'Ivoire, General Robert Guei tried to steal an election. He was driven out by popular protest, and replaced by an opposition candidate, Laurent Gbagbo. The banning of another contender, Alassane Ouatarra, led to clashes. 
The UN struggled to make peace in Sierra Leone. Foday Sankoh, the main rebel leader, was captured. But the war continued. So did a bigger war in Congo. 
Mori clings on 
A rebellion against Japan's prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, led by his younger rival, Koichi Kato, failed. But with the lowest approval rating of any Japanese leader for decades, and a flat economy, Mr Mori's days looked numbered. 
The presidents of the two Koreas, Kim Dae Jung and Kim Jong 11, held an unprecedented summit in Pyongyang, the North's capital. There were family reunions, too, and work began on restoring rail links between the two capitals. 
President Joseph Estrada of the Philippines went on trial in the country's Senate, accused of taking bribes from illegal lotteries; the first Asian leader to be impeached. ","Bush finally does it

It is not in everybody's interest to admit this. Mr Blair does not want to admit it lest complacency about the result persuades Labour voters to stay home on polling day. Newspapers do not want to admit it because dull elections sell fewer papers. Readers of British papers can accordingly expect much harking back in the coming months to the general election of 1970, when Labour's Harold Wilson looked like a shoo-in, but, to pretty universal surprise, victory went to the Tories. The Economist remembers this especially ruefully. We proclaimed ""Harold Wilson's Britain"" on our cover in the very week that Britain made Edward Heath its prime minister. Never prophesy, especially about the future, as the saying goes. All the same, 1970 is not much of a cautionary tale. Mr Wilson's government was climbing back from behind in the opinion polls, and his chancellor, Roy Jenkins, failed for all the worthiest reasons to deliver a sufficiently generous pre-election budget. Mr Blair, in contrast, is way ahead in the polls; and his chancellor has already indicated that the government's extra billions for public services will still leave room for ""targeted"" tax cuts in March. 
The government accuses William Hague of seeking deliberately to stir up apathy, in order to encourage the low turnout Mr Blair fears. In fact a dull election is not in the Conservative leader's interest either. Having abandoned hope of actual victory, Mr Hague will need to show the party faithful that he has at least fought a good fight if he is see off potential challengers and keep his job for the election after next. If he does not go down fighting, he will probably go down for good. He has got off to a reasonable start.

That is to say, the party shed potential votes throughout the campaign, mainly to the Liberal Democrats. But losing this battle did not matter, because Labour had already won the war that began soon after John Major's unexpected victory in 1992. Once Britain's ejection from Europe's exchange-rate mechanism on ""Black Wednesday"" had destroyed the Tories' reputation for economic competence, Mr Major was unable to benefit from the subsequent economic recovery. Divided on Europe and wallowing in accusations of sleaze, the Tories had been in power too long.

After being sworn in as America's 43rd president, George Bush appealed especially for civility among Americans. As his first initiative, he proposed sweeping changes to America's schools, including the annual testing of elementary-school pupils and the use of vouchers to help parents of children in bad public schools to pay for private or religious education. 
Mr Bush also said he would restore Ronald Reagan's policy of denying federal money for the promotion of abortion abroad. Many other last-minute Clinton regulations were blocked or suspended, including the creation of several new ""national monuments"", or protected areas, in the west. 
President Bill Clinton left office with immunity from criminal prosecution and a flurry of pardons, including pardons for his half-brother Roger, Patty Hearst and a fugitive oil-trader, Marc Rich. 
An oil slick from a stranded tanker threatened rare wildlife on Ecuador's Galapagos Islands. Winds and tides proved more effective at dispersing the oil than official efforts had been at preventing it from spilling.

Half-hearted efforts to restore them to health have failed. It is time for more drastic measures 
THE bankers in Marunouchi, Tokyo's financial district, know that one more big client's bankruptcy or a further slide in share prices could push them into an abyss that they prefer not to contemplate. The possibility of either event is far from remote. Among the candidates for collapse are big construction companies such as Kumagai Gumi and retailers such as Daiei, a supermarket chain. Meanwhile, the stockmarket, close to its lowest level for a decade, is levitating only after a promise earlier this month from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) that it will come up with proposals to prop up share prices. If those proposals fail to materialise, or to meet expectations, the cushion of unrealised equity gains on the banks' balance sheets could soon deflate. 
It should not be like this. Japanese banks have been on the brink of disaster before. After the most recent crisis (in 1997-98) the government set up a special body, the Financial Reconstruction Commission (FRC), to clean up the country's financial system. The FRC was due to complete its task by 2001. But almost the only thing that went according to plan was the closure of the FRC itself at the beginning of this year. The banks are still far from meeting the goals set out for them by the government in 1998; they remain burdened with bad debts, poor profitability and a lacklustre economy. Indeed, they may be in a worse state now than they were then. 
At the root of the problem lie poor lending decisions. Since the early 1990s, the banks have written down almost twice their entire capital and reserves in an attempt to get rid of their bad loans. But those bad loans have stubbornly refused to go away. Official figures show that non-performing loans are barely falling at the big banks, while at the regional banks they are actually increasing. 
Part of the trouble is that the banks are incorrectly classifying their loans. Last March, for example, Sumitomo had analysts scratching their heads when it reported that it had only Y265 billion ($2.26 billion) of problem loans to the construction industry, a figure smaller than the bank's total exposure to Kumagai Gumi,just one big troubled company. A few months later, Kumagai Gumi asked Sumitomo and three other banks to restructure its debts, and Sumitomo is now due to write off Y260 billion in an effort to save Kumagai from bankruptcy. 
The extent of such erroneous classification is further illustrated by the loan books of The Long-Term Credit Bank (LTCB) and Nippon Credit Bank (NCB), two nationalised banks. They were meant to have been stripped of their deadbeat loans by the FRC, and then sold to third parties. But even after the official ""clean-up"", loans to companies such as Sogo, a department store that later went bust, were left sitting on the books as ""good"" assets. 
In addition, there is a widespread fear that the banks have overestimated the value of the property backing many of their loans. Urban land prices, for example, have fallen by up to 80% since their peak in the early 1990s. This means that the banks have undervalued the portion of those loans without collateral-ie, the portion against which they need to hold reserves. For such reasons, the estimate of the Financial Services Agency (the FsA, the industry watchdog) that the banking system had problem loans of 63.3 trillion last March, is generally thought to be as much as 50% below the true figure. 
Little help from profits... 
One reason why the banks are unable to lift themselves out of trouble is that they are finding it hard to make decent profits. Brian Waterhouse of HSBC Securities reckons that even though they are, after several years of heavy losses, forecasting profits for the year ending in March 2001, much of this recovery is down to the fact that they are cutting costs by reducing their bad-debt provisions and write-offs. 
Profits from equity sales have also helped to boost profits in the first half of the year. James Fiorillo, an analyst at INC Barings, believes that the banks may even have reduced much-needed investment in IT so as to bolster their profits, endangering their long-term competitiveness. The banks are having to resort to such lastditch measures largely because they are still losing money on their core lending business, and they have been unable to develop fresh fee-based business as an alternative source of revenue. 
Some are hoping that four mega-mergers orchestrated among a number of the ailing banks-mergers that will create some of the biggest financial institutions in the world (see table)-will help get them out of trouble. But the chances of this working are slim. Instead of seeking to improve the banks' profitability through strategic alliances, the megamergers have merely sought to make them ""too big to fail"". 
Not surprisingly, more than a year after their announcement, the mergers are still largely in the planning and preparatory stage. The banks have, for example, yet to integrate their systems fully. This is much too slow, says an irritated Hakuo Yanagisawa, minister in charge of financial affairs, who was also in charge during the early stages of the banking reforms two years ago. 
The pace is unlikely to pick up. Mr Waterhouse says it will be particularly slow at Mizuho (which brings together Dai-Ichi Kangyo, Fuji and Industrial Bank of Japan) and at United Financial of Japan (a combination of Sanwa, Tokai and Toyo Trust). These two groups have chosen to assemble themselves under joint holding companies, a structure that takes more time to set up than an outright merger. Meanwhile, the plodding godzillas are in danger of having their market share stolen from them by nimble new competitors, such as the new banks being set up by the likes of Sony, Ito-Yokado, a retailer, and Orix, a leasing company. 
... or from the economy 
None of this would be quite so alarming if the Japanese economy were on the road to full recovery. Unfortunately, it is not.Japan's heavily indebted companies are still struggling to sell things to reluctant consumers while buckling under rising burdens of debt. This is because the economy, although growing in real terms, is not growing in nominal terms-ie, growth is low and inflation is negative. Since debts are always nominal (in the sense that borrowers must pay back the nominal amount that they borrowed), the ability of firms to service their loans rises only with nominal increases in profit, not with deflation-adjusted increases. Hence, cleaning up after Japan's asset-price bubble is getting harder. Bankruptcies are continuing at a high level (see chart 1), and requests for debt waivers still flood in. 
Some bits of the economy are recovering, but this is not helping the banks much. Most of the restructuring that is the basis for recovery is in industries and companies which are able to withstand some short-term pain. So good companies are getting stronger while the bad ones remain weak. The best borrowers are also shifting their fund-raising to Japan's fledgling capital markets, with the result that the banks' customers are becoming increasingly concentrated on the rotten sectors. 
To some extent, the banks have been able to disguise their ills because of the unrealised equity gains that they have on their balance sheets. But plunging stockmarkets are wiping out most of these. This matters more and more because Japan is due to introduce market-value-based accounting this year-- meaning that unrealised securities losses will start being deducted from their capital. With such losses to account for, the banks will be less willing than ever to undertake write-offs of their bad debts. 
Hironari Nozaki, an analyst with ABN Amro, reckons that if these equity losses keep growing, they might even push down retained profits to the point where some banks are unable to pay dividends. At this point, they would also have to stop paying interest on their preferred subordinated debt, since this cannot be paid before dividends. If this were to happen, warns Mr Nozaki, the so-called ""Japan premium"", the extra interest that international institutions began charging Japanese banks during the 1997-98 crisis, could start moving up. 
With so much riding on the stockmarkets, it is little wonder that they are the subject of the politicians' attention. According to Mr Fiorillo, ten out of the 14 biggest banks have Y2.1 trillion of unrealised losses on their equity portfolios at current stockmarket levels (with the Topix index at about 1,250). Given that the banks themselves are eager to sell their large shareholdings in firms within their own keiretsu (or group), further falls seem likely. Although it is hard to say exactly where the real danger zone lies, it is clear that share prices are slipping close to it. 
The authorities claim that the banks are healthier now than they were two years ago because their capital position is so much stronger. They point to the banks' Basle ratios, which averaged around 12% last September. (For banks with overseas operations, the Basle minimum is 8%.) But beware, says Mr Fiorillo, for these are not what they seem. They are flattered by unrealised gains on property valuation; by deferred tax assets that might disappear if the banks don't make lots of profit over the next five years; and by public funds that the banks will also have to pay back out of profits. Strip these out and the ratios are pushed down to around 6.2%; take into account unrealised equity losses and you can knock off another point or two. Either way, the number falls well below 8%. 
The Japan premium, however, is today practically zero, signalling that international financiers believe that Japan's banking system will not seize up again. It has placed its faith in the colossal safety-net that the government strung under the banks at the height of the 1997-98 crisis. Moody's, a creditrating agency, argues that although the banks individually stink (it rates many of them as ""E"" or ""E+"", on a par with the average bank in Mexico or Russia), the promise of public support greatly raises their collective stability, giving them an average credit rating of ""A"". This shows how crucial the government's safety-net is. Yet from April it is to have some sizeable holes in it. 
The 70 trillion cushion, created in 1998, is a complicated combination of four different ""funds"" that can be poured into the system in times of stress. A couple of them will safeguard depositors if banks collapse, and a couple are for the banks themselves. One is for banks which go bust-to nationalise them, for example-and about a third of the i8 trillion in this fund has already been spent. The 25 trillion in the other bank-related fund is to recapitalise unhealthy banks; and 84 trillion of this has already been used. 
it might seem as if a hefty sum is still available. And so it is. But not for much longer; the two bank-related bits of the safetynet are to disappear at the end of March. Some Y26 trillion will be set aside for the credit unions, but none of this will be available for banks. Instead, a 15 trillion ""systemic risk"" fund will be set up for emergencies. The prime minister, the finance minister, the minister in charge of financial affairs and the head of the Bank of Japan will get together to discuss its use. But the final say will rest with the prime minister alone. 
Critics argue that, at best, the way this new fund will work is ambiguous, and that it signals a disturbing move away from transparent bail-outs. More worrying for bankers is the risk that it might not work at all. With no designated framework to release the funds, the process of decision-making will be subjective and will be bound to come under intense public scrutiny, given the level of public anger at the last round of injections into the banking system. 
A successful application for funds will require a persuasive and credible politician at the helm. The present prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, is neither. At worst, an attempt to use the systemic risk fund could turn into another fiasco like last summer's, when the government tried unsuccessfully to use public funds to save the Sogo department stores. 
Where next? 
With the clock ticking and the environment deteriorating, the question of what to do about Japan's ailing banks is gathering new urgency. What is becoming clear is that it is not enough to consider the banks in isolation. For every problem loan there is a troubled borrower. And the clean-up of these borrowers has hardly begun. 
At the moment, the banks and the rest of the economy are caught in a vicious cycle. Banks have been all too willing to forgive debt or to provide new credit lines in order to keep deadbeats on their feet, and this has hindered the structural reforms needed to revive the economy. This, in turn, is sapping the banks' own strength, leaving them reluctant to take on more risk by lending to the young businesses that should be leading Japan out of recession. Despite promises to the contrary, domestic bank lending has fallen to its lowest level in nine years. 
The banks' policies are also increasing deflationary pressures. Large corporate white elephants are slashing prices to maintain day-to-day cashflow, safe in the knowledge that even if this leads to more losses, the banks will eventually come to their rescue. This, in turn, is weakening their healthier competitors, whose profit margins are being squeezed as they try to match the price cuts and remain competitive. 
This cycle must be broken. But the banks lack the will to do it. One of the biggest mistakes that the government made during the previous injection of public funds into the industry was to leave in office all of the bank bosses who had caused the problems in the first place. The survival of these elders, who are naturally loth to admit that their houses need cleaning, contrasts sharply with the experience in America and South Korea. There, scores of top banking executives were sacked, and some were even thrown into jail. 
Japan ought to do several things now. It should enforce stricter reporting and disclosure of bad loans; it needs to inject more money into the banks so that they can write off all their bad debts; and bank managers should be sacked, so that new ones can be put in their place. 
Temporarily nationalising the banks, by declaring them insolvent or as having inadequate capital, may be the only way to accomplish all this. Even with strict supervision, the banks will probably find it hard as independent entities to cut off favoured customers, alienate the public, hire better management and admit to true shareholder value. 
Reformers such as Yasuhisa Shiozaki, an LDP politician, strongly believe that such measures need to be implemented before the time limit on the rescue funds runs out. Yukio Edano of the Democratic Party of Japan (Dpj) has a more dramatic proposal which involves temporarily nationalising weak banks, splitting them into ""good banks"" and ""bad banks"", and then selling the good bits. The proceeds could be used to help deal with the bad bits left in the government's hands. 
Unfortunately, none of these options is likely to be taken up. Reformers have been sidelined within the LDP. Party elders, fearful of upsetting voters, do not want the problems that lurk in the banks exposed before elections to the upper house in July. Instead, the party's mainstream factions are reverting to the idea, discredited years ago, of supporting the stockmarkets. One of their proposals would allow companies to buy back their own shares until they decide to resell them later on. This is a dangerous idea that makes it easier for companies to use inside information to manipulate their own share prices, especially in Japan, which lacks a powerful securities commission. 
What does the man in charge think of all this? Mr Yanagisawa is against stockmarket intervention, arguing that not only do such schemes rarely achieve their purpose, but they could also drive away foreign investors. Mr Yanagisawa is also against giving the banks any more public money or nationalising them. He argues, at least officially, that this is because they are so much stronger now. Cynics suggest that he does not want to nationalise banks because it would be tantamount to admitting that the previous injection of public funds, which he oversaw, was a failure. 
Mr Yanagisawa does, however, believe that structural and banking reforms should go hand in hand, and he is moving to set up a committee with the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport to monitor private-sector debt reduction and engineer bank reform. His measures, though, fall short of the real medicine needed to cure Japan's banking ills. Yet if he were to take a tougher stance, Mr Yanagisawa would be unlikely to find enough political allies to back him, at least not until after the July elections. Meanwhile, Marunouchi could burst into flames any day. ","Japan 's problem banks present one of the greatest financial threats to the world economy .

Mr Waterhouse says it will be particularly slow at Mizuho ( which brings together Dai - Ichi Kangyo , Fuji and Industrial Bank of Japan ) and at United Financial of Japan ( a combination of Sanwa , Tokai and Toyo Trust ) . These two groups have chosen to assemble themselves under joint holding companies , a structure that takes more time to set up than an outright merger . Meanwhile , the plodding godzillas are in danger of having their market share stolen from them by nimble new competitors , such as the new banks being set up by the likes of Sony , Ito - Yokado , a retailer , and Orix , a leasing company . 
 ... or from the economy 
 None of this would be quite so alarming if the Japanese economy were on the road to full recovery . Unfortunately , it is not . Japan 's heavily indebted companies are still struggling to sell things to reluctant consumers while buckling under rising burdens of debt . This is because the economy , although growing in real terms , is not growing in nominal terms - ie , growth is low and inflation is negative . Since debts are always nominal ( in the sense that borrowers must pay back the nominal amount that they borrowed ) , the ability of firms to service their loans rises only with nominal increases in profit , not with deflation - adjusted increases . Hence , cleaning up after Japan 's asset - price bubble is getting harder . Bankruptcies are continuing at a high level ( see chart 1 ) , and requests for debt waivers still flood in . 
 Some bits of the economy are recovering , but this is not helping the banks much . Most of the restructuring that is the basis for recovery is in industries and companies which are able to withstand some short - term pain . So good companies are getting stronger while the bad ones remain weak . The best borrowers are also shifting their fund - raising to Japan 's fledgling capital markets , with the result that the banks ' customers are becoming increasingly concentrated on the rotten sectors . 
 To some extent , the banks have been able to disguise their ills because of the unrealised equity gains that they have on their balance sheets . But plunging stockmarkets are wiping out most of these . This matters more and more because Japan is due to introduce market - value - based accounting this year-- meaning that unrealised securities losses will start being deducted from their capital . With such losses to account for , the banks will be less willing than ever to undertake write - offs of their bad debts . 
 Hironari Nozaki , an analyst with ABN Amro , reckons that if these equity losses keep growing , they might even push down retained profits to the point where some banks are unable to pay dividends . At this point , they would also have to stop paying interest on their preferred subordinated debt , since this can not be paid before dividends . If this were to happen , warns Mr Nozaki , the so - called "" Japan premium "" , the extra interest that international institutions began charging Japanese banks during the 1997 - 98 crisis , could start moving up . 
 With so much riding on the stockmarkets , it is little wonder that they are the subject of the politicians ' attention . According to Mr Fiorillo , ten out of the 14 biggest banks have Y2.1 trillion of unrealised losses on their equity portfolios at current stockmarket levels ( with the Topix index at about 1,250 ) . Given that the banks themselves are eager to sell their large shareholdings in firms within their own keiretsu ( or group ) , further falls seem likely . Although it is hard to say exactly where the real danger zone lies , it is clear that share prices are slipping close to it . 
 The authorities claim that the banks are healthier now than they were two years ago because their capital position is so much stronger . They point to the banks ' Basle ratios , which averaged around 12 % last September . ( For banks with overseas operations , the Basle minimum is 8 % . ) But beware , says Mr Fiorillo , for these are not what they seem . They are flattered by unrealised gains on property valuation ; by deferred tax assets that might disappear if the banks do n't make lots of profit over the next five years ; and by public funds that the banks will also have to pay back out of profits . Strip these out and the ratios are pushed down to around 6.2 % ; take into account unrealised equity losses and you can knock off another point or two . Either way , the number falls well below 8 % . 
 The Japan premium , however , is today practically zero , signalling that international financiers believe that Japan 's banking system will not seize up again . It has placed its faith in the colossal safety - net that the government strung under the banks at the height of the 1997 - 98 crisis . Moody 's , a creditrating agency , argues that although the banks individually stink ( it rates many of them as "" E "" or "" E+ "" , on a par with the average bank in Mexico or Russia ) , the promise of public support greatly raises their collective stability , giving them an average credit rating of "" A "" . This shows how crucial the government 's safety - net is . Yet from April it is to have some sizeable holes in it . 
 The 70 trillion cushion , created in 1998 , is a complicated combination of four different "" funds "" that can be poured into the system in times of stress . A couple of them will safeguard depositors if banks collapse , and a couple are for the banks themselves . One is for banks which go bust - to nationalise them , for example - and about a third of the i8 trillion in this fund has already been spent . The 25 trillion in the other bank - related fund is to recapitalise unhealthy banks ; and 84 trillion of this has already been used . 
 it might seem as if a hefty sum is still available . And so it is . But not for much longer ; the two bank - related bits of the safetynet are to disappear at the end of March . Some Y26 trillion will be set aside for the credit unions , but none of this will be available for banks . Instead , a 15 trillion "" systemic risk "" fund will be set up for emergencies . Yoshiro Mori , the finance minister , the minister in charge of financial affairs and the head of the Bank of Japan will get together to discuss its use . But the final say will rest with Yoshiro Mori . 
 Critics argue that , at best , the way this new fund will work is ambiguous , and that it signals a disturbing move away from transparent bail - outs . More worrying for bankers is the risk that it might not work at all . With no designated framework to release the funds , the process of decision - making will be subjective and will be bound to come under intense public scrutiny , given the level of public anger at the last round of injections into the banking system . 
 A successful application for funds will require a persuasive and credible politician at the helm . Yoshiro Mori , is neither . At worst , an attempt to use the systemic risk fund could turn into another fiasco like last summer 's , when the government tried unsuccessfully to use public funds to save the Sogo department stores . 
 Where next ? 
 With the clock ticking and the environment deteriorating , the question of what to do about Japan 's ailing banks is gathering new urgency . What is becoming clear is that it is not enough to consider the banks in isolation . For every problem loan there is a troubled borrower . And the clean - up of these borrowers has hardly begun . 
 At the moment , the banks and the rest of the economy are caught in a vicious cycle . Banks have been all too willing to forgive debt or to provide new credit lines in order to keep deadbeats on their feet , and this has hindered the structural reforms needed to revive the economy . This , in turn , is sapping the banks ' own strength , leaving them reluctant to take on more risk by lending to the young businesses that should be leading Japan out of recession . Despite promises to the contrary , domestic bank lending has fallen to its lowest level in nine years . 
 The banks ' policies are also increasing deflationary pressures . Large corporate white elephants are slashing prices to maintain day - to - day cashflow , safe in the knowledge that even if this leads to more losses , the banks will eventually come to their rescue . This , in turn , is weakening their healthier competitors , whose profit margins are being squeezed as they try to match the price cuts and remain competitive . 
 This cycle must be broken . But the banks lack the will to do it . One of the biggest mistakes that the government made during the previous injection of public funds into the industry was to leave in office all of the bank bosses who had caused the problems in the first place . The survival of these elders , who are naturally loth to admit that their houses need cleaning , contrasts sharply with the experience in America and South Korea . There , scores of top banking executives were sacked , and some were even thrown into jail . 
 Japan ought to do several things now . It should enforce stricter reporting and disclosure of bad loans ; it needs to inject more money into the banks so that they can write off all their bad debts ; and bank managers should be sacked , so that new ones can be put in their place . 
 Temporarily nationalising the banks , by declaring them insolvent or as having inadequate capital , may be the only way to accomplish all this . Even with strict supervision , the banks will probably find it hard as independent entities to cut off favoured customers , alienate the public , hire better management and admit to true shareholder value . 
 Reformers such as Yasuhisa Shiozaki , an LDP politician , strongly believe that such measures need to be implemented before the time limit on the rescue funds runs out . Yukio Edano of the Democratic Party of Japan ( Dpj ) has a more dramatic proposal which involves temporarily nationalising weak banks , splitting them into "" good banks "" and "" bad banks "" , and then selling the good bits . The proceeds could be used to help deal with the bad bits left in the government 's hands . 
 Unfortunately , none of these options is likely to be taken up . Reformers have been sidelined within the LDP . Party elders , fearful of upsetting voters , do not want the problems that lurk in the banks exposed before elections to the upper house in July . Instead , the party 's mainstream factions are reverting to the idea , discredited years ago , of supporting the stockmarkets . One of their proposals would allow companies to buy back their own shares until they decide to resell them later on . This is a dangerous idea that makes it easier for companies to use inside information to manipulate their own share prices , especially in Japan , which lacks a powerful securities commission . 
 What does the man in charge think of all this ? Mr Yanagisawa is against stockmarket intervention , arguing that not only do such schemes rarely achieve their purpose , but they could also drive away foreign investors . Mr Yanagisawa is also against giving the banks any more public money or nationalising them . He argues , at least officially , that this is because they are so much stronger now . Cynics suggest that he does not want to nationalise banks because it would be tantamount to admitting that the previous injection of public funds , which he oversaw , was a failure . 
 Mr Yanagisawa does , however , believe that structural and banking reforms should go hand in hand , and he is moving to set up a committee with the Ministry of Economy , Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Land , Infrastructure and Transport to monitor private - sector debt reduction and engineer bank reform . His measures , though , fall short of the real medicine needed to cure Japan 's banking ills . Yet if he were to take a tougher stance , Mr Yanagisawa would be unlikely to find enough political allies to back him , at least not until after the July elections . Meanwhile , Marunouchi could burst into flames any day .",740,Japan,A29-8206,IN TERM,True,"The present prime minister , Yoshiro Mori",3,True

 IT IS a country that once felt great and proud, and now feels rather glum and second-rate. It is a country that has suffered a decade of economic stagnation, that in the past few years has zig- zagged in and out of recession, and in which unemployment has climbed to worrying levels, having for decades been virtually unknown. It is a country that faces the prospect of political change on its doorstep if the two Koreas continue their thaw, and political challenge in its region if China continues its growth. But it is also a country whose banks and life insurance companies, repositories of much of the nation's savings, look either weak or plain insolvent. That, in turn, makes it a place that could be knocked flat on its back if there were to be some sort of worldwide economic downturn, particularly one originating in the United States, the biggest single market for the country's exports.
 The country is, of course, Japan. To any political analyst with a sense of history, the circumstances just outlined should make Japan look a perfect candidate for some sort of extreme political change. Yet few seem to take such a prospect seriously, particularly inside Japan itself. The country has been so stable, and docile, since the days of communist demonstrations in the 1950s and wild student punch- ups in the 1960s, that it is hard to imagine anything very lively. It has been ruled virtually by a single party ever since 1955. Its voters have taken every disappointment of the past decade on the chin, becoming apathetic rather than angry. Most likely, things will stay that way. But there is a danger that they will not. And that danger increases the longer the current prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, remains in office, and the longer the country's political paralysis endures.
 The limits to patience
 For a decade, the political establishment has failed to find a way to pull the country out of its economic treacle. In such circumstances, all it would take to open the way to demagogues and other sorts of political faith-healer would be a fresh economic crisis, one harsh enough to make voters fear that treacle was turning into quicksand. And, if the worst really did come to the worst on Wall Street and in the American economy this year, such a crisis could be only months away. Yet Japanese politics stumbles on, in its usual corrupt, complacent and ineffectual way.
 This week an opinion poll in the Mainichi newspaper found that the approval rating for the government led by Mr Mori had fallen to a mere 14%. The main stockmarket index in Tokyo, the Nikkei, is nearing its lowest levels since early 1986, underlining the lack of confidence in Japan's supposed economic recovery, and bringing the many banks that depend on shareholdings for their capital base closer to the brink. New GDP figures released on February 8th suggested that the economy has barely been growing during the past six months. An election for the upper house of the Diet (parliament) is due in July, and the governing coalition, led by Mr Mori's Liberal Democrats, looks destined to suffer a heavy defeat, losing the majority in that chamber which is crucial if it is to get its legislation on to the statute books.
 So is the government contemplating a change of policy, or a change of prime minister, in order to rescue both itself and the country from disaster? There is little sign of it. To a degree, this is not terribly surprising. As wags have said, Mr Mori may be one of the worst Japanese prime ministers in living memory, but his job is nevertheless one of the safest in the country. No one wants to take on this poisoned chalice, at least until after the upper house elections in July. One who tried to do so late last year, a bright reformer called Koichi Kato, proved not bright enough to carry his erstwhile supporters with him, and is now in the political wilderness.
 Probably, after that upper house defeat, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) will at last change its leader, and thus prime minister. It may even choose someone with some vim and vigour, with a bent for reform. But it will make little difference, for with no majority in the Diet, the government will be unable to achieve very much, particularly as many heavyweights in the LDP themselves oppose change. There might be the appearance of renewal, but not the reality of it.
 What needs to happen instead is for this government to be brought down in a vote of confidence, after which elections could be held for both houses of the Diet, or else a new government could be formed. There is little sign of that either, although the opposition parties do have the governing coalition on the ropes over several corruption and campaign-finance scandals. The trouble is that the opposition, too, is far from clean, and not terribly united. The various opposition parties, led by Yukio Hatoyama of the Democratic Party, have talked about running on a unified ticket in July's election, but even that is not yet certain.
 And the alternative? So far, the stirrings are faint. But there are signs of a new, more defensive, more negative sort of nationalism, replacing the proud, more positive sort of recent decades. Calls for protectionism against imports from China are on the rise, despite Japan's huge overall trade surplus, as are pressures for a more hawkish approach to that traditional regional rival (see article). So far, this is all within the normal range of democratic politics and policy discussions. But the risk is rising that Japan will not stay normal forever.

 FRANCIS DRAKE did it, although his game was bowls, and once it was over he sunk the Spanish armada. Yoshiro Mori, Japan's much-abused prime minister, has been less fortunate. When news of a collision, on February 9th, between an American nuclear submarine and a Japanese fishing boat reached Mr Mori, he was enjoying a round of golf. He played on for another three holes and arrived back at his official residence some three hours later. Beset by a weakening economy, a falling stockmarket, assorted scandals and riot within his own ranks, Mr Mori's golfing gaffe has done him more harm. This week, senior officials from New Komeito, which shares power with Mr Mori's Liberal Democratic Party in a three-way coalition, were calling for his head.
 Like the LDP, New Komeito faces an election for Japan's upper house in July. But it must also contest local elections for Tokyo's metropolitan assembly in June. The party is strong in Tokyo. Because it is in bed with the LDP, however, New Komeito's strained reputation for clean politics is coming under daily assault. A campaign-finance scandal involving KSD, a small-business foundation that showered the LDP with money, has already led to the arrest of an LDP politician. A scandal in the foreign ministry, involving a low-level bureaucrat said to have used government money to buy racehorses, is doing yet more damage.
 The gossip in Nagatacho, Tokyo's political district, is that Mr Mori's fate may have been sealed at a meeting between New Komeito and LDP dons in an Azabu restaurant on January 24th. Mr Mori would supposedly be required to announce his resignation, perhaps at the end of February. The annual election for the party's presidency, which decides the prime ministership, would then be brought forward, from September to the party's general meeting on March 13th. With the much-fancied Yohei Kono, the foreign minister, done in by the scandal in his ministry, the main candidates are Ryutaro Hashimoto, a former prime minister who joined Mr Mori's cabinet in December, and Junichiro Koizumi, who heads Mr Mori's faction in the LDP. After some early gains by Mr Hashimoto, Mr Koizumi now seems to be inching ahead.
 The difficulty will be persuading Mr Mori to leave. The KSD mess may lead to the arrest of other LDP politicians. The foreign- ministry scandal may claim the scalp of Mr Kono. Mr Mori's tax position is not entirely clear. Yet nothing seems to penetrate his leathery hide. He seems still to enjoy life, especially away from Tokyo. Next time he plays a round, he may be tempted to leave his mobile phone behind.","  Japan

 A JAPANESE novelist, Ryu Murakami, talking to foreign journalists this week, sought to explain why the deeply unpopular prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, has survived for so long. He is like a drunken Japanese father who has fallen asleep, said Mr Murakami. When he wakes up he tells his family he is doing his best, then falls asleep again. He is ignorant and insensitive, but not vicious. So the Japanese ""family has no choice but to accept him, with a wry smile, mixed with disgust.""
 For those less familiar with the workings of the larger Japanese family, Mr Mori's longevity does seem odd. An opinion poll this week by the Asahi newspaper suggested just 9% of voters support Mr Mori's cabinet. In the post-war years only the corrupt Noboru Takeshita, who was felled by scandal in 1989, ended up more unpopular.
 Along with Mr Murakami's novelish view, there is the matter of politics. The main opposition leader, Yukio Hatoyama, has had many opportunities to boot out Mr Mori and his party, the Liberal Democrats (LDP). Yet no matter how many scandals, gaffes and blunders Mr Mori tosses its way, the opposition makes no progress. Indeed the fortunes of Mr Hatoyama's own party, the Democrats, are at least as miserable as the LDP's.
 One reason is the bouffanted Mr Hatoyama himself. He comes from a famous political family. His grandfather was Japan's first prime minister after the second world war. His father served in the upper house. Yet the Hatoyama political stock is in decline. Few people see him as suitable for the top job. There is talk that, were there a snap general election, he might even lose his seat.
 Mr Hatoyama has other personal failings. Grandfather and father were pillars of the LDP-dominated conservative political establishment. Hatoyama junior himself began his political career with the LDP, quitting the party in 1993 when it fell from power. Although now in opposition, he is associated with Japan's ruling elite, the same elite that has mismanaged the economy, failed to clean up the banks and amassed public debt of 660 trillion ($5.7 trillion). In national politics, Mr Hatoyama vows never to join hands with the LDP. As he admits, however, his party jumps into bed with the enemy in local elections. Understandably, voters see the Democrats as part of Japan's problem, not the way out. Many are turning their backs on mainstream politics altogether.
 The Democrats' policy platform looks wobbly. They have strong ideas about shrinking the budget deficit. On other burning issues, such as telecoms deregulation and cleaning up the banks, they are vague. This is not surprising. The party contains a broad array of political forces, from free-market liberals to die-hard socialists. Mr Hatoyama recently threw his weight behind revision of Japan's war- renouncing constitution, only to be shouted down by the small, but noisy, group of pacifists that bedevils the party's foreign-policy plans.
 With no shared ideology, the Democrats seem incapable of offering voters an uplifting alternative to conservative, bureaucrat-led rule in Japan, be it a variant of European socialism, American liberalism or even the much-sought third way. ""Maybe we can do a mixture of Thatcherism and Blairism,"" Mr Hatoyama offers limply. In truth, the party only really agrees on the ill effects of the LDP's close relations with the construction industry. So the Democrats push for slashing public works, resulting in bankruptcies among construction firms and millions more out of work; hardly the way to win votes.
 Rejuvenation for the Democrats could come in several guises. One is a change at the top. It is not impossible for Mr Hatoyama to be replaced by his predecessor, the more charismatic Naoto Kan, who fell from grace in 1999 following revelations of an extramarital affair. Mr Kan's political roots in the citizens' movements of the 1970s would enable him to tap into the growing anti-establishment mood among voters.
 More intriguing is the suggestion that the LDP might soon split, triggering a wider political realignment that would eventually offer voters a genuine choice. A catalyst might be Mr Mori himself. His refusal to resign is putting obvious strains on his coalition government. The LDP's policy chief, Shizuka Kamei, a close supporter of Mr Mori, has a particular reason for wanting him not to quit: the Tokyo prosecutors' special-investigations department has a fat file on Mr Kamei. The clearest fault line in the LDP runs between the Mori- Kamei camp and that of Ryutaro Hashimoto, a former prime minister, which is becoming more and more agitated about Mr Mori's unpopularity as the summer's upper-house elections draw nearer.
 There are other ways in which Japanese politics could be reshaped. Some politicians call for a grand coalition. Others want parties to divide along generational lines, with younger politicians from the Democrats and the LDP uniting under some sort of ""progressive"" banner. But voters who have waited since 1993 for politicians to make up their minds, are losing patience. It can happen in the closest of families.","  A weak opposition helps to keep Yoshiro Mori in power

 THIS might, just might, be a turning-point for the crisis at Japan's banks. Just as everyone was beginning to think the banks would stagger along half-dead for ever, a trio of powers has emerged- -and it seems to be bent on real reform. In a striking break with the past, the Financial Services Agency (FSA), the Bank of Japan (BOJ), and the Keidanren, the powerful group representing business interests, have all reached an understanding. As early as next month, a broad set of financial and structural reforms to clean up the banks and their borrowers could be set out.
 Hakuo Yanagisawa, the minister in charge of financial affairs, is leading the attack. This week he demanded that banks write off their bad loans rather than just set aside provisions to cover potential losses. That practice often understates bad loans, which have worsened at many banks, leading to a second round of losses. Mr Yanagisawa has also urged banks to speed up their bad-loan disposals. Banks have ditched some 70 trillion ($620 billion) of non-performing loans over the past ten years; that much and more still sits on their books.
 If banks get more serious about excising bad debts, many will end up in the red when they next close their books. Mr Yanagisawa has indicated that as long as they show they are serious about cleaning up, then the FSA will tolerate this. In turn, the central bank, a long-time advocate of wholesale bank reform, is also ready to help, by setting up a mechanism to provide needed liquidity to cash- strapped banks.
 Many weak, indebted borrowers would be driven out of business should the banks start writing off bad debts and cutting credit lines. That is why the Keidanren's support for painful reform is startling, if welcome. Its chairman, Takashi Imai, conceded this week for the first time that pain, at least in the short term, was necessary to revive corporate fortunes. ""Unless some of the players jostling around [in the corporate sector] leave the field,"" he said, ""we won't be able to shake off this unhealthy deflation.""
 There is little doubt that the weakness of the stockmarkets, which are hovering close to a 15-year low, has prompted the latest flurry of reforming zeal. But whether banks can be cajoled into acting is still unclear. With luck, they will grab this opportunity to clean up their books. After all, most are already being pushed to the brink by huge bankruptcies, actual or pending, such the collapse of Phoenix Resort, a resort operator, which failed on February 19th with 270 billion of liabilities. If they fail to act, the FSA could use the threat of stricter inspections, for one, to prod them.
 Dealing with the fallout in the corporate sector will be complex. Some of the weaker bits, such as the construction and retailing sectors, will need some long-term strategies mapped out to cope with unemployment and retraining before they can be trimmed. To this end, Mr Yanagisawa has joined hands with the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. If he can co-operate with these ministries, which have always fiercely protected their industries, then he will indeed have performed a miracle.
 Mr Yanagisawa has already accomplished a good deal since he was appointed minister (for the second time) last December. He still has a long way to go. For starters, he must explain the nitty-gritty of his reforms, and how they will be carried out. One issue is how the banks are to write off their bad loans. There are several ways this could be done. Simply to forgive debt would raise questions of moral hazard, inviting companies to take wild risks on the assumption that they would be bailed out. Selling bad loans to third parties in the market for distressed debt would help banks, but would leave the problems of the corporate sector unresolved. One solution might be to split companies into good bits, which survive, and bad bits, which are got rid of.
 Another matter which has not yet been addressed is the issue of management responsibility. The managers that got banks into this mess are still at their desks, and it is hard to see how revived banks can prosper in future under such a benighted lot. Furthermore, Mr Yanagisawa's assumption that banks will not need another injection of public funds in order to survive these massive write-offs may also prove mistaken.
 The biggest risk is that Mr Yanagisawa may not be around to push through his reforms. Cutting off credit lines and forcing companies to go bust would meet with a deal of opposition, not least from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Yoshiro Mori, the prime minister, gets more unpopular by the day. Mr Mori, a pork-barrel politician, is unlikely to back full-scale bank reform in his present, vulnerable state. Yet should he go, there are no guarantees that Mr Yanagisawa will be asked to stay on to complete the job.","  Bank reform in Japan

Cutting off credit lines and forcing companies to go bust would meet with a deal of opposition , not least from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) .

 President George Bush unveiled his $1.9 trillion budget for fiscal year 2002 to Congress, with promises to cut taxes and spend more on health and education. He suggested that taxes could be reduced by $1.6 trillion in the next decade, which would help stimulate the economy, and that over half of the $3.4 trillion national debt could be paid off. Democrats complained that the rich would benefit most from the budget.

 SIR--English appears to be the logical language of choice in many parts of the world; except, ironically, America (""English is still on the march"", February 24th). Bill Clinton, when president, signed an executive order requiring federal agencies to provide translation services to applicants in any language they choose (there are some 300 spoken here). The federally subsidised advocates of bilingual education in some areas are railroading all children with Hispanic surnames into bilingual (ie, Spanish) instruction, regardless of what the parents want.
 I have found the French quite willing to speak English in their country after I have made an effort in their language first. The Germans have quite enough to worry about sorting out their newly mandated but widely unpopular Rechtschreibung. Denglish will happen, just as did Singlish in Singapore and pidgin English all over the Pacific in the second world war.

 SIR--Monolingual Brits are too inclined to take the soft option, perhaps being unwilling or unable to cope with the rigours of learning another language. However, as increasing numbers of non- British Europeans perfect their knowledge of English they become freely able to use their skills to work in Britain (with the advantage of speaking their native language and often a third language). The monolingual British have few chances to work abroad and could become a second-rate choice in their own country.

 SIR--English actually comes from the continent. It is perhaps one of Germany's most successful exports; the later addition of French elements giving it a flavour of luxury. Why then should it not be Europe's lingua franca? Latin, of course, should be adopted as the second language.

 Down the Tube
 SIR--On the disagreement between London's mayor, Ken Livingstone, and the Labour government over the future ownership and management structure of the London Underground, Bagehot (March 3rd) raises an issue that goes far beyond the underground itself. It is whether separation of railway infrastructure and operations can ever be successful. In my opinion it cannot. I served as the first chairman- CEO of Britain's largest rail-freight carrier after privatisation and was forced to deal with vertical separation while striving to improve customer service, reduce costs and manage a large rolling-stock investment programme. In every one of these areas, Railtrack was a major obstacle. In fact, Railtrack, and the management structure that came with it, was by a long way our largest problem.
 More recently, safety, and economic and investment issues created by vertical separation, have caused huge problems on Britain's rail network and there is increasing disenchantment with the industry structure in place. Without huge government subsidies, vertical separation has been a failure everywhere it has been tried. It would be as disastrous for the London Underground to separate management between infrastructure and operations as it has been on the heavy- rail network. I am surprised that the Labour government has become so attached to the failed Tory model of functional separation.

 Democracy in Bahrain
 SIR--The Bahrain National Charter deserves credit for intellectual content and good intentions (""Your kingdom for our right"", February 24th). I believe in the politics of small steps to achieve a desired goal. However, the ""exit light"" for the prime minister is not sufficient in itself to move events in the right direction. The whole administration is loaded with members of the Khalifa family and other appointees with vested interests.
 Unless merit replaces incompetence, corruption and nepotism, the departure of one man will not deliver results. Bahrainis, especially the commercial, professional and intellectual elite, must contribute time and resources towards building a democratic society. Moreover, attracting foreign investors is not only a function of political stability but also of good governance by the civil service and the courts in the application of commercial law.

 SIR--There was no major switch to Pauline Hanson's One Nation party in the state election in Queensland; they gained only around three seats out of a total of 89 (""Australia's populist bites back"", February 24th). There was an unprecedented swing towards the centre- left Labor Party who held government prior to the election. It won 65 seats and crushed the opposing Liberal Party, which was reduced to just two seats.
 Queensland as a whole does not want Mrs Hanson to gain any power. She represents ignorant redneck attitudes and the majority are well aware of this. I hope that this dangerous woman gains no more political ground and no more coverage by the media.

 SIR--You are right to point out that the miserable opposition helps to keep Yoshiro Mori in power (""Being kind to Mr Mori"", February 24th). Yukio Hatoyama is Japan's William Hague; neither are regarded as suitable prime ministers. Despite the view that neither will win the coming elections there is no momentum to oust either of them. Mr Hatoyama, unlike Mr Hague, completely lacks debating skills and does not have any allies, even in his own party.
 Although the Democratic Party has a lot of brilliant young politicians, under the Japanese system it will take many years before they could become leaders. I am worried that Japan will sink before they come through, or that they will be institutionalised before they are allowed to come to the fore.

Since the beginning of the 1990s, when growth stalled, the politicians have drawn up no fewer than 13 rescue packages. None has had any lasting effect save the creation of a mountain of public debt, prompting the finance minister to say this week that Japan's public finances were ""quite near a state of collapse"". Plans to rescue Japan's banks have come and gone, and the banks look as sickly as ever. The stockmarket gets fresh policies for its reinvigoration every year, yet share prices keep falling. Recently, the government has been making new efforts to shore up the economy, with not one set of emergency measures but three, two of which were due to be revealed on March 9th.
 The government's latest initiatives are at least an improvement on what has gone before. The debate began with talk of using Japan's vast post-office savings to prop up the stockmarket: the authorities might use them to buy shares directly--a return to the notorious ""price-keeping operations"" of the early 1990s. But these crude methods no longer find favour with the public, and have been dropped. Instead, there are plans to broaden demand by giving tax incentives to individual investors, just 7% of whose money is invested in the stockmarket, much less than in, say, America or Britain.
 Those who grumble that such policies treat the symptoms not the disease may be encouraged by the second set of measures, which aims to tackle the banks. One of the many weaknesses of the effort to clean up the banks has been the futile attempt to do it painlessly. This has merely prolonged their agony and that of their borrowers in the building, property and retail industries. The government's new policy looks more brutal: there will be a full disposal of bad debts by next March.
 This is sure to do something nasty to the economy, which is already weak. One bank, Goldman Sachs, guesses that the government's plans for the banks would shave a full 1.5% off economic growth and put more than 300,000 people out of work. So the central bank, the Bank of Japan, stands ready with a third economic initiative: easier money. This could involve cutting interest rates, driving the yen lower, or buying government bonds, land or other assets.
 One reason for the multiplicity of measures is the traditional desire for a consensual approach, which the incumbent prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, has tried but failed to change. It means that policies emerge messily in public rather than being put together neatly in private. Decisions take too long, especially on urgent problems such as the banks and the economy, which has weakened dramatically in the past few weeks.
 The consensual approach also means that everyone has a go at policymaking, with unpredictable effects. The policies to support the stockmarket, for instance, come from Mr Mori's party, the Liberal Democrats (LDP). The banking initiative is from the cabinet, although not from Mr Mori himself but one of his ministers, Hakuo Yanagisawa. The Bank of Japan, meanwhile, wants to support Mr Yanagisawa with looser monetary policy, but, like everyone else, is unsure about the LDP's attitudes to the plan, and so is merely hinting at its intentions. Meanwhile, the banks themselves are pouring cold water on the whole idea. Mr Mori has a new council under his direct control to co-ordinate such policy matters. Officials at the Bank of Japan say it is not working as it should.
 The confusion all stems from one basic problem: a lack of leadership. It was clear from the start of his administration that Mr Mori was not cut out to lead. Despite comfortably surviving a vote of no confidence in parliament this week, his third in less than a year, the poor man may soon be returned to the backbenches. Reports suggest he may at last have come round to the idea of resigning, perhaps next week.
 Mr Mori's exit would probably provide short-term relief to the stockmarket. With him would go Shizuka Kamei, the LDP's policy chief, whose batty ideas do most to discredit the government's policies at the moment. Each of Mr Mori's three or four potential successors, meanwhile, offers something to cheer the market, whether it be a better grip on the party or a fresh idea about reform. But there are no obvious leaders who could get the government's grand economic plans off the drawing-board at last. In the meantime, more emergency packages seem likely.","  IT IS hardly surprising that the Japanese have become wary of their government 's efforts to revive the economy .

 IN HIS pre-election budget, Gordon Brown's objective was self- evident: to ensure victory for Labour at the polls. But achieving this was not so straightforward. The chancellor of the exchequer needed to please key groups of voters without letting slip his and Labour's hard-won reputation as a trusted steward of the nation's finances. Too big a give-away and Mr Brown could alienate both business and an electorate grown cynical with electioneering budgets. While tilting a little far towards crowd-pleasing, the chancellor just managed to keep his balance.
 Fittingly for someone recently married, his budget measures were a mixture of something old and something new--if not something borrowed, something blue. Despite its well-trailed contents, Mr Brown still had some surprises ready. The biggest was yet higher public- spending allocations: a total of 650m ($950m) more a year on hospitals and schools over the next three years. Mr Brown also unveiled a bonus for newborn babies on top of the children's tax credit. The bonus will be worth up to 10 a week for half a million families when it starts in 2002-03. In addition to these new measures, the chancellor confirmed ""old"" ones that he had already outlined in the pre-budget report in November, subject to consultation and so not yet included in the Treasury's overall forecasts for the public finances. As expected, motorists will pay 2p per litre less in duty for ultra-low sulphur (ULS) petrol and 3p less for ULS diesel.
 Mr Brown designed his budget to mobilise two principal groups of voters. The first lot were Labour's ""heartland"" voters--traditional but disillusioned Labour supporters across the country that party strategists fear may not turn out to vote in crucial marginal constituencies. Mr Brown reinforced the government's credentials with this group through a healthy 5 a week increase in the working families' tax credit and higher payments to families on income support. He re-emphasised the impact of measures already taken, such as the concessions to pensioners made last November. He said that 7.5m pensioners will now pay no tax at all or tax at just 10%. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the households that will benefit most from the budget are the poorest ones (see chart)-- in line with the effects of the chancellor's first four budgets.
 But Mr Brown also had to think of Middle England. The chancellor knew it was essential to look after Worcester Woman and Essex Man, those archetypal voters that helped Labour to win the election in 1997. Labour has to retain the support of these lower middle- and skilled working-class voters if it is to win another thumping majority, explains Roger Mortimore of MORI, a polling organisation. With his rhetorical appeal to rewarding ""hard-working families,"" Gordon Brown duly sought to woo these voters with the extra spending on education and health. In addition, they will benefit from the 300 widening of the lower-rate 10% income tax band.
 Middle-income families will also gain from the children's tax credit, most of whose impact does not show up in the chart since it was not a new budget measure. The chancellor did announce, however, that the children's tax credit would be more generous, bringing down income tax for 5m families by up to 10 rather than 8.50 a week.
 Prudence forsaken?
 Shortly before the budget, the International Monetary Fund warned Mr Brown not to make ""significant new spending commitments or tax cuts"". Altogether the cost of the measures the chancellor announced, including the decision to carry forward 1 billion of underspending by government departments this year into 2001-02, came to 5.3 billion or 0.5% of GDP. That sounds significant, but it includes the 2 billion cost of ""old"" concessions flagged in November's pre-budget report (but not included in the projections). Whether a package of new measures costing 3.3 billion is ""significant"" can be debated. What is clear is that the total relaxation in policy since November is substantial, since the pre-budget report also included a 2.6 billion give-away for 2001-02.
 However, Mr Brown argued that he had chosen ""the prudent course for Britain"". He said that the budget conformed to his two fiscal rules: borrowing only to invest and keeping debt at a sustainable level. Looking forward, the government will run big surpluses on the current budget. Net public debt will fall in 2001-02 to 30% of GDP and stay around that level for the next few years.
 The Treasury argues that the budget should be assessed by comparing the fiscal stance in 2001-02 and beyond with what was planned in last year's budget. By this yardstick, Mr Brown is now projecting a slightly tighter fiscal stance for the coming financial year--a surplus of 6 billion rather than the 5 billion forecast a year ago. The fiscal stance is also slightly tighter for 2002-03 and subsequent years. This reflects the far bigger surplus of 16.4 billion the government now expects to run this year--over 10 billion more than it forecast last March. Income-tax revenues have overshot by 6 billion while spending on social-security benefits and debt interest has undershot by 2 billion. The Treasury now expects the structural improvement in income-tax receipts in 2000-01 to continue, although this will be partially offset by the cost of the more generous lower-rate income-tax band and children's tax credit. It has also pencilled in even bigger savings of 6 billion in debt interest and social security next year before any offsetting effects from budgetary measures.
 But the government's two fiscal rules are useful rules of thumb rather than master guides. The golden rule of borrowing only to invest, drawn up when deficits appeared endemic, offers little help when you are running big surpluses. And judging budgets by the yardstick of earlier forecasts says more about the fallibility of those predictions than it does about the thrust of fiscal policy.
 It is certainly true that the budgetary stance has been much tighter this year than the Treasury expected, which in turn leaves the fiscal stance next year slightly tighter than predicted last March. But what matters now is the change that will occur between this year and next. The Treasury forecasts that the public-sector surplus (adjusted for the economic cycle) will fall from 1.4% of GDP in 2000-01 to 0.3% in 2001-02 (see chart). That is a big fiscal relaxation by any standard.
 In effect, the fiscal easing planned for the financial year now ending has been deferred to the year starting in April. But there is undeniably a big difference from the position last year, when the IMF described the budget as ""regrettably pro-cyclical"". The British economy was then gathering speed, whereas it is now threatened by the American slowdown. Arguably this budget could be described as fortuitously anti-cyclical. In that, as in so much of his time at the Treasury, the chancellor has been lucky."," The chancellor walked a fine line between electioneering and prudence in his fifth budget. He just managed to retain his balance
 IN HIS pre-election budget, Gordon Brown's objective was self- evident: to ensure victory for Labour at the polls. But achieving this was not so straightforward. The chancellor of the exchequer needed to please key groups of voters without letting slip his and Labour's hard-won reputation as a trusted steward of the nation's finances. Too big a give-away and Mr Brown could alienate both business and an electorate grown cynical with electioneering budgets. While tilting a little far towards crowd-pleasing, the chancellor just managed to keep his balance.
 Fittingly for someone recently married, his budget measures were a mixture of something old and something new--if not something borrowed, something blue. Despite its well-trailed contents, Mr Brown still had some surprises ready. The biggest was yet higher public- spending allocations: a total of 650m ($950m) more a year on hospitals and schools over the next three years.

But whatever it means, Bagehot feels a growing compassion for the Conservative leader, William Hague. The poor man seems incapable of getting it right. Last weekend he gave what was supposed to be a final, rousing, pre-election speech to the depleted forces of Conservatism, who had assembled in Harrogate for their party's spring conference. Most of those present found the speech quite funny. Mr Hague invited his audience to visit the ""foreign land"" that Britain was in danger of becoming after another term of Tony Blair. The horrors he enumerated were the Royal Mint melting pound coins to make way for the euro, the chancellor returning from Brussels with orders to raise taxes, the jail doors opening to release criminals early, fuel taxes rising, hospitals cancelling operations, the Dome still for sale, Peter Mandelson back in the cabinet for a fourth time, the Liberal Democrats still on the edge of their seats convinced that Mr Blair's promised referendum on voting reform was just around the corner. He also, in a separate bit of his speech, promised that a Conservative government would sort out Britain's ""asylum crisis"". It would assess claims within weeks rather than years, and immediately deport asylum-seekers whose claims were unfounded.
 This speech pleased the Daily Mail well enough. But many other commentators coupled the ""foreign land"" bit of the speech to the asylum bit and then to the Eurosceptical bit and so detected a single, odious, train of Hagueite thought. The Conservative leader, they concluded, was guilty of ""base nationalism"" (the Independent), ""playing the race card from the bottom of the deck"" (the Times) and displaying hostility to the EU of a ""breadth he's never shown before"" (the Guardian). As after earlier controversial speeches on policing or asylum, Mr Hague had to fend off accusations that he was a racist. But he could not claim this time to be surprised. Part of his speech - -""talk about crime and they call you reactionary; talk about asylum and they call you racist...""--was a defiant peroration against political correctness. In other words, he understood the reaction he would provoke, and still judged the provocation to be worthwhile.
 That was a mistake. No liberal-minded person would deny that Mr Hague is entitled to explain his policy on asylum. But he chose the wrong occasion. The last speech before his last party conference before the election was where Mr Hague was expected to set out his biggest ideas: his indictment of Blairism and his vision of what now made Conservatism distinctive and alluring. Neither half of this job was going to be easy. How to indict a Labour government that has hardly put a foot wrong on the economy? How to make the old Conservatives look alluring when New Labour has filched so many Conservative ideas?
 Before going to Harrogate, Mr Hague had seen one arrow after another bounce harmlessly off Tony Blair's shield. The Tories had hoped the Hinduja passport affair would make the government look sleazy. And so it did: more than 70% of respondents told MORI at the end of January that Peter Mandelson's resignation had damaged the government's reputation. But the same poll found that this had made no difference to people's voting intentions. The Tories hoped that the government would fail to transform public services. It did fail: Mr Blair himself has admitted to raising expectations too high. But the Tories have not yet profited from their expensive campaign on the theme of ""you've paid the taxes, so where are the teachers/doctors/ nurses?"" A MORI poll in January found that voters were disappointed with many aspects of Labour's record on health and schooling. But the same poll found that most voters expected public services to stay the same (45%) or get worse (32%) under the Tories. Astonishingly, neither Mr Hague nor Labour--with its scaremongering posters about 16 billion ($23 billion) of Tory spending ""cuts""--have persuaded voters that the Conservatives would even reduce taxes. According to MORI, most people believe that taxes would either remain at about the same level (43%) or rise (35%) under the Tories.
 So maybe it was desperation that drove Mr Hague to make so much in Harrogate of the Tories' promise to ""give you back your country"". This would consist mainly of fixing a constitution vandalised by Mr Blair, opposing the sovereignty-devouring encroachments of the EU and repatriating some powers already ceded to Brussels. It is a policy that Mr Hague's critics, in his own party and in others, disparage as xenophobic, but that all the polling evidence shows to be popular. A large majority of voters opposes Mr Blair's plan to join the euro. MORI reported last June that more than 60% of British people thought joining would mean giving up their ""national identity"". But suspicion of the EU goes much deeper even than that. A few polls have shown small majorities in favour of leaving the EU altogether. A December poll by ICM, administered in seven EU countries, showed that Britons alone opposed the idea of electing the EU president directly. They are less willing than any other EU citizens to call themselves ""European"" and much less trusting of the Union's institutions. Let liberal commentators denounce Mr Hague as a Little Englander: his sceptical line on the EU causes tension in the party but endows it with at least one arrow capable of penetrating Mr Blair's armour.
 Which, paradoxically, is why Mr Hague's little sally on asylum- seekers was a mistake. British Euroscepticism stems from many different motives: technical worries about monetary union, concern about sovereignty, a belief in the resilience of Britain's own political institutions. But at some point along this spectrum, the respectable motives shade into less respectable ones, and finally into the petty loathing of foreigners that Mr Hague is accused of pandering to in Harrogate. By making it easier for enemies to impugn his motives, he may have blunted his sharpest weapon.","  LIKE Conservatism itself , "" compassionate conservatism "" is a difficult idea to pin down .

George Bush wants to team up more closely with America's allies, Japan and South Korea, rather than spend time, as Bill Clinton did, chasing an illusory ""strategic partnership"" with China. But early plans to accord a symbolic first Asian handshake to Japan's Yoshiro Mori, as ally-in-chief in the region, fell victim to the hapless Mr Mori's political troubles. That honour then fell last week to South Korea's Kim Dae Jung. Next week the handshake diplomacy repeats itself as farce. Though in deeper trouble than ever, Mr Mori is to be rushed in to see Mr Bush a few steps ahead of China's foreign-policy mandarin, Qian Qichen. That puts China in its place (see article).
 Up to a point. Whether as partners or competitors--as the Bush team would more accurately have it--America and China have a testy agenda to work through, from China's troubling proliferation habits and patchy human-rights record, to America's missile-defence plans and its arms sales to Taiwan. Rows already loom, leaving Mr Bush and China little time for small talk. But Mr Bush can at least be sure of his allies: an enfeebled Japan absorbed with its own troubles, and a South Korea preoccupied with North Korea.
 Anyway, weighty Japan and rising China are not alternative choices around which America can construct its Asia strategy. Relations with both will need careful tending.
 Despite its current fragility, Japan is America's friend and Asia's leading regional power: its economy is second only to America's and it is Asia's most generous supporter of poorer countries (including China) both near and far. This helps a lot, since, unlike Europe, Asia is not criss-crossed with stability- preserving alliances. Yet, despite their own strengthened security alliance, in a conflict that drew in America's forces, Japan's pacifist-sounding constitution would still have Asia's best equipped armed forces doing little but holding America's coat and carting away its casualties. Mr Bush needs to persuade a reluctant Japan to share more of Asia's military burdens. It might help if he and China, which might someday be tempted to test America militarily, can get off to a reassuring start, by keeping talking, not shouting at each other.
 In other words, while Mr Bush's problem with Japan will be to manage their co-operation, with China it will be to manage their competition. China does not always make that easy. Despite the changes that have so dramatically opened up its economy in recent decades, China is still, after all, a communist dictatorship. It is unhappy with the territorial status quo in the region and occasionally kicks out at it, in the South China Sea and over Taiwan, both of which it claims as its own. It wants respect as a great power, and tends to see America as the chief threat to its ambitions.
 Hence the importance of Mr Qian's visit to Washington. Some long- standing irritations between the two--over human rights, trade and proliferation issues--can probably now be more safely managed on the basis of agreements Mr Clinton negotiated: the conditions for China's accession to the World Trade Organisation; its published promises to limit nuclear and, most recently, missile exports. Implementation will be tough. With China it always is. But at least there are some agreed rules, and others, including Japan and Europe, can help America keep up the pressure for China to stick to them.
 There are no such accepted ground rules to help deal with the two issues that could most easily pitch America and China into a new crisis: Taiwan and Mr Bush's plans for missile defences. The two are linked closely in China's mind, since it worries that America's plans for national defences could undermine China's small nuclear deterrent, while less capable regional ones developed to help defend, say, American troops in Japan, could also someday be used to protect Taiwan from China. The issues are linked in other ways too, since China's own behaviour--helping the missile ambitions of dodgy regimes and firing off its own missiles when it wants to intimidate Taiwan's voters--has helped drive the search for new defences. Yet both problems offer opportunities, not just dangers, if the two sides will reach for them.
 One China, two problems
 For years China, Taiwan and America could all agree on one thing: that there is but one China. This allowed them to disagree in relative safety about what sort of China it might be: one country, two systems, as China has long proposed; or one nation, two states, as many Taiwanese might now prefer. But the ruse works less well now that Taiwan is a democracy, and its voters can reject China's increasing insistence that the only alternative to negotiated unity is forced unity. America, committed to help Taiwan defend itself, has a dangerous balance to keep. But it could be made less dangerous.
 Mr Clinton leaned a little too far China's way. His mention of the ""three noes"" for the first time on Chinese soil in 1998--no two Chinas, no independence for Taiwan, and no support for its membership in organisations of sovereign states--both offended Taiwan and emboldened China. Mr Bush needs to draw the line more clearly, making the three noes five: no use of force by China to settle the issue and no political deal without the support of Taiwan's people.
 But at the same time he needs to temper the enthusiasm of his pro- Taiwan lobby for selling all the arms Taiwan can buy. Ultimately, Taiwan's security depends on America's support, rather than on any particular ship, missile or radar. As a way of exploring new possibilities for restraint on both sides, Mr Bush could usefully strike off next month's arms list items like America's top-of-the- line Aegis anti-missile system. Even Aegis could not defend Taiwan against a determined assault from China's missiles, and holding back gives Mr Bush extra room to explore a new pattern of mutual restraint with China. If China will not play, he can change his mind.
 If America and China could avoid an early clash over Taiwan, they just might find a way to defuse the missile defence issue. Taiwan's interest in missile defences will decline only as China's threats to the island subside, and only China can do anything about that. But China's concerns about its own small nuclear deterrent offer America and China the opportunity to open a stabilising new dialogue.
 Mr Bush is determined to explore defences. China can go on shrilly opposing them, and make good its threat to tear up the few international weapons-limiting agreements it has signed. Or it could sit down with America and work out a stable balance between any future missile defences and the future size of China's own long- range nuclear arsenal. China this week signalled an encouraging readiness to talk first and keep its powder dry. The handshakes over, Mr Bush and Mr Qian will have plenty to talk about.","  IF ONLY Asia 's problems were as easy to rearrange as the White House visitors book .

 MARCH is Asia month in Washington. Last week, South Korea's president, Kim Dae Jung, paid a visit, and this weekend one of China's most senior officials, Qian Qichen, flies there for what will almost certainly be the highest-level contact between America and China until late this year. Mr Qian, who is now a deputy prime minister, served for many years as China's foreign minister, and now oversees his country's relations with the outside world and its policy towards Taiwan. In the course of a week he will see everyone in Washington who matters to China, from the president down.
 Yet already there is awkwardness. Japan's prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, will also be in town. Although he is so deeply unpopular at home that he will soon step down after barely a year in office, Mr Mori is nevertheless being whisked over, at American insistence, so that he can visit the White House ahead of Mr Qian. This will underline to the Chinese that the new administration is serious about tilting its priorities away from China and back towards its old ally, Japan.
 It is a delicate moment. Less than two months into the job, the new American administration is still reviewing its Asia policies from top to bottom. The balance between moderates like Colin Powell, the secretary of state, and hawks--his own deputy, Richard Armitage, Donald Rumsfeld, the defence secretary, and Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser--has yet to be struck. Not least, nobody knows how President George Bush's mind works on the subject.
 During the presidential election campaign Mr Bush made much political capital out of the Clinton administration's friendliness with China, encapsulated in the phrase ""strategic partnership"". The idea, first expressed by Bill Clinton and Jiang Zemin, China's president, at their 1997 Washington summit, was developed a year later when Mr Clinton went to China, the first visit by an American president since the Tiananmen massacre in 1989. Mr Bush has rejected the term; instead, he describes China as a ""strategic competitor"".
 More aggressive attitudes
 The president has yet to spell out precisely what that phrase means. Looked at one way, it is a statement of the obvious. America and China have a raft of deep disagreements on, among other things, Taiwan, human rights, intervention, missile defence and the stealing of nuclear secrets. Although they share some interests, including an aversion to fundamentalist Islam and, increasingly, a commitment to free trade, on most strategic issues China and America are still on opposite sides. To talk of ""strategic partnership"", on this interpretation, is misleading at best, dangerous at worst. Mr Bush's phrasing could be nothing more than a useful rhetorical corrective.
 Or does something more substantial lie behind it? The use of a loaded term like ""competitor"" can, after all, be self-fulfilling, and there have always been powerful lobbies, both in China and America, which believe that the two countries are destined to be enemies, perhaps even to fight. Over the past two decades, China's relations with America have seen some warm spells and many icy patches. Tiananmen marked the coolest point, but there have been others: in 1993, when China blamed America for its failure to win the 2000 Olympics; in 1996, when China lobbed missiles close to Taiwan and America sent two aircraft-carrier battle groups to signal its concern; and in 1999, when NATO aircraft bombed China's embassy in Belgrade. Could Chinese-American relations be heading for another freeze?
 There is some reason to think so, reckons David Shambaugh, a professor at George Washington University. He foresees, within the next few months, a series of spats between the world's most powerful nation and the one that aims to succeed it. ""This is a government with a very different view of China,"" he says. ""It sees China as a rising power that needs to be bounded and checked.""
 In recent days, that assessment has seemed shrewd. On March 6th, China announced an increase of 18% in its defence budget, the biggest for 20 years. This shattered the target set by the five-year plan that has just expired, which called for increases in real terms of 10% year-on-year. Boosts of that size were already quite enough to worry China's neighbours, especially Taiwan, which knows that most of China's new weapons will point in its direction.
 Other rumblings have also been heard. In its most recent defence white paper, published last October, China clearly identified America as its principal threat. The deputy chief of staff of the Chinese army has given warning since then that ""the forces of war, hegemony and power-politics are increasing"". In July, China and Russia are expected to sign a Treaty of Friendship, partly to thumb their noses at America: it will be their first since the Sino-Soviet split in the late 1950s. China constantly tries to keep America out of regional forums by supporting Asian groupings, which exclude it, rather than pan-Pacific ones. It has even set up its own version of Davos, at Boao on Hainan island. No Americans were invited.
 China, of course, argues that it is merely responding to American assertiveness--as shown in the Kosovo war, or in recent American defence accords with Mongolia and Kazakhstan, or by the plans to construct a national missile defence (NMD). China fears NMD is squarely aimed at its own limited nuclear arsenal of about 25 missiles, which it has hinted it could use against Los Angeles if America attempted to frustrate an invasion of Taiwan. But to many in Washington and East Asia, China's spending plans smack of escalation. It is against this prickly background that Mr Qian is going to Washington.
 The first public row has already occurred, with America's announcement that it will sponsor a UN resolution later this month condemning China's record on human rights. The second may come during Mr Qian's visit. He wants to secure a state visit by Mr Bush, either before or after the Shanghai meeting of APEC, the 21-nation Asia- Pacific Economic Co-operation group, which is likely to be the first occasion on which Mr Bush and Mr Jiang will meet. APEC is not until November, but Mr Bush will not have completed the rounds of his allies by then, and China will probably be told to wait. This will be taken as a serious snub.
 Other irritants are on the way, such as the fury China will vent on America if Beijing fails to win the 2008 Olympics, or the stormy congressional debate over China's most-favoured-nation trading status (MFN), which is due in May. Despite the agreement on permanent normal trading relations (PNTR) that was passed last year, the annual MFN squabble will not go away until China joins the World Trade Organisation.
 The Taiwan question
 According to Joseph Nye, an old China hand who is also the dean of the Kennedy School at Harvard, these problems ought to be manageable. Mr Nye notes that, so far at least, the disagreements have been rhetorical rather than practical, and that there have been emollient as well as abrasive remarks. For instance, Mr Powell went out of his way to stress America's adherence to the ""one China"" principle, which rules out American recognition of Taiwan. He, and other senior officials, including the vice-president, have insisted that China, though it may be a competitor, is not an adversary, and must not be allowed to become one.
 Yet Taiwan is not so easily dealt with. Every April, in line with the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, the administration announces how it plans to supply Taiwan with the weapons it needs to defend itself. Now that China is vigorously building up its forces, Taiwan wants more and better. It can point in particular to China's deployment of M-9 and M-11 short-range ballistic missiles on the Fujian coast (300 now, compared with about 20 a decade ago); to the stationing in Fujian of squadrons of SU-27 Russian-built fighters; and to China's acquisition of Russian Sovremennyy-class destroyers.
 This year, Taiwan wants PAC-3 upgraded Patriot anti-missile systems, the JTIDS datalink system to tie its F-16 fighters to its airborne early-warning Hawkeyes, and Kidd-class destroyers with advanced ship-to-air missiles. Above all, it wants Arleigh Burke- class destroyers fitted with Aegis, a battle-management system that picks up incoming ballistic missiles, ships and planes and can track more than 100 targets simultaneously. China, thinks Paul Beaver of the Jane's defence group, would see this as a big step towards setting up a theatre missile defence for Taiwan, perhaps even as a pledge to defend Taiwan in the event of an invasion. China has never ruled out such an invasion as a way of ""reunifying"" its divided territory. America could not risk letting any of its prize equipment fall into Chinese hands.
 What will Taiwan actually get? There is clearly pressure from the Republican right in Congress, as well as the China hawks in the administration, to reverse Mr Clinton's tendency to deny Taiwan the most advanced weaponry for fear of damaging relations with the mainland. Henry Hyde, the Republican who chairs the House International Relations Committee, has already said that ""long- delayed arms sales will be approved"" this time. One insider goes further: ""China is going to be very upset,"" he says.
 Taiwan still looks unlikely to get the Arleigh Burkes: but it will probably be given a package of hardware which offers some of the same capabilities, and which will involve America in much more training of, and help for, Taiwan's armed forces. That, it is said, will be the price for Congress withdrawing the proposed Taiwan Security Enhancement Act, which seeks to make the defence ties even tighter. ""The idea is that the administration will implement the act by executive action,"" says one source. Another possibility, says Bates Gill of the Brookings Institution in Washington, is that Mr Qian will politely be told that if China continues the build-up on its side of the Taiwan Strait, America will consider itself free to supply Taiwan with Aegis.
 How serious a threat?
 China's figures for defence spending seriously underestimate the reality. They exclude army pensions, the cost of running the 600,000- strong People's Armed Police (un-bobbyishly armed with tanks and artillery), and military R&D. The official figure, now raised to $17.2 billion, probably needs to be multiplied by at least three. China's military budget is already comparable to Japan's, and is rising much faster.
 But China has to stretch its money much further than Japan does, not least to the Indian border. India's defence minister cites China, not Pakistan, as India's number-one enemy: a reminder of the fact that China has no allies, and almost no friends. The bulk of China's defence budget will go on increased salaries, leaving perhaps $1 billion a year that can be spent on foreign equipment.
 Taiwan, though, can afford to spend at least twice that, although there are concerns about its ability to use what it has already acquired. The Taiwanese air force has crashed several of its new F- 16s, and needs more practice at submarine-hunting and blockade- breaking with its American destroyers and frigates. But the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London reckons the Chinese air force and army are much less well-trained; China's pilots get few flying hours over water, for fear they will defect.
 Most analysts believe that Taiwan could easily repel a full-scale invasion, even without American help. Missile attacks, however, are another matter. Nothing the Taiwanese can get from America would completely eliminate that threat. China has mostly refrained from sabre-rattling since the election last year of Taiwan's new president, Chen Shui-bian, whose party has always inclined towards Taiwanese independence. But recently there have been growing signs of Chinese irritation at the slow pace of progress towards talks about reunification.
 The Japan card
 The flip side of Mr Bush's ""strategic competition"" with China is a proposed new closeness to Japan. But this, too, is fraught with difficulties. It is not at all certain that Japan is able to take the strain, or even that it is really willing to try.
 Not that the attention is wholly unwelcome. Japan has been smarting for the past few years at what it sees as serious American neglect. Officials were especially disappointed with Mr Clinton's second term in office. When not haranguing the Japanese for economic mismanagement, protectionism or aggravating Asia's economic problems, the Clinton administration was looking past Japan to its new strategic partner, China. In June and July 1998, Mr Clinton spent more than a week there without stopping off to brief the Japanese, the sort of insult not easily forgotten. China received far more praise from the Americans for trying to stem the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98 than Japan did, though Japan spent far more.
 No one can accuse Mr Bush of being neglectful. His administration is peppered with Japan experts, such as Mr Armitage at the State Department, Mr Bush's economic adviser, Larry Lindsey, Torkel Patterson, an adviser on Asia to Ms Rice, and Jim Kelly, who will handle East Asia for Mr Powell. Under Mr Armitage's influence, their inclination is for a much closer relationship with Japan, based on a more effective military alliance.
 This echoes long-standing American calls for Japan to shoulder more of the defence burden in Asia, where America maintains 100,000 troops. Just over 40,000 of these, the largest share, are in Japan. They are heavily concentrated in Okinawa, where they serve as a focus for much anti-American protest.
 Mr Armitage particularly wants Japan to revise its constitution, which renounces war, in order to play a more active role in collective self-defence. He argued this in a bipartisan paper last year, written with Mr Nye (published by the National Institute for Strategic Studies), which is now taken in Asia as a portent of things to come. Strikingly, it warns that ""major war in Europe is inconceivable for at least a generation, but the prospects for conflict in Asia are far from remote."" The aim of the Japan-firsters is nothing less than to turn Japan into an Asian equivalent of Britain: America's most dependable ally and closest associate in a whole region.
 This is not the first time the policy has been tried. It was attempted in Ronald Reagan's second term, but little came of it. George Bush senior attempted a ""global partnership"" with Japan, which fizzled out in the Gulf war. Mr Clinton's 1996 joint declaration on security with Japan, before he began the tilt towards China that culminated in his trip to Tiananmen Square, yielded a new set of defence guidelines that tightened American-Japanese co-operation a bit. But it could not hide the awkward fact that, if America finds itself fighting over Taiwan or South Korea, Japan's 60 destroyers and its 200 or so fighter planes will be constitutionally required to stand idle. It is not even completely certain, some analysts worry, that Japan will allow America to use its own Japanese bases.
 Mr Bush's latest overtures have had a cold reception in Japan. Neglect may be bad, but so is American overfriendliness, especially when Japan is already on edgy terms with China. Chinese posturing in the South China sea, a still-unresolved dispute over the Senkaku islands, a mysterious spate of Chinese naval incursions into Japan's waters, and Japanese resentment at China's alleged lack of gratitude for aid money have added to the unease. Meanwhile, Japan's growing bilateral trade deficit, a historically unprecedented level of unemployment and perennially low growth are fanning a chauvinistic nationalism. China is regularly lashed by conservative Japanese politicians such as Tokyo's governor, Shintaro Ishihara.
 Japanese diplomats also recall that the last time America tried to improve its relations with Japan, in May 1996, China's reaction was volcanic. Japan sees no sense in making an enemy out of its giant neighbour, as America, from a safer distance, sometimes seems inclined to. It is the volatility of America's relations with China that upsets the Japanese most. ""The nightmare for Japan is a deterioration in relations between China and America,"" notes Yoichi Funabashi, a leading commentator. ""Then we would be forced to choose. America's Japan-first policy is not at all what we want. It broke down before. Japan cannot endure such pressure.""
 Still, there is some shift. Ten years ago, even the mention of constitutional reform was taboo. Now, a parliamentary panel has begun to prepare some of the groundwork, although its work is likely to take many years. Signs of a new national assertiveness are everywhere: in 1999, for instance, the government gave official standing to the national flag and anthem. A growing number of people want Japan to become a ""normal"" country, free from the restraints that have made it, since the war, such a passive figure on the world stage.
 But whether this really adds up to a confident, outward-looking Japan, politically and economically ready to play a more active role alongside America in Asia, is another matter. For a start, no one in Japan has much time for foreign-policy objectives just now. The economy, having only just clawed its way up from recession, is back on the brink. The stockmarket is at a 16-year low; the finance minister speaks of ""collapse"". The ruling Liberal Democratic Party is weaker than ever. It is looking for a new leader, its ninth in ten years, and many, even within the party itself, believe it is only an election away from political oblivion.
 The danger with a Japan-first policy is that Mr Bush, like so many of his predecessors, will soon grow frustrated with the limitations imposed by Japan's domestic politics. That has always been the pattern in the past. Another striking pattern is that new presidents all begin by talking tough about China, and all end up mesmerised by the dragon. Mr Clinton, after all, came into office promising to end his predecessor's policy of ""coddling dictators"". Yet he ended up in ""strategic partnership"" with them, and snubbing Japan. It would be no surprise to see that happen again.","  The rise of China , the weakness of Japan , and a new spirit of robustness in Washington are prompting new tensions among the Pacific 's three great powers

This will underline to the Chinese that the new administration is serious about tilting its priorities away from China and back towards its old ally , Japan . 
  It is a delicate moment . Less than two months into the job , the new American administration is still reviewing its Asia policies from top to bottom . The balance between moderates like Colin Powell , the secretary of state , and hawks -- his own deputy , Richard Armitage , Donald Rumsfeld , the defence secretary , and Condoleezza Rice , the national security adviser -- has yet to be struck . Not least , nobody knows how President George Bush 's mind works on the subject . 
  During the presidential election campaign Mr Bush made much political capital out of the Clinton administration 's friendliness with China , encapsulated in the phrase "" strategic partnership "" . The idea , first expressed by Bill Clinton and Jiang Zemin , China 's president , at their 1997 Washington summit , was developed a year later when Mr Clinton went to China , the first visit by an American president since the Tiananmen massacre in 1989 . Mr Bush has rejected the term ; instead , he describes China as a "" strategic competitor "" . 
  More aggressive attitudes 
  The president has yet to spell out precisely what that phrase means . Looked at one way , it is a statement of the obvious . America and China have a raft of deep disagreements on , among other things , Taiwan , human rights , intervention , missile defence and the stealing of nuclear secrets . Although they share some interests , including an aversion to fundamentalist Islam and , increasingly , a commitment to free trade , on most strategic issues China and America are still on opposite sides . To talk of "" strategic partnership "" , on this interpretation , is misleading at best , dangerous at worst . Mr Bush 's phrasing could be nothing more than a useful rhetorical corrective . 
  Or does something more substantial lie behind it ? The use of a loaded term like "" competitor "" can , after all , be self - fulfilling , and there have always been powerful lobbies , both in China and America , which believe that the two countries are destined to be enemies , perhaps even to fight . Over the past two decades , China 's relations with America have seen some warm spells and many icy patches . Tiananmen marked the coolest point , but there have been others : in 1993 , when China blamed America for its failure to win the 2000 Olympics ; in 1996 , when China lobbed missiles close to Taiwan and America sent two aircraft - carrier battle groups to signal its concern ; and in 1999 , when NATO aircraft bombed China 's embassy in Belgrade . Could Chinese - American relations be heading for another freeze ? 
  There is some reason to think so , reckons David Shambaugh , a professor at George Washington University . He foresees , within the next few months , a series of spats between the world 's most powerful nation and the one that aims to succeed it . "" This is a government with a very different view of China , "" he says . "" It sees China as a rising power that needs to be bounded and checked . "" 
  In recent days , that assessment has seemed shrewd . On March 6th , China announced an increase of 18 % in its defence budget , the biggest for 20 years . This shattered the target set by the five - year plan that has just expired , which called for increases in real terms of 10 % year - on - year . Boosts of that size were already quite enough to worry China 's neighbours , especially Taiwan , which knows that most of China 's new weapons will point in its direction . 
  Other rumblings have also been heard . In its most recent defence white paper , published last October , China clearly identified America as its principal threat . The deputy chief of staff of the Chinese army has given warning since then that "" the forces of war , hegemony and power - politics are increasing "" . In July , China and Russia are expected to sign a Treaty of Friendship , partly to thumb their noses at America : it will be their first since the Sino - Soviet split in the late 1950s . China constantly tries to keep America out of regional forums by supporting Asian groupings , which exclude it , rather than pan - Pacific ones . It has even set up its own version of Davos , at Boao on Hainan island . No Americans were invited . 
  China , of course , argues that it is merely responding to American assertiveness -- as shown in the Kosovo war , or in recent American defence accords with Mongolia and Kazakhstan , or by the plans to construct a national missile defence ( NMD ) . China fears NMD is squarely aimed at its own limited nuclear arsenal of about 25 missiles , which it has hinted it could use against Los Angeles if America attempted to frustrate an invasion of Taiwan . But to many in Washington and East Asia , China 's spending plans smack of escalation . It is against this prickly background that Mr Qian is going to Washington . 
  The first public row has already occurred , with America 's announcement that it will sponsor a UN resolution later this month condemning China 's record on human rights . The second may come during Mr Qian 's visit . He wants to secure a state visit by Mr Bush , either before or after the Shanghai meeting of APEC , the 21 - nation Asia- Pacific Economic Co - operation group , which is likely to be the first occasion on which Mr Bush and Mr Jiang will meet . APEC is not until November , but Mr Bush will not have completed the rounds of his allies by then , and China will probably be told to wait . This will be taken as a serious snub . 
  Other irritants are on the way , such as the fury China will vent on America if Beijing fails to win the 2008 Olympics , or the stormy congressional debate over China 's most - favoured - nation trading status ( MFN ) , which is due in May. Despite the agreement on permanent normal trading relations ( PNTR ) that was passed last year , the annual MFN squabble will not go away until China joins the World Trade Organisation . 
  The Taiwan question 
  According to Joseph Nye , an old China hand who is also the dean of the Kennedy School at Harvard , these problems ought to be manageable . Mr Nye notes that , so far at least , the disagreements have been rhetorical rather than practical , and that there have been emollient as well as abrasive remarks . For instance , Mr Powell went out of his way to stress America 's adherence to the "" one China "" principle , which rules out American recognition of Taiwan . He , and other senior officials , including the vice - president , have insisted that China , though it may be a competitor , is not an adversary , and must not be allowed to become one . 
  Yet Taiwan is not so easily dealt with . Every April , in line with the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act , the administration announces how it plans to supply Taiwan with the weapons it needs to defend itself . Now that China is vigorously building up its forces , Taiwan wants more and better . It can point in particular to China 's deployment of M-9 and M-11 short - range ballistic missiles on the Fujian coast ( 300 now , compared with about 20 a decade ago ) ; to the stationing in Fujian of squadrons of SU-27 Russian - built fighters ; and to China 's acquisition of Russian Sovremennyy - class destroyers . 
  This year , Taiwan wants PAC-3 upgraded Patriot anti - missile systems , the JTIDS datalink system to tie its F-16 fighters to its airborne early - warning Hawkeyes , and Kidd - class destroyers with advanced ship - to - air missiles . Above all , it wants Arleigh Burke- class destroyers fitted with Aegis , a battle - management system that picks up incoming ballistic missiles , ships and planes and can track more than 100 targets simultaneously . China , thinks Paul Beaver of the Jane 's defence group , would see this as a big step towards setting up a theatre missile defence for Taiwan , perhaps even as a pledge to defend Taiwan in the event of an invasion . China has never ruled out such an invasion as a way of "" reunifying "" its divided territory . America could not risk letting any of its prize equipment fall into Chinese hands . 
  What will Taiwan actually get ? There is clearly pressure from the Republican right in Congress , as well as the China hawks in the administration , to reverse Mr Clinton 's tendency to deny Taiwan the most advanced weaponry for fear of damaging relations with the mainland . Henry Hyde , the Republican who chairs the House International Relations Committee , has already said that "" long- delayed arms sales will be approved "" this time . One insider goes further : "" China is going to be very upset , "" he says . 
  Taiwan still looks unlikely to get the Arleigh Burkes : but it will probably be given a package of hardware which offers some of the same capabilities , and which will involve America in much more training of , and help for , Taiwan 's armed forces . That , it is said , will be the price for Congress withdrawing the proposed Taiwan Security Enhancement Act , which seeks to make the defence ties even tighter . "" The idea is that the administration will implement the act by executive action , "" says one source . Another possibility , says Bates Gill of the Brookings Institution in Washington , is that Mr Qian will politely be told that if China continues the build - up on its side of the Taiwan Strait , America will consider itself free to supply Taiwan with Aegis . 
  How serious a threat ? 
  China 's figures for defence spending seriously underestimate the reality . They exclude army pensions , the cost of running the 600,000- strong People 's Armed Police ( un - bobbyishly armed with tanks and artillery ) , and military R&D. The official figure , now raised to $ 17.2 billion , probably needs to be multiplied by at least three . China 's military budget is already comparable to Japan 's , and is rising much faster . 
  But China has to stretch its money much further than Japan does , not least to the Indian border . India 's defence minister cites China , not Pakistan , as India 's number - one enemy : a reminder of the fact that China has no allies , and almost no friends . The bulk of China 's defence budget will go on increased salaries , leaving perhaps $ 1 billion a year that can be spent on foreign equipment . 
  Taiwan , though , can afford to spend at least twice that , although there are concerns about its ability to use what it has already acquired . The Taiwanese air force has crashed several of its new F- 16s , and needs more practice at submarine - hunting and blockade- breaking with its American destroyers and frigates . But the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London reckons the Chinese air force and army are much less well - trained ; China 's pilots get few flying hours over water , for fear they will defect . 
  Most analysts believe that Taiwan could easily repel a full - scale invasion , even without American help . Missile attacks , however , are another matter . Nothing the Taiwanese can get from America would completely eliminate that threat . China has mostly refrained from sabre - rattling since the election last year of Taiwan 's new president , Chen Shui - bian , whose party has always inclined towards Taiwanese independence . But recently there have been growing signs of Chinese irritation at the slow pace of progress towards talks about reunification . 
  The Japan card 
  The flip side of Mr Bush 's "" strategic competition "" with China is a proposed new closeness to Japan . But this , too , is fraught with difficulties . It is not at all certain that Japan is able to take the strain , or even that it is really willing to try . 
  Not that the attention is wholly unwelcome . Japan has been smarting for the past few years at what it sees as serious American neglect . Officials were especially disappointed with Mr Clinton 's second term in office . When not haranguing the Japanese for economic mismanagement , protectionism or aggravating Asia 's economic problems , the Clinton administration was looking past Japan to its new strategic partner , China . In June and July 1998 , Mr Clinton spent more than a week there without stopping off to brief the Japanese , the sort of insult not easily forgotten . China received far more praise from the Americans for trying to stem the Asian financial crisis of 1997 - 98 than Japan did , though Japan spent far more . 
  No one can accuse Mr Bush of being neglectful . His administration is peppered with Japan experts , such as Mr Armitage at the State Department , Mr Bush 's economic adviser , Larry Lindsey , Torkel Patterson , an adviser on Asia to Ms Rice , and Jim Kelly , who will handle East Asia for Mr Powell . Under Mr Armitage 's influence , their inclination is for a much closer relationship with Japan , based on a more effective military alliance . 
  This echoes long - standing American calls for Japan to shoulder more of the defence burden in Asia , where America maintains 100,000 troops . Just over 40,000 of these , the largest share , are in Japan . They are heavily concentrated in Okinawa , where they serve as a focus for much anti - American protest . 
  Mr Armitage particularly wants Japan to revise its constitution , which renounces war , in order to play a more active role in collective self - defence . He argued this in a bipartisan paper last year , written with Mr Nye ( published by the National Institute for Strategic Studies ) , which is now taken in Asia as a portent of things to come . Strikingly , it warns that "" major war in Europe is inconceivable for at least a generation , but the prospects for conflict in Asia are far from remote . "" The aim of the Japan - firsters is nothing less than to turn Japan into an Asian equivalent of Britain : America 's most dependable ally and closest associate in a whole region . 
  This is not the first time the policy has been tried . It was attempted in Ronald Reagan 's second term , but little came of it . George Bush senior attempted a "" global partnership "" with Japan , which fizzled out in the Gulf war . Mr Clinton 's 1996 joint declaration on security with Japan , before he began the tilt towards China that culminated in his trip to Tiananmen Square , yielded a new set of defence guidelines that tightened American - Japanese co - operation a bit . But it could not hide the awkward fact that , if America finds itself fighting over Taiwan or South Korea , Japan 's 60 destroyers and its 200 or so fighter planes will be constitutionally required to stand idle . It is not even completely certain , some analysts worry , that Japan will allow America to use its own Japanese bases . 
  Mr Bush 's latest overtures have had a cold reception in Japan . Neglect may be bad , but so is American overfriendliness , especially when Japan is already on edgy terms with China . Chinese posturing in the South China sea , a still - unresolved dispute over the Senkaku islands , a mysterious spate of Chinese naval incursions into Japan 's waters , and Japanese resentment at China 's alleged lack of gratitude for aid money have added to the unease . Meanwhile , Japan 's growing bilateral trade deficit , a historically unprecedented level of unemployment and perennially low growth are fanning a chauvinistic nationalism . China is regularly lashed by conservative Japanese politicians such as Tokyo 's governor , Shintaro Ishihara . 
  Japanese diplomats also recall that the last time America tried to improve its relations with Japan , in May 1996 , China 's reaction was volcanic . Japan sees no sense in making an enemy out of its giant neighbour , as America , from a safer distance , sometimes seems inclined to . It is the volatility of America 's relations with China that upsets the Japanese most . "" The nightmare for Japan is a deterioration in relations between China and America , "" notes Yoichi Funabashi , a leading commentator . "" Then we would be forced to choose . America 's Japan - first policy is not at all what we want . It broke down before . Japan can not endure such pressure . "" 
  Still , there is some shift . Ten years ago , even the mention of constitutional reform was taboo . Now , a parliamentary panel has begun to prepare some of the groundwork , although its work is likely to take many years . Signs of a new national assertiveness are everywhere : in 1999 , for instance , the government gave official standing to the national flag and anthem . A growing number of people want Japan to become a "" normal "" country , free from the restraints that have made it , since the war , such a passive figure on the world stage . 
  But whether this really adds up to a confident , outward - looking Japan , politically and economically ready to play a more active role alongside America in Asia , is another matter . For a start , no one in Japan has much time for foreign - policy objectives just now . The economy , having only just clawed its way up from recession , is back on the brink . The stockmarket is at a 16 - year low ; the finance minister speaks of "" collapse "" . The ruling Liberal Democratic Party is weaker than ever . It is looking for a new leader , its ninth in ten years , and many , even within the party itself , believe it is only an election away from political oblivion . 
  The danger with a Japan - first policy is that Mr Bush , like so many of his predecessors , will soon grow frustrated with the limitations imposed by Japan 's domestic politics . That has always been the pattern in the past . Another striking pattern is that new presidents all begin by talking tough about China , and all end up mesmerised by the dragon . Mr Clinton , after all , came into office promising to end his predecessor 's policy of "" coddling dictators "" . Yet he ended up in "" strategic partnership "" with them , and snubbing Japan . It would be no surprise to see that happen again .",740,Japan,A29-8206,IN TERM,True,"Japan 's prime minister , Yoshiro Mori",5,True

 HE CANNOT quite bring himself to say it out loud. But Yoshiro Mori is finished, and everybody knows it. On March 13th, Japan's prime minister confirmed that he was bringing forward the Liberal Democratic Party's leadership election, which was due in September. As the LDP dominates the coalition government, whoever wins this race will also claim the prime minister's job. Once the budget is through parliament, Mr Mori will then make his departure official, perhaps in early April. That, however, is all the party can agree on right now. Who will succeed Mr Mori--and even how and when--remains as mysterious as ever.
 The how dictates the when. Mr Mori's own route to the top, via a shady backroom deal among five party barons last April, made him deeply unpopular from the start. This time, the LDP must at least put on a show of democracy. But a by-the-book election, involving all 2.4m party members, would take more than a month to organise. That would leave little time to reverse the party's dismal fortunes before July's crucial upper-house election. So the party elders are pushing to restrict the vote to the parliamentary party, plus one representative from each of the 47 prefectural chapters. Naturally, local bosses want a bigger say. But the larger the electorate grows, the longer it will take to fix the outcome.
 There is plenty to fix. Mr Mori's 11 months in office have left the LDP looking desperately split. Yawning policy differences between the party's conservative mainstream and liberal minority have already led to one attempted coup on Mr Mori's watch, by a young reformer, Koichi Kato. Since then, the mainstream itself has split over Mr Mori's future. One camp, led by a faction headed by Ryutaru Hashimoto, a former prime minister (see chart), has worked feverishly to rid the party of the stunningly unpopular Mr Mori. The other, an alliance between Mr Mori's own faction, and one jointly led by his policy chief, Shizuka Kamei, has been struggling vainly to prop up Mr Mori. Although Mr Mori is now going, the split remains. One of the two candidates most likely to succeed him, Hiromu Nonaka, is from Mr Hashimoto's camp. The other candidate, Junichiro Koizumi, is from Mr Mori's.
 The two men could not be more different. Mr Koizumi is all privilege and polish. After graduating from Keio, a posh Tokyo university, he followed his father (and his grandfather before him) into politics. Accomplished and sophisticated--his interests span opera, classical music and kabuki theatre--Mr Koizumi looks good on television and is popular with the voters, especially women. He even has a reputation as a bit of a reformer, although his cowardly betrayal of his liberal allies in November's failed coup has put a big dent in this.
 Mr Nonaka is a much more interesting character. He comes from Sonobe, a district in Kyoto known for its large population of burakumin, literally ""village people"". This is a group that, like India's untouchables, used to handle the jobs no one else would do, such as tanning, butchery and rubbish collection. Mr Nonaka himself left school at 15 to become a railwayman. Discrimination pushed him into local politics, where he eventually won his spurs breaking the Communist Party's armlock on Kyoto's municipal government. The LDP rewarded him with a seat in parliament.
 To voters, Mr Nonaka and his allies, among them Muneo Suzuki and Makoto Koga, are an intimidating bunch. Mr Suzuki comes from a rough working-class background. Mr Koga, whom Mr Nonaka installed as the LDP's secretary-general when he resigned from that post in December, is said to describe himself as a kawasujimono. This word is from the southern island of Kyushu, where Mr Koga's father worked in the coal mines, and suggests a proud, rough, hard-drinking working man. The LDP is just as intimidated by Mr Nonaka himself. His chief currency is information, especially the sort of information that puts politicians in hot water. He employs his black arts to gain advantage behind the scenes and, last November, to put down Mr Kato's rebellion. ""Some flowers like the sunlight,"" says one insider. ""Others prefer the shade. Mr Nonaka is the latter variety.""
 It is still too early to tell for sure. But Mr Nonaka may soon have his time in the sun. Because he champions the poor, immigrants and other underdogs, he is close to the Buddhist-backed New Komeito party, the most important of the LDP's two coalition partners. Komeito is supposed to be the party of ""clean government"", and so has been especially upset by the lingering presence of Mr Mori, around whose cabinet swirl assorted scandals. Komeito is even threatening to abandon the coalition altogether. Mr Nonaka is probably the best man to patch things up.
 Party barons then hope to mend fences within the LDP by offering Mr Koizumi a plum job in Mr Nonaka's new line-up, either as party secretary-general, or as foreign minister. The deal will be sweetened, it is hoped, by giving Mr Nonaka the job for just five months. He is, after all, 75 years old, on the aged side even for Japan. Yet another party leadership election will then be held in September, after the upper-house election is out of the way.
 What this all might mean for Japan's economy, which lurches from bad to worse, is anyone's guess. Almost nothing is known about Mr Nonaka's economic thinking. But some optimists hope he will appoint as his finance minister a younger reformer like Yasuhisa Shiozaki as a sop to the party's discontented youth, who are frustrated by the LDP's rigid seniority-based system of promotion. Unlike Mr Mori, Mr Nonaka would also be his own man, and may return some welcome control to Japan's disturbingly chaotic politics and economy.
 In the meantime, there will be more drift and more muddle as Mr Mori limps on for another month or two. In the end, the LDP avoided the ugly scenes that had threatened the party's annual conference on March 13th. Outside, however, local party members were forlornly handing out leaflets, on which they had written, ""The party is going to die."" The message is not getting through.

2001-03-17,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224060066/fulltext/1D7B57A16962422CPQ/60?accountid=14657," ""PERHAPS my views are extreme, but I think this is a good time to buy."" That was the advice of Hakuo Yanagisawa, Japan's financial- affairs minister, on March 13th, after the benchmark Nikkei 225 index plunged to its lowest close for 16 years. Few investors agreed-- until, that is, the government came up with a sweetener two days later. On March 15th, Kiichi Miyazawa, the finance minister, proposed setting up a private fund to buy stocks, into which public money will be injected if it makes any losses. It is unclear whether the scheme, which has already been shot down once this year, will really be implemented. There is, after all, turmoil within the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which heads the ruling coalition. Nonetheless, the proposal helped lift the markets, at least temporarily. After the announcement, the Nikkei closed up at 12,153. The Topix, a broader index, was also up, though still near a two- year low.
 If the respite is short, it spells trouble for Japan's banks. Their huge stock portfolios used to be full of unrealised gains to offset losses from disposals of bad loans. Now their portfolios are turning into large liabilities. This could push them into the red when they close their books at the end of the month. Banks must mark down any shares that fall more than 50% below the price at which they were bought or last revalued. At current prices, according to Hironari Nozaki, of ABN Amro bank, this will result in more than 1.2 trillion ($10 billion) of extra losses for the 16 biggest banks. Worse, he says that if the Topix falls to 1,100 (from its current 1,184), the losses could all but wipe out 1.8 trillion of profits that are expected for this year. The banks are starting to feel the heat: Fitch IBCA, a ratings agency, said on March 14th that it was considering downgrading the ratings of 19 Japanese banks. The following day, Sanwa Bank and Tokai Bank warned that they expect to make a combined 220 billion in losses this year.
 In order to offset these losses, banks are trying to take profits by selling their better-performing stocks. That is helping push share prices even lower. Not surprisingly, it alarms the ruling party. Most of the LDP's emergency measures to counter falling shares, including its latest, have been cobbled together by the prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, and his cronies. The question is whether they will even be implemented, for Mr Mori's days look numbered.
 A different approach, set out by reformers such as Mr Yanagisawa, appeared to cheer the markets last month, at least for a while. He wants to clean up Japan's debt-ridden financial system, by making banks speed up their write-offs of bad loans. But he has yet to spell out the nitty-gritty of his scheme. Doing as he suggests will not be easy. He will have to skirt, or dismantle, several regulatory barriers for parts of his scheme to work. And he will also have to explain how the banks are meant to fund the clean-up. Assuming he manages to do all this, he will then have to oversee a messy, even shocking, process that will entail job losses and lots of bankruptcies.
 One of the lost jobs could be his own. Mr Mori's successor, whoever he is, will have to form a new cabinet, most likely next month. The new prime minister may face pressure to be cautious--if that term can any longer be applied in Japan to doing nothing--and replace Mr Yanigasawa with someone less bent on reform. There is no telling how far the markets might then fall.
Caption: That sinking feeling","  "" PERHAPS my views are extreme , but I think this is a good time to buy . "" That was the advice of Hakuo Yanagisawa , Japan 's financial- affairs minister , on March 13th , after the benchmark Nikkei 225 index plunged to its lowest close for 16 years . Few investors agreed-- until , that is , the government came up with a sweetener two days later . On March 15th , Kiichi Miyazawa , the finance minister , proposed setting up a private fund to buy stocks , into which public money will be injected if it makes any losses . It is unclear whether the scheme , which has already been shot down once this year , will really be implemented . There is , after all , turmoil within the Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) , which heads the ruling coalition . Nonetheless , the proposal helped lift the markets , at least temporarily . After the announcement , the Nikkei closed up at 12,153 . The Topix , a broader index , was also up , though still near a two- year low . 
  If the respite is short , it spells trouble for Japan 's banks . Their huge stock portfolios used to be full of unrealised gains to offset losses from disposals of bad loans . Now their portfolios are turning into large liabilities . This could push them into the red when they close their books at the end of the month . Banks must mark down any shares that fall more than 50 % below the price at which they were bought or last revalued . At current prices , according to Hironari Nozaki , of ABN Amro bank , this will result in more than 1.2 trillion ( $ 10 billion ) of extra losses for the 16 biggest banks . Worse , he says that if the Topix falls to 1,100 ( from its current 1,184 ) , the losses could all but wipe out 1.8 trillion of profits that are expected for this year . The banks are starting to feel the heat : Fitch IBCA , a ratings agency , said on March 14th that it was considering downgrading the ratings of 19 Japanese banks . The following day , Sanwa Bank and Tokai Bank warned that they expect to make a combined 220 billion in losses this year . 
  In order to offset these losses , banks are trying to take profits by selling their better - performing stocks . That is helping push share prices even lower . Not surprisingly , it alarms the ruling party . Most of the LDP 's emergency measures to counter falling shares , including its latest , have been cobbled together by Yoshiro Mori , and Yoshiro Mori's cronies . The question is whether they will even be implemented , for Yoshiro Mori's days look numbered . 
  A different approach , set out by reformers such as Mr Yanagisawa , appeared to cheer the markets last month , at least for a while . He wants to clean up Japan 's debt - ridden financial system , by making banks speed up their write - offs of bad loans . But he has yet to spell out the nitty - gritty of his scheme . Doing as he suggests will not be easy . He will have to skirt , or dismantle , several regulatory barriers for parts of his scheme to work . And he will also have to explain how the banks are meant to fund the clean - up . Assuming he manages to do all this , he will then have to oversee a messy , even shocking , process that will entail job losses and lots of bankruptcies . 
  One of the lost jobs could be his own . Yoshiro Mori's successor , whoever he is , will have to form a new cabinet , most likely next month . The new prime minister may face pressure to be cautious -- if that term can any longer be applied in Japan to doing nothing -- and replace Mr Yanigasawa with someone less bent on reform . There is no telling how far the markets might then fall .

 America's Federal Reserve cut interest rates by half a percentage point to 5%. Investors had hoped for more; the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq index both continued to fall. America's consumer-price index rose more than expected in February, by 0.3%, to give a 12-month increase of 3.5%. America's trade deficit in goods and services widened slightly in January to $33.3 billion.

In fact, no date has been formally announced: the government has merely inserted May 3rd into the national consciousness by its usual process of media osmosis. Indeed, Mr Blair has 13 months still to play with before an election falls due. With a majority of 179, you would think he could limp along a while longer. And yet his government has spent much of this week arguing against the ""postponement"" of an election which it has not yet called, and which it has no need to call. In a truly novel argument for May, the prime minister gave warning that not going ahead with the local elections that are (really) due then would scare off foreign tourists.
 William Hague is meanwhile struggling, with an equal lack of subtlety, to excise May 3rd from the political calendar. He has a powerful incentive. On present polls, the Tories are at about 30% and Labour at about 50%. Though this would not produce another mass cull of Tory MPs, it would produce another big defeat, and another big defeat could well tempt those Tories who survived it to propose the humane slaughter of their present leader. The awkwardness for Mr Hague is that no opposition leader can be seen to duck a fight. The official line on Planet Tory, you may remember, is that party and people alike are straining like greyhounds in the slips for their earliest possible opportunity to evict Labour from office and rescue Britain from a vile fate as Mr Blair's ""foreign land"".
 From that perspective, the plague of foot-and-mouth disease that has descended on Britain's farms descended on Conservative Central Office like manna from heaven. Even before the outbreak, the Tories had invested a good deal of political capital in the claim that whereas they instinctively understand rural life, Labour is wilfully ignorant of it. Even in the calamitous 1997 election, the Tories won 37% of the vote, against Labour's 29%, in the 150 constituencies with the highest proportion of jobs in agriculture. Since then, Mr Blair's plan to ban hunting with dogs has alienated many more rural people. But for the foot-and-mouth outbreak, many tens of thousands of them would have marched on London last Sunday under the predominantly blue banner of the ""Countryside Alliance"".
 Thus far, the Tories' handling of foot-and-mouth has therefore been quite deft. Tim Yeo, the shadow agriculture spokesman, combines a patrician manner with an appropriately ruddy complexion and an impressive grasp of country matters. He pays lip-service to the need for bipartisanship in a national emergency, but portrays Nick Brown, the agriculture secretary, as a well-meaning second-rater without the imagination or sense of urgency the crisis demands. Mr Yeo has bombarded Mr Brown with a barrage of ""helpful"" suggestions. The Tories say it was they who called first for drafting in the army and final-year student vets; for letting vets slaughter suspect animals without waiting for laboratory tests; and for burying animals immediately on their farms instead of leaving their carcasses to be carted off belatedly by lorry.
 Even so, a points victory on foot-and-mouth is hardly likely to save the Tories' electoral bacon in May. What Mr Hague needs is to knock out the very idea of a May poll if, as seems likely, the countryside can still be held to be in a state of crisis then. So although not yet daring to call for the postponement of the election that Mr Blair has not yet announced, on March 20th Mr Hague took a carefully disinfected step in that direction.
 It was ""undeniable"", he told a press conference, that in at least some counties it would be impossible under present conditions to go ahead with the local elections on May 3rd. In some heavily infected wards in Devon, said Mr Hague, half of the local Conservative candidates are farmers, who would not be able to campaign in the normal way. He called on the government to pass enabling legislation so that it could postpone the elections in such places if matters do not improve by May. By extension, it would be wrong to hold a general election if the ""national crisis"" was still ""out of control"".
 Naturally, Mr Blair is far too shrewd to fall into the trap of asking: ""What crisis?"" With farmers weeping on television, the government has taken care to feel the countryside's pain. On the very day of Mr Hague's press conference, Michael Meacher, the environment secretary, unveiled the latest plans to rescue the rural economy. But the epidemic is spreading. Having failed to bring it under swift control, Downing Street now stresses that eradicating it will be a ""long haul"", during which normal life, including normal democratic life, can and should continue.
 The government is right to say that however wretched foot-and- mouth has made the mood in the countryside, nobody is in serious danger of being disenfranchised by it. The real issue is taste. In the midst of such an affliction, why the distraction of an election? A MORI poll last weekend found 61% of voters against a May election in these circumstances, with 34% saying it should go ahead. An ICM poll reported 52% of voters against, with 40% in favour. But there is little evidence that voters would change the way they cast their votes if the government stuck to its plans. In the prime minister's mind, the small electoral price he might have to pay must be weighed against the unpredictable perils of ""postponement"".
 Given this, as the Tories privately acknowledge, the likelihood is that Mr Blair will go ahead. The consolation for the Conservatives is that he will now have to do so in somewhat trickier circumstances than he expected. He will be accused of opportunism. If the epidemic worsens, he may find it hard to keep his usual tight control of the headlines as the campaign unfolds. And he will need to prove that he can manage a national emergency without being distracted by politics. Final victory may be assured, but this is not the start Mr Blair would have wanted."," SO FIRM does the date appear that you might think Tony Blair had sent out battalions of town criers to proclaim a general election on May 3rd.

But for how long will they remain convinced?
 HAS Japan at last stumbled upon a cure for its sickly economy? The stockmarket seems to think so. On March 21st, Japanese shares soared by 7.5%, with the Nikkei 225 index closing above 13,100 for the first time since February 26th. After another fall on Wall Street the day before, most pundits had forecast trouble in Tokyo. That would once again have threatened Japan's wobbly banks and its weakening economy, which the central bank admitted (on the very same day that traders were rushing to buy shares) had ""come to a pause"".
 The stockmarket was excited about two bits of news, which it hopes are related. On March 19th, the central bank, the Bank of Japan, in effect cut interest rates back to zero, completing the reversal of its rate increase of last August, the first in ten years. On the same day, Yoshiro Mori, Japan's prime minister, who was in Washington to meet President Bush, pledged to come up with a solution to Japan's debt problems within six months.
 With the newspapers full of speculation about a grand economic plan to restore the economy to health, this suddenly looked to be just what the doctor ordered: the government would force the banks to rid themselves of their bad debts, once and for all; as a salve for the pain of the bankruptcies and job losses that were sure to follow, the Bank of Japan would print lots more money; and a side deal with the Americans would pave the way for the yen's rapid fall, to 140 to the dollar or lower. In the space of a single day, Japan's hopelessly muddled economic policy seemed, almost miraculously, to have come together.
 Dream on. Agreed, the Bank of Japan pledged much more than a rate cut: it has abandoned targeting interest rates altogether. Instead, it plans to target the quantity of money that flows through the economy. Its chosen measure is the reserves that commercial banks deposit with the central bank. It wants to push these up from 4 trillion ($32.5 billion) to 5 trillion, by flooding the markets with more money. This will have the effect of driving short-term interest rates down to zero. In another change of policy, the bank also said that it plans to hold interest rates at zero until the country shakes off what the government now admits is persistent deflation.
 There is less to these changes, however, than meets the eye. The Bank of Japan has promised not to raise rates until prices start to rise again. It has also promised to increase the supply of money. What it has not done is explicitly to link the two, by promising to print money until it creates inflation. Yet this is what the Japanese government and some economists have been urging it to do: print lots of money, force the yen lower, and get people to start believing that prices must soon start to rise.
 In fact, not only has the bank made no pledges about the circumstances under which it might print more money. It has only agreed to print just enough to force rates back to zero. It is no coincidence that, under the zero-interest-rate policy that the bank ran before last August's rate increase, commercial-bank reserves deposited with it averaged around 5 trillion--exactly the target that it has now adopted.
 Mr Mori's Washington ""pledge"", meanwhile, lasted little more than a day. On March 21st, Yasuo Fukuda, the chief cabinet secretary, denied that the prime minister had meant he would clean up the banks' bad debts within six months. In fact, said Mr Fukuda, Mr Mori was referring to the government's debt problems, for which he hoped there would soon be a plan.
 The political background
 Salvation is still possible: the government is floating all sorts of ideas for helping the banks to rid themselves of their bad debts. It is also true that the Bank of Japan's policy changes bring it an inch or two closer to printing money to create inflation. But there are still as many uncertainties as there were at the beginning of the week. For all the talk of a co-ordinated rescue package, the government's economic policy still seems to be in a muddle. And the confusion looks set to continue. For behind the scenes rages not one but three fierce political battles.
 The first of them pitches the ruling Liberal Democratic Party against the Bank of Japan. The LDP wants the bank to turn on the printing presses, but the bank continues to refuse, despite what was dressed up as a radical policy shift this week. Bolder measures may come later, hints the bank, but only if the politicians get serious about cleaning up the banking sector.
 For the obtuse and hard of hearing, the Bank of Japan has put its unorthodox agenda squarely in the open. To restore sustainable growth, it said in an extraordinary footnote to its policy changes this week, it is essential to reform the financial system, the economy and industry. ""Structural reform may be accompanied by painful adjustments,"" it warned. Without them, ""neither improvement in productivity nor sustainable economic growth can be obtained.""
 The second tussle is over the fate of Mr Mori. Japan's stunningly unpopular prime minister has already caved in to pressure by promising to resign, albeit indirectly. But his supporters have not yet given up hope. They are trying to use the economic crisis to keep him in power for as long as possible. With the stockmarket and the banks so weak, they say, economic policy must take priority over the party's leadership battle. Mr Mori's opponents in the LDP and the media, meanwhile, are taking every opportunity to frustrate his policy initiatives. The result, up until now, has been political paralysis.
 The final and most important stand-off is between the LDP's reformist minority and its conservative mainstream, over the much- scarred battleground of bank policy. Mr Miyazawa has proposed what looks like a disguised, pain-free, bank bailout, with taxpayers underwriting a fund that would take the banks' troublesome 45 trillion ($365 billion) or so of shares off their hands. These massive share portfolios have been the banks' biggest headache recently, because the value counts in calculating their capital. With the stockmarket so depressed, the banks now face larger deductions from their capital bases.
 The reformers, on the other hand, have been pushing a tough new plan fronted by Hakuo Yanagisawa, Mr Mori's minister in charge of the bank clean-up. Mr Yanagisawa wants to write down all the banks' bad debts by March 2002. That, however, is likely to mean a rash of bankruptcies and job losses in the struggling construction and retail industries--which just happen to be the two most important constituencies for traditional LDP politicians.
 Adding to the political complexity is the possibility that the outcome of one or more of these battles will influence the others, with unpredictable results. The question of who succeeds Mr Mori, for instance, is crucial to the battle over banking policy. But not even Japan's best informed political insiders have much idea about the outcome.
 Pacific contagion
 The proximate cause of all the muddle lies not in Japan, but in America. The weakening economy there and the collapsing market for technology shares have hurt Japan badly. Since Japan's exports to America add up to just 3% of GDP (compared with, for example, more than 8% in South Korea), the direct effects of American weakness through trade flows have been small. Moreover, contrary to widespread belief, export growth was never important to Japan's economic recovery in the first place.
 Yet confidence has tumbled and the strength of the business cycle, which has been nudging the economy forward, is now in serious doubt. The recent fall in the growth of machinery orders, a good guide to future business investment, has gloomier economists predicting a business recession by the summer.
 The explanation lies partly with the technology industry. One defining feature of Japan's latest recovery is that much of the country has in fact stayed in recession, from its restructuring steel makers and shipbuilders to its overborrowed high-street retailers. Growth has instead been concentrated on high-tech manufacturers, including chip makers like Fujitsu and NEC, consumer-electronics firms like Matsushita, and a whole raft of specialist mid-sized manufacturers. Richard Jerram of ING Barings, an investment bank, calculates that in the two years to the end of 2000, the electrical- machinery sector (which has a strong high-tech bias) contributed nearly two-thirds of Japan's 9.5% overall rise in industrial production. The sector's share of production, however, is just one- quarter.
 Between October 1998 and February 2000, the value of Japanese technology shares tripled. With demand for computers, mobile phones, fibre-optic cable and other high-tech kit racing along, massive new business investment followed. In the year ending March 2001, for instance, Japan's five big chip makers invested a record 964 billion in new plant and equipment, up nearly 80% on the previous year.
 Yet just as the technology industry's extravagant hopes had outsize effects on economic growth last year, so this year's gloomier sentiment threatens a wider recession. Since last summer, the price of 64 megabit DRAM computer-memory chips, an industry benchmark, has fallen by more than half, to less than $4. A sudden drop in consumer confidence in America, coupled with fears about the enormous investments of Europe's telecoms companies (along with the debts that they have amassed to make them) has deepened the gloom. Japan's technology firms have rapidly switched from record profitability to profit warnings. Business investment plans have been hurriedly shrunk, even as share prices have collapsed: since February 2000, high-tech stocks have halved in value.
 The stockmarket's collapse has had unfortunate consequences, particularly for Japanese banks. Over the past decade, the banks have ditched more than 70 trillion of non-performing loans while trying to scrub themselves clean. But with good loans souring as fast as banks can provision against them or write them off, that much and more still sits on their books. The banks themselves are partly to blame for this: they have, until recently, been far too optimistic about the prospects for their worst borrowers.
 But it is the stockmarket's tumble that has done the most damage. The banks' huge equity portfolios, until recently the source of unrealised gains which they have used to pay for bad-loan disposals, are now full of losses. With the benchmark Nikkei 225 index hovering near a 16-year low, the holes are getting bigger. After next month, when a new method of accounting (based on market values) is introduced, these portfolio losses will hurt the banks' capital bases, from which they will be subtracted. If the broader Topix stockmarket index falls to 1,178, the 16 biggest banks' net equity losses could balloon to 3.8 trillion, warns Yukiko Ohara of Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, an international investment bank.
 A more imminent danger is that some banks might not be able to close their books for the year at the end of this month. Until next month's market-value accounting changes, they must mark down any shares which fall below 50% of the price at which they were purchased or last revalued, a process which could push a few into insolvency. Such fears have already battered banks' shares, notably those of Daiwa Bank and Chuo Mitsui Trust, both of which have particularly dreadful-looking stock and loan portfolios.
 Pre-press requirements
 Against this sort of headwind, it is hard to see how the Bank of Japan's latest policy can turn the banks and the economy round. It will help that the bank has committed itself to keeping interest rates at zero until prices start to rise again. That will reassure people that it is not going to repeat its mistake of last August, when it raised rates despite evidence of lingering deflation.
 But free money will not make much of a difference to an economy that was already limping along with interest rates at a mere 0.15%. Rock-bottom rates do not work in Japan, and have not done so for several years. They do not encourage banks to take more risks and to make new loans, because the banks are broken. On the other hand, they do not encourage borrowers to take new loans, because they have borrowed too much already.
 Printing money in huge quantities might work, as it should push the yen dramatically lower. It might also encourage people to believe that prices will start to rise again. But printing huge amounts of money is not what the central bank has promised to do. It fears trouble in Japan's government-bond market, which must finance a deficit of close to 10% of GDP and national debts of 666 trillion, a whopping 120% of GDP (see chart 3).
 So far, the market has digested all this debt with barely a burp: ten-year bonds yield only a fraction over 1%. But the Bank of Japan worries that the sight of the central bank printing money to finance the government's deficit (which is exactly what it would be doing if it bought large amounts of government bonds) might unnerve investors. If bond yields then rose, investors might really take fright, dumping bonds and the yen. The bank might then be forced to print yet more money in order to cover the government's larger interest bill, pushing rates up further and entering a vicious circle. The risk might be small. But the possible consequences are dire.
 The second reason that the bank continues to resist the temptations of the printing press is that it first hopes to extract a sincere effort from the LDP to clean up the banking mess. Masaru Hayami, the central bank's brow-beaten governor, is all too aware of the popularity of printing money among the LDP's old guard. In Mr Hayami's view, conservative politicians like Shizuka Kamei, Mr Mori's policy chief, have seized on the idea as a pain-free alternative to cleaning out the debts. The banks and their borrowers would simply have their debts inflated away. Managers would then have no need to sort out their businesses, or sack their staff (or themselves), or take any other unpleasant decisions. But this would do nothing, argues the bank, for the economy's long-term health. That requires painful restructuring and, as the bank pointedly put it this week, ""decisive actions...under a strong leadership of the government of Japan.""
 The bank is unlikely to have its wish granted any time soon. Mr Mori's administration is probably good for at least another month, while the budget goes through parliament and the LDP squabbles over a successor. During this time, however, policymaking is likely to prove challenging. Mr Mori's opponents in the party will not want to grant the prime minister any chance to make political capital out of the economic crisis, and so prolong his stay of execution. This is the main reason why Mr Mori's countermeasures for the stockmarket, which are supposed to include generous tax breaks for investors, have so far got nowhere.
 The outlook beyond Mr Mori is hardly any brighter. Because the LDP cannot agree on his replacement, it now seems likely that whoever takes over will get the job only until September, when the LDP will hold yet another party leadership election. Worse, the cabinet reshuffle that will come with a change of leadership may well scupper Mr Yanagisawa's tough new plans for the banks, as he himself faces the chop unless he waters them down. ""Mr Yanagisawa is too radical,"" says one LDP insider. ""He does not represent the party consensus."" Should he go, his departure would mark the seventh change at the top of Japan's financial regulator, perhaps the most important post in the cabinet, in little more than a year.
 Even if, by some miracle, Mr Yanagisawa's plan does survive in some form, the next prime minister's priorities are likely to lie elsewhere. The LDP must prepare for upper-house elections in July, at which it looks like taking a beating. If it loses the majority it now enjoys with its two coalition partners, the New Conservative Party and the Buddhist-backed New Komei Party, the opposition will be able to block the passage of all bills except the budget and international legislation. The result would be stalemate.
 The LDP might not even get that far. It has its work cut out simply holding the coalition together until the summer's elections. The Buddhists, who are meant to be promoting clean government, are especially upset about Mr Mori, whose cabinets have been notably prone to scandal. This week's stockmarket rally has given the politicians some precious time. All the signs are, however, that they will fail to use it wisely.
Caption: Mori and Bush compare bubbles; Mr Hayami strains to hear the cries of pain","  Policy changes at the Bank of Japan , and more promises to clean up the banks , seem to have convinced investors that Japan does not , after all , face imminent collapse . But for how long will they remain convinced ? 
  HAS Japan at last stumbled upon a cure for its sickly economy ? The stockmarket seems to think so . On March 21st , Japanese shares soared by 7.5 % , with the Nikkei 225 index closing above 13,100 for the first time since February 26th . After another fall on Wall Street the day before , most pundits had forecast trouble in Tokyo . That would once again have threatened Japan 's wobbly banks and its weakening economy , which the central bank admitted ( on the very same day that traders were rushing to buy shares ) had "" come to a pause "" . 
  The stockmarket was excited about two bits of news , which it hopes are related . On March 19th , the central bank , the Bank of Japan , in effect cut interest rates back to zero , completing the reversal of its rate increase of last August , the first in ten years . On the same day , Yoshiro Mori's , pledged to come up with a solution to Japan 's debt problems within six months . 
  With the newspapers full of speculation about a grand economic plan to restore the economy to health , this suddenly looked to be just what the doctor ordered : the government would force the banks to rid themselves of their bad debts , once and for all ; as a salve for the pain of the bankruptcies and job losses that were sure to follow , the Bank of Japan would print lots more money ; and a side deal with the Americans would pave the way for the yen 's rapid fall , to 140 to the dollar or lower . In the space of a single day , Japan 's hopelessly muddled economic policy seemed , almost miraculously , to have come together . 
  Dream on . Agreed , the Bank of Japan pledged much more than a rate cut : it has abandoned targeting interest rates altogether . Instead , it plans to target the quantity of money that flows through the economy . Its chosen measure is the reserves that commercial banks deposit with the central bank . It wants to push these up from 4 trillion ( $ 32.5 billion ) to 5 trillion , by flooding the markets with more money . This will have the effect of driving short - term interest rates down to zero . In another change of policy , the bank also said that it plans to hold interest rates at zero until the country shakes off what the government now admits is persistent deflation . 
  There is less to these changes , however , than meets the eye . The Bank of Japan has promised not to raise rates until prices start to rise again . It has also promised to increase the supply of money . What it has not done is explicitly to link the two , by promising to print money until it creates inflation . Yet this is what the Japanese government and some economists have been urging it to do : print lots of money , force the yen lower , and get people to start believing that prices must soon start to rise . 
  In fact , not only has the bank made no pledges about the circumstances under which it might print more money . It has only agreed to print just enough to force rates back to zero . It is no coincidence that , under the zero - interest - rate policy that the bank ran before last August 's rate increase , commercial - bank reserves deposited with it averaged around 5 trillion -- exactly the target that it has now adopted . 
  Yoshiro Mori's Washington "" pledge "" , meanwhile , lasted little more than a day . On March 21st , Yasuo Fukuda , the chief cabinet secretary , denied that Yoshiro Mori had meant Yoshiro Mori would clean up the banks ' bad debts within six months . In fact , said Mr Fukuda , Yoshiro Mori was referring to the government 's debt problems , for which Yoshiro Mori hoped there would soon be a plan . 
  The political background 
  Salvation is still possible : the government is floating all sorts of ideas for helping the banks to rid themselves of their bad debts . It is also true that the Bank of Japan 's policy changes bring it an inch or two closer to printing money to create inflation . But there are still as many uncertainties as there were at the beginning of the week . For all the talk of a co - ordinated rescue package , the government 's economic policy still seems to be in a muddle . And the confusion looks set to continue . For behind the scenes rages not one but three fierce political battles . 
  The first of them pitches the ruling Liberal Democratic Party against the Bank of Japan . The LDP wants the bank to turn on the printing presses , but the bank continues to refuse , despite what was dressed up as a radical policy shift this week . Bolder measures may come later , hints the bank , but only if the politicians get serious about cleaning up the banking sector . 
  For the obtuse and hard of hearing , the Bank of Japan has put its unorthodox agenda squarely in the open . To restore sustainable growth , it said in an extraordinary footnote to its policy changes this week , it is essential to reform the financial system , the economy and industry . "" Structural reform may be accompanied by painful adjustments , "" it warned . Without them , "" neither improvement in productivity nor sustainable economic growth can be obtained . "" 
  The second tussle is over the fate of Yoshiro Mori . Yoshiro Mori's has already caved in to pressure by promising to resign , albeit indirectly . But Yoshiro Mori's supporters have not yet given up hope . They are trying to use the economic crisis to keep Yoshiro Mori in power for as long as possible . With the stockmarket and the banks so weak , they say , economic policy must take priority over the party 's leadership battle . Yoshiro Mori's opponents in the LDP and the media , meanwhile , are taking every opportunity to frustrate Yoshiro Mori's policy initiatives . The result , up until now , has been political paralysis . 
  The final and most important stand - off is between the LDP 's reformist minority and its conservative mainstream , over the much- scarred battleground of bank policy . Mr Miyazawa has proposed what looks like a disguised , pain - free , bank bailout , with taxpayers underwriting a fund that would take the banks ' troublesome 45 trillion ( $ 365 billion ) or so of shares off their hands . These massive share portfolios have been the banks ' biggest headache recently , because the value counts in calculating their capital . With the stockmarket so depressed , the banks now face larger deductions from their capital bases . 
  The reformers , on the other hand , have been pushing a tough new plan fronted by Hakuo Yanagisawa , Yoshiro Mori's minister in charge of the bank clean - up . Mr Yanagisawa wants to write down all the banks ' bad debts by March 2002 . That , however , is likely to mean a rash of bankruptcies and job losses in the struggling construction and retail industries -- which just happen to be the two most important constituencies for traditional LDP politicians . 
  Adding to the political complexity is the possibility that the outcome of one or more of these battles will influence the others , with unpredictable results . The question of who succeeds Yoshiro Mori , for instance , is crucial to the battle over banking policy . But not even Japan 's best informed political insiders have much idea about the outcome .

After Yoshiro Mori told the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in March that he would resign as prime minister, there was an embarrassing shortage of candidates to replace him. Yet on April 9th Junichiro Koizumi, a former posts and telecoms and health minister, said he would be a candidate for the top job. A day later Taro Aso, the economics minister, and Shizuka Kamei, the LDP's policy chief, offered their services. Ryutaro Hashimoto, a former prime minister and, lately, minister in charge of government reform, added his name to the list on April 11th.
 With less than two weeks to go before the vote, suddenly the LDP is spoilt for choice. In truth, there are only two men in the race: Mr Hashimoto and Mr Koizumi. That makes the contest a rerun of the LDP's leadership election of 1995, when party barons fielded two fresh-faced young politicians to help revive the LDP's sagging fortunes with the voters.
 The two rivals are no longer so young or so fresh-faced, but some things never change. In 1995, Mr Hashimoto won handsomely. This year, he is likely to do so again. Mr Hashimoto has two things going for him. First, he is head of the LDP's largest and best-organised faction. Not all of the Hashimoto faction's 102 Diet members--almost one third of the parliamentary party--will vote for their leader, whose haughty airs go down better with the public than with the LDP. But the faction's unrivalled campaign-finance network, the chief bequest of the late Noboru Takeshita, still buys plenty of loyalty among the rank and file. Second, Mr Hashimoto is the choice of Hiromu Nonaka, the LDP's most influential power-broker, who decided last week not to go for the top job himself. Mr Nonaka belongs to Mr Hashimoto's faction, but his tentacles reach everywhere.
 Against these mighty forces, Mr Koizumi has wisely chosen to fight on policy, not factional loyalty. As in 1995, Mr Koizumi's platform is party reform, which he wants to achieve by privatising the post office. The idea is to take the drugs away from the addict. The post office helps to deliver the LDP's organised rural vote. But, although electoral reform, migration and demography are all weakening the power of the countryside, the LDP still clings to its political roots. This week, for instance, the government decided to slap import curbs on Chinese vegetables, despite protests from urban consumers who pay through the nose for expensive home-grown alternatives.
 Mr Koizumi says he wants to sever the LDP's old rural ties and rebuild the party around the urban majority. His message is not entirely lost on the LDP. He is popular among its grassroots members, who have a keener sense of crisis than the sheltered politicians in Tokyo. The LDP's local chapters will cast about one-third of the votes in the leadership election on April 24th, and opinion polls suggest Mr Koizumi is their first choice.
 Support from the minority of liberal thinkers in the parliamentary party, such as Taku Yamasaki and Koichi Kato, will boost Mr Koizumi's chances further. In the end, though, this may not be enough. Although Shizuka Kamei has no chance of winning the LDP's leadership race himself, he is hoping to gain enough support to cast the deciding vote. Mr Kamei is from the LDP's old guard, firmly wedded to vested interests and addicted to pork-barrel fiscal stimulus. In return for his support, Mr Kamei is demanding that he should stay on as the party's policy chief. Until now, he has used this post to frustrate deregulation and bank reform, and to push for more government spending.
 Despite his reputation as a reformer, Mr Hashimoto may now be preparing to make the necessary concessions, by watering down his previous support of structural reform, and backing away from an immediate tightening of government finances. But it is these sorts of policies that find increasing favour with the voters. In 1998, Mr Hashimoto led the LDP to a humiliating defeat in that summer's upper- house elections. Another upper-house poll is due in July. The signs are that Mr Hashimoto will win the dubious honour of committing the same sin twice.

Though it is no longer British practice to drown its princes in butts of malmsey, the royal pageant marches gaudily on. In the language of the Michelin Guide, the spectacle is well worth a detour. This is no mummified monarchy, to be ogled in wax museums. As in Morocco, or Zululand, royalty is a living institution, part of the form if not quite the substance of government, and still capable, on occasions, of filling headlines and agitating politicians. The ""Sophie tapes"" have provided just such an occasion.
 Sophie Rhys-Jones became the Countess of Wessex by marrying the queen's third son, Edward, the Earl of Wessex. They are a working couple: he a film producer and she chairman of a PR firm, R-JH Public Relations. The tapes in question are recordings of conversations between the countess, her business partner, Murray Harkin, and an ""Arab sheikh"" whom they believed to be a potential client but who, like all too many Arab sheikhs apparently bearing gifts, was really just another wired-up undercover reporter for a tabloid newspaper. A transcript in last Sunday's News of the World has the countess saying things about British public figures which it is safe to assume she would not say to their faces. She says that Tony Blair, the prime minister, thinks he is president; that he is ""ignorant"" of the countryside and that his wife ""hates"" it; that William Hague, the Conservative leader, may be intelligent but ""sounds like a puppet""; that the recent budget was ""a load of pap"". When the countess is not present, Mr Harkin gossips merrily on tape to the presumed sheikh about whether her husband is gay, confesses to liking the ""odd line"" of cocaine and appears to suggest that he would be happy to procure some ""nice boys"" for an entertaining dinner party.
 As if it were not bad enough for a PR professional to fall hook, line and sinker for a classic tabloid sting, the countess made her predicament worse by an artless attempt to wriggle out of it. In return for what she took to be a promise not to publish the original transcript, she gave the paper that entrapped her an exclusive interview, in which she insisted to bemused readers who had never even wondered that her Edward was not gay. But even this self- inflicted humiliation was to no avail. A week after plastering her interview across its front page, the News of the World decided to publish a transcript of the original tapes anyway. The countess should not have been surprised. This was, after all, the same high- minded tabloid whose courageous ""naming and shaming"" campaign against paedophiles last year led indirectly to at least one high-minded physical assault on a paediatrician. This time, its excuse for breaking its word was that once rival newspapers had printed their own wild allegations about what the tapes contained, it had a duty to set the record straight.
 In fairness to all concerned, the record, now that it has been straightened, turns out to be somewhat dull. Mr Harkin comes over as a racier fellow than you would expect to find in a firm with pukka royal connections. But the countess's own taped remarks are hardly inflammatory. They are not even original. Frankly, you do not have to be seventh in line to the throne to hear on the grapevine that Mr Blair sees himself as a president, or notice that Mr Hague has a funny voice. Though it was not clever of the countess to pass such observations on to an Arab sheikh, still less a bogus Arab sheikh, on first acquaintance, this is not the stuff of which constitutional crises should be made. At most, the Sophie tapes bear on the moderately interesting but minor question of whether it is possible for a moderately interesting but minor royal to work in a sensitive career such as public relations without becoming entangled, by accident or design, in a conflict of interest. However that question is answered (as a first stage, she is stepping down as her firm's chairman) it ought not to affect the future of the monarchy as a whole. So why has this affair caused such a commotion inside the House of Windsor? And why the disproportionate volume of newsprint dedicated to it?
 An anatomical analogy may help. The function of the royal family in the British body politic is not dissimilar to the function of the appendix: a vestigial organ, says the encyclopaedia, that serves no current purpose and is believed to be gradually disappearing over evolutionary time. Opinion polls bear this out. A recent MORI poll found that although a majority of Britons would vote to retain the monarchy if asked in a referendum, a majority also expects it to have disappeared by the next century.
 The average person does not volunteer to have his appendix removed unless it is in danger of rupturing. But whenever Britain's royal appendix grumbles, for no matter how trivial a reason, plenty of people seize the opportunity to debate the monarchy's future. As it happens, the republicans in this debate have a good case to make. But they are compelled to seize upon trivial opportunities to make it because governments see no gain to be had from giving them a non- trivial opportunity. Mr Blair is certainly not their man. He has already changed much of Britain's constitution. He wants to make a mark on history and his party contains many vocal republicans. Some MPs are now demanding closer financial scrutiny of the royals. But this is the prime minister who leapt instinctively to the defence of the monarchy after the death of Princess Diana, and seemed only to profit from it. For the present, there are fewer safe votes in republicanism, however strong the constitutional case for it. Let the royal appendix grumble.

 DESPITE the best efforts of programmers, there are still many things that computers just cannot do. Examples include distinguishing between suspicious and legitimate behaviour on a corporate network, or sorting junk e-mail from genuinely important messages, or providing detailed answers to particular questions. For these tasks, which require judgment, expertise and experience that cannot be easily captured in software, some firms have adopted the unusual tactic of using people as part of their network infrastructure. Such ""cyborg"" companies use computers as levers for the mind, to make the most of precious human expertise.
 Counterpane Internet Security, based in San Jose, California, uses this technique to provide a security-guard service for corporate networks. Its founder, Bruce Schneier, realised after many years of working as a security consultant that no network could ever be made truly secure, no matter how much fancy hardware and software was available. There would always be weak spots, often caused by human failings. The best approach to security, Mr Schneier decided, was to assume that break-ins will occur--and to use people to spot them.
 Special software exists to identify network intrusions, but once an attacker has worked out how the software works, it can be circumvented. Human experts, on the other hand, are harder to fool, although software is still needed to enable a single operator to keep watch on dozens of networks simultaneously. Counterpane's approach is to install ""sentry"" machines on its clients' networks. These relay a stream of status messages to a central secure operations centre. Human operators sitting at consoles monitor the status of around 50 sentries at once, watching for anomalous behaviour. If anything fishy is detected, the alarm is raised and the client's technical staff can take appropriate action.
 Using highly trained people to look out for trouble has a number of benefits. For a start, there are economies of scale: since intrusions are rare, each operator can watch many networks at once. This also enables operators to spot trends that would otherwise go unnoticed--such as a hacker using a particular style of attack on several different networks, or aiming at firms in a particular business (such as banking or e-commerce). And operators can make allowances for human foibles, such as recognising the night-shift operator with chubby fingers who tends to mistype his password.
 Brightmail, based in San Francisco, also uses people to filter information flowing across the Internet. Its customers are Internet service providers that want to stop junk e-mail, or ""spam"", and messages infected with computer viruses, before they reach their intended recipients. This process can be automated, up to a point, but spammers and virus-writers quickly find ways to defeat most software filters.
 Brightmail's operators monitor decoy e-mail accounts, looking for new examples of spam or viruses that can defeat filters. When an example is found, the operators update the filter, and the new filter is then automatically relayed to Brightmail's customers. Since sending out a million junk e-mails takes quite a while, this rapid response makes it possible to detect and destroy subsequent messages before they do any damage.
 The cyborg firm that comes closest to the sci-fi vision of people plugging cables into their heads is Keen, another San Francisco firm. Keen in effect allows experts to rent out their brains over the Internet, charging by the minute. Anybody can register on Keen's website as a ""speaker"" on a particular subject, such as computer troubleshooting, tax regulations or tarot-card reading. Speakers specify when they are available and set a billing rate, which averages $2 per minute.
 Users of Keen who are looking for answers to a particular question choose a speaker and click a ""call now"" button. Keen then calls both the user and the speaker over the ordinary telephone network. Once the call is over, the user is billed and is also invited to give the speaker a numerical rating, which appears on the website and helps distinguish real experts from charlatans. Speakers pocket 70% of the call revenue; some are earning over $2,000 a week.
 According to Karl Jacob, the firm's boss, Keen has been successful- -it is one of the 20 most popular Internet merchants, and has more than 2.5m paying customers--because people want answers from people, not computers. Talking to a person is better than reading even the most detailed list of ""frequently asked questions"", he suggests, because it is easier to assess the trustworthiness of the information provided and to focus on a particular topic of interest. Keen has just launched its service in Britain, where a MORI poll found that nine out of ten people would rather talk to another person when searching for expert advice than scour the Internet. Even in the disembodied world of the web, there is a lot to be said for the human touch."," Two articles consider how companies are changing the way they use the Internet.

Human experts, on the other hand, are harder to fool, although software is still needed to enable a single operator to keep watch on dozens of networks simultaneously. Counterpane's approach is to install ""sentry"" machines on its clients' networks. These relay a stream of status messages to a central secure operations centre. Human operators sitting at consoles monitor the status of around 50 sentries at once, watching for anomalous behaviour. If anything fishy is detected, the alarm is raised and the client's technical staff can take appropriate action.
 Using highly trained people to look out for trouble has a number of benefits. For a start, there are economies of scale: since intrusions are rare, each operator can watch many networks at once. This also enables operators to spot trends that would otherwise go unnoticed--such as a hacker using a particular style of attack on several different networks, or aiming at firms in a particular business (such as banking or e-commerce). And operators can make allowances for human foibles, such as recognising the night-shift operator with chubby fingers who tends to mistype his password.
 Brightmail, based in San Francisco, also uses people to filter information flowing across the Internet. Its customers are Internet service providers that want to stop junk e-mail, or ""spam"", and messages infected with computer viruses, before they reach their intended recipients. This process can be automated, up to a point, but spammers and virus-writers quickly find ways to defeat most software filters.
 Brightmail's operators monitor decoy e-mail accounts, looking for new examples of spam or viruses that can defeat filters. When an example is found, the operators update the filter, and the new filter is then automatically relayed to Brightmail's customers. Since sending out a million junk e-mails takes quite a while, this rapid response makes it possible to detect and destroy subsequent messages before they do any damage.
 The cyborg firm that comes closest to the sci-fi vision of people plugging cables into their heads is Keen, another San Francisco firm. Keen in effect allows experts to rent out their brains over the Internet, charging by the minute. Anybody can register on Keen's website as a ""speaker"" on a particular subject, such as computer troubleshooting, tax regulations or tarot-card reading. Speakers specify when they are available and set a billing rate, which averages $2 per minute.
 Users of Keen who are looking for answers to a particular question choose a speaker and click a ""call now"" button. Keen then calls both the user and the speaker over the ordinary telephone network. Once the call is over, the user is billed and is also invited to give the speaker a numerical rating, which appears on the website and helps distinguish real experts from charlatans. Speakers pocket 70% of the call revenue; some are earning over $2,000 a week.
 According to Karl Jacob, the firm's boss, Keen has been successful- -it is one of the 20 most popular Internet merchants, and has more than 2.5m paying customers--because people want answers from people, not computers. Talking to a person is better than reading even the most detailed list of ""frequently asked questions"", he suggests, because it is easier to assess the trustworthiness of the information provided and to focus on a particular topic of interest. Keen has just launched its service in Britain, where a MORI poll found that nine out of ten people would rather talk to another person when searching for expert advice than scour the Internet. Even in the disembodied world of the web, there is a lot to be said for the human touch.",740,Japan,A29-8206,,False,,0,True

 FOR months the rift between the reformist minority and conservative mainstream in Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) had been widening. When it came to drawing up a set of emergency measures to revive the sickly economy, the two sides almost came to blows. On April 4th Hakuo Yanagisawa, the reform-minded minister of financial affairs, faced off with Shizuka Kamei, the party's policy chief, who is a die-hard interventionist. Disagreements over the detail and timing of some proposals delayed the package's announcement for two days. What was unveiled was still underwhelming. The stockmarket slid again.
 The package had once promised more. It was not, people said, going to rely on big-spending programmes, beloved by Mr Kamei and his cronies, to jump-start the economy. Under Mr Yanagisawa's influence, it set out to promote structural reform. In the end, the two main proposals were watered down, with other crucial details lacking.
 The first proposal aims to strengthen Japan's fragile banks, which have 70 trillion ($560 billion) or so of problem loans on their books. To speed the process up, new measures have set deadlines for banks to write off non-performing loans. Banks are to be urged to write off some 13 trillion of existing loans to borrowers classified as ""in danger of bankruptcy"" within two years.
 The plan fails to respond to the true scale of the banks' problems, warns Moody's, a rating agency. It ignores masses of other troubled loans that are better rated by the banks, but are, in reality, just as wobbly. Had this new scheme been implemented in March 2000, then banks would not have had to write off loans to Sogo, a giant retailer that went bust shortly afterwards. Moody's predicts that banks' potential losses from such problem loans could exceed 20 trillion.
 The package is also vague about how the government will cope with unemployment and the need for retraining that would come with widespread bankruptcies in businesses the banks are now propping up, notably in retailing and construction. It thus raises doubts about whether the government is serious about structural reform at all.
 The government's second proposal is to set up a share-buying fund to help shrink the banks' loss-ridden equity portfolios. The new vehicle is designed to buy shares from the banks at their market value and eventually to sell them publicly in the form of mutual funds. Who will run the entity, or pay for its purchases, has yet to be decided.
 The move is meant, in part, to help banks unwind the large cross- shareholdings that they hold in their corporate chums. That could help to shake up a lot of industries that have until now been shielded from hostile bids. Reducing the banks' equity holdings would also make them less vulnerable to stockmarket gyrations. Banks own some 43 trillion of shares, equivalent to nearly one-and-a-half times their capital. The government plans to limit this in future.
 But why does the government need to set up a fund to help the banks do this? One argument is that large share sales by the banks would make the stockmarket stagger. The prospect of sales was blamed last month for sending the benchmark Nikkei 225 index to its lowest in 16 years.
 Kathy Matsui of Goldman Sachs takes a different view. It is the low returns on equity, she argues, that are to blame for the stockmarket's weakness. Even if the new fund boosted share prices, gains would be short-lived without the better profitability that would follow restructuring and deregulation. In the meantime, there is a danger that government intervention could dent faith in the stockmarket's role of pricing capital. The government could drive investors away, especially foreigners.
 Mr Kamei seems intent on providing a short-term fix for the banks, all the same--especially since his party faces upper-house elections in July. What is more, starting in September most banks will have to subtract equity losses from their capital bases. Even if the stockmarket stays where it is, this will dent banks' capital--and the market could fall further. Mr Kamei wants to help by having the fund approved and set up by then.
 Mr Yanagisawa, who has repeatedly argued against old-style quick fixes, refuses to promise this. That is understandable. Helping them to close their books in September would not deal with the banks' basic challenges: how to write off bad loans and where to get the money to do it. If the banks need public funds to help them clean house (and Mr Yanagisawa's claims that they do not are disingenuous), the government should provide them directly--with harsh conditions attached--rather than give them an indirect, pain-free, bailout.
 Mr Yanagisawa has won a small victory, if you count beating back some of the more blatant bailout schemes. But can he hold on to his job? The LDP and the government now face a vacuum after Yoshiro Mori, the prime minister, announced his resignation on April 6th. A new leader will not be chosen until April 24th. The uncertainty continues.","  Yet another emergency package disappoints in Japan

 ""THIS is a total reversal of the past,"" declared Junichiro Koizumi as he won the election for the presidency of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), and with it the prime ministership. And he was right. In Japanese political terms his accession, shoving aside the anointed candidate of the party bosses, was little short of revolutionary. But now, as history has repeatedly shown, there is bound to be some form of counter-revolution.
 Until even a week ago, no one would have given much for Mr Koizumi's chances. His main opponent, Ryutaro Hashimoto, had appeared to have the LDP election stitched up. His faction, after all, is by far the largest of the LDP's groups and always used to get its way. A conservative alliance between business, the banks and the rural voter, it is one of the main impediments to the reforms that Japan so badly needs, and which Mr Koizumi is trying to deliver.
 Mr Koizumi's victory was a consequence of an apparently minor change to the party's election procedures, which expanded the vote given to ordinary party members by giving each of Japan's 47 prefectures three votes, out of a total of 487. Because they were mostly cast as blocks, the result was startling: a landslide for the unorthodox Mr Koizumi, with his silver suit, dishevelled hair and professed liking for heavy metal music. When the parliamentarians came to vote, the result of the ""primary"" prompted enough of the other factions to back Mr Koizumi to ensure his victory. That, however, was the relatively easy part. He now has to deliver.
 The new prime minister's biggest difficulty is probably his own party. The sorts of reforms he talks about--slashing government spending to restore the public finances and allowing heavily- indebted businesses to go bust--are anathema to the LDP's traditionalists, who have systematically watered down all attempts in the past to dispense similar medicine. Such changes, after all, would hit hardest at some of the LDP's most committed, and generous, supporters.
 The pressure on Mr Koizumi to backtrack will be intense, and unfortunately, there are already signs that he is ready to do so: he is talking about the virtues of compromise, and has struck some sort of a deal with Shizuka Kamei, one of the main LDP architects of Japan's failed attempts to spend its way out of the recession that has afflicted it since the early 1990s. Could Mr Kamei's endorsement mean that Mr Koizumi is already shifting before even being sworn in?
 Nor will the pressures for immobility come only from within the party. After it lost its majority in the 1998 election for the upper house of parliament, the LDP was forced into coalition government, and is now dependent on the much smaller New Komeito and New Conservative Party. But New Komeito is resistant to the kinds of reforms that Mr Koizumi is billed as wanting to make. Any attempt to end the privileges of Japan's farmers, shopkeepers or postal workers (the privatisation of the post office, with its vast savings deposits, is a pet project of Mr Koizumi's) will not go down well.
 Mr Koizumi's other main task is to avoid an electoral catastrophe for his party this July in the election to the upper house. His victory, after all, comes courtesy only of the LDP's members, not the voters at large. Though he will be able to claim that after barely two months it is hardly his fault if the LDP-led coalition loses its majority in the upper house, as was expected at least until Mr Koizumi took over, such an outcome would make the business of governing Japan nearly impossible: the upper house, though not as influential as the lower house, has extensive powers of veto. The leader of the main opposition party, Yukio Hatoyama, has already vowed to use victory in July to force a new election for the lower house, which might smash the LDP there as well.
 Stand and deliver
 How can Mr Koizumi avoid this awful fate? Only by delivering reforms that actually seem to be working. The trouble is that the timing is so tight. True, voters seem to be fed up with the LDP's spendthrift ways, which have already taken Japan's debt to 120% of GDP, the highest ratio in the developed world. And true, too, that they are concerned about a banking system which, on a broad definition, is reckoned to have more than $1 trillion in bad or doubtful debt on its books. But reforming either of these inevitably means short-term pain. The benefits would not appear until long after the election.
 Besides, for all his carefully cultivated maverick image, Mr Koizumi is rather an insider, the son and grandson of former LDP members of parliament, and a minister in two previous cabinets, including that of Mr Hashimoto when he was prime minister. Mr Koizumi loyally supported the disastrous outgoing prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, almost to the end.
 Yet if there is one thing that emerges from all opinion studies and recent by-elections, it is that the Japanese are fed up with established politicians, whether of the LDP or of the main opposition party, the Democratic Party of Japan. Time after time, they have rejected the mainstream candidates in elections, preferring instead novelists, NGO workers or entertainers. By reaching over the heads of his party elders, and campaigning in a deliberately American style, Mr Koizumi has at least shown that he understands the problem, and that he offers some of the right solutions. He will need, and he deserves, a lot of luck in implementing them."," Junichiro Koizumi's achievement in winning the leadership of Liberal Democrats is impressive--and so is the battle in front of him

 ""GAMBARO!"" cheered Junichiro Koizumi, punching the air with his fist. ""Let's do our best!"" Japan's new prime minister will have to do better than that. By winning the leadership election of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) against the wishes of its top men, Mr Koizumi has already performed one conjuring trick. If he is to honour his bold promises of reform, he will have to perform another.
 No one seemed more surprised by the election upset than Mr Koizumi himself. Only a week ago, Ryutaro Hashimoto seemed to have the keys to the kantei, the prime minister's official residence, in his pocket. Now Mr Hashimoto has been soundly beaten and his faction, which controlled Japanese politics for nearly 30 years, finds itself out in the cold. ""It seems the earth is shaking,"" said Mr Koizumi, his flowery rhetoric getting the better of him. ""The simmering magma is about to explode.""
 This is a disaster for the party bosses and they will want to put it behind them as quickly as possible. Along with his own faction, by far the biggest in the LDP, Mr Hashimoto was also the choice of Hiromu Nonaka, the party's top power-broker. Yet while Mr Nonaka was stitching up the parliamentary vote, the LDP's local chapters had other ideas. The last time the LDP changed leaders, a year ago, the party's 2.3m rank-and-file members had no say in picking Yoshiro Mori, a terrible choice. This time they demanded a big vote, and cast it in such overwhelming numbers for Mr Koizumi that his popularity carried the parliamentary party too.
 Mr Hashimoto's faction was supposed to be the mightiest vote- gathering machine in Japanese politics. Put together by Kakuei Tanaka, the father of money politics, and lovingly tended by Noboru Takeshita, his political heir, the influence of Mr Hashimoto's faction reaches far down into the industrial support groups, whose members make up two thirds of the LDP's party faithful. Once the faction had picked Mr Hashimoto, the word duly went out to the shopkeepers, the farmers and the postal workers. According to the Asahi newspaper, the postal workers' outfit, whose 250,000 members form the LDP's single biggest support group, was asked to return blank ballot papers on to which Mr Hashimoto's name would then be written. Yet with an election for the upper house of parliament looming in July and the LDP desperately unpopular, the party revolted. ""We picked the best man to lead us into the election battle,"" says one party hack. ""It's as simple as that.""
 Mr Koizumi will now have to prove that he is more than a ""poster boy for the elections"", as Naoto Kan, a leading opposition politician, is calling him. With his shaggy permed hair and outspoken views, Mr Koizumi's carefully cultivated image as a political eccentric makes him popular with voters, who are heartily sick of mainstream politics, though, as the LDP's election has shown, Mr Koizumi can play factional politics with as much finesse as any insider.
 Not so grey
 Parts of Mr Koizumi's colourful new line-up look decidedly experimental. With a nod, perhaps, to the unpopularity of all elected politicians in Japan, Mr Koizumi has leant heavily on unelected policy experts like Heizo Takenaka, a sparky, media-friendly economist who, as an adviser to the last administration, became known as ""Mr Mori's brain"". Mr Takenaka's new job, as economy minister, gives him a chance to push for the sweeping structural reforms he has championed outside government.
 Five of Mr Koizumi's cabinet will be women, including Atsuko Toyama, another non-politician, and, as foreign minister, the acid- tongued Makiko Tanaka, who, like Mr Koizumi, has an image as an LDP outsider. Critically, Mr Koizumi has also kept on as minister in charge of the financial clean-up Hakuo Yanagisawa, whose tough plans for the banks have come under assault from the LDP establishment. Less likely to please the markets, however, is Mr Koizumi's strange choice for finance minister, the 79-year-old Masajuro Shiokawa, an old political ally with scant financial experience. The hope had been that he would put a fellow-reformer, such as Koichi Kato, into that job.
 The new prime minister still falls far short of the sort of platform he needs to push genuine reform. However he juggles the numbers, liberal thinkers like Mr Koizumi are a minority in the LDP. He has the support of Taku Yamasaki, whom he quickly installed as the party's secretary-general, and possibly of Mr Kato, who last autumn took on the Hashimoto faction and lost. But Mr Koizumi must reach beyond the LDP's ""anti-mainstream"" if he is to survive more than a few months. He has already started trying to sway factions within the LDP, such as that of Shizuka Kamei, which are at heart hostile to his ideas. Inevitably, this will involve compromise, as did his appointment of Taro Aso, the outgoing economics minister, to the post of LDP policy chief. Mr Aso's past fiscal policies conflict with Mr Koizumi's plans.
 Eventually, he may even have to reach outside the LDP's existing coalition partners, the Buddhist-backed New Komeito and the New Conservative Party, although he is sticking with them for now. New Komeito, which champions Japan's underdogs, is an active brake on reform. If truth be told, Mr Koizumi is closer to elements within the main opposition Democratic Party of Japan than he is to much of his own party. A fundamental realignment of Japanese politics, long predicted and long overdue, may beckon again.
 Mr Koizumi's campaign promises (""Change the LDP, change Japan"") have aroused expectations that something is about to happen for the better. Mr Koizumi's new cabinet is an interesting start. But, with his camp surrounded by counter-revolutionaries, he has only three precious months in which to turn the LDP's dismal fortunes round. After July's election comes another LDP presidential poll in September, unless the party changes its rules first. Mr Koizumi's televisual charms, winning smile and punchy soundbites will get him only so far. Japan's voters are in a brutal mood. They want nothing less than miracles.","  Will the "" Koizumi revolution "" catch or fizzle ?

With his shaggy permed hair and outspoken views , Mr Koizumi 's carefully cultivated image as a political eccentric makes him popular with voters , who are heartily sick of mainstream politics , though , as the LDP 's election has shown , Mr Koizumi can play factional politics with as much finesse as any insider . 
  Not so grey 
  Parts of Mr Koizumi 's colourful new line - up look decidedly experimental . With a nod , perhaps , to the unpopularity of all elected politicians in Japan , Mr Koizumi has leant heavily on unelected policy experts like Heizo Takenaka , a sparky , media - friendly economist who , as an adviser to the last administration , became known as "" Yoshiro Mori's brain "" . Mr Takenaka 's new job , as economy minister , gives him a chance to push for the sweeping structural reforms he has championed outside government . 
  Five of Mr Koizumi 's cabinet will be women , including Atsuko Toyama , another non - politician , and , as foreign minister , the acid- tongued Makiko Tanaka , who , like Mr Koizumi , has an image as an LDP outsider . Critically , Mr Koizumi has also kept on as minister in charge of the financial clean - up Hakuo Yanagisawa , whose tough plans for the banks have come under assault from the LDP establishment . Less likely to please the markets , however , is Mr Koizumi 's strange choice for finance minister , the 79 - year - old Masajuro Shiokawa , an old political ally with scant financial experience . The hope had been that he would put a fellow - reformer , such as Koichi Kato , into that job . 
  The new prime minister still falls far short of the sort of platform he needs to push genuine reform . However he juggles the numbers , liberal thinkers like Mr Koizumi are a minority in the LDP . He has the support of Taku Yamasaki , whom he quickly installed as the party 's secretary - general , and possibly of Mr Kato , who last autumn took on the Hashimoto faction and lost . But Mr Koizumi must reach beyond the LDP 's "" anti - mainstream "" if he is to survive more than a few months . He has already started trying to sway factions within the LDP , such as that of Shizuka Kamei , which are at heart hostile to his ideas . Inevitably , this will involve compromise , as did his appointment of Taro Aso , the outgoing economics minister , to the post of LDP policy chief . Mr Aso 's past fiscal policies conflict with Mr Koizumi 's plans . 
  Eventually , he may even have to reach outside the LDP 's existing coalition partners , the Buddhist - backed New Komeito and the New Conservative Party , although he is sticking with them for now . New Komeito , which champions Japan 's underdogs , is an active brake on reform . If truth be told , Mr Koizumi is closer to elements within the main opposition Democratic Party of Japan than he is to much of his own party . A fundamental realignment of Japanese politics , long predicted and long overdue , may beckon again . 
  Mr Koizumi 's campaign promises ( "" Change the LDP , change Japan "" ) have aroused expectations that something is about to happen for the better . Mr Koizumi 's new cabinet is an interesting start . But , with his camp surrounded by counter - revolutionaries , he has only three precious months in which to turn the LDP 's dismal fortunes round . After July 's election comes another LDP presidential poll in September , unless the party changes its rules first . Mr Koizumi 's televisual charms , winning smile and punchy soundbites will get him only so far . Japan 's voters are in a brutal mood . They want nothing less than miracles .",740,Japan,A29-8206,IN TERM,True,Yoshiro Mori,2,True

 POLITICS is in crisis. The people despair. A dashing reformer appears. The people rejoice. The reformer fails. The people despair. Never mind the surge of hope that has lifted Junichiro Koizumi, Japan's new prime minister, into power. Tokyo's hard-bitten political hacks think they have seen it all before.
 In 1993, a maverick politician, Morihiro Hosokawa, took power with promises of reform. By the following April, this bold new leader had resigned. Mr Koizumi has Mr Hosokawa's looks, charisma and heterodox appeal, though the match is not perfect: not even Mr Hosokawa was as popular.
 Accounting for Mr Koizumi's instant and overwhelming popularity is by no means easy. He comes from the same party, the discredited Liberal Democrats (LDP), as his ridiculed predecessor, Yoshiro Mori. Mr Koizumi and Mr Mori even come from the same wing of the LDP, the Mori faction, which has a distinctly conservative colour.
 Mr Koizumi has already taken a new broom to some corners of Mr Mori's cabinet (see table). But some of Mr Mori's old dinosaurs have won themselves another term in office. The two men even share many policies: Mr Koizumi's first job will be to push through an economic bundle that Mr Mori drew up in April. There is one big difference, though. In its final months, Mr Mori's cabinet had an approval rating in single figures. Amazingly, Mr Koizumi's tops 80%.
 Part of Mr Koizumi's appeal is his flair for theatre. He looks good. He sounds good. He plays the press skilfully. Where Mr Koizumi has made cabinet changes, he has brought in slick performers, like himself: Makiko Tanaka as foreign minister, for instance, and Heizo Takenaka, a bouncy academic, as economics minister. Mr Mori was a backroom co-ordinator. In the glare of the television cameras, he seemed old-fashioned and oafish. Mr Koizumi is a thoroughly modern politician, with an ear for the right soundbite. There may be fierce resistance to his plan to ""change Japan"", he says, ""but I must grit my teeth and face it.""
 Unfortunately, counter the cynics, these soundbites are creating unrealistic expectations of change. As Mr Koizumi runs into opposition to his reform plans--from his own party, his coalition partners, bureaucrats and businessmen--his ratings will falter and he will fail, just as Mr Hosokawa did. Yasuo Fukuda, the government's top spokesman, seems as uncomfortable with Mr Koizumi's soaring popularity as he was with the cabinet's dismal ratings when he served under Mr Mori. Thank you for the vote of confidence, Mr Fukuda told reporters this week. The new government would certainly do its best not to let the people down.
 In the newspapers and on the talk shows, meanwhile, the Koizumi revolution marches on. He plans to clean up the banks, voters are told, and restore competitiveness to once world-beating industries. He will sort out the government's debt problem and balance the budget. He will overhaul the bureaucracy, change education and reform the legal system. He will even rewrite the constitution. There will be nothing sacred in his zealous pursuit of structural reform.
 Mr Koizumi clearly over-reaches himself a bit. But those who patiently wait for him to honour his extravagant promises may be missing the point about what has really changed in Japan. It is not just the LDP's old-fashioned policies that turn off the voters, but its stubbornly old-fashioned way of conducting politics. Its policy presentation is execrable. Its leaders are old and unattractive and they mumble their lines, even when they read their speeches. Regardless of the substance, on which the jury is still out, Mr Koizumi represents a new style of politics in Japan. His rise to power is a sign that Tokyo's spin-free political world has at last woken up to the role that the media play in politics everywhere else.","  Junichiro Koizumi arouses great expectations .

But loss of power, said somebody else who might as well have been talking about a Liberal, tends to corrupt absolutely. This is a motto that Charles Kennedy, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, may want to bear in mind as the general election approaches.
 Tony Blair is expected to announce next week that the election will take place on June 7th. To judge by recent polls, the Conservatives are cruising to a clobbering. Until recently, they had been adding up how many seats William Hague needs to gain in order to keep his job as their party's leader. But Mr Hague may not gain at all. A MORI poll for the Sun this week predicts that Labour is on course to win 443 seats, puffing up its majority from an already bloated 179 MPs in the present parliament to 227 in the next. The number of Conservative MPs will fall from 165 to 158, and the number of Liberal Democrats from 47 to 30.
 That would be a dismal result for both opposition parties. But in one respect it would be worse for the Liberal Democrats than for the Conservatives. Even if the Tories ditched their leader, they would not lose hope of returning to power one day. The Lib Dems would keep their leader, but would know in their hearts that power was farther beyond their grasp than ever.
 This is not the spiel you hear from official Lib Demmery. The official line is that the third party has never been nearer to office; that only Mr Blair's timidity, and the indecent size of Labour's majority, stopped the creation of a Lib-Lab coalition in 1997; that winning 46 seats in that election put more Liberals in the Commons than at any time since Lloyd George; that last year's by- election capture of Romsey was an earnest of victories to come; and that, all the while, the Lib Dems have been exercising real influence. They sat in on a cabinet committee, shaping Labour's constitutional reforms. They run plenty of town halls. In the new parliaments of Scotland and Wales, they rule in coalition with Labour. A few more heaves and surely there will come an election when Lib Dems hold the balance of power at Westminster and can force the Labour Party to scrap the iniquitous non-proportional voting system that has locked them out of power?
 Well, it is possible. But it is growing less likely. In the euphoria after Romsey, top Lib Dems speculated that a Tory collapse could propel them as high as 100 seats. They now admit in private that they will be lucky to keep the seats they have. As MORI's poll indicates, the Tories could indeed collapse. But, contrary to what some guileless Lib Dems imagine, this would not do much good to their own party. A cull of Conservatives would push Mr Blair's majority farther into the stratosphere, making it even harder for Mr Kennedy to clinch a Lib-Lab deal on voting reform than it was for his predecessor, Paddy Ashdown, who got on better with Mr Blair.
 If the immediate outlook is gloomy, what of the longer term? It is worse. The Lib Dems' strength in Parliament does not reflect their underlying voting strength. The 46 seats they won in 1997 were indeed a record, and twice the number they won in 1992. But even so the party's share of the vote, at 17.2%, fell for the fourth election in a row; and most polls suggest that it will fall again. In short, the closer you look, the farther from office this party appears.
 Which brings back Lord Acton. Loss of power is a terrible thing for a political party. But losing hope in the possibility of power is worse. The question that has plagued Liberals for more than half a century is how a third party can break open a two-party system.
 In the 1960s, Jo Grimond, leader of what was then simply the Liberal Party, thought he had an answer. The plan was simple, though he knew it would take time: move to the centre-left and replace Labour as the alternative to the Conservatives when class loyalties began to grow weaker and socialism lost its allure. Initially, Mr Ashdown adopted the same plan. What neither foresaw was the possibility of a Tony Blair: a politician who was not a socialist, and who despised class politics, but who nonetheless found a way to lead the Labour Party without breaking it apart. Mr Blair has, in effect, imposed on Labour the Grimond master-plan for the Liberals.
 For obvious reasons of brand differentiation, Lib Dem leaders do not endorse this version of events. Mr Blair is no liberal, splutters Mr Kennedy: just look at New Labour's authoritarian record on asylum- seekers, jury trials, civil liberty and all the rest. But although broadly right, Mr Kennedy's case against Mr Blair has two weaknesses. One is that Mr Blair is enough of a liberal to have grabbed the very role that Grimond mapped out for his own lot as the non-socialist alternative to the Conservatives. The other is that Mr Kennedy is not much of a liberal either.
 The voters may not yet have noticed it--a third party must be a ""centre"" party, mustn't it?--but the Lib Dems have moved to the left of New Labour. Indeed, John Meadowcroft, a political scientist at London University's Queen Mary and Westfield College, argues in a recent Political Quarterly that they are more recognisably social democrat than liberal. They accentuate positive liberty (empowerment) over negative liberty (freedom from coercion). They call for higher taxes. Their instinct is for the state, not the preferences of consumers, to shape public services.
 None of this is surprising: Mr Kennedy himself joined the Lib Dems by way of the Social Democrats, and many Lib Dem councillors have spent their political careers opposing the language of the market that they heard from the mouth of the hated Margaret Thatcher. But if there is a market opportunity in British politics, it is the absence of a party that dares to be liberal in both its economics and its social policy. This tradition, Mr Meadowcroft argues, is the Lib Dems' to reclaim. It may not win them power, but their present strategy shows few signs of doing that either. Besides, it might even be worth doing for its own sake.","  POWER corrupts , said Lord Acton , a Liberal peer .

 THE British like races, especially if they can place a bet on its outcome. But not even a nation of punters is going to be able to extract much suspense from the general election due on June 7th. If Tony Blair's Labour Party is not re-elected for a second term, and with another handsome majority, the nation's psephologists will have to eat not just their hats but the contents of an entire milliner's shop. Parties have won from behind before, but none from as far behind as William Hague's Conservative Party now lies in the polls. Since Labour's 1997 landslide, and except for one blip during last September's fuel crisis, the Tories have trailed well behind the government (see chart). A MORI poll in the Times on May 10th put Labour on 54%, the Tories on 30% and the Liberal Democrats on 13%.
 A certain Labour victory does not mean that the campaign itself has to be dull. For different reasons, the leaders of all three main parties have an interest in injecting drama into it. Mr Hague has the strongest incentive: a feisty campaign may help him ward off a leadership challenge when the election is over. Charles Kennedy's first general election as leader of the Liberal Democrats is a test of his ability to maintain the separate identity of the third party now that Mr Blair has moved Labour sharply to the centre of British politics. Mr Blair himself needs to inject enough enthusiasm into the campaign to prevent Labour supporters from staying home on polling day. The last thing Mr Blair wants to convey in his campaign is the slightest sense of arrogance or complacency.
 Enter Mr Humble. The prime minister may have a stonking lead in the polls, but he spent much of this week stressing that he does not take a single vote for granted. In a final cabinet meeting on May 7th, Mr Blair told his ministers to acknowledge that the government had not achieved all its aims in the first term and to set out its record ""with honesty and humility"". The next day, a shirt-sleeved prime minister announced the date of the election not from Number 10 but from St Saviour's and St Olave's, an inner-city girls' school in London. Standing before the girls ""with a sense of both humility and hope"", he said that Labour had built strong foundations but that no government with ambitions as lofty as his could complete its programme in a single term.
 Mr Hague is campaigning as Mr Angry. On the day of Mr Blair's stage-managed election announcement, the Conservative leader launched his campaign with some rambunctious soap-box oratory on a high street in Watford, north of London. He promised to return some of the taxpayers' money the Labour government had ""stolen"" in ""stealth taxes"", to increase the number of policemen and to hit crime hard. He reserved his main ire for Mr Blair's plan to take Britain deeper into the European Union and to ditch the pound in favour of the euro. ""Most of all,"" said Mr Hague, ""we are going to make sure that we still have the power to govern our own country, because that is what is being taken away.""
 The Lib Dems' Mr Kennedy is in danger of coming over as the election's Mr Snooty. With a record 47 seats to defend, the third party is eager to attract the tactical votes of Labour supporters in marginals where Labour cannot win. This gives Mr Kennedy a good reason to be harder on the rival opposition party than on the government itself. He is therefore ""disappointed"" in Labour, but heaps scorn on the Tories, especially for what he calls their scaremongering on Europe and asylum-seekers. The Tories, Mr Kennedy declared this week, were a negative and destructive opposition, which preyed on people's fears. His own party was a positive, constructive outfit that addressed people's aspirations.
 Seriously, though
 Can Messrs Humble, Angry and Snooty inject the missing drama into this election? Not if voters conclude that they are hamming up their parts. In real life, the easygoing Mr Kennedy is not snooty; the equable Mr Hague is seldom angry; and the humility of Mr Blair is not invariably the first attribute that people remark in the prime minister. Nor are the parties as far apart on policy as their electioneering pretends.
 Mr Blair said at St Saviour's that the differences between the two main parties were ""more stark than at any time since 1983"". He exaggerates: 1983 was the election in which Michael Foot threw the Labour Party into a suicidal battle against Margaret Thatcher's Tories by campaigning for high taxes, stronger state intervention in the economy, withdrawal from the Common Market and unilateral nuclear disarmament. This time, the sound and fury of electioneering cannot disguise the narrowing policy gap between the parties.
 According to Mr Hague, the Conservatives remain a tax-reducing party, committed philosophically to a smaller state. But the philosophy has yet to show up in the numbers. The Conservative manifesto, published on May 10th, contains some eye-catching tax- reduction promises, such as a cut of 6p per litre in fuel duty, to be implemented within a year of the election. However, the Conservative promise to spend 8 billion ($11.4 billion) less than Labour by 2003 amounts to less than 1% of GDP. Besides, the Tories claim that they would match Labour's spending promises on hospitals, schools and crime.
 Labour contrasts the Tories' ""irresponsible"" tax cuts with its own bold plans for public ""investment"" (ie, spending). But its second- term ""pledge card"", promising 10,000 extra teachers, 20,000 extra nurses and 10,000 extra doctors, is notable mainly for its caution. Mr Blair has hinted strongly that he will once again rule out an increase in income taxes.
 The big policy difference between the parties is the euro. Mr Hague made this the main of thrust of a flaming final onslaught on Mr Blair in the last prime minister's questions before the dissolution of Parliament. He said that the ""central deception"" of the election was going to be Mr Blair's pretence that he would give voters a choice on joining the European single currency, whereas Labour's real intention was to ""bounce"" them into membership.
 The Conservatives' promise to rule out British euro membership for the foreseeable future is one of their few policies that go down better than Labour's in the opinion polls. But, with a referendum promised before any decision on joining, there is no evidence that this is an election winner. Unless, that is, the election Mr Hague has in mind is the internal party contest that Mr Angry may have to fight if he is to keep his job after the general election."," Mr Humble, Mr Angry and Mr Snooty: three characters in search of a drama

This gives Mr Kennedy a good reason to be harder on the rival opposition party than on the government itself. He is therefore ""disappointed"" in Labour, but heaps scorn on the Tories, especially for what he calls their scaremongering on Europe and asylum-seekers. The Tories, Mr Kennedy declared this week, were a negative and destructive opposition, which preyed on people's fears. His own party was a positive, constructive outfit that addressed people's aspirations.
 Seriously, though
 Can Messrs Humble, Angry and Snooty inject the missing drama into this election? Not if voters conclude that they are hamming up their parts. In real life, the easygoing Mr Kennedy is not snooty; the equable Mr Hague is seldom angry; and the humility of Mr Blair is not invariably the first attribute that people remark in the prime minister. Nor are the parties as far apart on policy as their electioneering pretends.
 Mr Blair said at St Saviour's that the differences between the two main parties were ""more stark than at any time since 1983"". He exaggerates: 1983 was the election in which Michael Foot threw the Labour Party into a suicidal battle against Margaret Thatcher's Tories by campaigning for high taxes, stronger state intervention in the economy, withdrawal from the Common Market and unilateral nuclear disarmament. This time, the sound and fury of electioneering cannot disguise the narrowing policy gap between the parties.
 According to Mr Hague, the Conservatives remain a tax-reducing party, committed philosophically to a smaller state. But the philosophy has yet to show up in the numbers. The Conservative manifesto, published on May 10th, contains some eye-catching tax- reduction promises, such as a cut of 6p per litre in fuel duty, to be implemented within a year of the election. However, the Conservative promise to spend 8 billion ($11.4 billion) less than Labour by 2003 amounts to less than 1% of GDP. Besides, the Tories claim that they would match Labour's spending promises on hospitals, schools and crime.
 Labour contrasts the Tories' ""irresponsible"" tax cuts with its own bold plans for public ""investment"" (ie, spending). But its second- term ""pledge card"", promising 10,000 extra teachers, 20,000 extra nurses and 10,000 extra doctors, is notable mainly for its caution. Mr Blair has hinted strongly that he will once again rule out an increase in income taxes.
 The big policy difference between the parties is the euro. Mr Hague made this the main of thrust of a flaming final onslaught on Mr Blair in the last prime minister's questions before the dissolution of Parliament. He said that the ""central deception"" of the election was going to be Mr Blair's pretence that he would give voters a choice on joining the European single currency, whereas Labour's real intention was to ""bounce"" them into membership.
 The Conservatives' promise to rule out British euro membership for the foreseeable future is one of their few policies that go down better than Labour's in the opinion polls. But, with a referendum promised before any decision on joining, there is no evidence that this is an election winner. Unless, that is, the election Mr Hague has in mind is the internal party contest that Mr Angry may have to fight if he is to keep his job after the general election.",740,Japan,A29-8206,,False,,0,True

 WILLIAM HAGUE enters this election with an unenviable record. He has never been ahead of Labour in any of MORI's regular monthly opinion polls in the whole of this parliament. Even Michael Foot, Labour's leader in the disastrous 1983 election, managed to do better than that.
 True, as our chart shows, he has managed to make a little progress. Until May 2000, the Conservatives never got above the 30% mark. Since then, they have hardly ever dipped below it. They even almost managed to catch up with Labour in the immediate wake of last September's fuel crisis.
 The trouble is that the Tories have apparently been on the slide again since then. They have not fallen back below the 30% mark, but it is a very close-run thing. Little wonder gloom has descended on the Tory benches at every mention of the words ""spring election"". It would indeed take a miracle for Mr Hague to win.
 Occasionally, campaigns make a difference. During the 1997 election, for instance, Labour's poll rating fell by four percentage points, on average, during the course of the campaign as the Liberal Democrat strengthened their position. But it would be unprecedented for a 20-point lead to melt away in a three-week election campaign; after all, voters like Mr Hague even less than they liked John Major in 1997.
 Spurring lazy voters
 Nonetheless, there is no cause for cockiness in the Labour camp. Not least, turnout is a puzzler. Lots of people tell the pollsters they will vote Labour; but now that some of the gilt has fallen off the Labour gingerbread, many of them may not think it worthwhile going to the polls.
 Such fears are probably exaggerated. The polls may agree that a smaller proportion of eligible people will vote in this election than at any time since 1918; but they do not find any consistent evidence that Labour voters are more likely to stay at home than Conservative ones. In February, for example, MORI found little difference between them.
 Much more important is the disagreement that persists between the pollsters about the size of Labour's lead. Since 1997, ICM have regularly reported a lower lead than either MORI or Gallup. In recent months, that difference has averaged no less than seven points. One of the polls, at least, must be wrong.
 Then there is the pollsters' rather disappointing record in some of the key elections that have taken place since 1997. None of the polls anticipated that the Conservatives would win the 1999 European Parliament election. None of them anticipated that Labour would fail to win an overall majority in the Welsh Assembly. And, on average, all of them overestimated Labour's lead in the Scottish parliamentary elections by five points.
 In short, there are still doubts that the polling industry has solved all the problems that led to the disaster (from the pollsters' point of view) of the 1992 election. On that occasion, the polls showed a one-point Labour lead. In the event, there was an eight- point Conservative advantage. Even in 1997, the polls overestimated Labour's lead, on average, by three points. They may well overestimate again.
 Polls also measure votes, not seats. To forecast how many seats each party will win you have to know not just how many votes each will get, but where they will get them. Traditionally, pundits have got around this problem by making a simple assumption, known as ""uniform swing"". If, say, the polls point to a 2% increase in the Conservative vote and a 2% fall in the Labour vote, the pundits assume this 2% ""swing"" will happen in each and every constituency. They then just add up how many seats each party would win as a result.
 But uniform swing has become an unreliable guide. In 1992, it forecast a Conservative majority of 71. The actual figure was 21. In 1997 it anticipated a Labour majority of 131. In reality, it was 179.
 What went wrong? In fact, what happened at that election was neither luck nor happenstance. There were good reasons why the distribution of votes favoured Labour candidates in 1997--and why it is less likely to do so in 2001.
 Labour won so many seats in 1997 partly because of tactical voting against the Tories. Unprecedented numbers of Labour and Liberal Democrat supporters were so keen to evict the sleaze-tainted Major government that they switched their vote to whoever was best able to defeat the local Conservative. This gave Labour a bonus of between 25 and 35 seats.
 This time, many of these tactical voters may switch back again. In 1997, one in five people said they liked both Labour and the Liberal Democrats but disliked the Conservatives. Now, according to the latest wave of the British Election Panel study, less than one in ten take that view.
 Mr Hague may not be loved, but his party is no longer hated. This is Tony Blair's problem. Last time around, he benefited from people's hatred of the Tories; but in the intervening years, he has failed to make the voters love Labour.","  Labour feels confident , but the polls are not to be trusted

At the gift shop, the white-robed Shinto priest sells guidebooks, charms and telephone cards bearing photographs of a suicide aircraft, the prize exhibit in the shrine's museum. Inside, an inscription honours Japan's kamikaze warriors. Before the shrine, a middle-aged man in a black suit throws coins into the offertory box and claps his hands, summoning the spirits of friends or relations who gave their lives for their country. Two great gold chrysanthemum crests, symbols of the imperial household, emblazon the gate.
 It is to this Yasukuni shrine that Junichiro Koizumi, Japan's new prime minister, says he will pay an official visit on August 15th. Mr Koizumi says he wants to pay his respects to Japan's war dead, whose spirits Yasukuni enshrines and commemorates. Like most of what Mr Koizumi has said since he took office last month, his Yasukuni visit has struck a popular chord at home. Since the war, only Yasuhiro Nakasone has dared to worship at Yasukuni as prime minister, and even he went only once, after a barrage of criticism from China and South Korea blocked any return. Now, trumpets the right-wing press, the Japanese have a prime minister with the courage to brave foreign bullies and show pride in his nation. But if Mr Koizumi goes, there will be a huge uproar. Among the enshrined spirits are the souls of seven executed war criminals.
 What this says about Japan's new prime minister is not entirely clear. In part, he seems typical of a younger generation of conservative Japanese politicians. He wants to end the pretence of Japan's ""self-defence forces"" and call them what they are: modern, well-equipped armed forces. He seeks a more active role for Japan in its security alliance with America, including an explicit commitment to come to America's aid in the event of an attack on its forces in the region. That would mean revising, or at least reinterpreting, Japan's war-renouncing constitution, which Mr Koizumi also says he favours. He wants a more assertive Japan, ready to take its place among the world's great powers.
 Amid these modern nationalist currents lie traditional conservative roots. Mr Koizumi has spent his entire career in the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) among hawks, with what is now called the Mori faction. As a young man, he got a start in politics as a private secretary to Takeo Fukuda, the faction's boss at the time. Mr Fukuda did not support Japan's Asian empire-building with the passion of the faction's previous leader, Nobusuke Kishi, who was briefly imprisoned after the war as a suspected class A war criminal. But, as a bureaucrat in the 1930s, Mr Fukuda spent some of his formative years in China, where he advised the pro-Japanese puppet government in Nanjing. Among Mr Fukuda's protgs is Shintaro Ishihara, a populist nationalist and professional China- baiter who governs Tokyo. ""This is Mr Koizumi's DNA,"" says Takao Toshikawa, editor of Insideline, a newsletter.
 The trouble with books
 An early test of Mr Koizumi's populist leanings has come in the form of a row about Japanese history textbooks, whose contents the education ministry vets. On May 8th, South Korea handed Japan a list of revisions that it wants to see made to several textbooks for pupils aged 13 to 15. Of the 35 items on the Korean list, 25 concern a new book, edited by a group called the Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform, which China has also objected to. This society, formed in 1997, wants to rid history textbooks of what it says are excessive descriptions of the imperial army's cruelty in China and the rest of Asia. This ""tendency towards masochism"" teaches self- loathing and suppresses a healthy love for one's country, says the society.
 It also distorts history, argues Nobukatsu Fujioka, a Tokyo University professor and a founding member of the society. ""I am not saying that it did not commit acts of cruelty. But compared with the Chinese, or the Americans, the Japanese army was not unusually cruel,"" he says. In Mr Fujioka's view, Japanese schoolchildren are taught a naive version of history which plays up the moral barbarism of the Japanese army at the expense of the realpolitik of colonial Asia, with Japan battling America and the European powers for an equal and independent footing in the world.
 Right-wing newspapers such as the Yomiuri are thumping the table in protest at Korea's ""interference"" in Japan's domestic affairs, though the education ministry says it will bring together Japanese historians to look again at the textbooks, with Korea's complaints in mind. But Mr Koizumi has now said there will be no changes, prompting Chinese rage. He does propose that Japanese and Korean historians should work together, an old idea the Koreans say distracts from the issues at hand.
 If Mr Koizumi indeed turns out to be a moderate nationalist, he will be a pioneer in Japanese politics. Japan has passionate ideologues, on both left and right, but precious little in between. As the LDP's hawks try to rewrite the constitution, left-wing opposition parties still fight the security alliance with America. The Social Democratic Party pins its faith for peace in East Asia on a much-shrunken, strictly constitutional self-defence force and a multilateral ""comprehensive security system"". Mr Koizumi wants to restore national pride. But Japan's far-from-clean break with its past and its cold-war ideological battles have left almost no symbols of nationhood untainted. To the left, even the flag and the national anthem are symbols of repressive Japanese militarism, hopelessly entangled, like the Yasukuni shrine, with Japan's dark history."," Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, has made it clear that he is a nationalist.

 AS YOU can imagine, many absorbing press releases about this and that have landed on Bagehot's desk since the start of the present election campaign. But only one has been significant in the way that Sherlock Holmes found the failure of the dog to bark in the night significant. This was the one whose sender promised to say nothing until the campaign was over.
 The sender was the ""No"" campaign, the name under which two anti- euro pressure groups--Business for Sterling and New Europe--campaign jointly against British membership of the European single currency. In their press release, the two groups briskly remind the press that they are not involved in the general election, that neither endorses a political party, and that they exist only in order to campaign against Britain's membership of the European single currency. For the duration of the election, they have, in effect, taken a vow of silence.
 This is curious. One thing that has made this election feel flat is that the parties look alike on so many issues. The euro is a glorious exception. Here voters face a stark choice on a question that will have fateful consequences however they answer. Tony Blair says that if he is re-elected, and provided various economic tests are met, a Labour government will propose in a referendum that Britain should adopt the single currency. William Hague promises that a Conservative government would keep the pound. The choice could hardly be plainer. Or could it? One non-plain thought prompted by the vow of silence from the ""No"" campaign is that the Conservatives are in fact making it more likely, not less, that Britain will one day join the euro.
 To unravel this paradox you have to accept the evidence of the opinion polls that the Conservatives are heading for defeat. If they were somehow to win, Mr Hague would indeed go down in history as the dauntless saviour of the pound (and as a political Houdini). But if, as expected, he loses, the interesting question is what impact this will have on a referendum later on.
 Certainly, a Conservative defeat in the election is not enough, on its own, to sink the pound. The very polls which show that Mr Blair will be re-elected next month also show how many more minds the prime minister must change before he can be certain of winning a referendum. On MORI's latest figures, 70% oppose Britain's joining the euro. When, after the election, groups such as Business for Sterling and New Europe come out of purdah, the No campaign will still have public opinion on its side, as well as some decent arguments. All the same, it will be in a weaker position than before.
 Mr Hague intends in the final fortnight to fight the election as if it were the referendum on the euro. Such a strategy makes eminent sense, for him. Ruling out British membership is not only his most popular policy, but also the one that enticed Lady Thatcher to rise this week from the political dead and bestow a rare personal endorsement. Though unlikely to change many votes on polling day-- only a Martian could be surprised by her loathing of the euro--this could come in handy for Mr Hague when his leadership is questioned the morning afterwards.
 The pound has plainly been good for Mr Hague. But has Mr Hague been good for the pound?
 It is hard to see how. At a stretch, it is just about imaginable that a good Tory showing in the election would scare Mr Blair off his promised referendum. It is not altogether impossible that the Conservatives will argue so well against the euro in the remainder of the campaign that, even if they lose, public opinion on this issue can never be reversed. But these are the outer fringes of what is possible. It is far likelier that by choosing to fight the election on the euro, and then losing heavily, Mr Hague will have damaged the No campaign by associating it indelibly with his own doomed cause.
 That fellow has nothing to do with me
 All of this makes the silence of the No campaign a lot easier to understand. New Europe and Business for Sterling have long stressed that their support comes from all corners of politics: leading lights include Lords Owen and Healey, both former Labour ministers. The last thing they want is for the unpopularity of Mr Hague to rub away the popular objection to the euro.
 There is, however, yet another danger. Has Mr Hague contaminated the sound arguments for a No in the referendum by spraying so many unsound ones in the general direction of all matters European during the election?
 When it comes to the referendum, the merit of Lords Owen and Healey is not only that they are not Conservatives. It is that they are Good Europeans who nonetheless oppose British membership of the euro. Like Mr Hague, neither deems it in Britain's interest to submit to every demand the EU makes for ""ever-closer union"". But unlike Mr Hague, they do not express their objections in the juvenile language of nationhood in peril.
 Naturally, Mr Hague disavows the opinion of Sir Peter Tapsell, a veteran Conservative MP who accuses the German chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, of trying to achieve by peaceful means the domination that Hitler failed to impose on Britain by violent ones. But Mr Hague does believe that the EU threatens to make Britain ""a foreign land"". Though he says he cannot conceive of Britain leaving the EU, many senior people in his party desire just that.
 No doubt historians will argue in defence of Mr Hague that his exaggerations and ambiguities on Europe kept a divided party together and turned what used to be a political liability into an advantage, albeit not a big enough advantage to win this election. Against this, he has fallen into the trap of reinforcing the myth, cultivated by Mr Blair, that to oppose British membership of the euro is to oppose British membership of the EU itself. There could be no better way for the Conservative leader to destroy the pound he claims to love."," The Conservatives are making it more likely that Britain will scrap the pound and adopt the euro
 AS YOU can imagine, many absorbing press releases about this and that have landed on Bagehot's desk since the start of the present election campaign. But only one has been significant in the way that Sherlock Holmes found the failure of the dog to bark in the night significant. This was the one whose sender promised to say nothing until the campaign was over.
 The sender was the ""No"" campaign, the name under which two anti- euro pressure groups--Business for Sterling and New Europe--campaign jointly against British membership of the European single currency. In their press release, the two groups briskly remind the press that they are not involved in the general election, that neither endorses a political party, and that they exist only in order to campaign against Britain's membership of the European single currency. For the duration of the election, they have, in effect, taken a vow of silence.
 This is curious. One thing that has made this election feel flat is that the parties look alike on so many issues. The euro is a glorious exception. Here voters face a stark choice on a question that will have fateful consequences however they answer. Tony Blair says that if he is re-elected, and provided various economic tests are met, a Labour government will propose in a referendum that Britain should adopt the single currency. William Hague promises that a Conservative government would keep the pound. The choice could hardly be plainer. Or could it? One non-plain thought prompted by the vow of silence from the ""No"" campaign is that the Conservatives are in fact making it more likely, not less, that Britain will one day join the euro.
 To unravel this paradox you have to accept the evidence of the opinion polls that the Conservatives are heading for defeat. If they were somehow to win, Mr Hague would indeed go down in history as the dauntless saviour of the pound (and as a political Houdini). But if, as expected, he loses, the interesting question is what impact this will have on a referendum later on.
 Certainly, a Conservative defeat in the election is not enough, on its own, to sink the pound. The very polls which show that Mr Blair will be re-elected next month also show how many more minds the prime minister must change before he can be certain of winning a referendum. On MORI's latest figures, 70% oppose Britain's joining the euro. When, after the election, groups such as Business for Sterling and New Europe come out of purdah, the No campaign will still have public opinion on its side, as well as some decent arguments. All the same, it will be in a weaker position than before.
 Mr Hague intends in the final fortnight to fight the election as if it were the referendum on the euro. Such a strategy makes eminent sense, for him. Ruling out British membership is not only his most popular policy, but also the one that enticed Lady Thatcher to rise this week from the political dead and bestow a rare personal endorsement. Though unlikely to change many votes on polling day-- only a Martian could be surprised by her loathing of the euro--this could come in handy for Mr Hague when his leadership is questioned the morning afterwards.
 The pound has plainly been good for Mr Hague. But has Mr Hague been good for the pound?
 It is hard to see how. At a stretch, it is just about imaginable that a good Tory showing in the election would scare Mr Blair off his promised referendum. It is not altogether impossible that the Conservatives will argue so well against the euro in the remainder of the campaign that, even if they lose, public opinion on this issue can never be reversed.

 ""THE problem for us is that we are simply not credible. Let's face it, we've had it,"" says a former Conservative cabinet minister. With less than a week to go to the election, and opinion polls pointing stubbornly to a second landslide defeat, the Tory faithful have begun to despair.
 The Tories' defeat in 1997 was blamed largely on sleaze, Europe and the need for a change after 18 years. Since then, memories of the financial scandals that dogged the party have faded: the trial of Lord Archer, former party deputy chairman, for perjury, is the only hangover from that painful time. The arguments over Europe have not stopped, but they have abated. And the electorate has had the change of government it was begging for.
 Yet the Tories have recovered no ground. Things look as bad as they did in 1997. Six months ago, most bets were on Labour winning with a sharply reduced majority of about 100, a loss of roughly 80 seats. By the time the election was called three weeks ago, Labour's likely lead, according to the spread-betting firm, IG Index, had increased to nearly 150. The hot money is now on an overall majority of around 200.
 The opinion polls suggest a Labour lead of anything between 12 and 30 points. A poll by ICM, the Tory's own private polling company, published on May 30th, puts Labour's lead at 19 points, six points up on the previous week. If that lead were translated into seats on election day, it could give Labour an overall majority of 267, the biggest since Ramsay Macdonald's coalition government in 1931.
 The reason, most observers agree, is not that Labour has won the campaign, but that the Tories have lost it. Part of the problem is organisational. The party which used to be known as a great election- winning machine is in tatters. Morale and membership are at a record low. The average age of its members is 62. But that is only a symptom of the Conservative Party's deeper problems.
 The Tories were always going to have a tough fight because of the healthy economy. Vernon Bogdanor, an academic at Oxford University, says that the Tories are still dogged by Britain's humiliating expulsion from the European exchange-rate mechanism in 1992. It gained a reputation for being ""the party of economic mismanagement"" which it has not yet shaken off. But the conduct of the campaign has made things worse.
 Enoch Powell once said that every party has to have ""a theme to hum"". The problem in this election is that the Tories have chosen the wrong tune. The anti-Europe theme doesn't set feet tapping. Voters aren't much interested in Europe. Even tax, traditionally a strong Tory issue, is lower in people's priorities than health and education, the areas that Labour has focused on.
 Nor does the Tories' social conservatism play all that well. Vernon Bogdanor believes that they have failed to keep pace with changing public attitudes on issues such as drugs, asylum and race. ""Hague's populism has gone down badly,"" he says. ""Even if it reflects what people say in the bars, they don't want to vote for it. What they have is a ragbag of policies, some of them very nasty.""
 As Labour has moved on to the centre ground, so the Tories have abandoned it. That, according to Edward Heath, a former prime minister, is their mistake. ""I think to win sufficient support to become the government again, they will have to broaden their whole approach,"" he has said.
 It isn't just William Hague's policies that people dislike: it's the man himself. Not since Michael Foot, who led the Labour Party to its disastrous 1983 defeat, has a party leader been more unpopular. ""A good management consultant but absolutely no sense of strategy,"" says a senior civil servant who worked closely with him in government. In a Gallup poll asking which leader had done the best job in presenting his party's policies, only one voter in six picked the Tory leader. Even among Conservative supporters, only 41% chose him. As Bob Worcester, boss of the polling firm MORI, puts it, ""When Hague was chosen over Ken Clarke, the Tories did themselves in.""
 Focus groups hate the Tory leader's ""flat, grating"" Yorkshire voice and his ""wally-like"" appearance. Women are particularly vehement. ""He's a tit,"" was one comment from a focus group conducted for the opposition. The Tories understandably are not disclosing their research. But the Daily Telegraph, usually a reliable supporter of the party and its leader, last week published the results of ""a dial group"". This is a method used by parties to test the public's reactions to politicians by asking them to turn a dial from positive to negative. The reactions to the Tory leader were ""universally negative"". Participants complained that they ""couldn't stand his voice"", that he was ""not strong"" and that he had not got ""the right image"" to be leader.
 The decision that Mr Hague should be accompanied by his wife, Ffion, but that she should not be allowed to say anything is typical of the misjudgments made by the Tories' high command. The silent blonde is out of tune with the times; and the contrast with Cherie Blair's busy pursuit of her own career is painful.
 Lord Blake, historian of the Conservative Party, takes a longer- term view. He believes the Labour tide was unstoppable at this election, that the Tory failure is little to do with the leadership and that criticism of William Hague is misplaced. Political parties that have undergone a traumatic election defeat invariably require at least two elections to recover, he points out. New Labour itself is a product of this political truth.
 The Tories have reinvented themselves many times before, after similar catastrophes. The recipe has always been the same: a new leader, possessed of political and social imagination, has been able to re-unite a divided party around a new agenda, relevant to a new class or generation of voters. Robert Peel, Benjamin Disraeli and Stanley Baldwin all did it, as did Margaret Thatcher after the two defeats of 1974.

 THIS time it really is ""historic"". No previous Labour prime minister has been re-elected with a majority big enough to carry him through a full second term. From the moment of his 1997 victory, Mr Blair was haunted by this history of failure and determined not to repeat it. This made him cautious; and the caution made him puzzling. He has admitted that the first phase of New Labour was designed to reassure voters that Labour would not again make its old mistakes: trade unions could expect no special favours; there would be no old- style tax and spend; business would be welcomed as a partner. The precious second term allows him at last to show his true colours. But what are they?
 To some, Mr Blair is Bill Clinton minus the complications (and minus the charisma, too). But David Marquand, a former Labour MP and now an Oxford don, draws a parallel with Margaret Thatcher. Like Lady Thatcher, Mr Blair's political genius lies in having reached across familiar ideological boundaries to the core constituency of his opponents. Both have a rootless quality. She was cut off by sex and he is cut off by upbringing from the cultures of their respective parties. Mr Blair calls this a strength: he is proud not to fit into the conventional political categories. It may also be his weakness: according to Mr Marquand, Mr Blair differs from Lady Thatcher in that he has not yet found a distinctive ideology of his own.
 The things he did
 You do not need an ideology in order to be busy. After 18 years out of office, Labour burst back in 1997 like a cork popping from a champagne bottle. Mr Blair freed the Bank of England and rewrote much of the British constitution. He half-repaired relations with the European Union by signing the ""social chapter"", promoting a more independent European defence policy and promising-pending a referendum-to join the euro. He pushed Britain to the forefront of NATO's Kosovo war and negotiated a half-peace in Northern Ireland. He launched a ""New Deal"" for the young unemployed and imposed a minimum wage.
 He also made mistakes-and showed a rare ability to recover from them. The Millennium Dome became a symbol of incompetence. A protest against fuel taxes brought Britain to a standstill. Mr Blair was forced-twice-to sack his friend Peter Mandelson from the cabinet. But none of this damaged the government for long. On balance, and especially given Gordon Brown's successful management of the economy, it was a successful first term.
 This does not make it a reliable pointer to the second. Now that he has reassured Britain, Mr Blair wants to transform it, not just run it competently the way it is. This puts him squarely in the Labour tradition-except for one complication. Winning power entailed creating New Labour, which in turn meant throwing away the tools- state ownership and planning, crude redistribution-that previous Labour prime ministers relied on. What can he do without them?
 Through the cloud of speeches, three ambitions stand out. Mr Blair wants to change Britain's position in the world, to ""modernise"" its politics and to re-engineer the welfare state. With a renewed mandate, plus all the political capital he hoarded during the first term, he can be forgiven for fancying his chances. But he might still fail.
 Britain in the world
 Mr Blair is no ""declinist"". He believes that Britain can lead in Europe, not just take its place as a loyal member of the Union. Nor does he accept that leading in Europe implies weakening Britain's bond with America. He argues that Britain has a ""pivotal"" role in world politics by virtue of its seat on the Security Council, closeness to the United States, membership of the European Union and the G7, the credibility of its armed forces and the power of the English language. Mr Blair has relished cutting a dash on the world scene as an evangelist for his ""third way"", saviour of Kosovo and the first western leader to befriend Russia's President Putin.
 The second term could bring this world-bestriding statesman down to earth with a bump. In some foreign eyes, traffic jams, stalled trains and pyres of burning cows have turned Cool Britannia back into the sick man of Europe. Mr Blair is not going to be able to re- create with George Bush, his ideological opposite, the affinity he had with Bill Clinton. Gerhard Schroder, the German chancellor who seemed for a while to defer to the more experienced British prime minister, shows declining interest in Britain's third way. Lionel Jospin was never a fan. When Mr Blair told the French parliament that ""what matters is what works"", the French prime minister was unimpressed. A market economy was all very well, he said later, but not the ""market society"" which French Socialists suspect Mr Blair of trying to foist on Europe.
 Besides, to change Britain's position in the world, Mr Blair has to change Britain's attitude to Europe. This a harder job than it may sound in the immediate afterglow of re-election. He says that he wants to resolve British ambivalence towards the mainland ""once and for all"", but the opposite has happened on his watch so far. Since 1997, the British have become more suspicious of the EU, not less. More than seven out of ten oppose joining the euro, almost half favour leaving the EU itself and most of those who would like to stay would also like to trim the EU's powers.
 This is a fragile base from which to win the euro referendum he has promised to call when the five economic tests for entry laid down by Mr Brown have been met. Mr Blair promises to pronounce on these tests within two years, which gives him precious little time to turn opinion in favour of the euro even if he could be confident that developments on the mainland would buttress his arguments for joining. The chances are that they will not.
 Lady Thatcher said in Bruges 13 years ago that she had not rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain only in order to see them re-imposed from Brussels by a European super-state. Mr Blair offers two answers to this. First, he dismisses as ""theology"" the possibility of the EU becoming a super-state. At last December's Nice summit, Mr Blair infuriated some of his European partners by blocking some of their steps towards ""ever closer union"". Second, he claims that Britain is winning the economic argument inside Europe. His prize exhibit here is the Lisbon summit of March 2000, after which he boasted that the EU had moved decisively from the mainland's ""old social model"" towards a less regulated and more open economy.
 Really? The ""theology"" of the super-state still has believers on the mainland. The German chancellor and foreign minister are more (in the case of Joschka Fischer, the foreign minister) or less (in the case of Mr Schroder) frank advocates of turning the EU into something akin to such a state. Mr Jospin talked a fortnight ago about the need for a European ""economic government"". As for winning Europe's economic argument, this claim is premature. After Lisbon, a summit this year in Stockholm was a flop. Plenty of mainland politicians continue to say that the EU's job is, precisely, to protect Europe's social model from the cold winds of globalisation.
 Mr Blair claims that Britain has no need to choose between America and Europe. The closer Britain is to each, he says, the greater its value to both. But here, too, the matter is not quite settled. During the Kosovo war Britain was a bridge, if a wobbly one, between the two halves of the Atlantic alliance. It may be harder in the second term for Mr Blair to bridge the gap between the EU and an American administration with uncongenial views on climate change, missile defence, China and the Middle East. Mr Blair insists that the EU's defence initiative poses no threat to the primacy of NATO. Some in the French government hope it will do just that.
 A new politics
 ""Are you a pluralist or a control freak?"", Paddy Ashdown, the former leader of the Liberal Democrats, asked Mr Blair. The answer is still pending. Mr Blair protests that no control freak would have complicated his own life by devolving power to new parliaments and assemblies in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and London. But far from proving that Mr Blair is a pluralist at heart, his reforms have persuaded many people of the opposite. The disappointed constitutional reformers of Charter 88, a pressure group that was thrilled by Labour's election in 1997, ran an advertising campaign during this one depicting the prime minister as a Pinocchio, with a fibber's nose to match.
 It is possible that Mr Blair is genuine when he says that one of his ambitions is to ""reconnect"" people with politics. But he does not appear to see constitutional change as the instrument. His first- term reforms, inherited in the main from John Smith, the former party leader, were not conceived with pluralism in mind. Scottish devolution was a way to head off the Scottish Nationalists' demand for independence, and the Welsh assembly was offered because Wales would otherwise have resented Scotland's Parliament. The Northern Ireland Assembly was part of an attempt to end the province's civil war-a virtuous aim in itself but not evidence of a general preference for spreading power from the centre.
 If Mr Blair had really believed in that, he would not have tried in both Wales and London to override local preferences by putting his own lieutenants in charge of the new power centres; nor neutered his own government's Freedom of Information Act; nor ruled out, as Labour's manifesto seems to, turning the House of Lords into an all- elected chamber. He could have pushed devolution further in England, and called the referendum on voting reform which he promised both to Mr Ashdown and to the voters of 1997. But on the eve of this week's poll he mused about the disproportionate power proportional representation tends to give small parties. In retrospect, the lofty talk of using voting reform to herald a ""progressive"" realignment in British politics seems to have been so much flannel intended to keep the third party sweet in case he needed it.
 Will Mr Blair use the second term to make amends? Further reform of the Lords, devolution in England and another look at proportional representation make cautious appearances in Labour's manifesto. If, as some argue, Mr Blair is the true heir of Gladstone, valuing diversity for its own sake, he will seize these opportunities to weaken the power of the over-mighty centre. But as Vernon Bogdanor, a professor of government at Oxford University, points out, this would mark a break with Labour's past. A party intent on engineering equal social outcomes, across regions as well as classes, is bound to think that doing so requires a centralised state. Mr Blair is no socialist, and not much of an egalitarian either (he believes in ""equal worth"", not equality). But he is no less keen than his Labour predecessors were on using the state to engineer desired outcomes. This is the idea at the heart of his third way.
 A new welfare state
 Mr Blair talks of imposing a third post-war ""settlement"" on Britain, one that will combine and transcend Attlee's creation of the welfare state after 1945 and Lady Thatcher's pro-market reforms after 1979. The linking of opposites is to be achieved by the third way, the main idea of which is to make the state cleverer and more entrepreneurial, helping citizens to help themselves rather than spooning out ""bog-standard"" (as Mr Blair's spokesman called comprehensive schools) services through unimaginative bureaucracies.
 This vision does not entail shrinking the state, as Thatcherism tried to. Mr Blair resents nothing more than being labelled a softer sort of Tory. He continues to believe in the power of government to make the lives of people better, even to make them better people. He sees the need for a ""post-Thatcherite revitalisation and renewal of collective provision"". Whereas Lady Thatcher deliberately lowered citizens' expectations of what the state could do for them, Mr Blair spent his first term-and this election-raising expectations.
 He will not be able to meet them just by spending more on public services, though there will be a lot more cash for a while. Having built up big surpluses for its first two years, the government is to increase spending over the next three years by almost 4% a year, with rises of 6% for health and education, and 11% for transport. But the relief will be temporary. Since this is faster than the growth rate of the economy, it cannot go on indefinitely without raising taxes. The Institute for Fiscal Studies reckons that Mr Blair would need to increase taxation by Pounds 5 billion ($7 billion) a year if he wanted to extend his spending spree beyond three years.
 Mr Blair's hope is that the extra money will strip public-service providers of their excuse to resist his big reforms. Labour promises in the second term to ""hit the ground running"". Immediate ideas include streamlining the machinery of government, for example by bringing employment and social security under one roof in a new ministry of work and the family, and creating a ""policy-delivery unit"" in Downing Street.
 Tinkering with the machinery of government will be easier than finding a formula to rejuvenate Britain's public services. So far, the nearest thing to a big idea is a proposal to make greater use of the private sector and sweep away outdated demarcations. What does it matter, asks Mr Blair, whether a particular hospital is private, so long as the service is free at the point of use? But public-service unions from Unison to the British Medical Association have already voiced dismay at what they call this ""back-door privatisation"". Polls suggest that wider opinion is hostile to running public services at a profit. If this is his big idea for the second term, Mr Blair will have to overcome widespread prejudices as well as vested interests.
 That would be a fight worth having, if the prize were indeed the transformation of public services. But Mr Blair's thinking on this is still a study in vagueness. There is no great merit in using private money to finance public services: quite often, this merely raises the cost to taxpayers with no offsetting benefit, apart from hiding that long-term consequence for a decade or two if the money is borrowed. Nor is there much point in Mr Blair turning to private providers if he will not embrace the heresy that users of public services have a better understanding of their requirements than Whitehall does. If he grasped this, Mr Blair would introduce real competition into public services so that schools and hospitals could fight it out for publicly funded clients, with the government concentrating on ensuring that everyone, regardless of income, has the means to get better services and make his preferences count.
 Time to make choices, and enemies
 Behind Mr Blair's blokeish manner is a compulsive competitor. His tennis partners say that he cannot bear to lose. But he also hates confrontation. He showed in Kosovo that he can be daring, but his watchword is caution. He would sooner bring a convert inside his big tent than make an unnecessary enemy. His biographer, John Rentoul, says he likes to string people along and keep options open, while waiting to see what falls into his lap.
 The second term will provide fewer opportunities for prevarication and more for making enemies. A MORI poll this week for The Economist (see chart) suggests that he will face pressure to do things he has ruled out (such as renationalising the railways and increasing income- tax rates) and opposition to the things he wants to do (joining the euro, letting private companies run state schools, increasing school selection).
 What of his three big ambitions? If Mr Blair's destiny is to settle Britain in Europe ""once and for all"", he cannot use Mr Brown's five tests to keep his euro-options open indefinitely, even if closing them means conflict with his chancellor. If he is really to modernise British politics, the pluralist in him will have to drive out the control freak, even if this makes his other aims harder to achieve. If he is to transform the public services, he will have to be bolder about competition, even if this means war with the unions. The danger otherwise is of stepping on to the familiar treadmill of higher spending and taxes, followed by disappointed expectations, followed by higher spending and taxes.
 Like Lady Thatcher, Mr Blair does not want for self-belief: this is what they admire in one another. She had her ""wets""; he is hemmed in by the Labour movement's own forces of conservatism. The difference is that she was fortified by a clear ideology which everybody in her administration could understand, and which gave them a sense of direction. If Mr Blair has an ideology, it is to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds. Only he knows exactly which way he is heading."," If Tony Blair is to achieve his ambitions for the second term, he will have to make choices-and enemies
 THIS time it really is ""historic"". No previous Labour prime minister has been re-elected with a majority big enough to carry him through a full second term. From the moment of his 1997 victory, Mr Blair was haunted by this history of failure and determined not to repeat it. This made him cautious; and the caution made him puzzling. He has admitted that the first phase of New Labour was designed to reassure voters that Labour would not again make its old mistakes: trade unions could expect no special favours; there would be no old- style tax and spend; business would be welcomed as a partner. The precious second term allows him at last to show his true colours. But what are they?
 To some, Mr Blair is Bill Clinton minus the complications (and minus the charisma, too). But David Marquand, a former Labour MP and now an Oxford don, draws a parallel with Margaret Thatcher. Like Lady Thatcher, Mr Blair's political genius lies in having reached across familiar ideological boundaries to the core constituency of his opponents. Both have a rootless quality. She was cut off by sex and he is cut off by upbringing from the cultures of their respective parties. Mr Blair calls this a strength: he is proud not to fit into the conventional political categories. It may also be his weakness: according to Mr Marquand, Mr Blair differs from Lady Thatcher in that he has not yet found a distinctive ideology of his own.
 The things he did
 You do not need an ideology in order to be busy. After 18 years out of office, Labour burst back in 1997 like a cork popping from a champagne bottle. Mr Blair freed the Bank of England and rewrote much of the British constitution. He half-repaired relations with the European Union by signing the ""social chapter"", promoting a more independent European defence policy and promising-pending a referendum-to join the euro. He pushed Britain to the forefront of NATO's Kosovo war and negotiated a half-peace in Northern Ireland. He launched a ""New Deal"" for the young unemployed and imposed a minimum wage.
 He also made mistakes-and showed a rare ability to recover from them. The Millennium Dome became a symbol of incompetence. A protest against fuel taxes brought Britain to a standstill. Mr Blair was forced-twice-to sack his friend Peter Mandelson from the cabinet. But none of this damaged the government for long. On balance, and especially given Gordon Brown's successful management of the economy, it was a successful first term.
 This does not make it a reliable pointer to the second. Now that he has reassured Britain, Mr Blair wants to transform it, not just run it competently the way it is. This puts him squarely in the Labour tradition-except for one complication. Winning power entailed creating New Labour, which in turn meant throwing away the tools- state ownership and planning, crude redistribution-that previous Labour prime ministers relied on. What can he do without them?
 Through the cloud of speeches, three ambitions stand out. Mr Blair wants to change Britain's position in the world, to ""modernise"" its politics and to re-engineer the welfare state. With a renewed mandate, plus all the political capital he hoarded during the first term, he can be forgiven for fancying his chances. But he might still fail.
 Britain in the world
 Mr Blair is no ""declinist"". He believes that Britain can lead in Europe, not just take its place as a loyal member of the Union. Nor does he accept that leading in Europe implies weakening Britain's bond with America. He argues that Britain has a ""pivotal"" role in world politics by virtue of its seat on the Security Council, closeness to the United States, membership of the European Union and the G7, the credibility of its armed forces and the power of the English language. Mr Blair has relished cutting a dash on the world scene as an evangelist for his ""third way"", saviour of Kosovo and the first western leader to befriend Russia's President Putin.
 The second term could bring this world-bestriding statesman down to earth with a bump. In some foreign eyes, traffic jams, stalled trains and pyres of burning cows have turned Cool Britannia back into the sick man of Europe. Mr Blair is not going to be able to re- create with George Bush, his ideological opposite, the affinity he had with Bill Clinton. Gerhard Schroder, the German chancellor who seemed for a while to defer to the more experienced British prime minister, shows declining interest in Britain's third way. Lionel Jospin was never a fan. When Mr Blair told the French parliament that ""what matters is what works"", the French prime minister was unimpressed. A market economy was all very well, he said later, but not the ""market society"" which French Socialists suspect Mr Blair of trying to foist on Europe.
 Besides, to change Britain's position in the world, Mr Blair has to change Britain's attitude to Europe. This a harder job than it may sound in the immediate afterglow of re-election. He says that he wants to resolve British ambivalence towards the mainland ""once and for all"", but the opposite has happened on his watch so far. Since 1997, the British have become more suspicious of the EU, not less. More than seven out of ten oppose joining the euro, almost half favour leaving the EU itself and most of those who would like to stay would also like to trim the EU's powers.
 This is a fragile base from which to win the euro referendum he has promised to call when the five economic tests for entry laid down by Mr Brown have been met. Mr Blair promises to pronounce on these tests within two years, which gives him precious little time to turn opinion in favour of the euro even if he could be confident that developments on the mainland would buttress his arguments for joining. The chances are that they will not.
 Lady Thatcher said in Bruges 13 years ago that she had not rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain only in order to see them re-imposed from Brussels by a European super-state. Mr Blair offers two answers to this. First, he dismisses as ""theology"" the possibility of the EU becoming a super-state. At last December's Nice summit, Mr Blair infuriated some of his European partners by blocking some of their steps towards ""ever closer union"". Second, he claims that Britain is winning the economic argument inside Europe. His prize exhibit here is the Lisbon summit of March 2000, after which he boasted that the EU had moved decisively from the mainland's ""old social model"" towards a less regulated and more open economy.
 Really? The ""theology"" of the super-state still has believers on the mainland. The German chancellor and foreign minister are more (in the case of Joschka Fischer, the foreign minister) or less (in the case of Mr Schroder) frank advocates of turning the EU into something akin to such a state. Mr Jospin talked a fortnight ago about the need for a European ""economic government"". As for winning Europe's economic argument, this claim is premature. After Lisbon, a summit this year in Stockholm was a flop. Plenty of mainland politicians continue to say that the EU's job is, precisely, to protect Europe's social model from the cold winds of globalisation.
 Mr Blair claims that Britain has no need to choose between America and Europe. The closer Britain is to each, he says, the greater its value to both. But here, too, the matter is not quite settled. During the Kosovo war Britain was a bridge, if a wobbly one, between the two halves of the Atlantic alliance. It may be harder in the second term for Mr Blair to bridge the gap between the EU and an American administration with uncongenial views on climate change, missile defence, China and the Middle East. Mr Blair insists that the EU's defence initiative poses no threat to the primacy of NATO. Some in the French government hope it will do just that.
 A new politics
 ""Are you a pluralist or a control freak?"", Paddy Ashdown, the former leader of the Liberal Democrats, asked Mr Blair. The answer is still pending. Mr Blair protests that no control freak would have complicated his own life by devolving power to new parliaments and assemblies in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and London. But far from proving that Mr Blair is a pluralist at heart, his reforms have persuaded many people of the opposite. The disappointed constitutional reformers of Charter 88, a pressure group that was thrilled by Labour's election in 1997, ran an advertising campaign during this one depicting the prime minister as a Pinocchio, with a fibber's nose to match.
 It is possible that Mr Blair is genuine when he says that one of his ambitions is to ""reconnect"" people with politics. But he does not appear to see constitutional change as the instrument. His first- term reforms, inherited in the main from John Smith, the former party leader, were not conceived with pluralism in mind. Scottish devolution was a way to head off the Scottish Nationalists' demand for independence, and the Welsh assembly was offered because Wales would otherwise have resented Scotland's Parliament. The Northern Ireland Assembly was part of an attempt to end the province's civil war-a virtuous aim in itself but not evidence of a general preference for spreading power from the centre.
 If Mr Blair had really believed in that, he would not have tried in both Wales and London to override local preferences by putting his own lieutenants in charge of the new power centres; nor neutered his own government's Freedom of Information Act; nor ruled out, as Labour's manifesto seems to, turning the House of Lords into an all- elected chamber. He could have pushed devolution further in England, and called the referendum on voting reform which he promised both to Mr Ashdown and to the voters of 1997. But on the eve of this week's poll he mused about the disproportionate power proportional representation tends to give small parties. In retrospect, the lofty talk of using voting reform to herald a ""progressive"" realignment in British politics seems to have been so much flannel intended to keep the third party sweet in case he needed it.
 Will Mr Blair use the second term to make amends? Further reform of the Lords, devolution in England and another look at proportional representation make cautious appearances in Labour's manifesto. If, as some argue, Mr Blair is the true heir of Gladstone, valuing diversity for its own sake, he will seize these opportunities to weaken the power of the over-mighty centre. But as Vernon Bogdanor, a professor of government at Oxford University, points out, this would mark a break with Labour's past. A party intent on engineering equal social outcomes, across regions as well as classes, is bound to think that doing so requires a centralised state. Mr Blair is no socialist, and not much of an egalitarian either (he believes in ""equal worth"", not equality). But he is no less keen than his Labour predecessors were on using the state to engineer desired outcomes. This is the idea at the heart of his third way.
 A new welfare state
 Mr Blair talks of imposing a third post-war ""settlement"" on Britain, one that will combine and transcend Attlee's creation of the welfare state after 1945 and Lady Thatcher's pro-market reforms after 1979. The linking of opposites is to be achieved by the third way, the main idea of which is to make the state cleverer and more entrepreneurial, helping citizens to help themselves rather than spooning out ""bog-standard"" (as Mr Blair's spokesman called comprehensive schools) services through unimaginative bureaucracies.
 This vision does not entail shrinking the state, as Thatcherism tried to. Mr Blair resents nothing more than being labelled a softer sort of Tory. He continues to believe in the power of government to make the lives of people better, even to make them better people. He sees the need for a ""post-Thatcherite revitalisation and renewal of collective provision"". Whereas Lady Thatcher deliberately lowered citizens' expectations of what the state could do for them, Mr Blair spent his first term-and this election-raising expectations.
 He will not be able to meet them just by spending more on public services, though there will be a lot more cash for a while. Having built up big surpluses for its first two years, the government is to increase spending over the next three years by almost 4% a year, with rises of 6% for health and education, and 11% for transport. But the relief will be temporary. Since this is faster than the growth rate of the economy, it cannot go on indefinitely without raising taxes. The Institute for Fiscal Studies reckons that Mr Blair would need to increase taxation by Pounds 5 billion ($7 billion) a year if he wanted to extend his spending spree beyond three years.
 Mr Blair's hope is that the extra money will strip public-service providers of their excuse to resist his big reforms. Labour promises in the second term to ""hit the ground running"". Immediate ideas include streamlining the machinery of government, for example by bringing employment and social security under one roof in a new ministry of work and the family, and creating a ""policy-delivery unit"" in Downing Street.
 Tinkering with the machinery of government will be easier than finding a formula to rejuvenate Britain's public services. So far, the nearest thing to a big idea is a proposal to make greater use of the private sector and sweep away outdated demarcations. What does it matter, asks Mr Blair, whether a particular hospital is private, so long as the service is free at the point of use? But public-service unions from Unison to the British Medical Association have already voiced dismay at what they call this ""back-door privatisation"". Polls suggest that wider opinion is hostile to running public services at a profit. If this is his big idea for the second term, Mr Blair will have to overcome widespread prejudices as well as vested interests.
 That would be a fight worth having, if the prize were indeed the transformation of public services. But Mr Blair's thinking on this is still a study in vagueness. There is no great merit in using private money to finance public services: quite often, this merely raises the cost to taxpayers with no offsetting benefit, apart from hiding that long-term consequence for a decade or two if the money is borrowed. Nor is there much point in Mr Blair turning to private providers if he will not embrace the heresy that users of public services have a better understanding of their requirements than Whitehall does. If he grasped this, Mr Blair would introduce real competition into public services so that schools and hospitals could fight it out for publicly funded clients, with the government concentrating on ensuring that everyone, regardless of income, has the means to get better services and make his preferences count.

 IT IS not definite enough to be a rumour. Perhaps you could call it a sentiment. Whatever the right word, the fact is that at some point in the past few months the name David Blunkett and the phrase ""future prime minister"" have for the first time begun to crop up in the same paragraph of Britain's political conversation. This is peculiar. For a start, the job is not vacant: Tony Blair made it plainer than ever during the election that he intended to serve a full second term. And if Mr Blair does have an heir apparent, it is surely his next-door neighbour, the brooding, brilliant Gordon Brown. It is widely reported, and it may even be true, that Mr Brown made Mr Blair promise him the succession at the dinner in Islington at which he agreed to give his friend a clear run at the Labour leadership after John Smith's death. Since then, Mr Brown has fulfilled his part of the putative bargain. As chancellor of the exchequer he has given Labour an invaluable reputation for economic competence. He organised the campaign that has just landed the unprecedented second term. How did that interloper Blunkett butt into the narrative?
 The first part of the answer is that if politics is a game of momentum, Mr Blunkett has it and Mr Brown does not. Mr Brown's second- best job in life is the one he has right now, at the centre of things at the Treasury. He will go nowhere voluntarily, unless it is to Number 10. Mr Blunkett, by contrast, is upwardly mobile. For several months the prime minister has been telling whoever would listen that Mr Blunkett had done a ""brilliant"" job as education secretary-and education, remember, is Mr Blair's thrice-hallowed priority in government. Word that Mr Blunkett would receive his just reward by becoming home secretary in place of Jack Straw was one of the few pre- reshuffle rumours that everybody believed.
 Such a move, marking Mr Blunkett's ascent from the engine room of Blairdom to the bridge itself, was enough on its own to start the gossips going. But news that Mr Blunkett intends to publish a book in the autumn summing up his political philosophy has added to the intrigue. He is being helped by Tom Bentley, his former researcher and now head of Demos, Mr Blair's favourite think-tank. As it happens, Mr Brown is rumoured to be writing such a book too. Why would busy men at the very top of the government bother if they did not see these books as rival manifestos in a future leadership contest? Reporters who ask Mr Blunkett straight get the usual brush- off: there is no vacancy for prime minister. He sometimes adds a less usual one: that he cannot foresee Britain accepting the idea of a blind prime minister in the near future. Funny, that. When Margaret Thatcher was education secretary, she said that Britain was probably not ready for a female prime minister.
 Whatever people think of his politics, Mr Blunkett is universally admired for his personal odyssey. Born almost completely blind, at the age of four he was taken from home in a bus and deposited in a special boarding school on the far side of Sheffield, where the boys in his dormitory cried themselves to sleep at night. He was still a child when his father died a slow and painful death, after falling into a vat of boiling water at a gasworks. A headstone was beyond the family's means so he was buried in an unmarked grave. All the misery of those years made the young Blunkett ""very angry"". At 16, he says, he began to see that history was a struggle between those with power and wealth and those who had neither. This was 1963, when Harold Wilson's talk about using the white heat of technology to create a better world inspired a new optimism. His college offered to train him as a piano tuner, a lathe operator or a Braille shorthand typist. He chose the Braille-but he also joined the Labour Party. By 22 he was the (youngest ever) member of Sheffield council, which he was to go on to lead.
 Too good to come true?
 Education secretary, home secretary-and prime minister hereafter? To complete the fairytale, Mr Blunkett would need to surmount formidable obstacles. Unable to read the papers in his red boxes, Mr Blunkett has had to spend long hours as education secretary listening to tapes, and his workload will probably have to rise at the Home Office. The premiership might stretch even his stamina too far, though he has a legendary facility for storing an encyclopaedia of facts and arguments in his head.
 Mr Blunkett's boosters call him the outstanding success of the first term, a minister who really managed to ""deliver"": higher standards in primary schools, for example, and performance-related pay for teachers. They praise a supple intellect that has let him evolve as a politician without being gulled by the latest fad. As a municipal socialist when Thatcherism was rampant, he came to understand the limitations of the old left. This made him a genuine Blairite, but a plain-speaking, practical one, less given than his master to abstract rhetorical flourishes. Though not much favoured yet as a future leader-a MORI poll for The Economist has him running a poor third behind Mr Brown and John Prescott-much could change when he is home secretary.
 All in all, a lovely story-though naturally, since the leadership is at issue, another version is doing the rounds. In this one, Mr Blunkett's record at education is said to have been mixed: the few ideas that worked were inherited from the Conservatives, and the rest were forced on him from Downing Street. His childhood miseries have made him hard, incapable of accepting poverty as an excuse for failure. The supple political intellect admired by his supporters boils down to a social authoritarianism that will make him an even less liberal home secretary than Mr Straw.

 IN ITS ten-year transport plan, the government forecasts that up to half the Pounds 60 billion needed to finance the modernisation of the railways will come from private investment. That figure has always seemed optimistic; but this week's collapse of Railtrack's share price makes it look unrealistic. After ABN Amro, an investment bank, said it thought the shares were worth no more than 58p, their price fell to Pounds 3.50. At their peak in November 1998, they were worth Pounds 17.68. At this rate, Railtrack is not going to be raising much capital in the financial markets.
 What to do about Railtrack will be one of the first tasks for whoever is unlucky enough to get the transport job in the next government. Pretty much everybody now agrees that the model of rail privatisation imposed on the industry by the Conservatives does not work. However, the government has no appetite for renationalisation, despite the urging of the railway unions-and the public, of whom, according to a poll conducted by MORI for The Economist, 72% support renationalisation. So what are the alternatives?
 One radical solution now being discussed is the possibility that Railtrack could be referred to the Competition Commission on the ground that it is a monopoly which is failing the public. The commission could recommend, for instance, that the company be broken up into smaller regional units.
 This would fit in with proposals made by David Begg, chairman of the Commission for Integrated Transport, and Jon Shaw, a transport economist. They have recommended a fundamental restructuring of the railways. Five regional train-operating companies would be responsible for both train and track operations.
 The Begg paper, now being discussed by government advisers, also calls for a review of the way the industry is regulated. The dual- regulation model in which the Rail Regulator and the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) divide up responsibility for controlling the industry has led, the paper notes, to personal conflicts and blurred responsibilities. It says that Railtrack's adversarial relationship with the regulator, Tom Winsor, has contributed to its falling credit rating.
 Mr Begg, who advises the government, is also arguing that the incentive structure that was put into place when the industry was privatised is flawed. More than 80% of Railtrack's revenues are fixed. That gives the company little incentive to invest in efficiency or growth. The SRA's performance targets have had a perverse effect, too. They have encouraged train operators to stretch journey times in their timetables to minimise the risk of trains arriving late. Some journeys now take longer than they did 100 years ago.
 The train-operating companies are increasingly fed up with the dire state of the network and would welcome fundamental reform. Three of the biggest companies, First Group, Stagecoach and National Express, have already begun to talk to the SRA about the possibility of re-integrating the industry. The government will have to make a decision soon, because those companies' franchises are due to be renewed in the next few months, and they need to know what is going to happen to the industry."," Railtrack's share-price collapse brings a restructuring of the industry closer

However, the government has no appetite for renationalisation, despite the urging of the railway unions-and the public, of whom, according to a poll conducted by MORI for The Economist, 72% support renationalisation. So what are the alternatives?
 One radical solution now being discussed is the possibility that Railtrack could be referred to the Competition Commission on the ground that it is a monopoly which is failing the public. The commission could recommend, for instance, that the company be broken up into smaller regional units.
 This would fit in with proposals made by David Begg, chairman of the Commission for Integrated Transport, and Jon Shaw, a transport economist. They have recommended a fundamental restructuring of the railways. Five regional train-operating companies would be responsible for both train and track operations.
 The Begg paper, now being discussed by government advisers, also calls for a review of the way the industry is regulated. The dual- regulation model in which the Rail Regulator and the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) divide up responsibility for controlling the industry has led, the paper notes, to personal conflicts and blurred responsibilities. It says that Railtrack's adversarial relationship with the regulator, Tom Winsor, has contributed to its falling credit rating.
 Mr Begg, who advises the government, is also arguing that the incentive structure that was put into place when the industry was privatised is flawed. More than 80% of Railtrack's revenues are fixed. That gives the company little incentive to invest in efficiency or growth. The SRA's performance targets have had a perverse effect, too. They have encouraged train operators to stretch journey times in their timetables to minimise the risk of trains arriving late. Some journeys now take longer than they did 100 years ago.
 The train-operating companies are increasingly fed up with the dire state of the network and would welcome fundamental reform. Three of the biggest companies, First Group, Stagecoach and National Express, have already begun to talk to the SRA about the possibility of re-integrating the industry. The government will have to make a decision soon, because those companies' franchises are due to be renewed in the next few months, and they need to know what is going to happen to the industry.",740,Japan,A29-8206,,False,,0,True

 BLESSED, apparently, are the kingmakers. According to a poll conducted by MORI for The Economist, patience, like prudence, could prove a rewarding virtue for Gordon Brown: 30% of voters, and 38% of Labour supporters, would like the chancellor to succeed Tony Blair, should the prime minister step down during this parliament. If the public has its way, though, Mr Brown could be stuck with patience for a while: 67% think Mr Blair should serve a full parliamentary term, which Mr Blair has said he intends to do.
 But gravitas, of which Mr Brown has bucketloads, is evidently not the only quality that impresses the electorate. His closest rival in the estimations of both the general public and Labour supporters is John Prescott, the pugilistic deputy prime minister. Despite-or perhaps because of-the short fuse and left jab he exhibited in the campaign's most interesting confrontation, 18% of Labour voters happily envisage Mr Prescott in Number 10. David Blunkett, also touted recently as a possible candidate (see article), is a distant third.
 Just before the election, when our poll was conducted, William Hague's leadership seemed less than commanding: 55% of voters (and 40% of Tory supporters) thought a defeated Mr Hague should step down. The Tories have struggled of late to agree internally on a leader who is also palatable to the electorate. Our poll suggests an obvious remedy to this problem: Michael Portillo, the most popular successor among both groups.
 The old problem of discordant tastes re-emerges, though, further down the Tory wish list. Lady Thatcher's interventions during the campaign provoked glee in the Labour Party and bad jokes about ""The Mummy Returns"". Yet 11% of Tory voters (against 7% of the total) would like her to bring the Conservative Party to heel once again. And while 15% of all voters would like Ken Clarke, the cuddly, Europhile ex-chancellor, to succeed William Hague, only 10% of Tory supporters concur.
 For most of the rest of them, the problem is obscurity. Bill Emmott, this newspaper's editor, was included mischievously in the list of possible successors, and got more votes from Conservative supporters than did David Davis, the chairman of the public accounts committee, who is regarded by many as a serious candidate. (All right, Bill got one vote, and Mr Davis got none.) Perhaps Mr Davis should punch a few voters."," Who, if anyone, should succeed Tony Blair and William Hague?

STOCKBROKERS simply haven't been selling shares at the right prices. That, more or less, was how Masajuro Shiokawa, the finance minister, explained Japan's tumbling stockmarkets on July 23rd, when the benchmark Nikkei 225 fell to a 16-year low (see chart). Another reason why share prices were so weak, he added, was that the brokers weren't marketing enough equity-based investment trusts. 
Mr Shiokawa's swift response ahe called the head of the securities industry organisation and urged him to rectify these flawsaworked wonders. Japanese shares rose the next day. But the climb may be brief. Three months ago investors had high hopes of Junichiro Koizumi, the incoming prime minister, who promised structural reform. Today, they are disappointed by his lack of progress. Meanwhile, Japan's sickly economy only looks worse. Industrial production is falling sharply, and consumption continues to disappoint. Corporate profits are sliding, and now there is no strong American economy to help. 
The government will almost certainly try to boost the economy with a supplementary budget in August. But this causes unhappiness all round. Those who favour yet more government spending are upset over Mr Koizumi's refusal to commit himself to another budget. No matter that the prime minister will probably do it once the election for parliament's upper house this weekend is over. His coyness, they argue, has knocked market confidence over the past couple of weeks. 
Those seeking a fresh approach, on the other hand, fear that a combination of extra spending and scant reform leaves Japan exactly where it was under Yoshiro Mori, the previous prime minister, who was both inept and unpopular. Mr Koizumi, who is fond of pledging supply-side reform without explaining what it will actually entail, will not be able to get away with mere sound bites any longer. After this weekend's election, he will have to come up with real strategies, which he will then have to blend with the plans for fiscal stimulus desired by his party. 
For the stockmarket, this suggests bumpy times ahead. Thank goodness, then, that Mr Shiokawa will know exactly what the problem is.","Sinking to old lows

 SINCE June, Tony Blair has basked in the afterglow of re- election, having at last won the full second term that eluded previous Labour governments in Britain. The glow has been made all the brighter by the dimness of the Conservatives. Their over-long leadership election has put their divisions on embarrassing public display. On September 12th, however, the Tories will name a leader, and attention will at last swivel back to the government, where it belongs. Now that he has his second term, what does Mr Blair mean to do with it?
 On present showing, the second term will begin with a three-round fight. Next week--round one--Mr Blair goes to Brighton to tell the Trade Union Congress just what he meant during the election when he talked with so much enthusiasm and so little precision about using the private sector to revive Britain's sclerotic public services. Round two comes at the beginning of October, when delegates at Labour's own conference will beg him to renounce his apostasy and return to the statist faith. Then comes the return of Parliament. Will Labour backbenchers--numerous, confident and more disdainful than ever of the Conservative opposition--still let Mr Blair march across all the red lines set down in Labour's old ideology? Only, perhaps, if he advances by stealth. There may be a lesson in his handling this week of the education white paper, ""Achieving Success"".
 Education, remember, is Mr Blair's declared priority in government. It is Labour's twitchiest ideological lightning- conductor. It is also a sector where Mr Blair owes voters a debt or two. For all the speeches he lavished on education in his first term, he lavished little extra cash. Indeed, unhelpful research this week from Howard Glennerster, a professor at the London School of Economics, says that in 1998 and 1999 Labour squeezed spending on education to 4.5% of GDP, less than it got under Margaret Thatcher (4.7%) and its lowest share since the 1960s. A big spending increase is on the way now, but at a rate which is almost certainly unsustainable beyond a few years. So if Mr Blair is to transform education and the other public services, he will by his own admission have to combine the extra money with radical reform. ""Without the change,"" the prime minister said in February, ""money is simply wasted on outdated practices.""
 Brave words. And radical change is what this white paper was expected to contain. Mr Blair's spokesman promised that it would reform England's secondary schools, putting an end to the ""bog- standard"" comprehensives that had let down generations of students. One particularly encouraging sign was the horror of the teachers' unions. They braced to resist what they expected to be a hideous prospectus of Blairite offences against orthodoxy. Selection would return to state schools, disguised now as school ""specialisation""; whole schools would go under the auctioneer's hammer as a star- struck prime minister invited firms to run them; the end of state education was nigh.
 Or was it?
 Odd, then, that the white paper, once out, seems so much less threatening, either to the unions or to Labour dogma.
 Yes, the government hopes that the promise of extra money and more freedom to manage their own affairs will by 2005 have persuaded four out of ten secondary schools to specialise--in maths and science, say, or in art. But Estelle Morris, the education secretary, insists that this will confer no power that schools do not already have to select a fraction of their students by aptitude. The point, she says, is not to create two tiers of schools but to inject into as many schools as possible some of the quality-raising buzz that specialising seems to give them. And, yes, there will be an enhanced role for the private sector, but the role will be carefully circumscribed. For example, private firms that find their way on to an approved list may be asked to rescue state schools that are failing, and sometimes even to introduce new schools. But none of this should change the fact that education is a ""public service delivered by public servants"". A newspaper article on the white paper, published on the day of its launch under Mr Blair's name, said nothing at all about the role of private firms.
 This is calculation, not oversight. At the TUC conference, and then at Labour's, the big unions intend to hold rallies under the slogan ""Keep Public Services Public"". Polling firms have meanwhile published one survey after another showing that voters agree. One such, by MORI for the Times, found that more than six out of ten of voters would like schools and hospitals to be provided entirely or mostly by the public sector, with fewer than three out of ten preferring a mixture of public and private providers. In the face of all this, you can see why it was prudent of Mr Blair to take some evasive action. The question is whether evasive action is the same as headlong retreat.
 It need not be. According to the National Union of Teachers, the tone of the white paper has ""significantly softened"" since July. This is bad: when the NUT stops complaining, school reformers should start to worry. The consolation is that the union may well have declared victory too soon.
 It is now plain that Mr Blair and Mrs Morris dare not argue openly for selection, which remains anathema to much of the party. That whole argument, they say in the familiar manner of New Labour, is just another ""sterile"" debate of yesteryear. This lack of plain talk is a pity. Public policy is likelier to succeed when its framers set out their objectives honestly. All the same, the present spin will count for less than the new pattern of school incentives that the white paper foreshadows. Much therefore depends on round three, as the education bill wends through Parliament. But in the long run, the logic of specialisation, and the promise to relax central controls on good schools, points to selection by aptitude. That is a good thing, even if Mr Blair still cannot bring himself to say so."," Tony Blair may have to reform the public services by stealth

 AN AUTUMN of reform is what Junichiro Koizumi promised Japan's desperate voters. Yet two weeks after the new prime minister returned from his holidays in the cool of the mountains, there is no sign that one is on the way. Like so many of his predecessors, Mr Koizumi seems to be gently subsiding into Japan's familiar political quicksand.
 Central reforms are being abandoned, say his critics, or neutered. In anticipation of a mountain of legislation, the Diet (parliament) was supposed to have reconvened in August. Now, it will not start work until the end of September. There is still no word from Mr Koizumi about his policy priorities, despite a promise that he would draw up a list by August. The stockmarket is plunging, the banks are weakening by the day and the economic recession deepens. But half of the government's most crucial ministers are travelling abroad. As for Mr Koizumi himself, he is holed up in his official residence, say political gossips, listening to opera.
 Something Wagnerian would go well with the terrible news outside. Big exporters, like Hitachi and Toshiba, are announcing huge layoffs. Small-firm confidence continues to plunge. Output is falling rapidly and deflation is deepening. Statistics due out on September 7th may, it is feared, show that between April and June the economy shrank by 4% or more at an annualised rate. With confidence in the government's policies ebbing rapidly, the markets are abuzz with talk of a fresh financial crisis. Since Mr Koizumi's return to Tokyo, the stockmarket has fallen by nearly 10%, a drop so far interrupted only by hopeful rumours that Hakuo Yanagisawa, Mr Koizumi's minister in charge of the bank clean-up, will soon resign.
 Mr Yanagisawa is now Mr Koizumi's number-one problem. Mr Koizumi went to the voters before the election in July for Japan's upper house with a promise to clean up the banks within two to three years. But the plan for doing so that Mr Yanagisawa has been touting round Europe and America this week looks almost identical to the one he drew up in April, under the discredited administration of Yoshiro Mori. The markets condemned it at the time. Not surprisingly, they are passing the same judgment now.
 At the heart of the matter lies the fact that no one believes the government's figures for the amount of bank loans that could turn sour. Goldman Sachs, an American investment bank, thinks the true number may be an eye-popping Yen170 trillion ($1.4 trillion), seven times the official figure. By pushing bank shares ever lower, the markets are saying that the banks are short of capital and need public money. But Mr Yanagisawa will not countenance that. His staff are back in siege mentality, railing at Goldman Sachs and suchlike and furious with the IMF, whose request last week to inspect Japan's financial system got a dusty response.
 Even by Japanese standards, Mr Koizumi has shown himself to be remarkably insensitive to these market signals. It took him a whole week to ""correct"" Mr Yanagisawa's all-too-honest gaffe that it would take not three years but seven to clean up the banks, by which time the damage had been done. Among cabinet members, only Heizo Takenaka, Mr Koizumi's economics minister, retains the confidence of the markets. But Mr Takenaka is an academic economist, and is not faring well among the insiders of Nagatacho, Tokyo's political district. Mr Takenaka wants Mr Yanagisawa sacked. But Mr Yanagisawa has far more political clout
 Damaging cabinet divisions are appearing elsewhere. Despite the awful economic news, Mr Koizumi is still trying to push ahead with his dubious plan to tighten government spending. In fact, as cabinet heavyweights like Takeo Hiranuma, the economy, trade and industry minister, have defied the prime minister and called for a big emergency budget, Mr Koizumi has been upping the stakes. Now Mr Koizumi says he wants to bring forward his plan to cap government bond issues at Yen30 trillion from next year to this year, which would tighten public finances almost immediately. In recession, however, Mr Koizumi will have to issue more bonds simply to cover the government's tax shortfall. Already the Ministry of Finance is indicating that this year's tax revenues may fall below target.
 Other battles that Mr Koizumi persists in fighting look less wrong- headed than simply irrelevant. While the banks burn, Mr Koizumi has been prodding his minister in charge of public-sector reform, Nobuteru Ishihara (also travelling abroad), to crack the whip over the government's hugely ambitious privatisation programme. The true scale of this task became a little clearer this week. Of the 74 public-sector corporations that Mr Koizumi wants abolished or privatised, the bureaucrats agreed to part with just four, all of which the government had previously earmarked to get rid of anyway.
 How much of Mr Koizumi's dithering reflects a change of heart is not yet clear. The talk in Nagatacho is that Mr Koizumi has begun to cosy up to the dinosaurs of the Hashimoto faction in his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). On the election trail, Mr Koizumi strongly suggested that he would take on these anti-reformists in a straight fight. His ardour cooling, say some LDP insiders, Mr Koizumi has become more interested in cutting the sorts of political deals that would secure him a longer period in office.
 Most damning of all, the Hashimoto faction's big cheeses no longer seem threatened by Mr Koizumi's reforms. Let Mr Koizumi labour away, is their judgment, because he is unlikely to be around long enough to upset things too badly. Whatever the reason, ""Jun-chan"" already seems a shadow of the man who led his party to victory in July.","  Junichiro Koizumi flounders as the economy worsens

Of the 74 public - sector corporations that Mr Koizumi wants abolished or privatised , the bureaucrats agreed to part with just four , all of which the government had previously earmarked to get rid of anyway . 
  How much of Mr Koizumi 's dithering reflects a change of heart is not yet clear . The talk in Nagatacho is that Mr Koizumi has begun to cosy up to the dinosaurs of the Hashimoto faction in his Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) . On the election trail , Mr Koizumi strongly suggested that he would take on these anti - reformists in a straight fight . His ardour cooling , say some LDP insiders , Mr Koizumi has become more interested in cutting the sorts of political deals that would secure him a longer period in office . 
  Most damning of all , the Hashimoto faction 's big cheeses no longer seem threatened by Mr Koizumi 's reforms . Let Mr Koizumi labour away , is their judgment , because he is unlikely to be around long enough to upset things too badly . Whatever the reason , "" Jun - chan "" already seems a shadow of the man who led his party to victory in July .",740,Japan,A29-8206,POST TERM,True,"the one he drew up in April , under the discredited administration of Yoshiro Mori",2,True

 IN 1917, Lord Balfour, Britain's foreign secretary, wrote that ""His Majesty's government view with favour"" the establishment of a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine. On October 15th this week, Tony Blair declared in Downing Street, with Yasser Arafat at his side, that Britain now favoured the creation of a ""viable Palestinian state"". Historic, or what?
 What. Creating an independent Palestine alongside Israel has been British policy for many years. It has been European Union policy for many years. It has been American policy for many years. It has even been the policy of Israeli (Labour) governments for many years. The devil is all in the detail that Mr Blair did not mention: borders, refugees, Jewish settlements, the holy places and so on. But Mr Blair's silence on such details scarcely matters. This was less a substantive British initiative on Palestine than another virtuoso performance in Mr Blair's role as chief allied propagandist in the American-led war against Osama bin Laden.
 In recent weeks, Mr Blair, a silver-tongued lawyer, has won golden opinions from the American newspapers, a few of which have been worried by George Bush's tendency to grope for words and then come up with the wrong one (""crusade""). An American president would not choose to submit himself, as Mr Blair did last week, to a semi- hostile TV interview with Al Jazeera, the Qatar-based TV network that Mr bin Laden uses to put out his messages. But it is not primarily his eloquence that makes Britain's prime minister so useful to the Americans. It is his comparative freedom of manoeuvre.
 The leader of the free world can certainly say, as Mr Bush did recently, that he favours the creation of a Palestinian state. But America's domestic politics make it hard for him to summon Mr Arafat back to the White House while the intifada still smoulders. Mr Blair has no such constraint. He can invite guests who would be unwelcome in Washington; disclose information the Americans prefer not to (such as the dossier of evidence said to implicate Mr bin Laden's al-Qaeda group); and get to places that American diplomacy cannot reach (as when he sent Jack Straw, his foreign secretary, to Iran).
 Mr Blair is constrained neither by domestic politics--Iain Duncan Smith, the leader of the Conservative opposition, is trying to be even more pro-American than he is--nor by Britain's membership of the EU. Although Louis Michel, the excessively prominent Belgian foreign minister, this week accused Mr Blair of ""grandstanding"" since September 11th, few other mainland politicians have complained about Britain's prominent role in the war effort.
 One reason for this, says Charles Grant, director of a London- based think-tank, the Centre for European Reform, is that Mr Blair's EU partners welcome having a European voice that is listened to in Washington, for none of them has a similar entree. Germany's chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, has less military firepower to put at America's disposal, and needs to mollify the Greens in his coalition. France is hobbled by a double rivalry: between Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and President Jacques Chirac; and between the Defence Ministry, which would like to do some fighting, and the Quai d'Orsay, which prefers to maintain a proper Gaullist distance from anything invented in America.
 Naturally, Mr Blair is not wholly without critics at home. In Westminster and Whitehall, and not only on the streets and in newspapers, there are mutterings of dissent. The Tories may be solid, but in the House of Commons this week half-a-dozen Labour MPs, including a handful who are not just the usual suspects, expressed dismay at the bombing of Afghanistan. In Whitehall there are people from the Foreign Office who fret in private about the balance of the power.
 The balance they have in mind, however, is that between the Foreign Office and Downing Street. Since September 11th, goes this complaint, historic decisions are being made (literally) on the fly by a clique of Downing Street officials, such as Jonathan Powell, Mr Blair's chief of staff, and Alastair Campbell, his spin doctor, who have been criss-crossing the world alongside an admiring press corps in the prime-minister's aircraft. Even before September 11th, Mr Blair had appointed a senior foreign-policy adviser (Sir David Manning) and adviser on European affairs (Sir Stephen Wall) to Downing Street just when the Foreign Office was adjusting to the arrival of Mr Straw, an able politician but one untutored in foreign affairs.
 For the present, none of this matters much. It is the way of war to add to the power of the prime minister and subtract from the power of foreign secretaries. The Napoleonic wars are associated with the premiership of Pitt, not the diplomacy of Castlereagh. Besides, what Mr Blair is doing is popular. A MORI poll on October 11th found that 72% approve of the way he has handled the British response to the terrorist attacks. Moreover, 71% think that Britain was right to join America in the military strikes in Afghanistan, even though 59% think that this has made terrorist attacks against Britain itself more likely.
 Mr Blair's freedom of action plainly makes him a useful stalking horse, front man, ambassador and advocate for Mr Bush. Less clear is what Britain is getting in return, apart from promotion up the list of probable terrorist targets. Peace in Northern Ireland? Possibly (see article on this page). Influence? Harold Macmillan once said that Britain should offer the wisdom of Greece to the Americans' Roman might. Some British editorialists give Mr Blair the credit for talking Mr Bush out of an attack on Iraq and into the idea that the United Nations could play a part in nation-building in a post- Taliban Afghanistan. But in both cases Colin Powell, Mr Bush's secretary of state, was probably a more influential voice on the same side of the argument. And who is to say whether a strike on Iraq will not yet come?"," Tony Blair's excellent performance as America's ambassador to the world is winning him popularity rather than influence

 TONY BLAIR'S aides reckon that the prime minister nowadays spends about 50% of his working hours dealing with one aspect or other of the war against terrorism. It is doing him no visible harm. In mid- October, says MORI, Labour's lead over the Conservatives in the opinion polls was, at 32%, higher than at any time since just after it first came to power in 1997. But here is a thought-experiment. If there were no war, or if Mr Blair had chosen not to play such a big part in it, what would British newspapers now be writing about? They might well be full of tales of sleaze, arrogance and control freakery, just as they were at the end of 1999 and for much of 2000.
 The bad news you are not at present reading much about ranges from serious embarrassment to minor parliamentary delinquencies. But add it all together. Henry McLeish, Labour's first (ie, prime) minister in Scotland, resigned last week for misusing public funds. While Labour anoints his successor, Scotland's coalition government is being run by a Liberal Democrat. Stephen Byers, the transport secretary, stands accused of misleading Parliament about the sequence of events leading to the recent collapse of Railtrack, the privatised rail company. He emerged from a Commons inquisition this week with his job safe but his political capital much depleted (see Bagehot).
 The Commons has just expelled Geoffrey Robinson, Mr Blair's former paymaster general and the owner of the New Statesman, for three weeks. This was his punishment for having misled MPs about the details of some business dealings with the late Robert Maxwell, a former Labour MP, media tycoon and crook. In the Lords, meanwhile, Lord Falconer, the minister responsible for the Millennium Dome, has had to make a formal apology. Having told Parliament that the famous white elephant had never been insolvent, he now confesses that there was indeed a period of ""technical"" insolvency during which the Dome had to be kept afloat by public money. The government, incidentally, has yet to find a buyer for the Dome, nearly a year after it closed for business.
 These spots of bother would count for less if they did not seem to fit into a larger pattern of what even some Labour backbenchers now perceive as executive arrogance. Labour came to power in 1997 promising to root out sleaze, shake up Britain's over-centralised constitution and make government more transparent. It did reform much of the constitution in its first term. But some of its recent actions suggest that since its re-election last June it has become increasingly intolerant of dissent and exasperated with institutions- -from the judiciary to Parliament itself--that seek to check its powers.
 A small but telling example is the fate of Elizabeth Filkin, the commissioner for parliamentary standards. Her contract is not to be renewed when it expires next February. In other words, she has been sacked. She had, it seemed, shown too much zeal in her pursuit of government ministers suspected of breaching parliamentary rules.
 Last week, the government published its blueprint to continue reforming the House of Lords. This envisages a largely unelected upper house so feeble that not even Lord Wakeham, who chaired the royal commission on whose report the plan was based, was able to endorse it.
 This week, the government delivered another blow to constitutional reformers. In 1996, a year before becoming prime minister, Mr Blair said that if Labour were elected it would introduce a Freedom of Information (FOI) act, promising that such a measure would be ""absolutely fundamental"" to the way Labour governed Britain. He kept to the letter but not to the spirit of this promise. The bill enacted last November was far weaker than the one the government first proposed. And now it transpires that the main provisions of even this will not in fact come into force for another four years. Maurice Frankel, director of the Campaign for Freedom of Information, pointed out that more than 30 countries had introduced FOI laws, but none had taken so long to implement them.
 David Blunkett has added to the overall impression that this is a government that does as it pleases and brooks no criticism. This week the home secretary introduced a bill, crafted in the aftermath of September 11th, giving him draconian new anti-terrorist powers (see box on next page). He swatted away the complaints of libertarians as ""airy-fairy"". Unlike Jack Straw, whom he replaced, Mr Blunkett is not a lawyer. Some of his remarks have sent shivers through the judiciary by making open criticisms of judgments that have gone against the Home Office. Last week he warned judges not to use the Human Rights Act, which Mr Straw introduced, to overrule the Commons.
 Even if there were no war to distract voters and newspapers, none of these embarrassments, delinquencies or signs of arrogance would be big enough on its own to constitute a mortal threat to the government's popularity. All governments have their troubles, and these are minor ones. Labour continues to do well on the issues that voters care about most, such as managing the economy. As all the opinion polls attest, Iain Duncan Smith, the Conservatives' new leader, has so far been no better able than William Hague, his predecessor, to land an effective blow on the admired Mr Blair.
 Add them together, however, and it is just possible that the government's recent mistakes betoken the start of a deeper problem. They look typical of the errors that administrations begin to make once they come to consider themselves invulnerable. The Tories cannot touch Labour now. But even Labour, says Bob Worcester, the head of MORI, has its Achilles heel. In June, MORI asked whether people agreed that Labour's policies would in the long run improve the state of public services. At that time, 54% did. By October, this proportion had dropped to 45%. Voters continue to trust Mr Blair. But they are still waiting for him to ""deliver"".","  Is Tony Blair showing the carelessness that comes when government is unopposed ?

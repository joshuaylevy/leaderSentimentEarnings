MOST Greek politicians still believe a burst of pre-election spending is the best way to win over wavering voters. In spite of his modernising European leanings, Costas Simitis, the prime minister, is no exception. What is new is his timing.
A general election is not due until April next year, but Mr Simitis's Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement, better known as Pasok, is already campaigning as if it were imminent. First Mr Simitis announced a welfare package costing euro2.3 billion ($2.6 billion) to appeal to grumpy pensioners, farmers and women who have difficulty finding jobs. Then, on September 10th, he launched a ""convergence charter"". Making a rare appearance live on television, he brandished a glossy handbook packed with details of Pasok's plans to raise Greek incomes from their present 70% of the European Union's average to 80% by 2008. 
The charter has something for everyone: lower taxes for businesses and high earners, less spending on defence (now that Greece is on friendlier terms with its old enemy, Turkey) and more on education, pensions, training and job creation. Such plans would probably cost some euro7.7 billion to carry out. Cutting unemployment from 8.9% to 6% is a priority, says Mr Simitis. His government will even subsidise rents for families willing to move to places where there are more jobs. 
The plan optimistically banks on the economy's continuing to grow by around 4% a year, even when next August's Olympic games are over and the current stream of hand-outs from Brussels slows to a trickle, as funds are diverted to poorer new EU members from central Europe. Moreover, inward investment remains small (Libya got more last year), largely because of red tape and officials wanting bribes.
Pollsters say about 20% of Greek voters are floaters who make up their minds only a few weeks before polling day. Still, Mr Simitis's early start may pay off. The first poll published after the unveiling of his convergence charter suggested it had gone down well. Pasok was trailing New Democracy, the right-of-centre opposition, by just under seven percentage points, against almost ten early this year. 
Pasok has other ways to win people back. Michalis Chrysohoides, its new secretary-general, is trying to give the party a fresh look. Its die-hard Marxists and its nationalist faction are being shunted aside in favour of younger candidates with a softer, social-democratic image. Mr Simitis will appear more often on television, cutting ribbons around Athens as sports venues for the Olympics and more sections of a motorway are opened. 
Will it work? After holding power for 19 of the past 22 years, Pasok may be due for a spell in opposition. Many of its old guard are unpopular, but Mr Simitis is still considered a safe pair of hands. Voters may be wary of switching just before the Olympics, which are seen as a test of Greece's credentials as a serious player in Europe. 
Costas Karamanlis, the New Democracy leader, and his team are better than they used to be at picking holes in Pasok's grandiose schemes. But the latest announcements have thrown them into disarray. Six months ago they were expecting Pasok to fall, as one adviser put it, like a ripe fruit from the tree. Now Mr Simitis has offered a few plums of his own.","Can Greece 's prime minister , Costas Simitis , hold on to power ?

GEORGE PAPANDREOU appears to sail through life with remarkable calmness. Whether galvanising the faithful at noisy rallies, or parleying with Brussels and Washington from remote Greek villages, the foreign minister--and leader-designate of the ruling socialist party--looks cool and unruffled.
And yet he has reason not to be. The polls suggest that his Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok), which has been in power for 19 of the past 22 years, will lose the election on March 7th. So far, the Papandreou effect--the fact that many voters like the man more than his party--has not sufficed to reverse the opposition's lead.
Admittedly, the edge enjoyed by New Democracy, the centre-right opposition party, plunged to 2 points after it emerged earlier this month that Mr Papandreou, not Costas Simitis, the prime minister, would lead Pasok into battle. But Mr Papandreou's halcyon phase proved short-lived. New Democracy's lead widened again as details emerged of a sleazy affair that seemed to epitomise the sharp practices that Pasok has failed to uproot.
The opposition sniffed blood after a deputy economy minister, Christos Pachtas, used a quiet parliamentary moment to push through an amendment to allow holiday homes to be built on sensitive coastal land in northern Greece. When it became obvious that this move was an ugly piece of cronyism, it was denounced by Pasok's leaders, and the guilty were held to account. Mr Pachtas resigned in disgrace, and he and nine other deputies who backed the amendment have been excluded from the election. Fresh legislation will reverse the concession to developers; but the electoral fall-out could still be felt.
Mr Papandreou has also had to react nimbly to an acceleration of diplomatic moves over Cyprus, which could make or break the Greek-Turkish rapprochement that is his biggest achievement as foreign minister. A month ago, the Greek side of the Cyprus conundrum was basking in moral authority, after the UN had blamed the Turkish-Cypriot leader, Rauf Denktash, for wrecking its latest bid to reunify the island; and the Greek-Cypriot government was looking forward to joining the European Union--and hence to a surge in its bargaining power--on May 1st.
But on January 24th, the Turkish side deftly regained the initiative by calling for a fresh round of negotiations, using the UN plan as a ""reference point"", not a blueprint, and floating the idea of an early referendum on some bits of a settlement. To any Greek politician, especially one in the throes of an electoral contest, that sounds like a trap. For it may mean locking in concessions that are painful to the Greek-Cypriots--sharing power and money with their Turkish neighbours--with no promise of the demilitarisation or internal boundary adjustment that the Greeks most keenly desire.
In all this Mr Papandreou's gifts, including the use of his personal authority to break the foreign-policy mould, will be tested to the limit. A soft-spoken consensus-builder, he has never built a power base in Pasok, relying instead on name recognition as the son of a populist prime minister, Andreas Papandreou. Politics is a family business in Greece: Costas Karamanlis, the New Democracy leader, is the nephew and namesake of a respected prime minister, and even reformers seem to find that the dynastic factor still counts.
Born in America and educated in Sweden and Britain, Mr Papandreou sounds kinder and gentler than many Greek politicians, including his late father. After Mr Simitis, nicknamed ""the book-keeper"" because of his interest in financial minutiae, Mr Papandreou's Clintonian style--with his talk of social inclusiveness, and the folksy electronic diary that he posts on the web--makes a welcome change to Greeks.
Yet both election rivals still need to find answers to problems that Mr Simitis has failed to solve: creating more jobs, tackling corruption and removing bureaucratic hurdles that deter foreign investors. Although the stadiums are close to completion, the Athens Olympics in August will be a big challenge for the election winner. Organisers fret about putting the security measures demanded by American and British advisers in place in time. The games could exceed their euro4.6 billion ($5.8 billion) budget by a wide margin, say bankers in Athens. Mr Papandreou may yet defy the polls--but whoever takes power in March will find his in-tray overflowing.

A series of bomb attacks on the rail network in Madrid killed at least 170 people. The bombs came a few days before a general election in Spain that would have marked the end of the government of Jose Maria Aznar, who had taken a hard line against Basque separatists. 
The conservative New Democracy party convincingly won the Greek election. At 47, Costas Karamanlis, nephew of an earlier prime minister, will be Greece's youngest-ever prime minister. His immediate challenges are to help engineer a settlement of divided Cyprus, and to ensure that the Olympic Games in August are a success.

But most of the council's Shias issued a statement stressing their reservations about the document and underlining its interim nature. 
Israeli forces killed 15 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, most of them Hamas gunmen but at least four teenagers and children. A few days later the Israelis killed five Palestinian gunmen in the West Bank city of Jenin. But there were also rumours that, with Egyptian prodding, Israel's Ariel Sharon and his Palestinian counterpart, Ahmed Qurei, might at last hold their first heads-of-government meeting next week. Israel's foreign minister flew to Cairo to hold talks with Egypt's president, Hosni Mubarak.
Abu Abbas, the Palestinian who in 1985 hijacked the Achille Lauro cruise ship and had a wheelchair-bound American tourist murdered and tipped overboard, has died aged 56, apparently of natural causes. Mr Abbas had been in American captivity in Baghdad, where he was nabbed in April. 
The Zimbabwean authorities impounded an aircraft that had stopped over in Harare, the capital, en route from South Africa to an unknown destination, allegedly because it was carrying mercenaries.

According to Le Monde, a French police investigation has blamed Rwanda's president, Paul Kagame, for the shooting down of a predecessor's plane in 1994.

AFTER spending most of his career in opposition, Costas Karamanlis may have hoped for a breathing-space to learn the new job that he won this week. At 47, Mr Karamanlis will be Greece's youngest-ever prime minister; like most of his cabinet, he has never held even a junior government office. But he will have to plunge in at the deep end; within a few weeks, fateful decisions over Cyprus--the thorniest issue in Greek foreign policy for at least three decades--must be taken. On top of that, preparations for the Athens Olympics in August are lagging behind schedule.
The centre-right New Democracy party's unexpectedly big win in the March 7th election has given Mr Karamanlis a useful boost at the start of his four-year term. Most polls predicted that ND would defeat the Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) by only a narrow margin, even though the Socialists had held power for 19 of the past 22 years. But in fact ND did better than forecast, capturing 45.4% of the vote to 40.5% for Pasok. The result gave ND a comfortable majority, with 165 of the 300 parliamentary seats to Pasok's 117.
Defeat at the polls gives George Papandreou, the former foreign minister who remains the country's most popular politician, an opportunity to reinvent Pasok in opposition. But while the socialists lick their wounds, Mr Karamanlis must focus on the United Nations-backed effort to reunite Cyprus before May 1st, the date fixed for the island to join the European Union.
Greek- and Turkish-Cypriot leaders seem unlikely to reach a deal by the March 22nd deadline set by Kofi Annan, the UN's secretary-general; so Greece and Turkey will be asked to break the deadlock. Mr Papandreou was keen to broker a deal that would have allowed both bits of the island, not just the Greek-Cypriot south, to join the EU. But Mr Karamanlis's advisers want to avoid being rushed into an accord that could be unworkable.
Mr Karamanlis has picked as his foreign minister Petros Molyviatis, a 75-year-old retired diplomat, who advised his uncle, then prime minister, in the 1970s. Mr Molyviatis is suspicious of Turkey. Although Mr Karamanlis is keen to help Turkey along the road to EU membership, he must contend with elderly Greek-Cypriot leaders who doubt if they can rub along with their Turkish neighbours in a federal state. According to polls, over half of Greek Cypriots may reject the UN reunification plan at their referendum on April 20th. Turkish Cypriots, anxious to enjoy the benefits of EU membership, are more likely to vote ""yes"". What the Greeks, in Athens and Nicosia, must calculate is how high a price their side would pay for rejecting what the world sees as the best chance for a deal.
Mr Karamanlis's other immediate headache is the return of the Olympics to their native soil. Greece is expecting its NATO partners to help prevent a terrorist attack during the games. But security preparations, including the installation of a high-tech surveillance system for over 100 Olympic venues, are behind schedule. New transport systems to take spectators to the stadiums are delayed and embarrasingly, the elaborate glass and metal roof designed by Santiago Calatrava, a Spanish architect, may not be ready for the main athletics stadium in time. To speed things up, Mr Karamanlis will head the culture and sports ministry himself. He will have support from Athoc, the games organising body, headed by a former ND deputy, Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki. Mr Papandreou's promise to be a helpful opposition leader should ease Mr Karamanlis's first few months in office. In return George Alogoskoufis, the new, pro-market finance minister, will hold off on reforms that Pasok-run trade unions oppose, such as full privatisation of Greece's telecoms and electricity companies. With the euro4.6 billion ($5.7 billion) Olympics budget already hit by huge cost overruns, and contractors preparing to exact a high price for finishing projects, Mr Alogoskoufis may postpone revealing the state of public finances until the games are over. Superficially, economics should be low on the new government's list of worries, with GDP growing by a thumping 4.5% this year on the back of the Olympics and public works. But from 2007 onwards, Greece's share of EU handouts will fall sharply. So there is only a brief window of opportunity to make the country more competitive by trimming a corrupt, dysfunctional bureaucracy and making it easier to create real jobs. Given that many Greeks thrive off that bureaucracy, Mr Karamanlis must be brave as well as a quick learner.

Mr Papandreou was keen to broker a deal that would have allowed both bits of the island , not just the Greek - Cypriot south , to join the EU . But Costas Karamanlis's advisers want to avoid being rushed into an accord that could be unworkable . 
 Costas Karamanlis has picked as Costas Karamanlis's foreign minister Petros Molyviatis , a 75 - year - old retired diplomat , who advised his uncle , then prime minister , in the 1970s . Mr Molyviatis is suspicious of Turkey . Although Costas Karamanlis is keen to help Turkey along the road to EU membership , Costas Karamanlis must contend with elderly Greek - Cypriot leaders who doubt if they can rub along with their Turkish neighbours in a federal state . According to polls , over half of Greek Cypriots may reject the UN reunification plan at their referendum on April 20th . Turkish Cypriots , anxious to enjoy the benefits of EU membership , are more likely to vote "" yes "" . What the Greeks , in Athens and Nicosia , must calculate is how high a price their side would pay for rejecting what the world sees as the best chance for a deal . 
 Costas Karamanlis's other immediate headache is the return of the Olympics to their native soil . Greece is expecting its NATO partners to help prevent a terrorist attack during the games . But security preparations , including the installation of a high - tech surveillance system for over 100 Olympic venues , are behind schedule . New transport systems to take spectators to the stadiums are delayed and embarrasingly , the elaborate glass and metal roof designed by Santiago Calatrava , a Spanish architect , may not be ready for the main athletics stadium in time . To speed things up , Costas Karamanlis will head the culture and sports ministry Costas Karamanlis . Costas Karamanlis will have support from Athoc , the games organising body , headed by a former ND deputy , Gianna Angelopoulos - Daskalaki . Mr Papandreou 's promise to be a helpful opposition leader should ease Costas Karamanlis's first few months in office . In return George Alogoskoufis , the new , pro - market finance minister , will hold off on reforms that Pasok - run trade unions oppose , such as full privatisation of Greece 's telecoms and electricity companies . With the euro4.6 billion ( $ 5.7 billion ) Olympics budget already hit by huge cost overruns , and contractors preparing to exact a high price for finishing projects , Mr Alogoskoufis may postpone revealing the state of public finances until the games are over . Superficially , economics should be low on the new government 's list of worries , with GDP growing by a thumping 4.5 % this year on the back of the Olympics and public works . But from 2007 onwards , Greece 's share of EU handouts will fall sharply . So there is only a brief window of opportunity to make the country more competitive by trimming a corrupt , dysfunctional bureaucracy and making it easier to create real jobs . Given that many Greeks thrive off that bureaucracy , Costas Karamanlis must be brave as well as a quick learner .

THE idea of shutting up Greek, Turkish and Cypriot leaders in a Swiss ski resort to get them to agree to reunify Cyprus smacked of desperation. Kofi Annan, the UN secretary-general, had failed to pull off a deal last year. This week, he failed again--though by a narrower margin. After 48 hours of argument over details, only Tassos Papadopoulos, the Greek-Cypriot leader, rejected Mr Annan's latest plan.
The plan will still be put to separate referendums on April 24th in both halves of the island. But without Mr Papadopoulos's support, Greek-Cypriot voters are likely to reject it, dashing hopes that a reunited Cyprus can join the European Union on May 1st. At least it makes a change from the years when Rauf Denktash, leader of the Turkish-Cypriots, blocked all deals. Mr Denktash, now 80, had run his fief since 1974, when Turkish troops invaded the north after a short-lived coup had tried to fuse Cyprus with Greece.
When the reunification talks resumed in Nicosia in February, Mr Denktash was as unhelpful as ever. But he decided against coming to the Swiss talks. Mehmet Ali Talat, the new Turkish-Cypriot prime minister, and his coalition partner, Serdar Denktash, who is more pro-European than his father Rauf, were anxious to make a deal. So was Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey's prime minister, who is eager to polish his country's credentials in the hope of starting EU accession talks next year.
Mr Erdogan had persuaded the Turkish generals, formerly loyal to Mr Denktash, to back a settlement. Costas Karamanlis, Greece's new prime minister, was also keen to resolve the issue. So the chances for Mr Annan's plan to reunify the island as a confederation of two republics looked good. Under the plan, some 8% of the land would be given back to the Greek-Cypriots, reducing the Turkish-Cypriot share from 37% to 29% (see map). The Greeks would regain the port of Famagusta. The two states would largely run their own affairs, but the ""United Cyprus Republic"" would handle relations with the EU. 
But with Rauf Denktash off the stage, Mr Papadopoulos emerged as the hard-liner. The deal fell apart over his demand for more land--four villages in the Karpas peninsula--in exchange for agreeing to the presence of more Turkish soldiers and settlers from the mainland than the Greek-Cypriots wanted. He also objected to the Turkish request for an extended transition period, written into EU law, to stop wealthy Greek-Cypriots buying up land for development in the north. On this point, he was backed by Mr Karamanlis, who otherwise kept his distance from the Greek-Cypriot leader, not least to protect his budding friendship with Mr Erdogan.
What next? A majority of Turkish-Cypriot voters will vote for the plan on April 24th, even though Rauf Denktash will campaign against it. But the Greek-Cypriots are likely to say no. That will mean that only the Greek-Cypriot republic joins the EU on May 1st. Mr Papadopoulos will be pilloried in Brussels; but he may feel that popularity at home matters more.","The Cyprus unification plan may be rejected by Greek - Cypriots

IT WAS a fairy-tale ending that Greeks could scarcely have dreamt of. Their team arrived at Euro 2004 in Portugal as rank 80-1 outsiders. Winning the championship marked a success without parallel in Greece's recent sporting history. Over 200,000 delirious fans turned out to give their team a heroes' welcome, overflowing the stadium built for the first modern Olympics in 1896. With Athens preparing to host the Olympics again in only five weeks' time, the victory could not have been better timed. Costas Karamanlis, the prime minister, called it ""the best possible invitation to the games."" The feel-good factor may make Greeks more confident of making a success of the Olympics. They might even improve on their 13-medal haul from Sydney in 2000.
Preparations for the 17-day Olympics have been fraught with anxiety. Missed deadlines for stadiums and transport projects, and worries about the Greeks' ability to handle security, have made the International Olympic Committee (IOC) wonder if small countries should ever host the Olympics. Jacques Rogge, the IOC president, has said that future games should be awarded only to cities that already have most infrastructure in place.
Greece's euro4.6 billion ($5.6 billion) government budget for the Olympics is likely to overshoot by at least euro1.5 billion. The security budget tripled after September 11th. Political infighting delayed decision-making, sending costs soaring. Inefficient tendering gave contractors a chance to squeeze more money out by foot-dragging. But the pace picked up when Mr Karamanlis's centre-right New Democracy party ousted the Socialists after last March's elections. Co-operation between the government and Athoc, the games' organising body, improved. Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, the Athoc boss, is a former New Democracy MP with an open line to Mr Karamanlis, who has taken overall ministerial responsibility for the Olympics.
With the 35 sports venues more-or-less complete, security arrangements are now the biggest headache. Sensibly, Mr Karamanlis adopted a plan from his Socialist predecessors under which Greece's NATO partners will provide AWACS aircraft to monitor Greek airspace, plus ships to patrol in the Adriatic and Aegean. A committee of foreign security advisers includes Americans, Britons and Israelis. An American company has a contract to co-ordinate security at more than 100 Olympic sites. But it is behind schedule in installing equipment and in training operators. With less electronic protection, the onus will fall more heavily on Greece's 70,000 police, soldiers and emergency workers.
Faced with traffic restrictions and a ban on summer holidays for civil servants and bank staff, to say nothing of the burden on taxpayers, many Athenians already wonder if it was all worthwhile. Ticket sales have been slow, though the average price is lower than at Sydney. American tourists are staying away for fear of terrorist attacks, say travel agents. Yet Athens will be a better place after the games. As Mrs Daskalaki points out, Greece has built 20 years' worth of new infrastructure in one go. The stadiums, mostly clustered in low-income neighbourhoods and around the old airport, will become leisure centres that, she hopes, might encourage the young to excel at sport. New highways, a suburban train and a tram system should reduce traffic jams and pollution. And pedestrian walkways around the city's classical monuments will add to their appeal. The main sports complex, with roofs and public spaces designed by Santiago Calatrava, a Spanish architect, should become a tourist attraction in its own right. 
Corporate sponsors and the IOC are still holding their breath. Even if things go well, a glitch-free games seems unlikely. But if Mr Karamanlis is right and the Greeks' achievement in Portugal triggers a last-minute wave of Olympic visitors, a shinier, more self-confident Athens could become a trendy European city--even if the price will have been high.

COSTAS KARAMANLIS, the Greek prime minister, will have his work cut out playing host to the world's past and present leaders in a gleaming, refurbished Athens over the next couple of weeks. Some 60 are due to make an appearance at the Olympics, including America's George Bush senior and three leaders of countries that are keen to stage the 2012 games: France's Jacques Chirac, Britain's Tony Blair and Vladimir Putin of Russia. Protocol may dictate otherwise, but most Greeks know that the real guest of honour will be Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a reformist (and moderately Islamist) Turkish prime minister whose personal friendship with Mr Karamanlis has blossomed.
Mr Erdogan's original plan was to attend the Olympic opening ceremony and return to Athens later this month to see Sureyya Ayhan, Turkey's leading athlete, run in the women's 1,500-metres contest. But Ms Ayhan, a favourite for a medal, has pulled out, claiming injury, though rumours are rife of a doping scandal. Mr Erdogan, an avid sports fan, may decide to watch the weightlifting instead; Turkey's Halil Mutlu is a strong contender. But if Greece repeats its performance at the Euro 2004 tournament, and reaches the finals of the soccer competition, expect Mr Erdogan to sit next to Mr Karamanlis, who loves football, for the big match.
The flourishing personal relationship between the Greek and Turkish prime ministers also has some serious content. Every social occasion--such as Mr Karamanlis's visit to Istanbul last month to act as a chief witness at the wedding of Mr Erdogan's daughter Esra--gives a chance for a political exchange. Greece has been a strong supporter of Turkey's campaign to win a date from the European Union in December for the start of accession negotiations. Greek and Turkish diplomats also hold regular talking sessions in Athens and Ankara on a range of long-running disputes over sovereignty in the Aegean. 
The talks, hamstrung by legal debates about old treaties, go nowhere and are not expected to yield progress soon. But once Turkey is on the road, however long, to EU membership, some of the Aegean disputes may no longer be relevant. Others, such as those over territorial waters, may turn out to be easier to address in a European political framework.
On the thorny old question of Cyprus, which always lurks in the background, changes are afoot this autumn, and the two prime ministers will need to draw on the reserve of goodwill they have built up. The EU stands poised to reduce the isolation of the Turkish-Cypriots, whose enclave in the north of their disputed island is recognised only by Turkey. Last week the European Commission approved euro2.5m ($3m) to remove landmines in Cyprus, as part of a broad effort to build confidence between the island's outcast north and its Greek-dominated, internationally-recognised south. However, approval of a euro259m aid package for the Turkish-Cypriots has been delayed until next month because of a threatened veto by the Greek-Cypriot authorities. They were admitted to the Union in May, along with nine other new governments, although Greek Cypriots had rejected a UN reunification plan under which the whole island would have enjoyed the Union's benefits. As a result, the Turkish-Cypriots were left in the cold, although they backed the plan.
With the support of Greece's representatives in Brussels, the Greek-Cypriots have blocked attempts to open airports in the north to direct commercial flights--on the ground that this would give the Turkish-Cypriots less reason to join up, eventually, with their neighbours to the south.
This sort of thing makes Greek-Turkish reconciliation harder to sustain. For now, it seems, Mr Karamanlis and Mr Erdogan are not letting Cyprus cast a shadow over their comradeship. Once the games are over, though, the going will be tougher.

THIS is a tale of two countries that want to join the European Union. The first has been a stalwart member of NATO for over 50 years. It has a flourishing democracy, a lively free press and a stable government with a big parliamentary majority. Although most of its people are deeply religious, it is fiercely secular. Its economy is booming: over the past two years, GDP has grown by an annual average of 8.4%, and inflation has fallen by three-quarters, close to single figures. Unlike the current EU, it has a young and growing population. Its biggest city was a cradle of Christian (and European) civilisation. It sounds, in short, like a shoo-in for the EU.
The second country is quite different. It lies mostly in Asia, and it borders such troublesome places as Iraq, Syria and Iran. Its economy has been a basket-case for decades, its currency has been repeatedly devalued, many of its banks are ailing and it is one of the largest debtors to the IMF. It is far poorer than even the poorest of the ten countries that joined the EU in May. It has a history of military coups. Its dreadful human-rights record and its torture of prisoners are well documented. Its people are overwhelmingly Muslim, and it could soon be the EU's biggest member by population. In short, the EU should not touch it with a bargepole.
The question of which country the EU should admit is, of course, a trick one. For these are not two countries, but one: Turkey. This year the Turkish prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has become a familiar figure round Europe, pressing the case for starting membership talks. Now the moment of truth is at hand. In two weeks' time, the European Commission will publish its verdict on Turkey's readiness. And in December EU leaders must decide whether to say yes, and fix a date next year for the start of negotiations.
That it is possible, in our tale of two countries, to depict Turkey in such diametrically opposed ways shows why it presents such a poser for the EU. No other country's putative membership arouses such passions. It was a big issue in last June's European elections. This month, fresh controversy has broken out over a Turkish government proposal to criminalise adultery, which was hastily dropped after an outcry around Europe.
Several European commissioners have spoken out against Turkey's aspirations. Franz Fischler, the (Austrian) agriculture commissioner, has said that Turkey is more oriental than European. Frits Bolkestein, the (Dutch) single-market commissioner, declared that Turkish entry would mean that 1683 (when Turkish troops were thrown back from the gates of Vienna) would have been in vain. And Valery Giscard d'Estaing, a former French president, has said that Turkish entry would mean the end of Europe.
The question of Turkish membership of the European club has been around for four decades. Turkey was the second country to sign a European association agreement, normally seen as a prelude to membership, as long ago as 1963. It formally applied for membership only in 1987. The European Commission recommended against that application in 1989, but it remained on the table. Throughout the 1990s, even as they prepared to take in the eight central European countries that joined in May, European leaders trod gingerly around Turkey's hopes, though in 1996 an EU-Turkey customs union was formed. In 1997 an EU summit pointedly left the country off its list of candidates. 
This evasiveness irritated the Turks. Turkish politicians continued to insist on the country's European vocation. Turkish generals began to mutter that they might have done better in Brussels had they spent 40 years in the Warsaw Pact, not NATO. Yet the truth is that Turkey's instability in the 1990s, culminating in the ""soft coup"" that ousted a mildly Islamist party from government in 1997, made talk of EU membership moot. So did its succession of economic crises, leading to near-default and an IMF bail-out in 2001. Turkey's brutal war on Kurdish PKK terrorists in the south-east, and its repeated human-rights violations, also disqualified it.
It was not until 1999 that an EU summit in Helsinki formally accepted Turkey as a candidate. In 2002 EU leaders went further, declaring that if, in December 2004, Turkey satisfied their ""Copenhagen criteria"", they would fix a date for opening negotiations. These criteria include having stable institutions that guarantee democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for minorities, a functioning market economy, the capacity to cope with competition within the EU and the ability to take on the obligations of membership. 
The Justice and Development party, a mildly Islamist-leaning party that took office in November 2002 (though Mr Erdogan became prime minister only in March 2003), has pushed through a string of reforms to meet the Copenhagen criteria. So much so that few expect the European Commission to say no this time--although it could say ""yes, but"". It has become equally hard to see how the December EU summit can avoid offering a date, probably mid-2005, for the opening of entry talks.
Good marks and bad
How has Turkey got this far? The economy has stabilised after the horrors of 2001, thanks mainly to the IMF, but also to the economic policies of the Erdogan government. There are rocks ahead: the current-account deficit remains large, and Turkey's huge debt needs constant refinancing. Foreign investment remains feeble: last year Turkey took in a mere $1 billion, one-fifth of what went to Hungary. But fiscal policy is tight, and inflation is under control. 
On the political front, the Erdogan government has used its thumping parliamentary majority to push through a series of substantial reforms, including three big packets of constitutional change. Civilian control of the army, and over its budget, has been reasserted. The notorious state security courts have been scrapped. The judiciary is undergoing reform. Efforts have been made to improve human rights. The death penalty has been abolished. 
Progress in Turkey's largely Kurdish south-east has been remarkable. The war with the PKK (now renamed Kongra-Gel) had already subsided after the capture of the PKK leader, Abdullah Ocalan, in 1999. Earlier this year teaching in the Kurdish language, once proscribed, was permitted. In June Turkish state television began broadcasting in Kurdish for the first time. And a Turkish court freed Leyla Zana and three fellow Kurdish parliamentarians, who had languished in jail since 1994.
Mr Erdogan's culminating achievement has been to place Turkey on the moral high ground over Cyprus. Ever since 1974, Turkey and the Turkish-Cypriots have been seen as the main obstacle to a peace settlement. The Turkish army wanted to hang on to northern Cyprus for strategic reasons; the veteran Turkish-Cypriot leader, Rauf Denktash, resisted all plans to reunite the island. So the EU decided it would in extremis admit the Greek-Cypriot republic on its own. But as the enlargement date of May 1st approached, one more chance was seized to revive a United Nations plan for a re-unified Cyprus, which was put to the vote in both parts of the island in April. Thanks partly to deft footwork by Mr Erdogan, the Turkish-Cypriots voted yes; this time it was the Greek-Cypriots who said no. That switch of role means that the Cyprus issue, long an obstacle to Turkish membership, is now an argument in favour.
Many people argue that these changes are not enough. The economy remains fragile. Human rights need more protection. A new penal code that has just been put to parliament includes positive measures such as tougher penalties for torturers. But, despite the climb-down over adultery, it does not improve women's rights much: for example, it is still not severe enough on ""honour"" killings. 
On the Kurdish question, Kongra-Gel declared its ceasefire over on June 1st, because the government refuses to accept an amnesty for rebels. Some 35 soldiers and more than 70 guerrillas have since been killed. There is still local opposition to Kurdish rights. One school that planned to teach in Kurdish fell foul of a regulation about door widths. Troops have been turfing Kurds out of their homes again.
Religious freedom also remains circumscribed in Turkey. It is mysteriously hard to open a new Christian church. And the Greek Orthodox seminary on the island of Halki remains shut down. This means that no new orthodox preachers are being trained, even though the ecumenical patriarch is based in Istanbul.
Despite such failings, Gunter Verheugen, the European commissioner for enlargement, who visited Ankara last week, is pleased with Turkey's progress. He has promised to treat Turkey in the same way as all other applicants, though he has placed particular stress on implementation. It is one thing for a government to pass new laws; it is quite another for practice in local police stations, barracks and courtrooms to change. 
Mr Erdogan concedes that ""implementation is key"". He also insists that his programme of reforms will continue even if EU leaders say no in December--he jokes that he would rename the criteria after Ankara, not Copenhagen. His foreign minister, Abdullah Gul, agrees that reforms are anyway needed to make Turkey a modern democratic state. He too stresses implementation, citing the example of torture, where the aim of zero tolerance will take time to achieve. But he insists that the EU must not apply double standards to Turkey. Other applicants with implementation problems have been deemed ready to start talks, and nobody expects Turkey actually to join the EU for at least ten years.
Unwritten criteria
If the decision in December were based solely on the Copenhagen criteria, it would be hard to say no. Indeed, in its economic, political and judicial reforms, Turkey is in many ways ahead of Romania, which is hoping to join in 2007. But this being Turkey, other factors come into play.
For the Europeans, most of these factors are negative. The easiest to dispose of is the claim that Turkey is not in Europe. At the north end of the bridge across the Bosporus a sign welcomes drivers to Europe. But most geographers would say that one-tenth of the country's land-mass is already in Europe, as is most of its biggest city. Cyprus, which has joined the EU, lies to the east of Turkey's main population centres. In the 19th century, Turkey was a European power (Nicholas I of Russia dubbed it the sick man of Europe, not of Asia). Anyway, the EU has accepted Turkey's candidacy--and its geography has not changed.
Then there is size. This is not a criterion for EU membership. Indeed, Turkey could re-balance a club that has become skewed to the small. The EU, which began with three big and three small countries, now has six big and 19 small. The addition of Turkey, after Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia, would make it seven big and 22 small.
What really bothers existing members is that Turkey, which has 71m inhabitants and is growing, would be the biggest EU country, overtaking Germany in roughly 2020. Even so, its population would still be only about 15% of the EU total. Under the ""double-majority"" voting system in the draft EU constitution, it would have a weight equivalent to 14% of the total. That compares with Germany's weight, in an EU of 25, of 18%.
Turkey's poverty could pose other problems. One-third of the population is engaged in farming, which would be a big challenge for the EU's common agricultural policy. That, and its poverty, might mean big budgetary transfers from Brussels for many years--although most Turks say they are more interested in attracting foreign investment than in EU handouts.
But the biggest issue of all is Islam. Few people now insist that the EU is a Christian club, but the feeling that it should be is widespread, especially among Christian Democratic parties. September 11th, Iraq and the war on terror have all focused renewed attention on whether the EU is right to consider admitting a Muslim country. The arrival of the Justice and Development Party in government, so beneficial to Turkey's EU prospects in other ways, has not helped in this respect, for even within Turkey many suspect it of having a covertly Islamist agenda.
Mr Erdogan roundly rejects the label Islamist, yet his party has Islamist roots and its actions sometimes challenge Turkey's secularism. Mr Erdogan's first controversial target was rules that make it hard for graduates of religious training (imam hatip) schools to attend Turkish universities. In May he forced through a law giving all vocational-school graduates, including those from imam hatip schools, equal treatment with other graduates. The army chief of staff came out against the law, and the president duly vetoed it.
Mr Erdogan, who is himself an imam hatip graduate and whose four children also attend such schools, feels strongly that he is in the right. He says the army should not interfere with an issue that ought to be left to parliament; yet for now, he has dropped the law. He has acted similarly over the criminalisation of adultery. For weeks, he defended the plan, saying that the West was not ""a model of perfection for everything"". But he has now withdrawn the idea in the face of fierce protests.
The suggestion that Turkey could be kept out of the EU simply because of its religion is not really tenable. This is not least because the Union already has 12.5m Muslims, and two other potential candidates for membership--Albania and Bosnia--are partly or wholly Muslim. It is also because, in a broader sense, Islam can be read not as a negative, but a positive for Turkish entry.
Ever since September 11th, the West has been anxious to avoid a ""clash of civilisations"", and to show that democracy and liberal economics are compatible with Islam. One of the best ways to do this would be to admit Turkey to the EU. As one EU foreign minister puts it: ""letting Turkey in would be like D-Day in the war on terror"". By the same token, a no to Turkey would antagonise other Muslim countries, especially in the Arab world, who would see it as a slap in the face delivered by the West against Islam.
The naysayers
Despite these arguments, a strong body of opinion in Europe is against Turkish membership. The most negative attitudes are to be found in France, Germany, the Netherlands and Austria. Besides fretting about Islam, these countries worry about possible migration from Turkey and about cost.
In France, President Jacques Chirac's UMP party has come out against Turkish membership, though Mr Chirac has said he is in favour. In Germany the opposition Christian Democrats (CDU) and their allies in the Christian Socialist Union are against. The CDU leader, Angela Merkel, visited Ankara earlier this year and offered Turkey a special associate status instead of full membership. Mr Erdogan is not interested in any such status. In any case the Social Democratic chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, has come out for Turkish entry. So have most other EU governments, even the Dutch.
Until a few years ago, Greece was seen as an insuperable opponent of Turkish membership. But after the rapprochement that followed the earthquakes in Turkey and Greece in 1999, that has turned round: Greece is now a strong supporter of Turkey's EU goal, and its prime minister, Costas Karamanlis, is a close ally of Mr Erdogan's. Cyprus is less predictable, but the Greek-Cypriot government, already in bad odour in Brussels, is unlikely to court further calumny by vetoing Turkey. Most of the ten new countries that joined the EU in May claim to support Turkey. It is the existing EU 15, not the new countries, that fret most over Turkish accession.
The biggest reassurance to naysayers will be a promise that Turkish negotiations will take many years. Turks themselves talk of ten years, with a target date of perhaps 2015 for actual entry. Others think it will be more like 15 or even 20 years. In some ways, it is the travelling towards membership that counts, not the arrival. That reassurance alone should be enough to win Turkey its promised date for opening entry negotiations in December.
Yet there will still be a doubt over their outcome. Turkey's entry needs to be approved unanimously by the existing members. A new CDU-led government in Germany could upset the apple-cart. A failure to ratify the draft EU constitution might be seized upon as a reason to stop any talks with Turkey. Or somebody, perhaps Mr Chirac, might promise a referendum on Turkish accession to draw the sting of political opposition. It is little wonder that, although three-quarters of Turks say they favour EU membership, half say they never expect it to happen. Yet they are closer to it than anybody would have thought possible a few years ago.
Caption: Nothing to be afraid of","Many European governments dislike the idea of Turkey joining the European Union--but they are still likely to agree in December to open membership talks
THIS is a tale of two countries that want to join the European Union. The first has been a stalwart member of NATO for over 50 years. It has a flourishing democracy, a lively free press and a stable government with a big parliamentary majority. Although most of its people are deeply religious, it is fiercely secular. Its economy is booming: over the past two years, GDP has grown by an annual average of 8.4%, and inflation has fallen by three-quarters, close to single figures. Unlike the current EU, it has a young and growing population. Its biggest city was a cradle of Christian (and European) civilisation. It sounds, in short, like a shoo-in for the EU.
The second country is quite different. It lies mostly in Asia, and it borders such troublesome places as Iraq, Syria and Iran. Its economy has been a basket-case for decades, its currency has been repeatedly devalued, many of its banks are ailing and it is one of the largest debtors to the IMF. It is far poorer than even the poorest of the ten countries that joined the EU in May. It has a history of military coups. Its dreadful human-rights record and its torture of prisoners are well documented. Its people are overwhelmingly Muslim, and it could soon be the EU's biggest member by population. In short, the EU should not touch it with a bargepole.
The question of which country the EU should admit is, of course, a trick one. For these are not two countries, but one: Turkey. This year the Turkish prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has become a familiar figure round Europe, pressing the case for starting membership talks. Now the moment of truth is at hand. In two weeks' time, the European Commission will publish its verdict on Turkey's readiness. And in December EU leaders must decide whether to say yes, and fix a date next year for the start of negotiations.
That it is possible, in our tale of two countries, to depict Turkey in such diametrically opposed ways shows why it presents such a poser for the EU. No other country's putative membership arouses such passions. It was a big issue in last June's European elections. This month, fresh controversy has broken out over a Turkish government proposal to criminalise adultery, which was hastily dropped after an outcry around Europe.
Several European commissioners have spoken out against Turkey's aspirations. Franz Fischler, the (Austrian) agriculture commissioner, has said that Turkey is more oriental than European. Frits Bolkestein, the (Dutch) single-market commissioner, declared that Turkish entry would mean that 1683 (when Turkish troops were thrown back from the gates of Vienna) would have been in vain. And Valery Giscard d'Estaing, a former French president, has said that Turkish entry would mean the end of Europe.
The question of Turkish membership of the European club has been around for four decades. Turkey was the second country to sign a European association agreement, normally seen as a prelude to membership, as long ago as 1963. It formally applied for membership only in 1987. The European Commission recommended against that application in 1989, but it remained on the table. Throughout the 1990s, even as they prepared to take in the eight central European countries that joined in May, European leaders trod gingerly around Turkey's hopes, though in 1996 an EU-Turkey customs union was formed. In 1997 an EU summit pointedly left the country off its list of candidates. 
This evasiveness irritated the Turks. Turkish politicians continued to insist on the country's European vocation. Turkish generals began to mutter that they might have done better in Brussels had they spent 40 years in the Warsaw Pact, not NATO. Yet the truth is that Turkey's instability in the 1990s, culminating in the ""soft coup"" that ousted a mildly Islamist party from government in 1997, made talk of EU membership moot. So did its succession of economic crises, leading to near-default and an IMF bail-out in 2001. Turkey's brutal war on Kurdish PKK terrorists in the south-east, and its repeated human-rights violations, also disqualified it.
It was not until 1999 that an EU summit in Helsinki formally accepted Turkey as a candidate. In 2002 EU leaders went further, declaring that if, in December 2004, Turkey satisfied their ""Copenhagen criteria"", they would fix a date for opening negotiations. These criteria include having stable institutions that guarantee democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for minorities, a functioning market economy, the capacity to cope with competition within the EU and the ability to take on the obligations of membership. 
The Justice and Development party, a mildly Islamist-leaning party that took office in November 2002 (though Mr Erdogan became prime minister only in March 2003), has pushed through a string of reforms to meet the Copenhagen criteria. So much so that few expect the European Commission to say no this time--although it could say ""yes, but"". It has become equally hard to see how the December EU summit can avoid offering a date, probably mid-2005, for the opening of entry talks.
Good marks and bad
How has Turkey got this far? The economy has stabilised after the horrors of 2001, thanks mainly to the IMF, but also to the economic policies of the Erdogan government. There are rocks ahead: the current-account deficit remains large, and Turkey's huge debt needs constant refinancing. Foreign investment remains feeble: last year Turkey took in a mere $1 billion, one-fifth of what went to Hungary. But fiscal policy is tight, and inflation is under control. 
On the political front, the Erdogan government has used its thumping parliamentary majority to push through a series of substantial reforms, including three big packets of constitutional change. Civilian control of the army, and over its budget, has been reasserted. The notorious state security courts have been scrapped. The judiciary is undergoing reform. Efforts have been made to improve human rights. The death penalty has been abolished. 
Progress in Turkey's largely Kurdish south-east has been remarkable. The war with the PKK (now renamed Kongra-Gel) had already subsided after the capture of the PKK leader, Abdullah Ocalan, in 1999. Earlier this year teaching in the Kurdish language, once proscribed, was permitted. In June Turkish state television began broadcasting in Kurdish for the first time. And a Turkish court freed Leyla Zana and three fellow Kurdish parliamentarians, who had languished in jail since 1994.
Mr Erdogan's culminating achievement has been to place Turkey on the moral high ground over Cyprus. Ever since 1974, Turkey and the Turkish-Cypriots have been seen as the main obstacle to a peace settlement. The Turkish army wanted to hang on to northern Cyprus for strategic reasons; the veteran Turkish-Cypriot leader, Rauf Denktash, resisted all plans to reunite the island. So the EU decided it would in extremis admit the Greek-Cypriot republic on its own. But as the enlargement date of May 1st approached, one more chance was seized to revive a United Nations plan for a re-unified Cyprus, which was put to the vote in both parts of the island in April. Thanks partly to deft footwork by Mr Erdogan, the Turkish-Cypriots voted yes; this time it was the Greek-Cypriots who said no. That switch of role means that the Cyprus issue, long an obstacle to Turkish membership, is now an argument in favour.
Many people argue that these changes are not enough. The economy remains fragile. Human rights need more protection. A new penal code that has just been put to parliament includes positive measures such as tougher penalties for torturers. But, despite the climb-down over adultery, it does not improve women's rights much: for example, it is still not severe enough on ""honour"" killings.

IT WAS a sad end to Greece's sporting summer. Seven children were killed when a bus taking them to watch the Paralympics in Athens overturned after a collision with a lorry. The closing ceremony for the world's biggest sporting event for disabled competitors was blighted: traffic accidents caused many Paralympic athletes' disabilities. It was the more poignant given the success of the Olympics in August. 
Greece's credibility as a modern state, capable of organising a world-class event, soared after the Olympics. Costas Karamanlis, the prime minister whose centre-right New Democracy party defeated the Socialists in March's election, basked in the afterglow. All too briefly. This week's crash, similar to one two years ago, underlined how far Greece lags the rest of Europe. The north-south highway, where both accidents took place, has been improved thanks to EU money, but it is not up to European standards. Checks for roadworthiness are rare in Greece's trucking industry, which is dominated by one-man, one-vehicle businesses.
The government's budget numbers are causing even more embarrassment. A final bill for the Olympics--budgeted at euro4.6 billion ($5.6 billion) but now thought to have cost over euro7.5 billion--is still being totted up. But it is clear that the budget deficit for 2004 will reach about 5.3% of GDP, well above the supposed 3% ceiling for euro members. George Alogoskoufis, the finance minister, says the deficit can be cut next year to 2.8%. But he will have a hard time convincing anybody that Greece can get below the ceiling in just one year. 
That is partly because Mr Alogoskoufis has already shot Greece's fiscal credibility to pieces, by reviewing the budget-deficit numbers for the previous three years. His aim, he says, was to straighten out the public finances and improve transparency. Yet the extent of his upward revisions, which pushed the deficits from below 2% to over 4% of GDP, well above the 3% ceiling, has caused consternation. It has also led rating agencies to put Greece on warning for a possible credit downgrade.
Joaqun Almunia, the EU monetary commissioner, has ordered an investigation into Greece's 1998 and 1999 figures, which were used as the benchmark for its euro entry in 2001. There is some talk in Brussels of suspending EU grants to Greece. But Yannos Papantoniou, the Socialist finance minister who oversaw the country's preparations to join the single currency, is outraged. He says Mr Alogoskoufis has breached the EU's own guidelines so as to make the Socialists look bad and to help the New Democracy government to keep below 3%.
At issue are defence outlays that account for most of the increase in the deficit in Mr Alogoskoufis's review. The Socialists splurged on a $10 billion modernisation of the armed forces at the end of the 1990s, but there was no sign of this in the national accounts. Mr Papantoniou says the government acted under guidelines from Eurostat, the EU's statistical arm, allowing the amortisation of military purchases after equipment has been delivered and certified as being in working order. The equipment payments were to appear in the budget between 2005 and 2007--until Mr Alogoskoufis decided differently. 
This Greek quarrel has ramifications for would-be euro members from central Europe, most of which have deficits far above 3%. Already the gutting of the sanctions under the euro-area's stability and growth pact had given them cheer. Now they have seen yet another instance of a country apparently fudging its numbers to qualify--after such big countries as France and Italy resorted to one-off measures to the same end. Do not be surprised if central European countries, like some exemplars in western Europe, miraculously start to report deficits of 2.9% of GDP just when they are seeking to join.","The post-Olympic glow fades amid a new budget squabble

LAST March, Costas Karamanlis, just elected as Greek prime minister, shocked his countrymen by announcing that the country was ""effectively run by five davatzides (pimps)"". His use of underworld slang was meant to discredit a group of businessmen whose cosy relationship with the previous Socialist government and local media bosses had given them an edge in winning public contracts worth over euro2 billion ($2.5 billion) a year in the run-up to the 2004 Olympics. A clean-up of public life, seen by most Greeks as deeply corrupt after many years of Socialist rule, has become a priority for Mr Karamanlis's centre-right government. 
So far, the results are mixed. An audit ordered by Mr Karamanlis showed that the Socialists had fed the European Commission misleading figures to get into the euro. But the fiddling damaged the reputation of Mr Karamanlis's government too. The budget deficit, swollen by spending on the Olympics, went above 6% of GDP in 2004, over twice the ceiling set by the European Union's stability and growth pact. With Greece's economy now under close supervision by the commission, Mr Karamanlis has little room for manoeuvre on fiscal policy. 
A parliamentary inquiry into allegations that Socialist officials received millions of dollars in kickbacks from middlemen working for big defence contractors has run out of steam for lack of documentary evidence. A new media law that bans big shareholders in newspapers and television stations (plus their relatives) from owning shares in companies that bid for public contracts, may conflict with EU law. Mr Karamanlis's critics, including the boss of Greece's confederation of industry, called the law ""preposterous"" and said that extra bureaucracy required to sort out shareholder relationships would put off foreign investors whom the government is keen to attract.
In other ways, though, Mr Karamanlis's clean-up campaign may be working. Anastasios Papaligouras, the justice minister, is methodically wading through a heap of files on alleged bribe-taking by Greek judges. More than 20 senior judges are under investigation. The bank account of a jurist in Crete, who faced charges of bribe-taking and money laundering, held over euro50,0000 in transfers from a nightclub owner and from lawyers representing a drug-dealer. Several of the judges under suspicion seem to be linked to a trial-fixing ring organised by a Greek Orthodox priest with underworld connections. Other revelations of sexual misconduct by supposedly celibate bishops, leaked to right-wing newspaper and television journalists, have shocked public opinion and triggered debate over whether Orthodoxy should remain the established faith in Greece. 
Plenty of other scandals have surfaced as well, ranging from match-fixing among leading Greek soccer clubs, to doctors taking bribes from patients to speed up surgery, to army officers being bribed to exempt entertainers from military service. Mr Karamanlis insists that his clean-up campaign will continue.""Greece must become a country where the law is observed at every level of society,"" he declared on the anniversary of his New Democracy party's election win. Yet it remains open to question whether he and his party will succeed in rooting out corruption, which is deeply entrenched in Greek society.
Meanwhile, his crusade is at least keeping up Mr Karamanlis's approval ratings: one anniversary poll gave him a 15-point lead over George Papandreou, the Socialist leader. But it may also divert attention from other challenges, such as boosting tax revenues, creating more jobs and opening up markets (the state still controls 55% of the economy, a bigger slice than anywhere else in the EU). When boredom with corruption-bashing sets in, especially if it is seen not to deliver on its promises, the problems of the Greek economy may loom larger still.

Costas Karamanlis's use of underworld slang was meant to discredit a group of businessmen whose cosy relationship with the previous Socialist government and local media bosses had given them an edge in winning public contracts worth over euro2 billion ( $ 2.5 billion ) a year in the run - up to the 2004 Olympics .

FOR some years now, new brooms have been heard rustling across southern Europe. In Spain, politics became visibly less corrupt under Jose Maria Aznar. In Greece, Costas Karamanlis has launched a campaign to curb graft. The exception, however, is Italy.
A high-profile anti-corruption drive in the 1990s destroyed the crooked party-financing methods that underpinned the old, Christian Democrat-dominated system. But its long-term effect was to hand power to Silvio Berlusconi, who has several times managed to escape conviction by virtue of Italy's statute of limitations. In any case, the activities of a handful of Milan magistrates has had little lasting impact on a society held together by a network of reciprocal favours, in which respect for the rule of law is weak.
This is being brought home again by the campaign for the regional elections that are being held on April 3rd and 4th. The campaign has shown up not only alarming indifference to the law on both sides of the political divide, but also a system of justice that almost invites disdain--vitiated by unworkable legislation, legalistic humbug and a blurred separation between the judiciary and the executive.
Voters will elect governments in 14 of Italy's 20 regions, in the last big test of public opinion before a general election due next spring. The result will affect the overall mood of both the centre-right government and the centre-left opposition as they gear up for the national poll. The biggest battleground is Lazio, the region that encompasses Rome. The governor, Francesco Storace of the formerly neo-fascist National Alliance, faces challenges on two fronts: from a centre-left candidate, and from Alessandra Mussolini, grand-daughter of Italy's Duce, Benito Mussolini.
Ms Mussolini stormed out of the National Alliance in 2003 after its leader, Gianfranco Fini, had disavowed fascism on a visit to Israel. She later formed a party, Social Alternative, which the polls suggest could win as much as 9% of the vote, possibly tipping the balance against Mr Storace. But on March 12th Social Alternative was barred from standing. To cut back the number of small parties, the law requires them to present large numbers of endorsements. Electoral officials announced that hundreds of Social Alternative's endorsements were blatantly faked. One came from a sponsor who was apparently born on a February 31st.
Ms Mussolini denied the forgeries. But, contradictorily, she added that everybody did it and that she was the victim of a plot. Evidence has since emerged to suggest that she is right on both counts. The justice minister, Roberto Castelli, has admitted that the forging of endorsements has been ""going on for years"". But he has also said that the law is impractical, as it does not give the parties enough time to gather signatures. As for alleged conspiracy, it has transpired that employees of a firm answering to Mr Storace's regional government hacked into the civil registry to check details of Social Alternative's sponsors.
Opposition leaders expressed outrage, but were noticeably less scandalised by Social Alternative's original alleged ruse. In some regions, though not in Lazio, even left-wing elected representatives were found to have signed Social Alternative's endorsements. Ms Mussolini herself went on hunger strike outside a court to which she had appealed, but the judges still upheld the ban. She then left her mobile home for a meal of salad and lasagne, and announced a further appeal. The same day the cabinet gave the judge in charge of the court that ruled against Ms Mussolini a top job as head of Italy's media watchdog. Both the judge and the government stoutly deny that there is any link between these two events.
As it happens, the court's judgment was later nullified because, on March 22nd, Ms Mussolini secured an entirely different ruling from Italy's supreme administrative court. The court decided that the real issue was not whether the endorsements were fakes, but whether they were properly authenticated by the appropriate official. It later came out that two of the five judges who ruled in Ms Mussolini's favour had held senior positions in a previous, centre-left government. Again, there is no suggestion that they were influenced by their political affiliations. But the affair shows up the fragile credibility of a judiciary whose members can float easily from court to government and back again.
Ms Mussolini is pressing ahead with a campaign that may yet have potentially far-reaching effects. A former B-movie starlet with improbably pneumatic lips and blonde hair, the Duce's grand-daughter is a formidable communicator whose cause has now been boosted by a massive dose of publicity. Mr Berlusconi had hoped that, once she had let off steam in Lazio, Ms Mussolini could be wooed into his broad alliance in time for next year's general election. That looks unlikely now.
Her campaign of revenge has infuriated former associates on the right and made her an unlikely darling of the left. Italy's opposition is desperate to oust Mr Berlusconi, not least because it fears that he is systematically neutralising rival sources of power and could become, in effect, impossible to remove. He directly or indirectly controls six of the seven main television channels. He is curbing the freedom of prosecutors. Last week, the Senate approved a constitutional reform that would enhance the powers of the prime minister, weaken those of the president and undermine the independence of the constitutional court--though the reform will need to be endorsed by a referendum. 
Italy's opposition leaders, mostly professionals or academics, must envy Ms Mussolini the populist skills they so manifestly lack. In a televised debate with Mr Storace this week, she overwhelmed the governor, who was opining about the family, by repeatedly asking him the price of nappies. Yet in the long run Ms Mussolini could do her new-found friends more harm than good, by luring them into a betrayal of their principles. Ever since the second world war, the most sacred of these has been anti-fascism. Italy's socialists and progressive Catholics, its environmentalists and its former communists, all need to think hard about whether they really want the help of a woman whose supporters in Milan greeted her earlier this year with loud chants of ""Duce, Duce"".

ON MAY 5th, shareholders in Britain Inc will vote for their next chief executive. Apart from the sheer kick of running a country, what's the pay like for the job? Lousy, according to a study of European political leaders by Hay Group, a human-resources consultancy.
In terms of his (for such it will be) take-home pay, Britain's next prime minister will earn pounds 178,900 a year. This is 4% less than Gerhard Schroder, the German chancellor, but 63% more than Costas Karamanlis, the prime minister of Greece (see chart). 
Top political jobs, however, vary according to the size of the country (how many customers for your services), its geopolitical significance (how much travel involved) and its internal structure (how much work can be fobbed off to others). Taking such factors into account, and the element of job-sharing in countries such as France that have an executive president and a prime minister, Hay has graded the size of the top political jobs around Europe and found that of the British prime minister to be the biggest of them all, in a class of its own. 
The consultants then asked what leaders with jobs of that size might expect to earn in the private sectors in their own countries. And here Britain's prime minister comes off badly, earning only 8% of what he could expect heading a big company like BP or Unilever. Norway's prime minister, Kjell Magne Bondevik, earns 31% of what he could expect for a comparable private-sector job in Norway. On this ranking, only Poland's leader does worse than Britain's.
Political leaders can hope to catch up on their forgone earnings in later life, after they have retired from office. A public-sector pension (defined in Dr Johnson's dictionary as ""pay given to a state hireling for treason to his country"") is generally generous, and former leaders can expect to be in demand from publishers and on the lecture circuit. Sir (since last weekend) John Major, Britain's most recent ex-prime minister, tours the world in a private jet with a full-time chief-of-staff, lecturing to the likes of the American Dental Association and the Tax-Free World Association on timeless subjects such as ""The Changing World"".

COSTAS KARAMANLIS would like to be the first Greek prime minister in half a century to make an official visit to Turkey. Besides demonstrating the positive shift in Aegean relations, a trip would put a stamp on Mr Karamanlis's own contribution. His centre-right government has consistently backed Turkey's desire to join the European Union. And he gets on well with Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish prime minister, a fellow soccer enthusiast.
The official visit was first planned for June, but Mr Karamanlis was persuaded to wait until August, when Turkey should have cleared the last remaining hurdle to the start of EU membership talks on October 3rd: signing the protocol extending its customs union with the EU to the ten new members that joined last year, including Cyprus. Yet last week Mr Karamanlis called off his visit again. Turkey had signed the protocol, but also issued a statement that this did not imply recognition of the Greek-Cypriot government.
Such non-recognition, declared Yannis Valinakis, Greece's deputy foreign minister, ""will cast a shadow over Turkey's accession talks."" Greek enthusiasm for Turkish membership may wane if Turkey keeps refusing to recognise the Greek-Cypriot government. The stakes were raised last week when France's prime minister, Dominique de Villepin, said it was ""inconceivable"" that membership talks could begin with a country that did not recognise all 25 members of the EU. This week the European enlargement commissioner, Olli Rehn, responded that new conditions could not be set for the start of entry talks.
In this confusing situation, Mr Karamanlis reluctantly called off his visit. He is worried about losing popular approval if he seems not to care about Cyprus, or to care less about it than France does. The island remains divided after the Greek-Cypriots voted overwhelmingly against the UN reunification plan in a referendum in April 2004 (the Turkish-Cypriots voted in favour). Showing solidarity with Greek-Cypriots, even though they shot down the UN plan, counts in Greek public opinion. 
Cyprus is not the only issue. Nationalist Greeks are quick to respond to pin-pricks, which often involve the Turkish armed forces; for example, there have been renewed Greek complaints of airspace violations. Turkey is resisting pressure to reopen a seminary for Greek Orthodox priests on the island of Heybeli, near Istanbul, an issue that Greeks see as a benchmark for assessing the Turkish government's commitment to EU standards of human rights and religious freedom.
Among Greeks, there is still a widespread desire to see Turkey following a European road to respectability and regional peace. Since Turkey became an EU candidate, the Greek and Greek-Cypriot governments have both cut defence spending sharply. A Europeanised Turkey would relieve deep-seated feelings of insecurity in Athens and Nicosia about Turkey's large size and powerful army.
In practical ways, too, Greek-Turkish rapprochement is steaming ahead. Mr Karamanlis and Mr Erdogan met in July, on the border in Thrace, where they initiated the construction of a pipeline to carry gas from Turkey via Greece to Italy--their first cross-border infrastructure project. Many well-off Greeks now take holidays on Turkey's Aegean coast, where five-star hotels are cheaper and offer better service than on many Greek islands. There is talk of a Turkish conglomerate buying a stake in a Greek-owned oil refinery. If Turkey starts its EU talks in October, Mr Karamanlis may yet get to Ankara--and into the history books--before the year is out.","The troubles affecting Greek support for Turkey 's EU aspirations

""TO YOUR right, you can see Portugal burning."" On a flight leaving Lisbon this week, passengers heard that gloomy advice as they gazed down at the smoke billowing up from pine and eucalyptus trees.
From space, the images are even more dramatic: giant plumes, swirling over the Atlantic, and black scars where forest used to be. On the ground, about 4,000 exhausted fire fighters are battling blazes that have been breaking out at an average rate of more than 400 a day since August 13th. So far this year, Portugal's fires have claimed the lives of 15 people, 11 of them firemen, and ruined many livelihoods.
Fires have already burnt close to 180,000 hectares (444,800 acres) of forest this summer in what is expected to be the second-heaviest annual toll since records began 25 years ago. Aggravated by the country's worst drought in more than 60 years, they come only two years after politicians promised to end the fires that killed 18 people and destroyed almost 426,000 hectares of forest during the heat wave that hit southern Europe in 2003.
Returning from holiday, rather tardily, to a country in flames, the Socialist prime minister Jose Socrates took flak for his inadequate response to the crisis. ""Our task now is to put out the fires,"" Mr Socrates retorted this week, visiting Coimbra in the heart of one afflicted region. ""Then we will look at the structural causes."" One of the first questions he must answer is why more forest burns in Portugal than in comparable southern European states like Spain, France, Italy and Greece.
Equipment is clearly lacking. The number of fire-fighting planes and helicopters has increased from 38 last year to 49. But Portugal owns none of the Canadair aircraft which are most useful against forest fires. Greece has 23 and Italy 16.
Unfortunately, comparisons with other southern European countries do not end there. Across the region, the share of land covered by forest is shrinking, while the proportion shrouded in concrete is increasing. In all south European states, arson plays some part in accelerating that process--but just how big a part?
As Portugal burns, conspiracy theories abound.

In Greece, this year's worst forest fires all broke out on the same day, near fast-growing suburbs east of Athens where olive groves give way to combustible coastal pine-forests. According to police, the fires seem to have been started deliberately, with a view to clearing land for building, a long-established practice around Greek towns and cities. In the countryside, shepherds are blamed for setting fires on windy days, in order to open up more grazing land. As livestock farming declines, big forest fires have become less frequent.
The pine-forests on the mountains around Athens make the city more attractive as well as helping absorb atmospheric pollution. But the temptation to burn them selectively, to make way for upmarket suburbs, remains strong. Few arsonists have been arrested.
The absence of a nationwide land registry encourages illegal building on state-owned land. The forestry service has a poor track record on replanting burned areas, as required by law. At best, only 25% of land damaged by fire is reforested.

""TO YOUR right, you can see Portugal burning."" On a flight leaving Lisbon this week, passengers heard that gloomy advice as they gazed down at the smoke billowing up from pine and eucalyptus trees.
From space, the images are even more dramatic: giant plumes, swirling over the Atlantic, and black scars where forest used to be. On the ground, about 4,000 exhausted fire fighters are battling blazes that have been breaking out at an average rate of more than 400 a day since August 13th. So far this year, Portugal's fires have claimed the lives of 15 people, 11 of them firemen, and ruined many livelihoods.
Fires have already burnt close to 180,000 hectares (444,800 acres) of forest this summer in what is expected to be the second-heaviest annual toll since records began 25 years ago. Aggravated by the country's worst drought in more than 60 years, they come only two years after politicians promised to end the fires that killed 18 people and destroyed almost 426,000 hectares of forest during the heat wave that hit southern Europe in 2003.
Returning from holiday, rather tardily, to a country in flames, the Socialist prime minister Jose Socrates took flak for his inadequate response to the crisis. ""Our task now is to put out the fires,"" Mr Socrates retorted this week, visiting Coimbra in the heart of one afflicted region. ""Then we will look at the structural causes."" One of the first questions he must answer is why more forest burns in Portugal than in comparable southern European states like Spain, France, Italy and Greece.
Equipment is clearly lacking. The number of fire-fighting planes and helicopters has increased from 38 last year to 49. But Portugal owns none of the Canadair aircraft which are most useful against forest fires. Greece has 23 and Italy 16.
Unfortunately, comparisons with other southern European countries do not end there. Across the region, the share of land covered by forest is shrinking, while the proportion shrouded in concrete is increasing. In all south European states, arson plays some part in accelerating that process--but just how big a part?
As Portugal burns, conspiracy theories abound. The culprits are variously identified as pyromaniacs, as people venting grievances against forest owners, as people with a commercial stake in the fire-fighting business, or (most plausibly) as land speculators. One bizarre theory says Portugal is being punished for sending a small military unit to Iraq. Anybody who sees this year's drought as the main factor is just naive--such is the popular verdict.

LOOK at the faculty list for any leading university in America or Europe and you will be struck by the number of Greek names. Campuses all over the Western world--especially Britain--are also full of Greek students, many of whom get excellent results under pressure from parents who have stretched their family budgets to give their children the best chance. But despite the importance that Greeks attach to education, Greece has some of the worst universities in Europe.
Marietta Giannakou, the Greek education minister, hopes to start correcting that. She says there are about 5,000 scientists and professors of Hellenic origin who might be lured back to their native land if its university system were more rational and freed from the state's stranglehold. But the minister's efforts at reform have run into a wave of violent protests, both among students and among academics who like the status quo.
Instead of sitting their qualifying exams, Greek students spent the final weeks of the academic year staging noisy street demonstrations. Last week, a group of extremists among a 10,000-strong student protest in Athens hurled petrol bombs and paving-stones at police, who fought back with tear gas. The protesters claim to be inspired by those at the Athens Polytechnic who tried to overthrow Greece's ruling colonels three decades ago. But graffiti around Athens University explain their main gripe: they are enraged by the centre-right government's talk of ending the state's monopoly on higher education and introducing private, not-for-profit universities.
Such universities would certainly charge for tuition, but they could also get cash from Greek shipping tycoons and other frustrated benefactors, who now endow departments of Greek studies at American universities and would love a chance to be similarly generous at home. Greece's economy--one of the weakest in the euro area--would improve faster if more students could earn MBAs and doctorates in computer sciences at home, Mrs Giannakou argues.
Even if the mood on the streets were calmer, she would not be able to authorise independent universities at a stroke. That requires a change in the constitution, a complex procedure that starts in the life of one parliament but can be completed only in the next. But there are other things that parliament could, in theory, do now--such as set time limits for students to finish their courses, or make them pay for some tuition and textbooks. Those were among the aims of an education bill which Mrs Giannakou had hoped to push through parliament during its partial recess this summer. After the recent protests, the bill has been shelved until the autumn. 
The centre-right government will not give up on education reform. One reason why Costas Karamanlis, the American-educated prime minister, is prepared to tackle it is that the Socialist opposition leader, George Papandreou (who has degrees from American and British universities), agrees on the need for change.
Higher education is only one area of Greek life where common sense--and cooler heads in the top ranks of both main political parties--points one way, while long-established practice, and the mood on the street, point in the opposite direction. Much the same applies to the security situation in the Aegean, where military competition between Greece and Turkey costs billions of dollars--and puts at risk even larger amounts of tourist revenues, in the event of a serious incident. A lot of money could be freed to improve its education system, if Greece were somehow able to reduce the share of GDP that it now spends on defence.

A SCANDAL about state-run pension funds might worry any government. For Costas Karamanlis, the conservative prime minister who promised to clean up sleaze, allegations of corruption at a fund for Greece's 500,000 civil servants are especially damaging.
At issue are structured bonds, a risky investment vehicle. An Athens stockbroker is said to have overcharged the civil-service fund when it bought chunks of a euro280m ($370m) structured bond issued in February by the Greek state. Market gossip has it that bond salesmen paid kick-backs to pension-fund managers chosen by Mr Karamanlis's New Democracy party.
Savvas Tsitouridis, the social-welfare minister, has sacked the civil-service fund manager (the son of New Democracy's finance boss) and called in a public prosecutor. George Alogoskoufis, the finance minister, has ordered an audit of Greece's 200-odd pension funds and banned investment in the risky bonds.
Only a handful of Greek pension funds are professionally managed. The state pension funds' investments of euro30 billion are monitored by the central bank. Jobs as pension-fund managers and board members are dished out to people with links to the ruling party. The perks can be generous. ""The bond affair was a scandal waiting to happen,"" comments a local banker.
It comes after a three-month confrontation with students and professors over higher-education reforms. The state's monopoly on universities means they are poorly financed and staffed by political appointees. An Athens degree is enough for a safe job in the public sector, but young Greeks who want a higher-flying career head for universities abroad.
Mr Karamanlis's plan to change the constitution to permit private universities failed because he lacks a three-fifths majority in parliament. After hinting that they would support the change, the opposition Socialists backed off as street protests became more violent. So the government has settled for more modest reforms. A new law will set a deadline for students to take their degrees. Although rebel professors say they will not enforce it, universities should become more serious places without the 35-year-old ""students"" who lead most protests and sit-ins.
The voters have shrugged off Mr Karamanlis's failure over higher education, but the pension-fund scandal has dented his poll ratings. For the first time since March 2004, his party is less than a point ahead of the Socialists. Mr Alogoskoufis is leading the counter-attack, meeting Socialist accusations of ""looting the state"" with reminders of a stockmarket bubble in 2000 on their watch. Small investors lost euro2 billion in a post-election collapse, when a government-run organisation stopped propping up the market by trading shares in state corporations.
Mr Alogoskoufis also argues that the economy is doing well. For the first time in a decade, unemployment is below 9%. GDP is growing by around 4% a year. Greek shipping companies, run now from Athens not London, are bringing home handsome profits from carrying China's imports of raw materials. Foreign investors are building new tourist resorts and second homes for north Europeans. A mini-boom in the Balkans is helping: a Greek bank opens a new branch in a neighbouring Balkan country almost every week.
Mr Karamanlis is watching the polls closely. Although George Papandreou, the Socialist leader, has recently adopted a more populist style, he lacks political credibility. Mr Karamanlis must decide soon whether to call an early election in October or hold on until his four-year term expires next March. If the bond scandal looks like producing more embarrassing revelations, he may go for a snap poll. Whatever he does, the government's clean image has been irretrievably tainted.","A corruption row hits a previously popular government

EVERYBODY loves a fireman, especially those saviours from the sky who swoop down in yellow-painted Canadair planes and ""bomb"" fires with six tonnes of water in a single swoop. Not everybody, it is fair to say, loves the European Union. So it is little wonder that every summer, as forest fires crackle and roar across southern Europe, politicians suggest Brussels should make itself more popular by creating an EU fleet of such planes.
Given that the most sought-after models, made by Bombardier of Canada, cost more than euro19m ($26m) a pop, it is argued that such precious assets should be shared. Better still, they should be painted with the blue-and-gold European flag so that grateful citizens can see who is zooming to their aid. A 2006 report for the European Commission--warmly welcomed by the European Parliament--argued for the creation of a new civil-protection force, dubbed ""EuropeAid"". It suggested buying ten new water bombers as the minimum needed to form a ""credible"" Euro-squadron (though whether they should be paid for by EU funds or national governments was left unclear).
The author of that report, a former French foreign minister, Michel Barnier, has been at it again. While inspecting fire precautions in southern France on July 26th, in his new capacity as his country's agriculture minister, Mr Barnier renewed his call for a ""EuropeAid"" force. His boss, the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, discussed creating ""some sort of European fleet"" of jointly owned fire planes during a working lunch with the Greek prime minister, Costas Karamanlis. The EU environment commissioner, Stavros Dimas (whose officials would control such a fleet), unsurprisingly found the plan ""very encouraging"".
In the face of yearly devastation--only this week, fire damaged a third of the forest cover on the two largest Canary Islands, forcing the evacuation of 14,000 people--the Canadairs offer impressive proof to voters that the authorities are taking the disasters in hand. Specially toughened boat planes, they can attack fires up to nine times an hour, skimming across a nearby lake or sea to fill their tanks in seconds. (According to a popular tale, a Canadair once sucked up a diver by mistake and dropped him, flippers sadly waving, onto a fire. Not true: the water intakes are only inches wide.)
Mr Barnier's report does not conceal the political dimension, saying it is ""essential"" to make EU assistance more visible. It says there should be a single Euro-uniform worn by ""all staff acting as part of the European force"", emblazoned with the EU flag, the flag of the wearer's country and the words ""EuropeAid"".
European politicians should resist such temptations. Their ability to do so will say much about whether the EU puts action above spin. There is every sense in helping nations share expensive assets to confront menaces such as forest fires. But the union is already doing just that. The commission runs an excellent unit called the Monitoring and Information Centre (MIC), swiftly linking countries that need emergency equipment with European governments that have planes to lend. Another unsung commission unit, EFFIS, sends out daily forest-fire risk assessments, based on weather forecasts and the like.
There is no reason to suppose that a joint EU squadron would work better. One EU official admits it would be politically ""difficult"" to decide where to send planes when fires are raging in several countries. Even Canada, a single state, merely encourages provincial governments to share water bombers; it does not direct their movements. As David Martell, a University of Toronto academic, notes: ""There is no way political leaders in one jurisdiction are going to allow themselves to be dictated to by somebody else"" at such times.
Forestry experts in bodies such as the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) show surprisingly little yearning for big sums to be devoted to water bombers. European governments have spent hugely on new equipment in recent years. Bombardier's records show that there are already 76 Canadairs in service in EU nations, including 36 of the latest type (a 37th crashed in Greece last month, killing its crew). Money might now be better spent on fire prevention. Although the overall area of land burned each season is in decline because of better fire-fighting equipment, the number of blazes in EU forests keeps rising.
The poor shepherd
Researchers point to several reasons, few of which can be resolved by water-bombing. Important factors include rural depopulation, growing wealth, arson and stupidity. Once people can afford gas cookers, and stop herding goats, firewood gets left on the ground and flammable scrub is left uncleared. The last, elderly shepherds start fires to clear thorny scrub and to promote green-shoot growth, ""but they lack the physical strength or the manpower to control a fire, and it gets out of hand,"" says Pieter Van Lierop, a forest-fires expert at the FAO. Climate change plays a role, and so do dimwits (cigarette butts start many fires).
Governments talk a lot about arson, especially by property speculators trying to build on forest land. Many Mediterranean states have laws against building on burned forest land (under a 2006 Spanish law, land use cannot be changed for 30 years after a forest fire). Corruption, and weak or clogged legal systems, can undermine such rules, of course. Part-time firemen sometimes set fires to generate work for themselves, a new FAO report notes. A local forest ranger is being held in the Canary Islands, accused of just that. But the FAO also suggests that loud talk of arson can be cover for government ""ineffectiveness"".
Forestry experts favour rather mundane solutions, like education, making firebreaks and hiring ground crews with spades and hoes. That may please the crowds less than EU-flagged planes piloted by heroes in blue and gold flightsuits. But if politicians want to be loved, they should have chosen another trade: being a fireman, perhaps?","What this summer's forest fires say about the priorities of EU politicians

In its first-ever referendum, Thailand's voters narrowly approved a new constitution drafted by a panel appointed by the military government, which took power in a coup last September. The vote paves the way for elections before the end of the year. But a party dominated by supporters of Thaksin Shinawatra, the ousted prime minister, may turn out to be a front-runner in the election, causing consternation in the army.
An indefinite curfew was imposed in Dhaka and five other cities in Bangladesh after three days of rioting. Sparked by a trivial incident at Dhaka University, protests spread to most university towns, as students called for the lifting of emergency rule and the restoration of democracy.
In parliamentary elections in Kazakhstan, the party of Nursultan Nazarbayev won all the contested seats. The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe found flaws in the electoral arrangements.
After organising rare protests, against steep increases in fuel prices, some of Myanmar's leading dissidents, many of whom have spent much of the past two decades in prison, were arrested again.

In India, the Communist parties, on which the ruling Congress-led coalition relies for a parliamentary majority, threatened to withdraw their support for the government if it proceeds with its nuclear co-operation deal with America.
In a referendum in the Maldives, voters supported a proposal for a presidential system, seen by the government as an endorsement of the president, Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who has been in power for 29 years.

In Peru, rescue attempts to find survivors in towns on the country's south coast wrecked by an earthquake that killed more than 500 people were followed by efforts to bring emergency aid to 100,000 people made homeless.
Hurricane Dean, the first strong Atlantic storm of the year, killed about 20 people in the Caribbean, damaging houses and banana crops and forcing the postponement of Jamaica's election, due on August 27th. But it missed Cancun, from where thousands of tourists had fled.
Brazil's president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, announced a $3.3 billion five-year plan to tackle violent crime in 11 cities, including building 160 new prisons, improving salaries and conditions for police, and more social programmes for poor youths.
After only six hours of debate, Venezuela's National Assembly unanimously approved radical constitutional changes that abolish presidential term limits and envisage a socialist economy. The assembly is made up solely of supporters of President Hugo Chavez, because the opposition boycotted its election in 2005. The new constitution will be put to a referendum later this year.

JUST as the weather is cooling in Greece, after a record heatwave that has brought devastating forest fires, politics has heated up again. Costas Karamanlis, the country's conservative prime minister, has announced an election on September 16th, six months ahead of schedule.
Mr Karamanlis says his New Democracy (ND) party needs a fresh mandate to tackle pension reform. Greece, which spends more on pensions than the European Union average, is under pressure from Brussels to overhaul its fragmented, inefficient system. Workers who receive generous payouts, such as bank employees, object to proposals for merging pension funds and raising the retirement age. It is 15 years since the last modest reform took place.
New Democracy's credibility on pensions has been undermined by a scandal over purchases of government bonds at inflated prices by pension-fund managers appointed by the social-welfare minister. More than 50 people, mostly officials at state pension funds, banks and brokerages, may face charges of fraud, money-laundering and tax evasion. Mr Karamanlis, who last campaigned on an anti-sleaze platform, has some explaining to do.
Modernising old-fashioned state universities is another priority. Greece is still short of courses in business, finance and IT, and Mr Karamanlis wants to amend the constitution to allow private non-profit universities to be set up. His first attempt collapsed earlier this year after three months of violent student protests. But grown-up voters are keen to end the state's monopoly on higher education.
The issue that will cost New Democracy most votes, say analysts, is the handling of the forest fires. One blaze on Parnes, a mountain outside Athens, raged for a week while emergency services struggled to co-ordinate their efforts, and firefighting aircraft were grounded because they had not been maintained.
But can George Papandreou, head of the Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok), exploit his opponents' weakness? Infighting is rife under his leadership. Mr Papandreou has given up trying to make Pasok more like a west European social democratic party. These days he sounds more like his populist father, Pasok's founder, Andreas Papandreou--whose style may not appeal nowadays to the centrist swing voters who decide Greek elections.
The small, far-right Laos party of George Karatzaferis, a former ND deputy and energetic member of the European Parliament, could pose a bigger threat to New Democracy's chances. Laos, which is strongly nationalistic, is likely to appeal to disaffected ND voters, especially in regions with high unemployment.
Mr Karamanlis is betting that a buoyant economy, growing at an annual rate of more than 4%, will win him another four-year term. The budget is at last under control; a new ""social cohesion fund"" is being launched to help poor families and the elderly; and, despite the fires, tourism has rebounded, with a record 16.5m visitors expected this year. The jobless rate, though still high among the young, is now around 6% for heads of households.
Greece's proportional election system favours the front-running party. According to most polls, New Democracy has led Pasok almost throughout its current term. Mr Karamanlis has kept a seven-to-ten-point lead over Mr Papandreou as the best choice for prime minister. Observers agree that Mr Karamanlis, a shrewd electoral tactician, will be hard to beat.","Costas Karamanlis seeks a renewed mandate

At least 52 people were killed in fighting in the holy city of Karbala between Iraq's two biggest Shia militias--the Mahdi Army loyal to a cleric, Muqtada al-Sadr, and the Supreme Iraqi Islamic Council, which follows the Hakim family.

Mr Sadr told his militia to ""suspend its activities"" for up to six months, though it was unclear what that would entail.

Separately, the Saudi government banned an influential London-based pan-Arab newspaper, al-Hayat, which is owned by a son of the crown prince, apparently because it criticised some government departments and refused to heed the information ministry's orders.
A Saudi company run by a half-brother of Osama bin Laden said it would secure 1,500 square kilometres (580 square miles) of land in Yemen and 600 square kilometres in Djibouti, on opposite sides of the Red Sea, to build two cities that would eventually be connected by a bridge 27km (17 miles) long, linking Africa and Asia.

AS RECENTLY as two years ago, a forest fire came close to burning down the home of Costas Karamanlis. His seaside villa outside Athens was spared, but the conflagration prompted the Greek prime minister to promise stricter measures to stop developers from building on land cleared by fires; satellite photos, for example, would be taken at regular intervals to help enforce Greece's law banning construction in forest areas.
Mr Karamanlis failed to deliver. This week the emergency services struggled to contain the worst forest fires in Greece for more than a century, which have killed more than 60 people. Forestry officials say the firefighters' work was hampered by the lack of satellite imagery.
Many perished trying to escape from Zacharo, a village in the Elis district in south-western Greece, as it was engulfed by flames. Homes in more than 100 villages were gutted. By some estimates, the fires have so far caused euro5 billion ($6.8 billion) worth of damage.
The government, which called a snap election on September 16th, may yet face a backlash over its handling of the fires. It was quick to come up with money for the stricken--euro13,000 (roughly $18,000) in cash, equivalent to more than a year's income for many villagers. Few were grateful, though. Many who escaped said they felt let down by the authorities. Conspiracy theories abound. Some members of Mr Karamanlis's New Democracy party claim their opponents started fires deliberately to discredit the government.
In truth, there are many causes. To begin with, Greece lacks a proper fire-prevention strategy. An exceptionally hot summer, following a winter drought, has made the resinous pine forests particularly flammable. Other countries, such as Italy, are having a bad year of forest fires.
But arsonists certainly have strong economic incentives. Rising incomes have fuelled a construction boom. In Greece, as in other Mediterranean countries, demand is particularly high for land near the sea to build second homes. Although Greek law states that builders cannot put up homes on former forested areas, developers are practised at getting around such regulations.
One reason is that Greece, unlike other European states, lacks a comprehensive register of forests and land ownership. A programme to put this right, paid for by the European Union, is moving slowly. It is easy to have burned forest land reclassified as former farmland, which can then be sold for development. Local officials are often open to bribery, while politicians are prone to declaring amnesties for illegal buildings ahead of an election.
Such problems plague other fire-prone parts of Europe. In Italy, where at least seven people died in fires this summer, an environmental group, Legambiente, estimates that 60% of fires are deliberately set. Some are the work of pyromaniacs. Others are started by farmers trying to clear land, or by part-time forestry workers creating employment for themselves.
There are also good reasons to suspect economic motives linked to Mafia-style organised crime. In 2000 the government passed a law banning construction for 15 years on property where there had been a blaze. However, such legislation has to be adopted at local level. In Sicily, not a single council has incorporated the law. In Campania, stronghold of the Camorra syndicate, a firefighting helicopter was shot at on August 6th.
In Spain, though, a recent study by Greenpeace, an environmental lobby group, suggested that deliberate arsonists were only a minority. Looking at thousands of fires whose causes fire were known (about half the blazes in the past decade), the study suggested that the worst culprits were farmers starting fires to burn stubble, clear land or remove rubbish.

Costas Karamanlis's seaside villa outside Athens was spared , but the conflagration prompted Costas Karamanlis to promise stricter measures to stop developers from building on land cleared by fires ; satellite photos , for example , would be taken at regular intervals to help enforce Greece 's law banning construction in forest areas . 
 Costas Karamanlis failed to deliver . This week the emergency services struggled to contain the worst forest fires in Greece for more than a century , which have killed more than 60 people . Forestry officials say the firefighters ' work was hampered by the lack of satellite imagery . 
 Many perished trying to escape from Zacharo , a village in the Elis district in south - western Greece , as it was engulfed by flames . Homes in more than 100 villages were gutted . By some estimates , the fires have so far caused euro5 billion ( $ 6.8 billion ) worth of damage . 
 The government , which called a snap election on September 16th , may yet face a backlash over its handling of the fires . It was quick to come up with money for the stricken -- euro13,000 ( roughly $ 18,000 ) in cash , equivalent to more than a year 's income for many villagers . Few were grateful , though . Many who escaped said they felt let down by the authorities . Conspiracy theories abound . Some members of Costas Karamanlis's New Democracy party claim their opponents started fires deliberately to discredit the government . 
 In truth , there are many causes . To begin with , Greece lacks a proper fire - prevention strategy . An exceptionally hot summer , following a winter drought , has made the resinous pine forests particularly flammable . Other countries , such as Italy , are having a bad year of forest fires . 
 But arsonists certainly have strong economic incentives . Rising incomes have fuelled a construction boom . In Greece , as in other Mediterranean countries , demand is particularly high for land near the sea to build second homes . Although Greek law states that builders can not put up homes on former forested areas , developers are practised at getting around such regulations . 
 One reason is that Greece , unlike other European states , lacks a comprehensive register of forests and land ownership . A programme to put this right , paid for by the European Union , is moving slowly . It is easy to have burned forest land reclassified as former farmland , which can then be sold for development . Local officials are often open to bribery , while politicians are prone to declaring amnesties for illegal buildings ahead of an election . 
 Such problems plague other fire - prone parts of Europe . In Italy , where at least seven people died in fires this summer , an environmental group , Legambiente , estimates that 60 % of fires are deliberately set . Some are the work of pyromaniacs . Others are started by farmers trying to clear land , or by part - time forestry workers creating employment for themselves . 
 There are also good reasons to suspect economic motives linked to Mafia - style organised crime . In 2000 the government passed a law banning construction for 15 years on property where there had been a blaze . However , such legislation has to be adopted at local level . In Sicily , not a single council has incorporated the law . In Campania , stronghold of the Camorra syndicate , a firefighting helicopter was shot at on August 6th . 
 In Spain , though , a recent study by Greenpeace , an environmental lobby group , suggested that deliberate arsonists were only a minority . Looking at thousands of fires whose causes fire were known ( about half the blazes in the past decade ) , the study suggested that the worst culprits were farmers starting fires to burn stubble , clear land or remove rubbish .

Iraq's prime minister, Nuri al-Maliki, said that the American embassy in Baghdad should stop using Blackwater, an American security firm, whose employees had apparently killed 11 civilians after mortar rounds landed near an embassy convoy being escorted through the city. Some Iraqis complained about the immunity enjoyed by the 25,000-plus private security contractors working in Iraq.
An anti-Syrian Lebanese member of parliament, Antoine Ghanem, was blown up by a car-bomb in Beirut a week before parliament was due to elect a new president.

THE Greek prime minister must be wondering if he was right to call a general election on September 16th, six months early. Admittedly, Costas Karamanlis's centre-right New Democracy (ND) party finished well ahead of the main opposition party, the Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok). But under a new proportional system, its four-point lead over Pasok gave it only a four-seat parliamentary majority, down from 30 in 2004.
The opposition is likely to be a lot more vociferous than it was during Mr Karamanlis's first term. Greece's unreconstructed Communists and their gentler cousins, the Radical Left Coalition, benefited strongly from a protest vote, especially among the young, over the botched handling of recent forest fires. The two parties doubled their total seats, to 36 between them. Not only will parliamentary debate be livelier. Left-wing party bosses can call thousands of demonstrators on to the streets at a moment's notice.
Mr Karamanlis is also committed to two controversial reforms: an overhaul of the creaking pay-as-you-go pension system, and another try at breaking the state's constitutional monopoly over university education. These reforms will test the loyalty of his deputies. But party officials brush off worries that history could repeat itself: in 1993, a handful of dissidents brought down a modernising ND government in a row over privatisation.
Mr Karamanlis could in a pinch seek support from Popular Orthodox Rally (Laos), a far-right party led by George Karatzaferis, a former ND deputy and member of the European Parliament. Laos will enter the Greek parliament for the first time, with ten seats. Its deputies could come in useful if ND needs help. However, Mr Karatzaferis, who denied accusations of anti-Semitism during the campaign but stuck to an anti-immigrant ""Greece for the Greeks"" platform, could prove an embarrassing ally.
The government has a seasoned ministerial team under George Alogoskoufis, the finance minister. Mr Alogoskoufis will handle talks with the trade unions on raising the retirement age, unifying 150-odd state pension funds and finding professional managers to look after their euro33 billion ($42 billion) of assets. But a simmering scandal over sales of complex structured bonds at inflated prices to pension-fund managers appointed by ND threatens to make reform much harder.
Euripides Stylianides, the ambitious new education minister, also has a tough task ahead. A junior foreign minister in the previous government, he was promoted after several cabinet veterans had turned down the job. Although plenty of new Greek shipping billionaires would like to endow non-profit private universities, most professors and students used to the state-controlled system strongly oppose change. Three months of street protests last spring forced the government to withdraw a constitutional amendment that would have permitted private universities.
A leadership struggle in Pasok could at least give Mr Karamanlis a few months' breathing-space. George Papandreou is the mild-mannered party boss (and also the son of Pasok's founder, Andreas Papandreou, just as, to confirm Greece's dynastic tendencies, Mr Karamanlis is the nephew of ND's founder, Constantine Karamanlis). After leading his party to its worst electoral defeat in 30 years, he is fighting to keep his job. His chief challenger is Evangelos Venizelos, a crafty constitutional expert and former culture minister, who has already secured the support of Socialist heavyweights who steered Greece into the euro in 2001. He may become the man to overturn the Papandreou dynasty.
On the campaign trail Mr Karamanlis promised to reduce poverty and to create more jobs. In spite of an economy that has grown by around 4% a year for a decade, one in five Greeks still live in poverty, as defined by European Union standards. The youth unemployment rate of 25% is among the highest in the EU. The public debt is over 80% of GDP. These are the economic failings that need to be dealt with if Mr Karamanlis is to win popular backing for his other reforms.

A LAWYER by training, Costas Karamanlis brushes off allegations of corruption within his government by saying that he trusts the Greek judicial system. Yet a string of bribery scandals has undermined the prime minister's approval ratings. Even some deputies in Mr Karamanlis's centre-right New Democracy party are grumbling. They point out that the judiciary moves at a snail's pace, lacks expertise in 21st-century financial crime and is influenced by politicians. None of the dozens of suspects under investigation for corruption has yet appeared in court. 
At least one scandal has seriously embarrassed Mr Karamanlis. Christos Zachopoulos, a senior cultural official who once ran the prime minister's constituency office, attempted suicide last December amid allegations of blackmail by his secretary. Mr Zachopoulos has been accused by prosecutors of turning a blind eye to dozens of illegal deals allowing protected sites to be developed. 
The sacking in July of George Zorbas, boss of Greece's anti-money-laundering unit, set more tongues wagging. Mr Zorbas complained that the judiciary had not backed his probe into a scandal about government bonds worth over EUR 300m ($425m) that were bought by state pension funds at inflated prices. He could not look into offshore bank accounts used to channel proceeds from the scam. Mr Zorbas's preliminary report, which is said to implicate several politicians, went to prosecutors, but he fears it will be shelved. 
With an election still three years away, Mr Karamanlis's laid-back attitude to such scandals might work. He has already shown himself to be a principled leader by sacking two cabinet ministers for minor breaches of the law. It helps that the opposition Socialists (Pasok) are in total disarray. George Papandreou, their pro-European leader, faces constant sniping from a discontented nationalist faction within the party. He lags well behind Mr Karamanlis in opinion polls. 
Yet Mr Karamanlis may not be able to ignore Greek involvement in a bribery scandal at Siemens. Reinhard Siekaczec, a former executive at the German electronics giant, which supplies equipment to Greece's state telecoms operator, gave damaging testimony at a trial in Munich earlier this year. He said that ""commissions"" worth 8% of the contract's value were paid to Greek politicians and senior executives through a network of offshore companies. The total amount exceeded EUR 1 billion, he claimed. Most of it apparently went to officials from Pasok, which held power from 1993 to 2004, but the New Democracy government elected that year approved a contract worth over EUR 40m for security equipment for the Athens Olympics. 
Nikos Zagorianos, a prosecutor investigating the Siemens affair, is shortly to go to Germany. One former Pasok official, Theodoros Tsoukatos, has admitted that he accepted EUR 400,000 from the local Siemens boss as an election contribution in 1999, when he was a prime ministerial aide responsible for collecting political donations. Amid the furore, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, a New Democracy deputy who is the son of a former prime minister, recently paid an overlooked bill for a switchboard that was supplied to his private office by Siemens, after a copy of the invoice was printed in a Greek newspaper.
Cash-strapped voters are growing more critical of corruption in high places. After a decade of strong growth, the economy is slowing, though GDP is still expected to increase this year by 3.5%. Rising interest rates are putting pressure on incomes. Inflation is close to 5%. New taxes loom as Mr Karamanlis's government struggles to keep the budget deficit under control.
Mr Karamanlis's two-seat majority in parliament is too slim to allow for any mistakes. Several New Democracy backbenchers have come back from their holidays in rebellious mood. Sacrificing a few senior political leaders in the name of transparency might make more sense than having to fight an early election.

GREECE prides itself on the robustness of its democracy. Despite frustration over the number of traffic-choking demonstrations outside parliament (the average is said to be two a week), most politicians like to stress that modern Greeks' enthusiasm for protest shows an admirable continuity with the golden age of Periclean Athens. The trouble is that protests so easily turn violent. Sometimes a group of hooded young men, who style themselves ""anarchists"", bring up the rear of a march. They carry metal bars and petrol bombs. Ritual clashes with riot police ensue, shop windows are smashed and tear-gas fills Syntagma Square for a few hours. 
This week's violence was on an unprecedented scale. It erupted after Alexandros Grigoropoulos, a 15-year-old schoolboy, was shot dead by a policeman in Exarchia, a scruffy central district of Athens known as the anarchists' home base, on the night of December 6th. Shouting insults at police in their patrol cars is a weekend sport for some Athenian youths. The police are meant to stay cool: the last time a policeman killed a teenager was in 1985. 
This time protests over the shooting quickly spilled into the main streets of Athens, and thence across the country. Roving groups of anarchists torched cars, broke shop windows decorated for Christmas and tossed in petrol bombs. Beyond the capital, demonstrators attacked police stations and public offices in a dozen cities.
The pent-up anger of Greece's youth, matched by the anarchists' taste for mayhem, triggered five nights of riots, causing damage estimated at more than EUR 100m ($130m). Hundreds of school students battled with police after the teenager's funeral in a plush seaside suburb. Others threw stones at policemen on guard outside parliament, shouting ""let parliament burn"".
Appeals for calm by Costas Karamanlis, the centre-right prime minister, were mostly ignored. Fearful of provoking even broader dissent, he refused to take such tough measures as imposing a curfew or ordering blanket arrests, on the ground that they might smack of the military dictatorship in the 1970s. Talks among political leaders in pursuit of a consensus on how to quell the unrest swiftly broke down. On December 10th a long-planned 24-hour strike by public-sector unions went ahead despite Mr Karamanlis's televised call for it to be cancelled. George Papandreou, the opposition Pasok leader, urged the prime minister to resign and call a general election. ""Effectively there is no government...we claim power,"" he said. 
Mr Karamanlis was already vulnerable. His New Democracy party controls only 151 of the 300 seats in parliament and trails Pasok by four or five points in the opinion polls. For all his party's weakness, the prime minister's personal approval rating has so far stayed well ahead of Mr Papandreou's. But with his image as a safe pair of hands in tatters, that may now change. Small family-owned businesses and retailers, the backbone of support for New Democracy, are furious at the failure of the police to protect their property. 
The government is also facing mounting criticism over a string of financial scandals. Even as protesters rampaged, a parliamentary committee was taking evidence in a scandal over an illegal government land swap carried out with Vatopedi monastery on Mount Athos. Senior ministers are said to have diddled taxpayers out of some EUR 100m while handsomely lining their own pockets. Two have resigned already: George Voulgarakis, the merchant-marine minister, whose wife acted as a notary for the deal, and Theodoros Roussopoulos, the government's spokesman. 
Yet New Democracy could still stagger on. Mr Papandreou's Pasok is split between European Social Democrats and populist nationalists. The latter currently have the upper hand. It would take only two New Democracy defections to bring down the government, but opinion polls suggest that Pasok would be unlikely to win an election outright. And even its supporters are doubtful that a coalition with Syriza, a left-wing party led by Alexis Tsipras, a 34-year-old who has never run for parliament, would work. 
Mr Karamanlis has cruised through two elections and four-and-a-half years in power on the strength of Greece's economic growth, averaging over 4% a year up to 2007. Yet this reflected reforms by Costas Simitis, his Pasok predecessor, to get Greece into the euro. Greek shipowners made record profits from China's export boom; Russian oligarchs bought expensive land on Aegean Islands. 
The feel-good factor allowed the conservatives to ignore the pressing case for social reform, particularly in education, health and policing. But as the global slowdown takes effect, young Greeks see their parents struggling to pay the bills. If they cannot afford to study abroad, they get lousy tuition at a Greek university and, unless their family can pull strings, few chances of a good job. The unemployment rate for young graduates is 21%, compared with 8% for the population as a whole.
Inadequate policing has allowed anarchists to flourish in Exarchia, which has become a haven for drug-dealers and racketeers. The anarchists have also exploited a constitutional loophole that bans police from university campuses. As a result, demonstrators can regroup behind barricades at the Athens Polytechnic and pick up fresh supplies of petrol bombs before heading back onto the streets. 
Mr Karamanlis's attempt to scrap this ""university asylum"" two years ago failed because he could not win enough cross-party support to change the constitution. Another set of university reforms collapsed when a majority of professors refused to make any commitment to higher teaching standards and submit themselves to peer review. The street violence may fade but Greece's frustrated students are unlikely to stop protesting for long.","Youth riots across Greece demonstrate why the country needs to change

CAFES and bars in Athens are filling up as spring beckons and the memory of December's nasty riots fades. As the tourist season gets under way officials play down fears of renewed unrest. The message is that Greece was hit merely by a bout of hooliganism similar to post-match clashes between fans of the capital's rival football teams. Yet Athenians are sceptical, not least because the violence, though diminished, shows no sign of dying out.
Jittery Greek police officers blame self-styled anarchists, who played a big role in the December riots, for a spate of petrol-bombings of expensive cars, bank machines and government offices. A leftist terrorist group, Revolutionary Struggle, claimed responsibility for shooting a policeman in January. In early April two policemen from a rapid-reaction force formed after the riots were shot dead at close range during a late-night identity check, perhaps by east European gangsters. 
Fears of public disorder add to existing worries over jobs and mortgages. Yannis Papathanasiou, the newish finance minister, claims optimistically that Greece can escape recession. But as forecasts keep being revised downwards, his mantra of growth above 1% in 2009 sounds less and less convincing. This week the central bank suggested that Greece may join the rest of Europe in recession. The unemployment rate has just hit 9.4%. 
Tourism, which employs one in five Greeks, is suffering, partly because of a strong euro. The number of foreign holidaymakers on Greek beaches this summer may fall by 15-20%, say hoteliers. The British are heading for Turkey, where a weak pound is partly offset by a falling lira. Bookings by Russians, the fastest-growing market last year, are sharply down. ""If there's a surge in late bookings, there's a slim possibility we can break even,"" says Nikiforos Lambrinos, a hotelier on Crete, glumly.
After 15 unbroken years of growth at around 4% a year, Greeks are not used to belt-tightening. But Mr Papathanasiou cannot offer even a modest fiscal stimulus. The cost of financing a public debt standing at 94% of GDP has risen since Greece's credit rating, like Spain's and Portugal's, was downgraded in January. The budget deficit is already over the theoretical ceiling of 3% of GDP for euro-area countries. 
A record of fudging budget numbers gives Greece little credibility in Brussels. The European Commission has demanded more reforms to keep the deficit below 3% in 2010. Mr Papathanasiou has already announced unpopular measures, including a wage freeze for civil servants and a one-off tax for high earners. More spending cuts are on the way. But structural reforms such as modernising the health-care and pension systems remain stuck.
The gloomy atmosphere is taking its toll on Costas Karamanlis, the prime minister, and his conservative New Democracy party. Last month Mr Karamanlis marked his fifth anniversary in the job by telling a journalist he felt ""exhausted"" and might step down if New Democracy loses the election that may come next year or even sooner. With only a one-seat majority in parliament, the party trails the opposition Socialists by over seven points, say polls. 
Corruption scandals still beset the government. This week a former director of Greece's competition watchdog was convicted of bribe-seeking. A former minister, Aristotle Pavlidis, is accused of involvement in a bribery scandal over subsidised ferry routes. Mr Pavlidis, who insists he is innocent, has resisted pressure to resign from parliament. Disgruntled conservatives fear that, as Mr Karamanlis and his government focus on anarchists and fiscal discipline, their grip on power is slipping.","A bad economy and scandals are sapping the government 's popularity

PUNDITS in Athens were not all that surprised when Costas Karamanlis, the Greek prime minister, announced that he would call a snap election next month, halfway through his four-year term. The opposition Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) led by George Papandreou is ahead by six points in the polls, so Mr Karamanlis seems set for a spell in opposition. His announcement, on September 2nd, duly infuriated some in his centre-right New Democracy party. ""What am I to tell my voters? That we're just surrendering power?"" spluttered one backbencher.
But with a bare two-seat majority in parliament, the conservatives have been clinging to power in undignified fashion. After five-and-a-half years in office, Mr Karamanlis looks tired. A string of corruption scandals (one, over the sale of church property, involved his closest aide) have undermined his authority.
Recession looms, with the economy projected to shrink this year. Tourist receipts are forecast to fall by 15-20%. Germans have stayed at home; Britons have headed for cheaper Turkey or Croatia.

Unrest simmers close to the surface. Last December's riots in Athens led to the emergence of new extreme-left groups. This week a car bomb damaged the Athens stock exchange. In Thessaloniki, another bomb went off outside the ministry for northern Greece. The recent forest fires have reinforced a sense of drift; local mayors were quick to blame the government for not reacting faster. 
Yet, despite popular dissatisfaction with New Democracy, the polls suggest that Pasok may not win an outright majority in the 300-seat parliament. Mr Papandreou, a former foreign minister who reached out to Turkey, is mistrusted by his party's old-fashioned nationalists. Younger voters may prefer the Greens (who won a seat in the European election in June) or Syriza, a left-wing splinter group run by Alexis Tsipras, a fast-talking, 30-something biker. 
The government that takes over after the election, which will probably be on October 4th, may be short-lived. Parliament is due to vote for a new president next March, and Pasok is unlikely to command the three-fifths majority required. If no president is chosen, another general election would be necessary. Greece may be in for a period of both economic gloom and political instability.

ON THE campaign trail George Papandreou, Greece's new prime minister, said he wanted to make his country more transparent, efficient and meritocratic, but added that a ""small revolution"" would be needed. After winning the election on October 4th by an unexpectedly wide margin, he has a chance to bring one about. His party, Pasok, took 44% of the vote, enough to win 160 of the 300 parliamentary seats. Fears that disaffected young Greeks would back smaller leftist parties proved unfounded. Syriza, a splinter group, won 4.6% (13 seats); the Communist Party won 7.5% (21 seats), slightly down from 2004. 
Costas Karamanlis's New Democracy (ND) party, in power for the past five years, took 33.5% and 91 seats, its worst-ever showing at the polls. Frightened by recession and fed up with financial scandals, ND supporters deserted in droves. Some even switched to Laos, a far-right party that increased its vote to 5.6% (15 seats). Mr Karamanlis promptly stood down as ND leader, opening the way for a succession battle in which Dora Bakoyannis, the outgoing foreign minister, appears best-prepared.
Mr Papandreou has decided for now to be his own foreign minister, a job he held in a previous Pasok government. A native English-speaker (he was born in America), he is skilled at international networking. Having masterminded a Greek-Turkish rapprochement a decade ago, Mr Papandreou wants to persuade the Greek- and Turkish-Cypriots to agree this year on a plan to reunify Cyprus. He would also like to revive Turkey's flagging hopes of joining the European Union. 
A restructured cabinet will have five women ministers, including Greece's first environment minister. Names for regrouped ministries include buzzwords rarely heard under Mr Karamanlis: ""climate change"", ""competitiveness"", ""electronic government."" The finance ministry has been split in two. Louka Katseli, an American-trained economist, will look after investment and disbursing EU grants. George Papaconstantinou, a British-educated economist and technology expert, has the task of overseeing the budget.
The most urgent job is to prevent a prolonged recession. Fewer tourists visited this summer and shipping income is down because of a fall in trade. Shops are shutting in smart parts of Athens. Unemployment is near double digits. The budget deficit is soaring, thanks to collapsing tax revenues and a pre-election spending binge. Greece will borrow over EUR 60 billion ($90 billion) this year. The public debt could reach 105% of GDP, second only to Italy's among euro countries. Yet Mr Papandreou proposes a EUR 3 billion package for small businesses, to be paid for by collecting as much as EUR 10 billion in unpaid taxes. He also promises real rises in wages and pensions to encourage Greeks to spend again. But if the deficit exceeds 10% Mr Papaconstantinou may face difficulty selling this to his European colleagues.
During his campaign Mr Papandreou spoke enthusiastically of improving Greece's competitiveness by getting small Greek companies to use information technology more effectively. He talked of exporting renewable energy, harvested on sunny mountainsides and windy Aegean Islands, and persuading Greek software developers abroad to set up companies at home. Few Greeks doubt the sincerity of Mr Papandreou's drive for ""green"" growth; many fear his plans will be undermined by bureaucratic inertia and corruption. ""If you're foreign minister, you're not exposed to the reality of the Greek system,"" says a former cabinet minister.
Mr Papandreou's father and grandfather, both prime ministers, were poor economic managers. His father Andreas founded Pasok as a tax-and-spend Socialist party. His grandfather George led a short-lived centrist government that overspent in the 1960s.

CONFRONTING the vociferous farm lobby is a critical test for every Greek prime minister. A year ago thousands of farmers blockaded main roads across the country, intimidating Costas Karamanlis's conservative government into coughing up a EUR 500m ($705m) package of support. A year later they are up to the same trick, asking George Papandreou's socialist government to find EUR 1 billion for further crop subsidies, along with cheaper fuel and a three-year freeze on debt repayments. By January 20th more than 2,000 agricultural vehicles were blocking roads around Greece. 
But the cash-strapped government is hardly in a position to make any concessions to special interests. On January 14th it unveiled an ambitious plan to cut its budget deficit from 12.7% to 8.7% of GDP this year, and to below the 3% ceiling for euro-area members by 2012. Reaction to the plan in Brussels was lukewarm; in response, George Papaconstantinou, the finance minister, promised to take further tough measures later this year if targets were missed. 
Economists have queried the plan's growth forecasts of 1.5% next year and 1.9% for 2012. Unable to afford a stimulus package, Greece seems more likely to stay in recession--the economy shrank by 1.2% in 2009--than to stage a rebound. That in turn would make it less likely that revenue-raising targets would be hit. 
Credit-rating agencies also seem unconvinced by the Greek plan, reiterating their ""negative outlook"" for Greece, a veiled threat of further downgrades to the country within two or three months. Worse, financial markets reacted badly. Spreads on ten-year government bonds over German Bunds--a measure of the perceived risk that Greece may default on debt repayments--edged upwards. Prices of credit-default swaps, a form of insurance against default, hit record levels on January 20th.
Greece must borrow EUR 55 billion this year to finance a public debt swollen by years of budget overruns. Many fear that the country will struggle to manage this. About EUR 25 billion of existing debt must be rolled over in April and May. Normally Greece's debt-management agency would already be raising extra funds to ensure that all goes smoothly in the spring. But the agency has not yet announced a fund-raising programme for this year. Since November it has resorted to issuing short-term treasury bills with maturities of up to one year, which are seen as less risky than five- or ten-year bonds. But it is having to pay a sizeable premium even on these. 
To avoid calamity, the finance ministry will try to make private placements of debt with international banks. Yet some traders in Athens fear that a crunch cannot be avoided. And if Greece falters, it could drag other struggling euro-area members like Ireland down too, even if their fiscal efforts have been braver.","A Greek deficit-reduction plan is greeted sceptically

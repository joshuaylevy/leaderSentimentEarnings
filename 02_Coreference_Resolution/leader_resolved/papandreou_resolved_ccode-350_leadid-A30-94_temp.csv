WHEN George Papandreou, the Greek opposition leader and president of the Socialist International--a global association of centre-left parties--convened the latest of his summer talkfests on the shores of the Aegean, the mood was upbeat. Veterans of the annual gathering said it was the cheeriest they could recall. 
But the reasons for the optimism blowing in the pine-scented air were mainly local: after struggling for several years to rally discontent with Greece's ruling conservatives, Mr Papandreou is now doing well in the opinion polls. He has a good chance, some time over the next year, of becoming prime minister, following in the trail of his liberal grandfather and firebrand father.
Segolene Royal, the French vice-president of the Socialist International (SI), also came to the Aegean with a success story of sorts, but it too was on a small scale. In the region of Poitou-Charentes, which she runs, the problem of voter apathy is being solved, she insisted, with newfangled experiments in grassroots democracy: for example, ""citizens' juries"" chosen by lot to monitor the work of local officials.
If the talk turned to town-hall matters, that was partly because, nationally, this is a bad moment for Ms Royal, whose party is in chaos. The picture is hardly more cheerful for much of Europe's moderate left, whether in power or in opposition. With the exception of Greece, the European elections in June were a disaster for social democratic parties. From France to Austria, centre-leftists failed to harness dislike of conservative incumbents. There was a swing against ruling socialists from Bulgaria (where they were ousted from national power in July) to Britain (whose prime minister, Gordon Brown, looks irredeemably unpopular). In Spain supporters of the ruling socialists tried hard to convince people that they were as upset as anybody about unemployment of nearly 20%, but voters still nudged to the right. 
Elsewhere in the world, the picture is more mixed. But in almost every democracy, politicians who style themselves progressive face a common set of problems, to do with shrinking treasuries, looming environmental challenges, general pessimism and the resurgence of nationalism.
There is a paradox here. In many ways, the centre-left should be making hay. Whatever problems he may face at home, Barack Obama has emboldened critics of the status quo--and made life harder for purist conservatives--across the world. Mr Obama has given heart to those who argue that democracy (as opposed to street protests or violence) can produce real change; and helped those on the left who still say that America, for all its recent flaws, can be a guarantor of democracy and freedom. 
Meanwhile the banking crisis and the global downturn have been seized on by the Cassandras (many of them worthy centre-leftists) who said, even at the height of the boom, that global capitalism might become an uncontrollable monster.
But many voters seem unconvinced by the efforts of the centre-left to cash in with told-you-so talk. In some cases, that is because the right has stolen their clothes by launching economic rescue packages, and joining the denunciation of wild ""Anglo-Saxon"" capitalism. France's conservative president, Nicolas Sarkozy, for one, has borrowed personnel as well as rhetoric and ideas from the left.
In several countries the centre-right has held together with a judicious mixture of talk about tough border controls and promises of economic regeneration. ""They sound just a little bit harder on immigration and voters get the hint,"" says Charles Grant of the Centre for European Reform, a think-tank. The centre-left, by contrast, has haemorrhaged votes, as malcontents drift to various extremes, or into apathy. 
A Marxist moment
Indeed, if any group has been making told-you-so arguments with success, it is the radical foes of the system, including Marxists, who denounce their more cautious comrades for being complicit in the capitalist order. In Germany, for example, the far-left vote held up better than that of parties nearer the middle--though some thought it would do better still.
Admittedly, some of the travails of the European centre-left reflect problems that are peculiar to the old continent. Under parties of any stripe, Europe's relative weight in the world economy would be doomed to decline--along with its ability to fund welfare programmes whose roots go back to post-1945 reconstruction and the ideological contests of the cold war.
Australia's Kevin Rudd, whose Labor Party scored a landslide victory in 2007, is holding up in the opinion polls, despite the difficulty of keeping promises and transforming the country's environmental posture in a deep recession. But Mr Rudd has advantages that his European counterparts lack: the cushion provided by a decade-long boom, and by signs that China--which buys Australia's commodities--is rapidly emerging from the downturn. He is promising a return to fiscal caution once his stimulus has helped the economy.
In Latin America, meanwhile, the centre-left is riding out the recession with comparative success. Take Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, whose working-class origins and pragmatic policies are still a winning mixture. He has managed to convince his compatriots that the recession was thrust upon the region from outside: it is, as he puts it, the fault of ""blonde, blue-eyed"" bankers from the north.
And in Latin America the centre-left has reaped some benefit from stimulus packages designed to protect jobs. In Chile--homeland of the Socialist International's secretary-general, Luis Ayala--such measures have boosted the popularity of the ruling coalition, three of whose constituents are members of the SI. The centre-left is now tipped to win a forthcoming presidential election, mainly because voters feel the need to protect the poor. For similar reasons, Uruguay's ruling left-of-centre coalition looks set to retain power in an electoral contest this autumn. And in Mexico's recent legislative election, it was the Institutional Revolutionary Party, a lumbering titan of the centre-left, that gained at the expense of the ruling conservatives, not parties of a more radical stripe.
At the same time, Latin America's far left seems a less attractive option for people hard hit by recession. More than in Western Europe, voters there have experience of far-leftist experiments--and their results. Administrations of a deep-red hue are now in power in a few countries, and their economies are in some ways doing worse than those of their neighbours. The red-hot ""21st-century socialism"" of Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez has been obliged to cool down by sagging world energy prices. In Argentina's mid-term election, in June, the populist government of President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner lost its parliamentary majority.
True, there is one country where a centre-leftist leader is struggling under the impact of the recession, and under threat from radicals--Peru. But even there, ultra-leftism is not in the ascendant: the main radical contender for the 2011 election, Ollanta Humala, has tried to portray himself as a moderate and stressed his differences with the fiery Mr Chavez. Is green the new colour?
Both in the commodity-rich economies of the South, and in the tired old industrial societies of the North, a common dilemma--and perhaps, opportunity--for moderate leftists is posed by the environment.
Especially in Europe, centre-leftist politics and concern for the planet have almost blended into a single, warm and sometimes fuzzy discourse. Mr Papandreou, for one, expects a full merger. He wants to add environmentalism to the SI's core ideals of democracy and social justice. At home, he has taken risks in defence of that idea, by recruiting to his party a young independent green, Kriton Arsenis, whose campaign against construction on Aegean islands had threatened vested interests, including pro-Socialist ones.
But elsewhere, the terms of a political marriage between social democracy and greenery look uncertain. Many eyes are on Germany, where the Social Democratic Party (SPD)--now sharing power with the centre-right--did appallingly in the Euro-elections, with a record low of 21%, even as the Green vote held steady at 12%.
What does this portend for Germany's general election on September 27th? On the face of things, the only possibility of a left-of-centre government lies in a new ""red-green"" coalition, like the one that held power from 1998 to 2005, but with the greens dictating more of the terms.
A Green legislator, Kerstin Andreae, says the SPD is paying the price for internal strife and a lack of convincing leadership. The centre-left is still seen as the tree-huggers' natural partner. Recent German polls have sent a different message, however: that some voters like the idea of a more improbable alliance of greens and centre-rightists, a so-called black-green alliance of the kind that now has power in Hamburg.
Could it happen nationally? Ms Andreae notes that there are big gaps between her party and Germany's Christian Democrats (over nuclear power, say)--but she concedes that they have moved nearer the centre and ""we have hopes for them."" The only thing her party has ruled out is a ""Jamaica"" (green-black-yellow) deal with Christian Democrats and the liberal Free Democrats, in which the Greens would represent a lone non-establishment voice.
If Europe's premier green party made a deal with the centre-right, that might leave the centre-left feeling lonelier than ever. But recent events in Ireland (where centre-rightists and environmentalists have been sharing power) contain some sobering lessons for anybody contemplating such a bargain. In the European elections, both parts of the ruling coalition were soundly thrashed by recession-weary voters, especially the Greens.
Still, even in Ireland, centre-leftists would be wrong to see the environmentalists as tame fellow-travellers, easy to co-opt because they have nowhere else to go. Whichever partners they choose, green-minded people will have their own ideas.
Take Nessa Childers, an Irish Labour Euro-MP who was formerly a local Green politician. She, at least, is not about to convert to dogmatic leftism. ""The old left-right divide has ceased to reflect the choices people have in their lives,"" she says. Instead, she hopes her new colleagues will wrestle harder with the meaning of ""sustainable policies--for the fabric of society as well as for the planet."" Another good topic for a summer symposium.

PUNDITS in Athens were not all that surprised when Costas Karamanlis, the Greek prime minister, announced that he would call a snap election next month, halfway through his four-year term. The opposition Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) led by George Papandreou is ahead by six points in the polls, so Mr Karamanlis seems set for a spell in opposition. His announcement, on September 2nd, duly infuriated some in his centre-right New Democracy party. ""What am I to tell my voters? That we're just surrendering power?"" spluttered one backbencher.
But with a bare two-seat majority in parliament, the conservatives have been clinging to power in undignified fashion. After five-and-a-half years in office, Mr Karamanlis looks tired. A string of corruption scandals (one, over the sale of church property, involved his closest aide) have undermined his authority.
Recession looms, with the economy projected to shrink this year. Tourist receipts are forecast to fall by 15-20%. Germans have stayed at home; Britons have headed for cheaper Turkey or Croatia. The global downturn is cutting Greek shipping earnings. The budget deficit may hit 6-7% of GDP this year. 
Unrest simmers close to the surface. Last December's riots in Athens led to the emergence of new extreme-left groups. This week a car bomb damaged the Athens stock exchange. In Thessaloniki, another bomb went off outside the ministry for northern Greece. The recent forest fires have reinforced a sense of drift; local mayors were quick to blame the government for not reacting faster. 
Yet, despite popular dissatisfaction with New Democracy, the polls suggest that Pasok may not win an outright majority in the 300-seat parliament. Mr Papandreou, a former foreign minister who reached out to Turkey, is mistrusted by his party's old-fashioned nationalists. Younger voters may prefer the Greens (who won a seat in the European election in June) or Syriza, a left-wing splinter group run by Alexis Tsipras, a fast-talking, 30-something biker. 
The government that takes over after the election, which will probably be on October 4th, may be short-lived. Parliament is due to vote for a new president next March, and Pasok is unlikely to command the three-fifths majority required. If no president is chosen, another general election would be necessary. Greece may be in for a period of both economic gloom and political instability.

The debate in America about the war in Afghanistan became increasingly politicised. Robert Gates, America's defence secretary, said that the army should submit its advice in private after General Stanley McChrystal, America's commander in Afghanistan, gave a speech in which he said a proposal to scale back America's troop commitments was ""short-sighted"". Barack Obama is reviewing policy. 
In Britain, meanwhile, a row broke out when General Sir Richard Dannatt, a former army chief who has said troop levels in Afghanistan are inadequate, became an adviser to the Conservatives. Some in the Labour government accused him of breaching a ""sacred trust"" that the armed forces should remain impartial. 
The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office produced its assessment of the Senate Finance Committee's health-care bill. It found the legislation would extend insurance coverage to 29m people at a cost of $829 billion over ten years, but, crucially, would not add to the budget deficit. 
Kofi-flavoured reforms
Kofi Annan, a former UN secretary-general, went to Kenya to urge the coalition government to ""accelerate"" its reform programme, agreed on with Mr Annan when he brokered a deal between the government and opposition after the post-election violence in early 2008. Electoral, judicial, constitutional and land reforms have all stalled, and there are fears that the chaos at the last poll will be repeated at the next election, due in 2012.
There were clashes between the Israeli police and Palestinians around the religious site known as Haram al-Sharif to Muslims and Temple Mount to Jews in Jerusalem. The Palestinian Authority (PA) accused the Israelis of trying to ""take over Jerusalem and Judaise it""; the Israelis briefly arrested the head of Israel's Islamic movement for inciting violence.
Palestinians were vehement in their criticism of Mahmoud Abbas, who presides over the PA, for a decision to postpone an endorsement of the UN Goldstone report, which is highly critical of Israel's attack on Gaza this year. To assuage his critics, Mr Abbas ordered an internal inquiry into why the PA did not endorse the report, and backed a Libyan attempt to discuss the document at the Security Council.

IT IS no secret that negotiations on Turkish membership of the European Union are going slowly. Only one of the 35 ""chapters"", on research, has been completed. Five are blocked by a French veto on anything implying Turkey's eventual accession. Eight have been frozen since December 2006 to punish the Turks for not opening their ports and airports to Cyprus (ie, the Greek-Cypriot republic). On December 8th the EU agreed to open just one new chapter, on the environment.
This week's annual stocktake on progress with Turkey was gloomy. Public opinion is shifting, too: Turkish support for EU accession fell from 70% in 2004 to 42% in 2008. The new president of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, once said Turkey would never be part of Europe, a sentiment shared by the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy. Yet Western diplomats tell the Turks that time is on their side, and that presidents come and go.
There is, however, a more urgent problem: Cyprus, divided since the Greek-backed coup and Turkish invasion of 1974. Turkey cannot join the EU without a deal on Cyprus because the Greek-Cypriot republic, an EU member since 2004, has a veto. This week the Cypriot government showed its teeth by promising to block the opening of five new chapters in the Turkish negotiations next year. A Cyprus settlement is thus essential if Turkey is to have any hope of progress towards the EU.
It matters for other reasons, too. Cyprus is a main cause of today's scratchy relations between the EU (of which Cyprus is a member, but not Turkey) and NATO (of which Turkey is a member, but not Cyprus). If the Cyprus problem were solved, the way should be clear for closer co-operation between the two organisations, which often seem to occupy different planets even though both are based in Brussels.
It would be brave to express any optimism about a Cyprus deal. David Hannay, a British former special envoy to Cyprus, notes in a recent paper for the Centre for European Reform that ""no one has yet lost money betting against...a comprehensive settlement."" Even so, this ought to be a propitious moment since, for the first time, the leaders of both sides want a deal.
For 30 years after 1974, the Turkish-Cypriots were led by the obstinate Rauf Denktash, who preferred partition to the ""bizonal, bicommunal"" federation that both sides agreed to aim for in the late 1970s. By the time he was sidelined, the Greek-Cypriot presidency had gone to the hardline Tassos Papadopoulos. Mr Papadopoulos pushed for a Greek-Cypriot rejection of the UN's Annan plan for unification in April 2004 (see box on next page). Cyprus joined the EU a week after the Greek-Cypriots said no (with the union's acquis communautaire suspended for the Turkish-Cypriot north).
From its new vantage-point the Cypriot government vetoed an EU promise to reward the Turkish-Cypriots for voting yes by ending their trade and travel isolation. It was in response to this that Turkey refused to open its ports and airports to the Greek-Cypriots, even though this became a legal obligation as soon as Cyprus joined the EU. Many diplomats muttered (as they still do today) that it was a mistake to guarantee the Greek-Cypriots EU membership without a settlement. The worry had been that Greece might veto new EU members from eastern Europe if Cyprus were left out. But it was also assumed, wrongly, that the main obstacles to a deal were Mr Denktash and the Turkish-Cypriots.
In February 2008 things improved when Demetris Christofias ousted Mr Papadopoulos as president. Mr Christofias comes from the Akel (communist) party. Not only is he pro-settlement, but he is also an old trade-union friend of Mehmet Ali Talat, the Turkish-Cypriot leader. Mr Christofias says he ran for president with the specific aim of solving the Cyprus problem. The coincidence of the two presidents opens what William Chislett, an analyst at Spain's Royal Elcano Institute, calls ""a unique window of opportunity to lay the Cyprus problem to rest once and for all, but it will not remain open for ever."" A communist to the rescue
Mr Christofias and Mr Talat duly set about new formal talks in September 2008. They opened an extra crossing-point over the ""green line"" on Ledra Street, Nicosia's main shopping street. The UN wearily agreed to join in again and Alexander Downer, a former Australian foreign minister, was made special envoy. 
Yet no sooner had the talks started than they began to drag. Mr Christofias was determined not to revert to the Annan plan, whereas Mr Talat wanted it to be the basis of discussion. Under each of the six headings for the talks--economics, the EU, governance, territory, security and property--the positions staked out by the two men's chief negotiators (George Iacovou for Mr Christofias and Ozdil Nami for Mr Talat) seemed far apart.
Even so, some progress has been made, partly because the number of meetings between Mr Christofias and Mr Talat has risen to two a week (it may rise to three in January). Economics and the EU are largely resolved. After months of argument about the roles and voting arrangements for a rotating (Greek-Cypriot) president and (Turkish-Cypriot) vice-president, the differences over governance also look bridgeable.
The territorial split between the two communities will be harder. Yet in principle the Turkish-Cypriots are ready, as under the Annan plan, to hand back some 9% of the 38% of Cyprus that they now occupy, including Varosha, a ghost resort town south of Famagusta. A renewed British offer to give up some land from its two military bases will help. There may however be a row about Morphou, which under the Annan plan would have gone to the Greek-Cypriots but has since seen a big influx of Turks from the mainland. 
Indeed, some Greek-Cypriots say mainland Turks are a bigger problem than territory. It is common to hear that ""we have no problem with Turkish-Cypriots, only with Turks and their army."" Yet the numbers can be exaggerated. Mete Hatay, who works on demographic issues at PRIO, a think-tank in Nicosia, says there are some 50,000 ""citizens"" of mainland Turkish origin in the north (plus 35,000 troops and a transient population of 100,000). He reckons there are 140,000 Turkish-Cypriots left, comprising 17.5% of the population, close to their 18.6% in 1960.
The two biggest sticking-points in the negotiations are security and property. Mr Christofias insists that he cannot accept a deal that preserves Turkey's role as a guarantor power and keeps many Turkish troops on the island, since that would be a ""Damocles sword hanging over us"". Like all Greek-Cypriots, he distrusts the Turkish army. He hints that a Cyprus deal may fall victim to the power struggle between Turkey's prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and his generals. For his part, Mr Talat is adamant that, after their experience of the 1960s, Turkish-Cypriots cannot forgo some protection from Turkey. Men of property
Property may prove tougher still. When the Turkish army overran the north, as much as 80% of property there belonged to Greek-Cypriots, who either fled or lost their lives. In many cases they or their heirs still hold the title deeds, even though the property has been seized by Turkish-Cypriots, developed or, in some cases, sold to foreigners. Mr Talat says property questions must be settled by an independent commission, with compensation paid to former owners (though he is vague about where the money will come from).
Asked for his views, Mr Christofias says endearingly that, as a communist, he does not like private property. Yet the Greek-Cypriots have a clear policy: the original owners must decide. A few might return; others might sell; still others might accept compensation. A new complicating factor is the Orams case. The Oramses are a British couple who bought land in the north from a Turkish-Cypriot and built a holiday home. The original (Greek-Cypriot) owner sued for compensation and won in Cyprus. He took his case to Britain, and earlier this year the European Court of Justice ruled that, even if a Greek-Cypriot judgment against British owners were unenforceable in northern Cyprus, it could be enforced in Britain. The Orams ruling has chilled further investment by foreigners.
Resolving differences over security and property will clearly be hard. But with enough time and goodwill, and sufficient pressure on both sides, it could be done. Unfortunately, all three are lacking.
Sitting in his presidential palace, by the window through which Makarios escaped in July 1974 and in sight of the Turkish-Cypriot flag painted provocatively on the Pentadaktylos mountains, Mr Christofias is emphatic. Substance must prevail over speed; there can be no deadlines and no arbitration. He blames the failure of the Annan plan on excessive haste.
The trouble is that time is once again running out. Mr Talat faces a presidential election in early April that he may well lose. His party was defeated by nationalists in a general election last April. The prime minister is now Dervish Eroglu, a man cut from the same cloth as Mr Denktash. Mr Eroglu, who speaks little English and barely knows Mr Christofias, is now ahead in the polls for the presidential election. Mr Talat has invested so much political capital in his settlement talks that, if he gets no deal, even more voters may turn against him.
The pressure on Mr Talat may be more immediate, but Mr Christofias's room for manoeuvre is also circumscribed. Both coalition parties in his government are harder line than he is. His foreign minister, Markos Kyprianou, wanted new sanctions on the Turks for refusing to open their ports and airports to the Greek-Cypriots, something Mr Christofias was anxious to avoid. The Cypriot media are also vociferously sceptical about the settlement talks.
The big question is how much the two sides really want a deal. The Turkish-Cypriots clearly do. Without a settlement, they will remain unrecognised and isolated, dependent on the Turkish army and an annual subsidy of some $600m from Turkey. But even they feel the pressure for a settlement less than they did. Until the global recession hit, their economy had improved a little. Now they can cross the green line and get Cypriot passports, they can in a worst-case scenario always move to Britain or elsewhere in the EU.
In the end, though, the Turkish-Cypriots would surely say yes. Far more worrying is the absence of pressure for a deal among Greek-Cypriots. Since they rejected the Annan plan in 2004 they have had the benefits of EU (and now euro) membership. The economy has done well, even if it is now in recession. Some fear unification might be costly: GDP per head for Turkish-Cypriots is half as big as for Greek-Cypriots, and taxpayers may have to compensate property-owners. Greek-Cypriots seem unimpressed by studies suggesting a settlement could raise GDP per household in the island by EUR 5,500 ($8,150) or more. 
The best way forward may be pressure from outside. But this needs care. Mr Christofias is not alone in lamenting that ""our tragedy has its roots in intervention by outsiders."" The rejection of the Annan plan in 2004 was partly a response to pressure from the UN and the EU. And both sides are past masters of the blame game--preparing for failure to reach a deal by pinning the blame in advance on each other.
Mr Downer, who says he is ""cautiously optimistic"", is being careful to act as facilitator, not as negotiator. The EU is largely hamstrung because the Turkish-Cypriots see it as tainted by the membership of both Greece and Cyprus. Britain, still a guarantor power, is mistrusted by both sides, as is America. So outside pressure will have to come from the two sides' main patrons: Greece and Turkey.
On this front there are grounds for hope. The new Greek prime minister, George Papandreou, elected in October, may have economic distractions, but he is keener on a Cyprus settlement than his predecessor, and he acts as his own foreign minister. He has visited Nicosia and Ankara already, and gets on with Mr Erdogan. Mr Erdogan's foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, has a policy of no disputes with the neighbours. If Cyprus were to remain unresolved, it would be a glaring exception. A study by the International Crisis Group suggests it might help if the Greek-Cypriots talked directly to Turkey--Mr Christofias met Mr Erdogan in New York in September. But the Turks are reluctant. 
The best source of pressure is the knowledge that there may never be a better chance than now. UN officials mutter about packing their bags and leaving, perhaps taking their peacekeepers with them, if these talks fail. The successors to the two present leaders will be less pro-settlement. As the ICG study concludes, failure would mean more talk of formal partition. Both sides fear that young Cypriots, with no memory of a united island, are less inclined than their parents to compromise--and less attached to lost property.
A deal still looks elusive, and time is short. It would have to be done by the end of February if voters on each side were to approve it before Mr Talat faces his electorate in early April. Talk of reaching a framework agreement that is sufficiently robust to win Turkish-Cypriot voters back to Mr Talat is risky and may well not work.
If these talks fail, another chance is unlikely to arise for years. Turkey's EU hopes would be crushed. And Europe's aspirations for a bigger role in the world would be dented: if it cannot solve a dispute in its own back yard, how can it do much elsewhere? The stakes in Cyprus in the next few weeks could hardly be higher.

 Property may prove tougher still . When the Turkish army overran the north , as much as 80 % of property there belonged to Greek - Cypriots , who either fled or lost their lives . In many cases they or their heirs still hold the title deeds , even though the property has been seized by Turkish - Cypriots , developed or , in some cases , sold to foreigners . Mr Talat says property questions must be settled by an independent commission , with compensation paid to former owners ( though he is vague about where the money will come from ) . 
 Asked for his views , Mr Christofias says endearingly that , as a communist , he does not like private property . Yet the Greek - Cypriots have a clear policy : the original owners must decide . A few might return ; others might sell ; still others might accept compensation . A new complicating factor is the Orams case . The Oramses are a British couple who bought land in the north from a Turkish - Cypriot and built a holiday home . The original ( Greek - Cypriot ) owner sued for compensation and won in Cyprus . He took his case to Britain , and earlier this year the European Court of Justice ruled that , even if a Greek - Cypriot judgment against British owners were unenforceable in northern Cyprus , it could be enforced in Britain . The Orams ruling has chilled further investment by foreigners . 
 Resolving differences over security and property will clearly be hard . But with enough time and goodwill , and sufficient pressure on both sides , it could be done . Unfortunately , all three are lacking . 
 Sitting in his presidential palace , by the window through which Makarios escaped in July 1974 and in sight of the Turkish - Cypriot flag painted provocatively on the Pentadaktylos mountains , Mr Christofias is emphatic . Substance must prevail over speed ; there can be no deadlines and no arbitration . He blames the failure of the Annan plan on excessive haste . 
 The trouble is that time is once again running out . Mr Talat faces a presidential election in early April that he may well lose . His party was defeated by nationalists in a general election last April . The prime minister is now Dervish Eroglu , a man cut from the same cloth as Mr Denktash . Mr Eroglu , who speaks little English and barely knows Mr Christofias , is now ahead in the polls for the presidential election . Mr Talat has invested so much political capital in his settlement talks that , if he gets no deal , even more voters may turn against him . 
 The pressure on Mr Talat may be more immediate , but Mr Christofias 's room for manoeuvre is also circumscribed . Both coalition parties in his government are harder line than he is . His foreign minister , Markos Kyprianou , wanted new sanctions on the Turks for refusing to open their ports and airports to the Greek - Cypriots , something Mr Christofias was anxious to avoid . The Cypriot media are also vociferously sceptical about the settlement talks . 
 The big question is how much the two sides really want a deal . The Turkish - Cypriots clearly do . Without a settlement , they will remain unrecognised and isolated , dependent on the Turkish army and an annual subsidy of some $ 600 m from Turkey . But even they feel the pressure for a settlement less than they did . Until the global recession hit , their economy had improved a little . Now they can cross the green line and get Cypriot passports , they can in a worst - case scenario always move to Britain or elsewhere in the EU . 
 In the end , though , the Turkish - Cypriots would surely say yes . Far more worrying is the absence of pressure for a deal among Greek - Cypriots . Since they rejected the Annan plan in 2004 they have had the benefits of EU ( and now euro ) membership . The economy has done well , even if it is now in recession . Some fear unification might be costly : GDP per head for Turkish - Cypriots is half as big as for Greek - Cypriots , and taxpayers may have to compensate property - owners . Greek - Cypriots seem unimpressed by studies suggesting a settlement could raise GDP per household in the island by EUR 5,500 ( $ 8,150 ) or more . 
 The best way forward may be pressure from outside . But this needs care . Mr Christofias is not alone in lamenting that "" our tragedy has its roots in intervention by outsiders . "" The rejection of the Annan plan in 2004 was partly a response to pressure from the UN and the EU . And both sides are past masters of the blame game -- preparing for failure to reach a deal by pinning the blame in advance on each other . 
 Mr Downer , who says he is "" cautiously optimistic "" , is being careful to act as facilitator , not as negotiator . The EU is largely hamstrung because the Turkish - Cypriots see it as tainted by the membership of both Greece and Cyprus . Britain , still a guarantor power , is mistrusted by both sides , as is America . So outside pressure will have to come from the two sides ' main patrons : Greece and Turkey . 
 On this front there are grounds for hope . George W. Papandreou may have economic distractions , but George W. Papandreou is keener on a Cyprus settlement than George W. Papandreou's predecessor , and George W. Papandreou acts as George W. Papandreou's own foreign minister . George W. Papandreou has visited Nicosia and Ankara already , and gets on with Mr Erdogan . Mr Erdogan 's foreign minister , Ahmet Davutoglu , has a policy of no disputes with the neighbours . If Cyprus were to remain unresolved , it would be a glaring exception . A study by the International Crisis Group suggests it might help if the Greek - Cypriots talked directly to Turkey -- Mr Christofias met Mr Erdogan in New York in September . But the Turks are reluctant . 
 The best source of pressure is the knowledge that there may never be a better chance than now . UN officials mutter about packing their bags and leaving , perhaps taking their peacekeepers with them , if these talks fail . The successors to the two present leaders will be less pro - settlement . As the ICG study concludes , failure would mean more talk of formal partition . Both sides fear that young Cypriots , with no memory of a united island , are less inclined than their parents to compromise -- and less attached to lost property . 
 A deal still looks elusive , and time is short . It would have to be done by the end of February if voters on each side were to approve it before Mr Talat faces his electorate in early April . Talk of reaching a framework agreement that is sufficiently robust to win Turkish - Cypriot voters back to Mr Talat is risky and may well not work . 
 If these talks fail , another chance is unlikely to arise for years . Turkey 's EU hopes would be crushed . And Europe 's aspirations for a bigger role in the world would be dented : if it can not solve a dispute in its own back yard , how can it do much elsewhere ? The stakes in Cyprus in the next few weeks could hardly be higher .

By Greek standards Mr Papandreou has been courageous, but he should have been braver still. Ireland set the pace on December 9th by producing a budget that sharply cut public-sector wages. Mr Papandreou and his finance minister, George Papaconstantinou, talk up the need to balance fairness and social peace with fiscal austerity. But the socialist Pasok party won a big majority in October's election, making it Greece's strongest government in a generation. The opposition has an untested new leader. Mr Papandreou wants to avoid direct confrontation with his trade union supporters, but the need to re-establish fiscal credibility ought to have come first.
To its credit, his government recognises that Greece's ills go far beyond the public finances. Stuck in the euro, its economy has lost competitiveness. Too many Greeks are underemployed. Education, especially higher education, needs reform. Exacerbating these worries is the poor quality of Greece's statistics. The previous government admitted that Greece had massaged its figures to qualify for the euro in 2001. The new one confessed that this year's budget deficit had suddenly shot up from 6.7% to 12.7%. An independent statistics agency set up by Mr Papaconstantinou will help, but it will take years before the markets and Greece's European Union partners trust its figures. That is one reason why Greece's fellow euro-area members are so concerned. Their unspoken fear is that, unless the new government gets tougher and pushes through deep reforms, Greece could be on an inexorable path towards default. Fearing Greeks bearing bonds
When the euro was born a decade ago, it came with central rules limiting budget deficits and banning bail-outs. Yet the rules, which theoretically included huge fines for excessive borrowing, were never likely to stick, and were soon emasculated by France and Germany. Worse, the financial markets came to assume that no euro-area country would ever be allowed to go bust: the EU and the European Central Bank would surely find some way to stand behind it.
It is true that, as Germany's Angela Merkel has conceded, all euro-area countries have an interest in staving off a default. If Greece went under, the markets' attention would quickly turn to other euro-area debtors like Spain, Ireland and Italy, and dent confidence in the euro itself. Yet no euro-area country wants to give its more profligate fellows the impression that their debts will be covered. The bond markets' recent jumpiness suggests that investors, at least, are readier to believe that the strong might be willing to let the weak go under.
Good. The ban on bail-outs must remain credible, in the interests of all the euro members. Otherwise, the burden on the strong could become intolerable, and the weak would get feebler still. Investors are already nervous about Greece; if it finds an easier way out, its political leaders will never have the stomach for difficult choices. Hard times, unfortunately, demand harsh measures.","Urgent measures must be taken by the most profligate euro - area member of all

SUCCESSIVE Greek governments have managed to hoodwink the European Union over the size of the country's budget deficit and its public debt by blaming their predecessors and then promising to do better. No longer. The European Commission's fury over a leap in the projected deficit for 2009 from 6.7% of GDP (the figure from the old centre-right New Democracy-led lot) to 12.7% (the figure produced by the new centre-left Pasok government) helped to trigger a collapse in the Greek bond markets and even provoke dire warnings that the country might go bust.
For now, the idea of Greece having to seek a bail-out from its euro-area partners or appealing to the IMF for help is just talk. The finance minister, George Papaconstantinou, says he has had no such negotiations with his European colleagues. He adds that no euro-area government could ever go to the fund. But the markets' grim mood could yet change things. 
Since Pasok came to power only ten weeks ago, the cost of raising new two-year debt has risen by 1.35 percentage points. Meanwhile, its stock of debt will rise to 125% of GDP next year, from 113% this year. On December 15th Greece resorted to a EUR 2 billion ($2.8 billion) private placement of five-year floating-rate notes with local banks because public-debt managers feared that investors would have shunned a fixed-rate offering. 
Greece's white-knuckle ride in the financial markets will continue. It needs to raise about EUR 55 billion in 2010 to refinance existing debt and keep paying salaries and pensions, and most of that is front-loaded into the first six months. Indeed, the government plans to raise 40% of it in the first four months, whatever the cost--which to some observers smacks of desperation. Talk of default is dismissed as alarmist by the finance ministry. But bankers are less sanguine. ""The markets will give the government two more months to turn things around, no more,"" says one.
The government's dithering is one reason why Greece has come under such fierce attack in the markets. George Papandreou, the new prime minister, was reluctant to abandon his campaign promises of real wage rises and extra welfare spending, even after Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, visited Athens to call for ""courageous measures""--code for cutting public-sector pay, as Ireland has done. At an EU summit on December 10th Mr Papandreou shocked his colleagues by admitting that Greece was riddled with corruption, which he claimed was the main reason for its economic woes. Cynical Greeks concluded that Mr Papandreou was trying to use the issue of corruption, ""as central a part of Greece as the Acropolis"", says one, to build consensus for unpopular reforms.
On December 14th Mr Papandreou tried a little harder. He announced a pay freeze for civil servants earning more than EUR 2,000 a month and a 10% cut in allowances. This is harsher than it looks because allowances an extra 60-90% to basic salaries, and because they will in future be taxed in the 40% band, not the 10% one as now. A near-freeze on public-sector recruitment and military spending, a 10% cut in operating budgets and tax rises for wealthy Greeks are all meant to bring the deficit down to 8.7% of GDP next year. Mr Papandreou insisted that Greece would cut its deficit below the euro area's approved ceiling of 3% of GDP (a target that, even by its own dodgy numbers, the country has met just once since joining the euro in 2001) by 2013.
Sceptics were unconvinced. Standard & Poor's, a rating agency, reacted by downgrading Greece only a week after Fitch, another agency, had done so. The downgrade came just as Mr Papaconstantinou was wrapping up a roadshow around European capitals that was meant to restore Greece's credibility. (He seems confident that the third agency, Moody's, will not downgrade Greece so swiftly.)
Mr Papaconstantinou, a British-trained economist, has a grip of the numbers and knows what has to be done. He is proud of his plans to establish the statistical office as an independent agency, as a way of regaining lost credibility. But he has struggled to win Mr Papandreou's confidence and he may not keep it. Louka Katseli, the development minister, thinks Greece should borrow and spend its way back to growth, with generous handouts to low-income families. She appeals to Mr Papandreou's idealistic side, and also goes down well with tax-and-spend socialists who recall Mr Papandreou's father, Andreas, as prime minister in the 1980s. 
It does not help that Pasok's return to power has been so chaotic. Senior civil-service jobs were advertised online in a bid to boost transparency but, because of a lack of suitable applicants, the government fell back on the familiar habit of appointing party loyalists. Even so, many administrative posts are still unfilled, including that of economic adviser to the prime minister. Mr Papandreou, who chose to be his own foreign minister and also decided to retain the job of president of the Socialist International, prefers the diplomatic stage to the tedious business of putting the public finances in order. 
There is much to do on the foreign front, too. Greece's friendship with Turkey, neglected under the previous government, needs tending. It has frayed recently over Turkey's reluctance to stop large numbers of Central Asian and Middle Eastern migrants crossing from its Aegean coast to the Greek islands--despite the EU's Frontex team of helicopters and patrol boats keeping watch on illegal immigration. Greece also needs to patch up ties with America, strained by a veto, which Mr Papandreou has chosen to uphold, on Macedonia's entry to NATO because of an 18-year-long dispute over the name of Greece's northern neighbour. For the time being, though, Mr Papandreou may have to stay at home a bit more--and be sure that somebody in his office is keeping a close eye on the bond-trading screen.","George W.

SOCIAL cohesion is one of those values all decent Europeans can sign up to: less social conflict and less of the inequality that America and Britain (see
) put up with. Some countries, notably Germany, really do manage to marry social harmony and economic reform. In the past decade Germany has--thanks to good management and obliging unions--kept its public sector in check, partly freed its labour market, held down unemployment, and regained competitiveness. Elsewhere, though, the need to preserve social cohesion, parroted by European politicians from left and right, has become a self-defeating excuse to avoid reform.
In Greece, for instance, the hard-pressed Socialist government of George Papandreou talks up social cohesion as a reason to avoid unduly large public-sector pay cuts in its urgent fiscal retrenchment. Spain's Socialist prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, touts it to justify the retention of labour-market laws that make it ruinously expensive to sack permanent employees. Italy's right-wing government, under Silvio Berlusconi, is similarly loth to lift burdensome regulations on small businesses and services for fear of protests and strikes. Sweden's centre-right leader, Fredrik Reinfeldt, is reluctant to be seen attacking his country's generous social model by trimming benefits, pay and pensions. Even France's conservative president, Nicolas Sarkozy, is unwilling to damage social cohesion (and risk trouble in the streets) by pushing hard for labour-market, pension and welfare reforms.
Two worrying common threads can be discerned in all this. One is that the natural desire for social cohesion is being abused to justify the protection of ""insiders""--those in permanent jobs, in trade unions or in privileged professions. But the cost of protecting insiders falls largely on ""outsiders""--the unemployed and those in temporary work, especially young people and immigrants. The gulf between insiders and outsiders destroys the very social cohesion that the policy is meant to preserve. And in the long run it is bad for everyone, because employers do not train temporary workers--a particular problem in economies like Italy and Spain, where new permanent contracts are rare. This lack of training is one of the main reasons why Europe's productivity growth over the past two decades has persistently lagged behind America's.
The second common thread is that social cohesion has become a reason to defend the privileges and perks of the public sector, which is also now the last bastion of trade unions. Across Europe many private-sector workers have seen their pay, pensions and other benefits frozen or cut by cash-strapped employers during the recession. Yet most governments, even Britain's, have been reluctant to apply similar treatment to the public sector. One result is that the state is taking a rising share of GDP, which is sure to lead to heavier taxes. Another is that public-sector pay and benefits have shot ahead as a cosseted caste extends its privileges. Follow the Irish--or Germans
Most governments seem too paralysed by their muddle-headed talk of social cohesion to act, despite the struggle to finance huge deficits. Yet they now have a striking example in Ireland. Faced with a gaping budget deficit and a recession, the Irish government has torn up its 30-year social compact with employers and unions. It has slashed public spending and made sharp cuts in pay. Indeed, pay is now falling across the whole economy. Not surprisingly, workers and unions are unhappy. This week, the public sector began a work-to-rule. But the harsh medicine seems to be working, as Ireland pulls out of recession, the public finances improve and the economy regains competitiveness lost inside the euro.
It is not always necessary to face down strikes. Italy and Spain could learn from Germany's trick of reforming without strife. But that may be beyond deeply troubled countries like Greece (
), which probably has no alternative but to copy Ireland. What all European governments must grasp, though, is that many of the policies espoused in the name of social cohesion do not promote compassion over cruelty. Rather, they encourage decline, entrench divisions and thus threaten the harmony they pretend to nurture.","Social cohesion has become an excuse for avoiding necessary reforms in Europe

RARELY do chickens come home to roost with such precision. George Papandreou, Greece's Socialist (Pasok) prime minister, is struggling to stop the country ""falling over a cliff"", as he put it in a gloomy television address on February 2nd. Yet it was his late father Andreas, a spendthrift Pasok premier, who presided over the origins of Greece's crisis with a borrowing spree in the 1980s. The younger Mr Papandreou must now act quickly to curb Greece's ""triple deficit""--big budget and current-account deficits, plus a soaring public debt--or risk a humiliating loss of sovereignty to the European Union's institutions to escape a sovereign default. 
Mr Papandreou, a sociologist who dislikes figures, would much prefer to talk of Greece's ""credibility deficit"". As he made clear this week at a conference in Athens organised by The Economist, with Joseph Stiglitz, an American economics Nobel laureate, he likes to blame unnamed ""speculators"", including hedge funds, for the punishment that the country's bonds are taking on financial markets. He and Mr Stiglitz both attacked those whom they termed ""deficit fetishists"".
Yet Mr Papandreou also accepts that Greece has made itself vulnerable, as it is ""the euro zone's weakest link."" Few Greeks doubt that Mr Papandreou is committed to rescuing the economy. Even so, it took two months of verbal bludgeoning by senior European politicians and central bankers before he agreed to impose the freeze on public-sector wages across the board that he announced this week. He also plans tax rises, including higher fuel taxes, and an increase in the retirement age for both men and women.
On February 3rd the European Commission endorsed this latest version of Greece's ""stability and development"" plan. EU finance ministers are likely to approve it on February 16th. The plan sets out an optimistic three-year blueprint for cutting the deficit from 12.7% of GDP in 2009 to below 3% in 2012 (this being the theoretical limit for euro-area countries). But the commission is not convinced that Mr Papandreou will be able to stick to all his promises, even though he told the World Economic Forum at Davos at the end of January that Greece would ""draw blood"" if necessary to overcome its problems. 
Mr Papandreou's latest measures will produce savings of another 0.5% of GDP: a step forward, but still not enough to persuade sceptics that this year's target of reducing the budget deficit by four percentage points can be met. The stability plan still lacks detail. Spreads on Greek bonds narrowed marginally this week as the markets turned their attention to Portugal and Spain (
). But Greece can expect only a short respite, as its plans will not show measurable results before July.
Because of its past habit of fudging the national accounts, Greece will face tougher surveillance, including regular monitoring by Eurostat, the EU's statistical agency. A withering commission report on the country's fraudulent accounting methods, made public last month, is likely to be followed by a court case against Greece. The finance minister, George Papaconstantinou, has promised that the state statistics office will be modernised and cut loose from political supervision by March.
Some senior members of Pasok are objecting to tighter austerity measures, which they claim will lead to social unrest. Income disparities widened under the previous centre-right administration. As many as 20% of Greeks live below the EU's poverty line. Pasok came to power in October promising more ""social protection."" But with the economy set for a second year of recession--it is likely to contract by more than the official projection of 0.3% this year--Mr Papandreou has had no choice but to abandon his campaign pledges. 
Public opinion is, for the moment, on Mr Papandreou's side. His approval rating is well above 50%, according to most opinion polls. The normally militant public-sector unions say that, so long as the pain is seen to be fairly shared, they will accept the government's pay freeze--although they still plan to hold a token 24-hour strike on the day that parliament approves this year's pay policy. 
The main conservative opposition party, New Democracy, is also backing the government. Its new leader, Antonis Samaras, is a former foreign minister whose friendship with Mr Papandreou dates back to student days in America. Mr Samaras says his party will support the government's economic policies and that it will even try to match Eurostat's tight monitoring. Left-wing parties, though, are unwilling to back Pasok. This week Alexis Tsipras, leader of Syriza, a left-wing splinter group, scoffed at the ""empty drama"" of Mr Papandreou's attempt to rally the nation. It is perhaps fortunate that Pasok won such a clear parliamentary majority in October.
To keep the unions on board, Mr Papaconstantinou must act swiftly against tax-dodgers. High-earning doctors and lawyers can often avoid paying taxes by using offshore companies to acquire suburban villas, SUVs and luxurious motor yachts. These possessions may now be considered as ""objective criteria"" of large incomes regardless of what their owners declare on their tax returns. Now that Athens has a computerised land registry, it should be easier to track down and prosecute tax evaders. Mr Papaconstantinou promises that ""we will put people in jail for tax evasion."" Yet at the conference with Professor Stiglitz, one businessman in the audience drew applause for telling Mr Papaconstantinou that the entire tax administration was corrupt and needed to be replaced.
In 1985, under the older Mr Papandreou, Greece was bailed out by an emergency loan from Brussels. But the tighter fiscal polices imposed by the commission were soon ignored. Greece got away with its delinquency on that occasion. But times have changed. If the younger Mr Papandreou fails, Greece will surely be punished far more severely.","The government wins support from Brussels -- but its ability to stick to austerity will soon be severely tested

SOME would say that tragedy was inevitable from the moment, nine years ago last month, when Greece was admitted to the euro zone. Others would claim that woe was sure to befall such a disparate currency union sooner or later: if not Greece, then some other weak member of the club would have been the cause. Avoidable or not, trouble has arrived. At best, Greece has to undergo a dramatic budgetary tightening. Its fellow Europeans, or the IMF, may yet have to organise a humiliating bail-out. Some even talk--probably mistakenly--of the beginning of the end of the euro area.
Last year Greece's budget deficit reached 12.7% of GDP. Worries over whether the Greeks would act to cut it have caused paroxysms in the bond markets: late last month the yield on ten-year Greek government bonds vaulted to 7.1%, the highest since the country joined the euro area and about four percentage points more than that on German bunds, the euro zone's safest investment. The panic abated on February 3rd, when the European Commission endorsed the Greek government's plan to cut the deficit to 3% of GDP by 2012. The day before, Greece's prime minister, George Papandreou, had used a television address to announce higher taxes on fuel and an extension of a public-sector wage freeze to include low-paid civil servants.
However, Greece and Europe are not out of trouble yet. The commission says it will watch Greece closely to ensure that it keeps its promises: it expects a report in mid-March on Greece's chances of hitting this year's deficit target of 8.7% of GDP. Joaquin Almunia, the outgoing economics commissioner, said he hoped a positive assessment by the commission in mid-May would help restore confidence in Greece, which has one of the world's largest debt burdens relative to its GDP (see chart 1).
If the Greeks do not regain the markets' confidence, they may fail to refinance the EUR 20 billion ($28 billion) or so of debt that falls due in April and May. At that point the government would default or would have to be bailed out. And Greece is not the only country about which the bond markets are worried. On the same day as the commission approved the Greek plans, investors were selling Portuguese bonds. The spread of ten-year bonds against bunds widened by 0.16 percentage points, to 1.43 points. A marathon, not a sprint
Greece has a long history of fiscal trouble. It has spent half of the past two centuries in default, note Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff in ""This Time Is Different"", a history of financial crises. When it became the 12th country to join the euro in 2001, its public debt was more than 100% of GDP. Many thought its chronic budgetary mismanagement might harm the currency.
For Greece, membership was a boon. Bond markets no longer had to worry about high inflation or devaluation. Lower interest rates allowed the government to refinance debt on more favourable terms: the ratio of net interest costs to GDP fell by 6.5 percentage points in the decade after 1995. The underpricing of default risk during the credit boom gave Greece easy access to longer-term borrowing. Lower interest rates also spurred a spending splurge. The economy grew by an average of 4% a year until 2008.
But strong GDP growth masked the underlying weakness of the public finances. The public-debt ratio fell, but only because GDP in cash terms grew more quickly than debt. Large budget deficits continued. Once it was safely inside the euro, indeed, Greece relaxed its fiscal grip. The primary budget balance (ie, excluding interest payments) was in surplus in the run-up to membership but has been in deficit since 2003. That did little to cool the economy. Greece's inflation rate stayed above the euro-area average, hurting its competitiveness. The economy relied increasingly on foreign borrowing. The current-account deficit widened to 14.6% of GDP in 2008. 
If Greece had retained its own currency, trouble might have come sooner. But in the months after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, Greece was shielded by euro membership. It could still borrow easily, if not as cheaply, in bond markets even as investors' aversion to risky assets peaked last March. The economy was on course for a shallow recession at worst. Greek banks were free of the toxic mortgage securities that felled others. Forecasts for the 2009 budget deficit, at 5% of GDP, seemed almost modest compared with the gaping shortfalls projected for other countries.
Yet the reality was far worse, as became clear after October's election. The new government said the true deficit was likely to be 12.7% of GDP. Worse, the shortfall for 2008 was also revised up to include unpaid bills to medical suppliers. The mild downturn hurt tax revenues more than the previous administration had let on. The economy probably shrank by 1% last year, but consumer spending fell by more. Value-added taxes, a reliable source of revenue, were squeezed. Control of public spending had been relaxed in the run-up to the election, adding to the deficit.
Investors' trust in Greek statistics, never solid, was shattered. Two of the three main credit-rating agencies, Fitch and Standard & Poor's (S&P), cut their rating on Greek bonds and gave warning that a further downgrade was likely. A debt standstill by Dubai World, a state-backed property venture in the Middle East, made bond investors more nervous about sovereign risk. Greek bond spreads started to widen again. In mid-December the government responded with a fresh plan to cut the deficit. Bond markets were unconvinced. So were the rating agencies: Fitch and S&P cut Greece's grade again, from A- to BBB+. 
On January 25th the Greek government enjoyed some brief reassurance, raising EUR 8 billion in a sale of five-year bonds. The bank syndicate charged with placing the bonds said it had drummed up EUR 25 billion-worth of orders in a matter of hours from investors attracted by an interest rate of 6.2%. Yet within a couple of days Greek bond yields were on the rise again. Stories that China had turned down an offer of Greek bonds--denied in both Athens and Beijing--also unsettled markets.
Predictably, Mr Papandreou blames speculators for the flare-up in the markets. But he also concedes that his country has been left vulnerable by its own profligacy. If the government wants to restore the bond markets' confidence, it will have to be bolder.
The planned cuts to the public-sector wage bill look small when set against such a large budget deficit. They also look timid when compared with the much bolder action taken in Ireland, another cash-strapped euro member. In December the Irish government announced big reductions in civil servants' pay, only months after it had introduced a ""pension levy"" that cut public-sector wages by 7%. Its courage has been rewarded with lower borrowing costs (see chart 2).
Greece's finance minister, George Papaconstantinou, says the main problem in his country's civil service is overmanning, not excessive pay: the right approach is to slow recruitment and allow the payroll to shrink as civil servants retire. Fine, but time is not on his side. To appease Greece's jittery creditors a policy with speedier and more visible results is needed. A big pay cut in the public sector would help. Private firms might then find it easier to follow suit, which would help Greece to regain its cost competitiveness.
The government says it will present a plan for pension reform soon. Greece has one of the most generous, and therefore expensive, state pension systems among the 30 mostly rich OECD countries. Workers look forward to a pension of 96% of pre-retirement earnings. Greeks can no longer afford such a comfortable old age. In his television address Mr Papandreou hinted that a higher retirement age would be one plank of reform.
A bolder package of budget cuts might secure bond-market finance at tolerable interest rates. The Greek government says it has to strike a balance between budget cuts and keeping its ""social partners"" happy. But if it is too kind to public-sector workers, pensioners and so forth, it will struggle to find buyers for its bonds. If the bond markets are closed to Greece, the country will face bail-out or default. Neither option is likely to contribute much to social peace. Which bucket to bail with?
The thought that Greece might fail to carry out the necessary budget cuts has had officials scratching their heads about the form a bail-out might take. When yields soared in late January, nervous Eurocrats were briefing journalists that a rescue package for Greece was being considered. The treaty governing the European Union includes a ""no bail-out"" clause, forbidding countries from assuming the debts of others. That clause was inserted in 1991, at the insistence of Germany, at the EU summit in Maastricht, the Dutch town where many of the ground rules for the euro were set down. Other treaty clauses, however, may allow for aid to an EU state in trouble.
One remedy would be for Greece to arrange a bridging loan from another euro-zone country in good credit, such as Germany. Such an arrangement may or may not be legal; it would certainly make for terrible politics. Voters in the donor country would be outraged if the rewards of their thrift were used to rescue the profligate. To ensure that good money was not thrown after bad, any loan would need to have conditions attached. That raises another problem. It is tricky for one country to tell another how to cut its budget. When Mexico was rescued in 1994, the Clinton administration at first wanted to manage the bail-out alone. It quickly realised that it would be better to have the IMF ask Mexico to sign up to conditions. For Mexico in the mid-1990s, read Greece today. ""If Germany steps in, there will be people on the Athens street who will say the Wehrmacht is back,"" an economist remarks.
European officials are privately horrified at the thought of calling in the IMF to bail Greece out. Pride is at stake. To turn to the fund for aid would be a humiliation for Europe, never mind the Greeks. The reputation of the euro is on the line and its members ought to be strong enough to fix problems within its borders. An IMF-led rescue would only underline the feebleness of the euro zone's procedures to prevent fiscal laxity, even if few outside Brussels and Frankfurt ever set much store by them. European officials also seem reluctant to accept that the euro is not a shield against all crises. The EU has been content to work with the IMF in helping Hungary, Latvia and Romania, but these countries are not yet in the euro. 
The trouble is, the euro area has no mechanism to help a member that cannot fund itself in capital markets. So default is all too plausible. If Europe is too proud to call on the IMF, it will have to come up with its own fund as a backstop for Greece, and quickly.
A template for such a fund already exists. The EU has a loan facility to help members outside the euro with balance-of-payments problems. The fund's ceiling was raised to EUR 50 billion last spring, to cope with the potential need for emergency loans to Hungary and others. The facility is financed by EU-backed bonds, issued as the need arises. Loans for Greece could be raised in the same way, though it would mean that countries outside the euro, including Britain and Sweden, would be liable if they were not repaid. And the chances that Britain, determined to stay outside the single currency and short of money itself, would put itself on the hook for a bankrupt euro member seem slim-- even if British pension and insurance funds hold a good slice of Greek debt.
In any case, a bail-out by Greece's partners is unlikely to be as effective in sorting out the country's finances as an IMF programme. To assuage the lenders' domestic voters, EU loans would have to be made at a punitive interest rate. The IMF, by contrast, would offer cheaper funds with stricter conditions. And it has the experienced staff the EU lacks to make sure a miscreant sticks to a plan to fix its finances.
There is an alternative to a bail-out within Europe or by the IMF: default. Mr Almunia has insisted that this will not happen. ""In the euro area...default does not exist,"" he declared (perhaps rashly) on Bloomberg television. Yet there is a view that default may be less bad than a bail-out, especially a botched one. Greece's financial woes are a problem for the country and its creditors to sort out. If Greece has to declare a debt standstill, say the hardliners, so be it. Financial aid would only discourage countries from mending their finances. Concerns that this would undermine the euro's credibility may be misplaced. The countries that stand behind the rich world's other main currencies (the dollar, the yen and the pound) have troubles of their own. Indeed, the euro is suffering from a surfeit of credibility since, on many gauges, it is overvalued against the dollar. Coming Acropolis
What makes default unpalatable is the fear of contagion--that if Greece were allowed to go under, the cost of borrowing for other troubled euro members would shoot up. (Banks holding troubled countries' bonds would also suffer.) Portugal, as the sell-off on February 3rd suggests, is next in line. Its public-debt ratio is 77% and rising. Its current-account deficit is almost as big as Greece's (see chart 3). Italy has public debt of a similar scale, relative to GDP, to Greece's; but its budget deficit is only half as big and its current-account deficit is relatively small. The Italian bond market is the world's third-largest. Such a large and liquid market is less vulnerable to speculative attack than a small one, such as Greece's or Portugal's. Ireland is small, too, but its government has shown itself willing to take unpopular decisions to right its public finances. The Irish economy is more flexible so its medium-term prospects seem brighter. The economy grew slightly in the third quarter of last year. There are even signs that tax revenues are recovering.
The Greek crisis only confirms the folly of binding a group of disparate countries together in a currency zone with no mechanism, such as a central fiscal authority, to address its internal imbalances. The north-south divide in the euro area looks more marked than ever. The north, exemplified by Germany, relies on exports to power its growth, saves hard and runs trade surpluses. The southern economies, such as Greece, have leant too heavily on consumer spending, have weak public finances and rely on foreign capital to supplement their low savings. 
Do these disparities, and the trouble in Greece, threaten the break-up of the euro, as some believe? European officials retort that large imbalances are found in all large currency areas--even the United States. Spain's construction bust and rigid labour markets seem certain to condemn it to years of economic struggle and high unemployment, yet Michigan is scarcely in better shape. The state's outlook is clouded by the long decline of Detroit's motor industry. Greece is struggling to raise funds, but so is California, which accounts for a far bigger share of America's output (one-eighth) than Greece does of the euro zone's (a bit more than one-fortieth).
An important difference in the case of the United States, however, is that the bulk of taxing and public spending is done by the federal government. As Marco Annunziata of UniCredit, an Italian bank, points out, California's debt amounts to less than 1% of America's GDP. Greek debt comes to 2% of the euro zone's GDP.
It is unlikely that Greece would be forced out of the euro, still less that it would choose to leave. Any hint of that would cause a bank run. A departing country may get a brief fillip from having a cheaper currency but it would still be left with expensive euro debt to service. Borrowing costs would shoot up to reflect higher currency and inflation risk. A more likely scenario than break-up is that the euro area finds ways around the absence of a central fiscal authority while stopping well short of a unified budget, for which there is scant political support.
A forthcoming paper from the Centre for European Policy Studies, a Brussels think-tank, sets out some ideas about how this could be done. The authors, Daniel Gros and Thomas Mayer, think the euro area should prepare for fiscal crises instead of trying only to prevent them. They propose an insurance system with premiums based on each country's debt and budget deficit. The money raised would be used for loans to euro members shut out of bond markets. If a bailed-out country failed to comply with the conditions attached to loans and threatened default, the fund would stand ready to swap the country's ""bad"" bonds, at a discount, for ""good"" bonds backed by euro-zone members, in order to limit the costs of contagion. ""Only if default is possible can market discipline be maintained,"" say the authors.
Such a scheme would not obviate the need for deep reform in Greece. Successful companies complain that they are overtaxed to make up for evasion elsewhere. Small firms continue to operate below their efficient scale, because if they were bigger, they would attract the tax authorities. Greece's higher inflation is partly explained by a lack of competition in parts of the economy. As in Italy and Spain, wages are set centrally with too little regard for differences in productivity across industries and companies. If Greece is to get itself out of trouble, fixing the public finances is only the beginning.","The sorry state of Greece 's public finances is a test not only for the country 's policymakers but also for Europe 's 
 SOME would say that tragedy was inevitable from the moment , nine years ago last month , when Greece was admitted to the euro zone . Others would claim that woe was sure to befall such a disparate currency union sooner or later : if not Greece , then some other weak member of the club would have been the cause . Avoidable or not , trouble has arrived . At best , Greece has to undergo a dramatic budgetary tightening . Its fellow Europeans , or the IMF , may yet have to organise a humiliating bail - out . Some even talk -- probably mistakenly -- of the beginning of the end of the euro area . 
 Last year Greece 's budget deficit reached 12.7 % of GDP . Worries over whether the Greeks would act to cut it have caused paroxysms in the bond markets : late last month the yield on ten - year Greek government bonds vaulted to 7.1 % , the highest since the country joined the euro area and about four percentage points more than that on German bunds , the euro zone 's safest investment . The panic abated on February 3rd , when the European Commission endorsed the Greek government 's plan to cut the deficit to 3 % of GDP by 2012 . The day before , George W. Papandreou's had used a television address to announce higher taxes on fuel and an extension of a public - sector wage freeze to include low - paid civil servants . 
 However , Greece and Europe are not out of trouble yet . The commission says it will watch Greece closely to ensure that it keeps its promises : it expects a report in mid - March on Greece 's chances of hitting this year 's deficit target of 8.7 % of GDP . Joaquin Almunia , the outgoing economics commissioner , said he hoped a positive assessment by the commission in mid - May would help restore confidence in Greece , which has one of the world 's largest debt burdens relative to its GDP ( see chart 1 ) . 
 If the Greeks do not regain the markets ' confidence , they may fail to refinance the EUR 20 billion ( $ 28 billion ) or so of debt that falls due in April and May.

SINCE the launch of Europe's single currency, there have been theoretical worries about profligacy. The main fear was that free-spending countries (ie, Italy) might borrow excessively and pass either higher interest costs or the bill for a bail-out on to their sober, frugal brethren (ie, Germany). Eleven years after the euro's birth, as Greece skids towards disaster, those vague fears have become an urgent question of policy.
The first attempt to deal with profligacy, the comically misnamed stability and growth pact, was never going to work. Neither the threat of fines on miscreants unable to afford them nor the euro area's ban on bail-outs was credible. Yet in the past few months Greek bond yields have widened spectacularly against German ones, as lenders have rightly begun to ask what plans there are for euro-area countries in trouble--and, in the silence that followed, to fear a sovereign default. 
What should be done? The aversion of most euro-area countries to a bail-out is understandable, even laudable--nothing would encourage reckless spending like the knowledge that other countries were ready to step in. Greece is especially undeserving (
). Although some of its problems have been brought on by global recession and by speculators, almost all the blame lies at home. Blatant Greek fiddling with the national accounts to disguise government borrowing has shot to pieces the country's credibility, both in the markets and with other euro-area members. Deep structural weaknesses in the Greek economy have been left to fester. For a decade or more Greece has lived far beyond its means. Savage austerity is now inevitable. Yet, although the newish Socialist government of George Papandreou has promised to reduce borrowing below 3% of GDP by 2012, that may prove too unpopular to carry through (
).

SINCE the launch of Europe's single currency, there have been theoretical worries about profligacy. The main fear was that free-spending countries (ie, Italy) might borrow excessively and pass either higher interest costs or the bill for a bail-out on to their sober, frugal brethren (ie, Germany). Eleven years after the euro's birth, as Greece skids towards disaster, those vague fears have become an urgent question of policy.
The first attempt to deal with profligacy, the comically misnamed stability and growth pact, was never going to work. Neither the threat of fines on miscreants unable to afford them nor the euro area's ban on bail-outs was credible. Yet in the past few months Greek bond yields have widened spectacularly against German ones, as lenders have rightly begun to ask what plans there are for euro-area countries in trouble--and, in the silence that followed, to fear a sovereign default. 
What should be done? The aversion of most euro-area countries to a bail-out is understandable, even laudable--nothing would encourage reckless spending like the knowledge that other countries were ready to step in. Greece is especially undeserving (
). Although some of its problems have been brought on by global recession and by speculators, almost all the blame lies at home. Blatant Greek fiddling with the national accounts to disguise government borrowing has shot to pieces the country's credibility, both in the markets and with other euro-area members. Deep structural weaknesses in the Greek economy have been left to fester. For a decade or more Greece has lived far beyond its means. Savage austerity is now inevitable. Yet, although the newish Socialist government of George Papandreou has promised to reduce borrowing below 3% of GDP by 2012, that may prove too unpopular to carry through (
).

The conservative opposition, in a mood of deep introversion after being turfed out last October, can hardly challenge the handling of a crisis it helped to create. Its leader, Antonis Samaras, has been pointedly thanked by the European Commission president, Jose Manuel Barroso, for his constructive attitude. 
But the risk now is that the consensus for reform will ebb away. The pay cuts will undoubtedly draw blood, and people must brace themselves for an imminent reform of the pension system, which is likely to raise the average retirement age from 58 to 63.

In a bid to offset the political cost of the wage cuts, and also to pre-empt demands from impatient EU partners, the government has announced a sweeping overhaul of the tax system, including a drive to collect more revenue from the rich. The upper tax rate of 40% will start at EUR 60,000 ($82,000), down from EUR 75,000, and there will be tough penalties for evaders; shops may be closed and assets seized. Big property holdings, including some church assets, will incur a progressive levy. However, implementing tax reforms will be an uphill struggle as long as corruption abounds among collectors. 
The first challenge is to induce citizens to show a modicum of honesty in declaring what they earn.

ON FEBRUARY 15th Greeks celebrated Clean Monday, the start of Orthodox Lent, by flocking out of towns and cities to eat shellfish and fly kites. For a country in the throes of an economic crisis, a national holiday to listen to the bouzouki smacks of self-indulgence. But then Greeks and other members of the euro zone are perhaps allowing themselves to believe that, after an awful, bickering month, things are looking up. Fortified by a couple of European Union summits, plus a more ambitious Greek pledge to cut the deficit and a euro-zone counterpledge to stand behind the country, the market for Greek government debt looks stable. 
But for how long? The bond market's assault has indeed abated, but only the most carried-away kite-flying oyster-eater could believe that this crisis is over for good. At some point in the next few months, during which Greece has to raise at least EUR 20 billion ($27 billion) in the bond markets, its finances are likely to be tested again. Greece's plans to restructure its economy lack credibility, the euro zone's promised rescue is vague and the whole confection threatens to be needlessly expensive. European leaders bought time this week. They should use it to devise something better.
The problem is that European leaders seem to like their handiwork. The euro zone's chieftains promised ""determined and co-ordinated action"" should the euro come under threat. There was no detail, but that was intentional. Details would be harder than generalities for member states to agree on and they would give speculators a target. Details would also draw the anger of voters at a time when European solidarity is in short supply. Almost seven out of ten French voters say they now regret the loss of the franc. Germans wonder why a 67-year-old worker from Aachen must cough up so that an Athenian can retire early at 54 (see
). As its part of the deal, Greece has to get its deficit below 3% of GDP by the end of 2012, including a four-percentage-point cut this year. If by mid-March Greece is falling behind, the euro zone can ask for further cuts. To German ears that sounds like reassuringly harsh punishment for Greece's fiddled accounts and profligacy. Between extremes, uncomfortable reality lies
What is more, the fix appears to have seen off the two extremes that dismay Europe's leaders. One is the Eurosceptic fantasy that Greece's travails herald the breaking apart of the euro. That will not happen if Greece has support. The other is a push towards further European integration--which, after the poison spread by the Lisbon treaty, finally ratified last year, is firmly off the menu (see Charlemagne). True, Greece will be watched closely, but if compliance counted as federalism, then the IMF, which has overseen countless such programmes, would long ago have brought about world government.
The trouble is that the euro-zone plan also has some grave weaknesses. The first is that its vagueness may come to be seen as a symptom of how hard it would be to carry out--that, say, domestic objections in France or Germany could thwart it. If so, investors in Greek bonds may come to doubt the credibility of the rescue promise. You can see why George Papandreou, the Greek prime minister, asked for more precision.
The second weakness is that Greece may not be able to restructure fast enough. That is not only because of the scale of the task. In just a few months Mr Papandreou's Socialist government is seeking to overturn decades of tax evasion and easy government money. The finance minister has already seen his own staff go on strike--and his ministry's job is to force the programme through. There is a limit to what Greeks will tolerate, but nobody knows where it lies. That is why the euro zone has said it will call on the experts at the IMF to help ensure that Greece stays on course. However Greece is a full member of the EU and the euro zone. For as long as the main judgments are in Brussels, it will be hard to convince investors that the Greek programme is immune from backroom favours.
Some economists favour setting up a European Monetary Fund (see
). We would rather give the IMF overall charge, even if in Brussels this is seen as a humiliation and in Athens the fund is viewed as an arm of the American government. The IMF would lend credibility to Greece's restructuring and lower the cost of emergency borrowing: euro-zone countries would have to lend to Greece at punitive interest rates, to deter future spendthrifts, but the fund can lend its own cash at low rates. A credible IMF programme would also mean bond-market investors would charge the Greeks less too. And the less it has to pay, the more restructuring Greece can get done. The euro zone may be too proud to go to the IMF, but as any Lenten penitent should know, pride comes before a fall.","The euro zone 's rescue plan for Greece is flawed

GEORGE PAPACONSTANTINOU, the overworked Greek finance minister, likens the effort to steer Greece away from economic disaster to ""changing the course of the Titanic."" Until this week it looked as if the country was headed for an iceberg labelled default. Two austerity packages had failed to convince Greece's European partners--or the financial markets--that measures to cut the budget deficit this year from 12.7% of GDP to 8.7% would work.
Critics in Brussels said that Greece's Socialist government was relying too heavily on pledges to cut tax evasion and soak the rich, rather than slash spending, especially on public-sector pay and pensions. The markets pushed spreads on Greek bonds over their German equivalents to record highs. Greece's ten-year bonds were offering mouth-watering yields of some 6%, twice the German level. 
On March 3rd, however, the mood changed. George Papandreou, the prime minister, at last threw his full weight behind austerity. His government announced some severe measures: a rise in the top rate of value-added tax, from 19% to 21%, higher taxes on fuel, tobacco and alcohol, a freeze on pensions and a 30% cut in civil servants' Christmas, Easter and summer bonuses. This last is equivalent to a cut of one month's pay for Greece's 700,000-strong public-sector workforce. On March 4th Greece resumed some bond sales.
Mr Papandreou had shrugged off earlier warnings from Brussels (and Berlin) that more had to be done. He changed tack after blunt remarks by Olli Rehn, the new European economics commissioner who visited Athens this week, that extra measures were needed to meet this year's deficit target. Mr Papandreou claimed that Greece had now taken enough ""painful but necessary measures"" to qualify for support from its European partners, but without specifying what form that might take.
Greece desperately needs EUR 20 billion ($27 billion) in the next two months to roll over expiring debt. If it can get it, more than half this year's borrowing requirement of EUR 53 billion will have been covered and the markets' pressure will ease, say bankers. One way forward might be to persuade other euro-area countries to buy Greek bonds, perhaps by providing guarantees for euro-area investors. ""We want to be able to borrow at the same rates as other euro-zone countries,"" Mr Papandreou said, perhaps optimistically given Greece's record of huge budget deficits and deceitful accounting. On the other hand, as he has also pointed out, Greece cannot afford to go on borrowing indefinitely at 350 basis points over Germany. The gains from austerity measures could be swallowed up by such a high debt premium. 
Imminent visits by Mr Papandreou to Berlin, Paris and Washington, DC, could help to resolve Greece's debt problem. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, has considered the possibility of Germany providing bilateral help to Greece, though she insists she is not yet ready to talk about aid with Mr Papandreou. Germans still fret about moral hazard: a bail-out would mean that Greece gets away with years of irresponsible fiscal policy and could set a bad precedent for other euro delinquents. The German constitutional court ruled two decades ago that the Maastricht treaty was acceptable only if its no bail-out provisions were respected--so any bail-out would have to be disguised to avoid legal challenges. Yet German banks are on the hook for so much Greek (and other Mediterranean) debt that some kind of taxpayer support may be unavoidable.
France's president, Nicolas Sarkozy, seems readier to help--though Greece may come under pressure to buy more expensive French frigates for its navy. This is not a deal that Mr Papandreou likes, since Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey's prime minister, has just proposed that the two formerly hostile neighbours should make a joint agreement to cut defence spending.
To strengthen his hand with the rest of the euro zone, Mr Papandreou is threatening to turn to the IMF for a standby loan. The conditions are unlikely to be much harsher than the latest austerity measures, say Greek officials. But this could also be too optimistic. The IMF would probably tell Greece to sack thousands of public-sector workers and cut pensions sharply. Even so, as one Greek official notes, ""at least with the fund you can stop worrying about where to get the money to finance the debt.""
Greek trade unions are predictably furious over the bonus cuts, which come on top of a 4% pay cut they have already swallowed. Strikes will spread; on March 4th protesters briefly occupied the finance ministry. Some strikers are unpopular, for example the taxi drivers. There is more sympathy for pensioners, who face a double blow from a freeze in pensions and the impact of tax rises. Militant pensioners unexpectedly broke through a police cordon blocking the road to Mr Papandreou's office as he was announcing the new measures. They will soon be on the march again, says their union. ""You cannot make ends meet on EUR 400 a month,"" declared one retired plumber. So far Mr Papandreou's approval ratings have held up, with more than 60% of Greeks accepting that tougher measures are needed.
Fears loom over the timetable set in Brussels for implementing the new plans. Greece will shortly complete an overhaul of its tax legislation and come up with proposals to reform state pensions, which now eat up over 11% of GDP. A shortage of competent bureaucrats makes it harder to ensure that any new targets are met. If Greece is to stay on course, Mr Papaconstantinou and his team will have to keep putting in long hours.","The government 's new austerity measures may prove to be enough -- so long as they are fully implemented

Papandreou . Germans still fret about moral hazard : a bail - out would mean that Greece gets away with years of irresponsible fiscal policy and could set a bad precedent for other euro delinquents . The German constitutional court ruled two decades ago that the Maastricht treaty was acceptable only if its no bail - out provisions were respected -- so any bail - out would have to be disguised to avoid legal challenges . Yet German banks are on the hook for so much Greek ( and other Mediterranean ) debt that some kind of taxpayer support may be unavoidable . 
 France 's president , Nicolas Sarkozy , seems readier to help -- though Greece may come under pressure to buy more expensive French frigates for its navy . This is not a deal that George W. Papandreou likes , since Recep Tayyip Erdogan , Turkey 's prime minister , has just proposed that the two formerly hostile neighbours should make a joint agreement to cut defence spending . 
 To strengthen George W. Papandreou's hand with the rest of the euro zone , George W. Papandreou is threatening to turn to the IMF for a standby loan . The conditions are unlikely to be much harsher than the latest austerity measures , say Greek officials . But this could also be too optimistic . The IMF would probably tell Greece to sack thousands of public - sector workers and cut pensions sharply . Even so , as one Greek official notes , "" at least with the fund you can stop worrying about where to get the money to finance the debt . "" 
 Greek trade unions are predictably furious over the bonus cuts , which come on top of a 4 % pay cut they have already swallowed . Strikes will spread ; on March 4th protesters briefly occupied the finance ministry . Some strikers are unpopular , for example the taxi drivers . There is more sympathy for pensioners , who face a double blow from a freeze in pensions and the impact of tax rises . Militant pensioners unexpectedly broke through a police cordon blocking the road to George W. Papandreou's office as George W. Papandreou was announcing the new measures . They will soon be on the march again , says their union . "" You can not make ends meet on EUR 400 a month , "" declared one retired plumber . So far George W. Papandreou's approval ratings have held up , with more than 60 % of Greeks accepting that tougher measures are needed . 
 Fears loom over the timetable set in Brussels for implementing the new plans . Greece will shortly complete an overhaul of its tax legislation and come up with proposals to reform state pensions , which now eat up over 11 % of GDP . A shortage of competent bureaucrats makes it harder to ensure that any new targets are met . If Greece is to stay on course , George W. Papandreou and George W. Papandreou's team will have to keep putting in long hours .",350,Greece,A30-94,IN TERM,True,"George Papandreou , the prime minister ,",19,True

WHEN times are hard, many people are tempted to let their credit cards take the strain for a while. And when economies fall into recession, many governments are happy to let their budget deficits widen, to tide the economy over. 
Sensible as this may be, deficits in several countries have increased so much and so fast during the economic crisis of the past 18 months or so that it is generally agreed that remedial action will be needed in the medium term. Deficits of 10% or more of GDP cannot be sustained for long, especially when nervous markets drive up the cost of servicing the growing debt.
Market pressure explains why deficits have come to the fore in southern Europe. Greece and Portugal, in particular, have seen a sharp rise in their cost of finance and some investors have questioned their ability to roll over their debt. But deficits will also be at the centre of the forthcoming British election campaign, and in America the ""tea party"" movement has launched a populist campaign against rising government spending.
There is no absolute rule on when deficits or public debts are too high relative to an economy's size. Prior to the crisis the general consensus was that rich countries could safely have public debts worth 60% of GDP. Yet although Japan's debt has exceeded its GDP for many years, the government has yet to suffer a financing crisis, perhaps because it has a large number of willing domestic buyers of its bonds. But when the markets do lose confidence in a government's fiscal rectitude, a crisis can arise quite quickly, forcing countries into painful political decisions. 
Plainly, economic growth makes policymakers' lives much easier. Growth reduces deficits automatically by increasing tax revenues and cutting spending on unemployment benefits and so forth. As the economy grows, deficits fall, debts become more sustainable, lightening the adjustment burden and reassuring investors.
Nations have recovered from huge debt burdens in the past, often in the aftermath of wars, when men and resources were released from conflict and put to more productive work. When politicians turn to today's deficit problems, it is vital that they choose policies that enhance long-term growth prospects. They will not lack opportunities: in several countries, for example, increases in statutory pension ages and other reforms that make labour markets more flexible are anyway overdue.
It would, however, be unwise to assume that a burst of rapid and prolonged growth is imminent in many rich economies. Ageing or even shrinking populations make sluggish growth more likely. Growth also tends to be weak in the aftermath of financial crises. In a recent book on sovereign debt, ""This Time is Different"", Carmen Reinhart of the University of Maryland and Kenneth Rogoff of Harvard conclude that ""the evidence offers little support for the view that countries simply grow out of their debts."" 
So, short of debt default or implicit default via inflation, that leaves two other ways of closing the deficit. Spending must be cut or taxpayers must pay more. Many political battles of the next few years will be fought on these simple lines, with taxpayers on one side and the beneficiaries of public spending on the other. One imminent battle will be between taxpayers and public-sector workers. In some countries, one party can be seen as representing taxpayers (the Conservatives in Britain and the Republicans in America) and the other the workers (Labour and the Democrats, respectively).
Another of these fights will be between generations. In America the biggest medium-term budget busters are pensions and health care for the old. A big deficit may ease the economic pain in the short term but risks saddling the next generation with a growth-sapping burden of higher taxes and interest payments. The battles are also intertwined: taxpayers finance the pensions of public employees which are, by and large, more generous and predictable than in the private sector.
The outcome of these battles will vary from country to country. Both sides have potent weapons. Many of the biggest taxpayers are political donors and have access to people in power. If they are ignored, they may pack up and move to a more friendly jurisdiction. In Europe especially, public employees, together with recipients of public services, probably have numbers on their side. They are certainly better organised, via their trade unions, and they are political donors too. As French workers have often shown, public-sector unions can intimidate governments with strikes and demonstrations. Their Greek brethren have been trying to emulate them. The case for cuts
Experience suggests that governments should focus on spending cuts rather than tax increases. An NBER study of 1996 concluded that ""fiscal adjustments which rely primarily on spending cuts and the government wage bill have a better chance of being successful and are expansionary. On the contrary, fiscal adjustments which rely primarily on tax increases and cuts in public investment tend not to last and are contractionary."" A paper by Antonio Afonso of the European Central Bank and Davide Furceri of the OECD found that increases in government spending as a proportion of GDP tended to be correlated with slower economic growth. And a paper published by Policy Exchange, a right-of-centre British think-tank, concluded that successful debt consolidations had put 80% of the emphasis on spending cuts (see table).
Some of the more successful deficit-cutting programmes were accompanied by falls in inflation and interest rates. These made it easier for economies to rebound and helped shore up governments' electoral support. But today inflation is already low, as are most countries' bond yields. So cutting spending may not bring much reward from the markets in the shape of lower interest rates. Yet the thought that spending might not be cut may bring punishment in the form of higher ones.
Cutting public spending is, however, a hard slog. Spending on welfare rises automatically in a recession; pension payments continue to grow as the population ages. Western countries used the end of the cold war to slash defence budgets in the 1990s, but given continued military action in Afghanistan and the threat of terrorism, further big reductions are hard to envisage. Nor are there the easy, one-off gains to be made through privatisation of big industries pioneered in Britain in the 1980s under Margaret Thatcher.
Barack Obama's promise to freeze discretionary spending (excluding defence and homeland security) saves $250 billion over ten years--not much when annual deficits are $1 trillion or more. So government will have to tackle much more politically sensitive areas. Changes to Social Security (pensions), which are not part of discretionary spending, are likely to form part of any fiscal reform in America. Should the Conservatives win the British election, they may change eligibility for welfare payments.
Many governments have boxed themselves in by rewarding their own supporters with jobs or subsidies. In Greece, the right-wing New Democracy party came to power in 2004 pledging a liberalisation of the economy. When it left office in 2009, it had more civil servants than when it started. Such ""clientilism"" tends to lead to an ever bigger presence for the state in the economy, with more and more citizens depending on the government for employment and income. These people then vote in favour of the status quo. It may take a crisis to force governments to act in ways that hurt their core supporters. 
When a crisis does occur, the markets tend to insist on public-expenditure cuts as a kind of test of the government's machismo. In a recent paper Ms Reinhart and Mr Rogoff say: ""Even countries that are committed to fully repaying their debts are forced to dramatically tighten fiscal policy in order to appear credible to investors and thereby reduce risk premia.""
Governments may thus find their political decisions driven by the need to keep markets onside. That is why the choice is so stark for the southern European countries, which are tied into the single-currency zone. No longer do these countries have the option of devaluing their currencies, which they have resorted to many times in the past. Nor can they combine tighter fiscal policy with loose monetary policy, because they do not control the latter. Voters or creditors?
If the cuts demanded are particularly painful, governments may simply be unwilling to bear the political cost of pushing them through. A classic example occurred in 1931 when Britain was trying to remain on the gold standard. The then Labour government was told that cuts in the budget deficit, in particular unemployment benefits, were required to appease the markets; otherwise the Bank of England's gold reserves would run out in two weeks. The cabinet split. Ramsay Macdonald, the prime minister, took charge of a (largely Conservative) coalition and has been reviled in left-wing circles ever since. And after all that effort, the austerity plan failed to do the trick; Britain left the gold standard within months.
The 1931 episode was viewed in Labour Party history as a ""bankers' ramp"" in which financiers tried to bounce a government into hurting the poor. Modern governments can also be tempted to blame ""speculators"", a category covering everyone from bankers to hedge-fund managers, for their own failings. The idea that creditors might be concerned about the governments' ability to pay their debts--and thus insist on a higher interest rate--seems to be hard for politicians to accept. At the Davos economic forum in January George Papandreou, Greece's prime minister, said: ""This is an attack on the euro zone by certain other interests, political or financial, and often countries are being used as the weak link, if you like, of the euro zone.""
Even so, the Greek government has accepted that its deficit needs to be trimmed. In the politics of deficit reduction Mr Papandreou has some crucial advantages: opinion polls suggest that Greeks accept the need for austerity; he won a substantial election victory last year; the opposition is being supportive; and his Pasok party has strong links with the trade unions. It may be easier for a left-wing party to push through budget cuts.
Supportive social cohesion may explain Sweden's successful fiscal tightening after the banking crisis of the early 1990s. The Social Democratic government turned a budget deficit of 9.3% of GDP in 1994 into a surplus of 1.2% by 1998. Spending fell by more than five percentage points as a proportion of GDP and tax revenues rose by almost as much. Growth averaged 3.2% in 1994-98 and unemployment was lower at the end than at the start--surely a political as well as an economic boon.
Politics within the government can help or hinder deficit reduction. Canada had three failed attempts at fiscal reform before a successful austerity programme was unveiled in the Liberal Party's budget in 1995. Earlier efforts had been blocked by government departments. On the fourth attempt departments were encouraged to suggest sacrifices--and told that budgets would be cut by 10% across the board if they failed to agree. Cuts were made in several areas, including defence, farm subsidies and unemployment benefits. The budget went from a deficit of 6.7% of GDP in 1994 to a small surplus in 1997.
It may be that tax hikes, particularly for the better off, are politically necessary to ensure popular acceptance that pain is being shared. But big tax increases can do economic damage. In the 1990s some of the more remarkable success stories were associated with countries that reduced taxes in order to attract business and capital. Ireland, which became known as the Celtic tiger because of its growth rate, has a corporate-tax rate of just 12.5% and chose not to raise it when it tightened its belt last year.
The corporate-tax trend over the last 30 years has been remorselessly downward. A survey by Robert Carroll of American University in Washington, DC, found that the top rate in OECD countries (excluding America) had fallen from 51% in the early 1980s to 32% by 2009 (see chart on the previous page). If businesses are attracted by low taxes, they may leave if rates rise. 
High-tax European governments have complained in the past about competition from countries like Ireland; the current crisis may lead to more calls for co-ordination of tax policies. Indeed, many countries will be raising taxes simultaneously, which may reduce the temptation for businesses to shift. Much depends on where countries start; it should be easier for those with lower tax burdens to increase their take.
High earners can also be mobile. So many French professionals moved to London in the past decade that Nicolas Sarkozy, France's president, pleaded with them (and offered tax deals) to come back. Britain is gradually losing its appeal to high-earning foreigners. Calculations by PricewaterhouseCoopers, an accounting firm, show that British authorities will take a bigger tax bite out of the pay packet of a married executive earning Pounds 250,000 ($373,000) than any other G20 nation except Italy.
The need for countries to maximise their take from their citizens has caused a renewed interest in preventing tax evasion. Countries in the G20 have been pushing hard for low-tax countries such as Switzerland to provide information on foreign depositors. Nevertheless, there are plenty of legitimate ways for businesses and individuals to move to countries with more favourable tax regimes.
So the temptation will be to impose taxes that will be difficult to escape, in particular sales or value-added taxes. The political drawback of such levies is that they fall more heavily on the poor than the rich. This will be unpopular, especially because many people regard this crisis as the fault of high-earning bankers. Furthermore, if higher taxes eat into demand, economies may slip back into recession. A Japanese consumption-tax increase in 1997 is still blamed for derailing its recovery.
European governments have accordingly produced a mix of measures in their austerity packages. Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain have all promised to attack the public-sector wage bill by cutting or freezing wages or by reducing the number of staff. Greece announced a new round of cuts on March 3rd. But the packages have also contained tax rises (motorway tolls in Portugal, fuel taxes in Greece) and assaults on tax evasion.
In Greece, tax evasion seems to be rife among the professional classes, with very few citizens declaring high incomes; one response from the government has been to try to encourage the use of receipts. High earners claiming the personal tax allowance of EUR 12,000 ($16,270) will need to provide receipts of at least that value. 
Despite this attempt to spread the pain, the Greek government has been confronted with a wave of strikes by public-sector workers. Governments can use outside financial pressure as an excuse to push through reforms that might otherwise be politically unacceptable. But it is a fine balance. Voters may be more resistant if harsh measures are seen as being dictated by foreigners, whether from the EU or the IMF. The people aren't revolting
Lord Salisbury, a British prime minister, and other 19th-century conservatives feared that democracy would lead to the overthrow of private property rights. Debtors tend to outnumber creditors, and thus can outvote them.
Such pessimism has yet to be proved right. Sometimes, irresistible force meets immovable object. In California, for instance, voters have the right to vote on specific fiscal policies in referendums. The result has been a cap on taxes with no apparent limit on spending. Iceland is about to provide a specific test of this theory in a referendum, in which voters are being asked to accept or reject the terms for compensating foreign depositors in failed Icelandic banks.
However, the efforts of Canada and Sweden suggest progress can be made, if the crisis is acute enough. And dictatorships are unlikely to be better than democracies. Military regimes in Latin America (except Chile) had poor economic records; they saw the state as a source of cushy jobs for officers and subsidies for arms factories. In addition, their very lack of legitimacy may tempt autocracies to bribe influential sections of the electorate.
Nevertheless, democracies face awkward decisions in the years ahead. One of the biggest problems is pensions, which will dwarf the cost of the recent bank bail-out. When state pensions were introduced in 1889 by Otto von Bismarck, the German chancellor, life expectancy was 45; the idea was to provide an income for those who simply could not work any longer. Women who make it to 65 these days can expect 20 years of retirement.
Even that tricky calculation relies on people working to 65 in the first place. Many employers, particularly in the public sector, developed the habit of letting workers retire in their late 50s or early 60s. Germans, who will soon face a state retirement age of 67, will resent being asked to bail out Greeks, who are only just being asked to work to 63.
In Britain, most public-sector workers are still members of final-salary, or defined-benefit, schemes, whereas new employees in private companies are usually placed in defined-contribution schemes with uncertain benefits. The difference in cost may be as much as 30% of payroll. 
Raising the retirement age, probably to 70, and cutting the public-sector pension bill will deliver only modest savings in the short run, but will immensely improve the long-term picture. It will, however, be staggeringly unpopular. The proportion of the population in or nearing retirement is increasing; and older people are much more likely to vote than younger citizens. Without reform, however, those apathetic young voters face a crippling tax burden.
There are many battles over deficits to come: taxpayers against public-sector workers; old against young. Well-chosen policies that foster growth may make them less fierce. They may be bloody even so.","Increasing budget deficits and rising government debts are likely to entail fierce political battles -- not least between taxpayers and public - sector workers

Iceland is about to provide a specific test of this theory in a referendum , in which voters are being asked to accept or reject the terms for compensating foreign depositors in failed Icelandic banks . 
 However , the efforts of Canada and Sweden suggest progress can be made , if the crisis is acute enough . And dictatorships are unlikely to be better than democracies . Military regimes in Latin America ( except Chile ) had poor economic records ; they saw the state as a source of cushy jobs for officers and subsidies for arms factories . In addition , their very lack of legitimacy may tempt autocracies to bribe influential sections of the electorate . 
 Nevertheless , democracies face awkward decisions in the years ahead . One of the biggest problems is pensions , which will dwarf the cost of the recent bank bail - out . When state pensions were introduced in 1889 by Otto von Bismarck , the German chancellor , life expectancy was 45 ; the idea was to provide an income for those who simply could not work any longer . Women who make it to 65 these days can expect 20 years of retirement . 
 Even that tricky calculation relies on people working to 65 in the first place . Many employers , particularly in the public sector , developed the habit of letting workers retire in their late 50s or early 60s . Germans , who will soon face a state retirement age of 67 , will resent being asked to bail out Greeks , who are only just being asked to work to 63 . 
 In Britain , most public - sector workers are still members of final - salary , or defined - benefit , schemes , whereas new employees in private companies are usually placed in defined - contribution schemes with uncertain benefits . The difference in cost may be as much as 30 % of payroll . 
 Raising the retirement age , probably to 70 , and cutting the public - sector pension bill will deliver only modest savings in the short run , but will immensely improve the long - term picture . It will , however , be staggeringly unpopular . The proportion of the population in or nearing retirement is increasing ; and older people are much more likely to vote than younger citizens . Without reform , however , those apathetic young voters face a crippling tax burden . 
 There are many battles over deficits to come : taxpayers against public - sector workers ; old against young . Well - chosen policies that foster growth may make them less fierce . They may be bloody even so .",350,Greece,A30-94,IN TERM,True,"George Papandreou , Greece 's prime minister ,",4,True

GREECE had a budget deficit of 12.7% of GDP in 2009. It has a record of dodgy accounting. Its own leaders acknowledge how dire its fiscal situation is. George Papaconstantinou, the country's finance minister, summed it up pretty well last month. ""People think we are in a terrible mess. And we are."" 
That hasn't stopped his boss, George Papandreou, and other European leaders from jabbing fingers elsewhere. To judge by this week's political rhetoric, the blame for Greece's woes lies largely with speculators, who stand accused of buying sovereign credit-default swaps (CDSs), a form of insurance against government default, in the hope of profiting from jitters about sovereign debt. ""Unprincipled speculators are making billions every day by betting on a Greek default,"" said Mr Papandreou in a speech in Washington, DC. 
The wheels of policy are now turning. The European Commission has said it will examine the case for banning ""naked"" sovereign CDSs, in which buyers of protection on government debt do not actually own any of the underlying bonds. A European ban would not do much good on its own: trading would simply move to other markets. The official American response to Mr Papandreou has been tepid. But the issue is on the G20's radar. The Financial Stability Board, which is co-ordinating international financial reform, thinks that tighter rules are likely.
Some reform of the market for sovereign CDSs is needed. Like other credit-default swaps, there is a strong case for moving these over-the-counter instruments on to central clearing-houses, which stand between buyers and sellers and reduce counterparty risk. Sensible changes of this kind are already in train in Europe and America. But the idea that speculators are to blame for Greece's troubles is wrong-headed, and the solution of banning naked sovereign CDSs is even worse.
First, the diagnosis. The case against buyers of sovereign CDSs is that by driving up the price of insuring against default, they cause spreads on underlying cash bonds to widen, making borrowing more expensive and bringing default--and a big payout--closer. That drives up the price of insurance further, setting the cycle in motion again. The problem with this analysis is that the tail is far too puny to wag the dog. There are $9 billion of net Greek sovereign CDSs outstanding, compared with more than $400 billion of Greek government bonds. It is a similar story in other countries under pressure. According to the Bank for International Settlements, the proportion of net CDS positions to government debt is highest in Portugal, at just 5%. Moreover, CDS and bond prices have tended to move together, rather than one driving the other. Naked self-interest
Even so, surely it cannot be right for people who do not own any government debt to profit from sovereign distress? Actually, it can. When states get into trouble, other borrowers suffer too: taxes rise, economies slow. So investors in Greek companies have legitimate reason to protect themselves against Greek sovereign risk. If they cannot, they will simply charge companies a higher risk premium instead. Buyers of protection also have to find sellers--banks, say, or hedge funds. But sellers want to offload their risk as well. If sellers are not allowed to buy protection themselves, investors will find it harder to hedge. If so, banning naked CDSs could end up making it more expensive for governments to borrow. 
There is a long tradition of shooting messengers who bring bad news. But the simple explanation for rising borrowing costs--Greece's finances are tatty--makes far more sense than the complex, politically convenient one. The sovereign-CDS debate is a smokescreen to obscure an unpalatable truth.","Blaming speculators for sovereign - debt woes is misguided . Banning them would be worse

NOT even Greece's diplomats will be spared the cuts in pay and allowances imposed by George Papandreou's Socialist government in its struggle to curb public spending. Just before this week's European Union summit in Brussels, staff stopped work for four hours to protest outside the neoclassical foreign ministry. ""Altogether we're facing a 30% cut in income. That's really not acceptable,"" said the diplomats' well-dressed spokesman.
The mood gets gloomier with each round of cuts. Two rises in excise duties on fuel, alcohol and cigarettes in under three months have caused grumbling. On March 24th a bill arrived in parliament aimed at cracking down on tax evasion by Greek companies as well as the self-employed. Doctors, lawyers and taxi-drivers will all have to issue VAT receipts; electronic systems for cross-checking returns will be upgraded. High-earners will have to pay more income tax. Yet many doubt if the tax overhaul will produce anything like the EUR 2.7 billion ($3.5 billion) of extra income the finance ministry wants without a thorough clean-out of the notoriously corrupt tax administration.
Pension reform is likely to make Greeks crosser still. The retirement age will rise from 58 (on average) to 65 for both men and women, bringing Greece into line with other EU countries. The number of female civil servants applying for early retirement has already jumped by 25% this year. The government wants to trim the public-sector payroll, but its most productive workers are often women in their 40s and 50s. ""It's the most efficient female colleagues who are lining up to leave,"" says an official at the civil-service union. 
The economy is likely to shrink this year by at least 2%, after a 2% contraction in 2009. That compares with the government's previous ""worst-case"" forecast of 0.8%. Unemployment is now close to 11%. Bank lending may rise this year by less than 3%. Among cash-strapped family-run companies, gloom is turning into pessimism. A survey published on March 22nd said that one-third of small-business owners in Athens and the surrounding region fear they may have to close down in the next three years.
The good news for Mr Papandreou is that, so far, his approval ratings have held up. More than two-thirds of Greeks accept that tough measures are necessary, say the polls. That makes it easier for the government to stick to the timetable agreed with Brussels for reforms. Mr Papandreou has pushed through three austerity plans in the past four months in response to prodding from the European Commission and from Greece's euro-area partners. Even the European Central Bank has praised its efforts to sort out the public finances.
Yet without a firmer offer of financial assistance from other euro-area countries and perhaps the IMF, the gain from belt-tightening measures could easily be swallowed in higher borrowing costs. Greece's debt may be on an unsustainable path whatever it does (
). That is why the government has been losing patience with German dithering on support measures, and occasionally threatening to go to the IMF instead. If interest rates on its bonds remain at twice German levels, Greece could face a borrowing crunch next month--and the gloom could then turn into outright anger.","Gloom today may turn into anger tomorrow

GEORGE PAPANDREOU may have spoken too soon. On April 6th, just three days after the Greek prime minister claimed ""the worst is over,"" the yield on Greek ten-year government bonds leapt from 6.5% to above 7%. Yields remain at alarming levels. On April 7th the spread over their German equivalents stood at more than four percentage points, the highest since Greece joined the euro in 2001. The D-word (default) is increasingly on the lips of analysts. The cost of insuring Greece's bonds surpassed that of Iceland's this week; Greek banks have asked to tap a government liquidity scheme. Far from coming to an end, the Greek debt crisis seems scarcely to have begun.
On the face of it, this week's renewed bond-market jitters were caused by growing doubts that an emergency-aid package patched together by European Union leaders last month offers Greece much help. Under the terms of the EU deal, any short-term support would have to be approved by all of the 16 countries in the euro zone. German anger at Greece's profligacy could easily delay the cash it would need should bond markets close.
Any rescue package would be co-financed by the IMF, which may be good for EUR 12 billion ($16 billion) of swift support. But the stipulation, insisted on by Germany, that EU cash would only be furnished at near-market rates meant the deal failed to provide an interest-rate ceiling for Greece's public debt, leaving the country to suffer every turn in market sentiment. Senior EU sources say a formula is being discussed to address this flaw. The interest- rate benchmark would be set over a long period, so it would not be unduly influenced by immediate market stresses. Rates paid by countries with a credit rating similar to Greece's would also be a factor. 
Optimists are still confident that the government can raise enough funds in the next six weeks to stave off default, though at a high cost. The government has more than EUR 13 billion in cash, enough to refinance maturing debt and fund the budget deficit during April. It needs to raise another EUR 10 billion-12 billion in May. The likely borrowing requirement for the remainder of the year, around EUR 25 billion, is spread more evenly. ""If we can get over the May borrowing hump, it's a relatively smooth cruise for the rest of the year,"" says one trader in Athens.
That is a big ""if"", say pessimists. In the six months since the Socialists were elected, spreads have jumped by more than two percentage points. Greece can no longer risk holding an auction for a new issue of bonds for fear that it fails. Its Public Debt Management Agency has resorted to syndicated-bond sales managed by big international banks. But the pools of spare cash that Greece can tap seem to be drying up.
Subscriptions for a new seven-year bond on March 29th reached only EUR 6.2 billion, just above the target of EUR 5 billion. Two previous issues this year were heavily oversubscribed, even if the investors who were allocated bonds are now cursing their luck. On March 30th Greece failed for the first time to raise a targeted amount when it offered a fresh slug of an existing, but illiquid, 20-year bond. In an auction restricted to local market-makers just EUR 390m was subscribed against a target of EUR 1bn. The bond was reopened in part to accommodate hedge funds that wanted to cover short positions. Some may subsequently have bought the bonds they needed more cheaply elsewhere. But for many observers this was a clear signal that Greece will need a bail-out soon.
George Papaconstantinou, the finance minister, plans to lead a roadshow to America in the last ten days of April. He hopes to persuade American investors, including emerging-market funds, to buy $5 billion-10 billion worth of a new dollar-denominated bond. It would be a heavy irony if Greece, a member of the euro club, were temporarily reprieved by loans in dollars. But the fear is that investors will stick to buying the bonds of genuine emerging markets, which have much more solid growth prospects. 
It is not yet clear what Greece's fallback plan will be if American demand is weak. ""The roadshow will be decisive. If it doesn't fly, the alternative is either a wave of T-bill issues at very high interest rates, or a rescue package,"" says a senior Greek banker. Mr Papaconstantinou insists that Greece does not plan to fall back on support from the EU and IMF. But he also accepts that the government cannot go on borrowing at such high interest rates. 
Even at lower interest rates, however, Greece will struggle to keep borrowing. Previous analysis of the country's debt dynamics by The Economist, based on fairly benign assumptions, concluded that Greece's public debt would stabilise above 150% of its GDP. That burden is probably too much to bear for a small country with such ropy economic prospects: it also implies that a much bigger bail-out pot is needed than the one currently being mooted. Some buyers of Greek debt may still think the interest rewards on offer are worth the default risk, but they seem to be a diminishing band. The bigger worry for Greece is not its immediate funding hump, but that investors are starting to lose faith that the country will be able to sustain its growing indebtedness.","Worries about Greece 's ability to roll over its maturing debt are giving way to bigger fears

SADLY the words Cyprus and conflict seem inextricably linked. The island has been divided for over 35 years despite many rounds of settlement talks. So the election on April 18th of a hardline Turkish-Cypriot president, Dervish Eroglu, might look like just another episode in a never-ending saga.
Yet, even by Cyprus's dismal standards, the repercussions of Mr Eroglu's victory are serious (
). He has ousted Mehmet Ali Talat, the most pro-settlement leader the Turkish-Cypriots have had. Mr Eroglu is against the idea of a ""bizonal, bicommunal federation"", which has been the basis of all Cyprus talks since 1977. He barely knows the Greek-Cypriot president, Demetris Christofias, and speaks almost no English. In contrast, Mr Talat and Mr Christofias were not just pro-settlement but also old trade-union friends and fluent in English. Cypriots on both sides, as well as the United Nations negotiators patiently trying to bring them together, have good reason to ask: if these two were unable to solve the conflict, and Mr Talat was ejected by Turkish-Cypriot voters after 18 months of talks, what chance will anybody else have?
It would be wrong to see this as an issue of only local interest. Cyprus casts a shadow across Europe. In May 2004 the European Union foolishly admitted the (Greek-Cypriot) Republic of Cyprus even though Greek-Cypriot voters had rejected the UN's Annan plan for unification. As a member, Cyprus has played a destructive role, undermining both the EU's efforts to help the Turkish-Cypriots, who voted for the Annan plan, and Turkey's membership talks. Because Turkey is in NATO (but not the EU) and Cyprus is in the EU (but not NATO) these two organisations find it hard to work together. In search of a solution
What should be done? It is tempting to give up trying to resolve the conflict altogether. Nobody is being killed because of the island's division. Crossing the ""green line"" has become far easier in recent years. And, as the election of Mr Eroglu suggests, de facto partition suits many on both sides. Turkey may jib at the annual subsidy, worth some $600m a year, that it has to pay the isolated north. But the Turkish army is happy to have a place to garrison and train a large number of soldiers.
Yet, however frustrating Cyprus may be, it would be wrong to abandon it. Experience suggests that the Greek-Cypriots and Turkish-Cypriots will not solve their conflict alone. To leave their dispute to fester would be bad for the Turkish-Cypriots, whose unrecognised republic is denied direct trade and transport links with the world; bad for the Greek-Cypriots, who face a large Turkish army in the north and have lost territory and property; and damaging to the whole island's economy, especially its tourist industry. Moreover, it is hard to see how Turkey can ever join the EU without a settlement in Cyprus, since it would first have to recognise the Greek-Cypriot government and abandon the Turkish-Cypriots. Indeed, France and Germany shamelessly use Cyprus as another excuse to keep Turkey out.
There are three ways to revive hopes of a Cyprus settlement. First, Turkey's government, which pays Mr Eroglu's bills, must press him to restart the talks where Mr Talat left off. This will be hard. But it will help that the uncharismatic Mr Eroglu does not have much of a following in Turkey itself. Second, the Turkish prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, must find a way of talking directly to the Greek-Cypriots. This is delicate, because he cannot be seen to go behind Mr Eroglu's back. His best shot would be to use the good offices of Greece's prime minister, George Papandreou, whom Mr Erdogan will meet in Athens next month. A joint demarche by the Greek and Turkish governments could do much to offset the damage of Mr Eroglu's arrival on the scene.
However the biggest problem is not on the Turkish-Cypriot side, but the lack of pressure on the Greek-Cypriots to make concessions. Mr Papandreou may be able to help with this as well. But an even more promising possibility is a potential initiative from Brussels.
A regulation to allow direct EU trade with northern Cyprus has been blocked by the Cypriot government ever since 2004. Now, under an obscure article of the Lisbon treaty, it is being revived in the European Parliament. If it passes, it could be approved by a majority vote of EU governments, clearing the way for the Turks to drop their refusal to open Turkish ports and airports to trade with the Greek-Cypriots. If such an EU manoeuvre were to end the economic isolation of the Turkish-Cypriots, the pressure on the Greek-Cypriots to push harder for a settlement would rise--and the long saga of the Cyprus conflict might just reach a satisfactory ending after all.","The world's most complicated island has just got even trickier.

Cypriots on both sides, as well as the United Nations negotiators patiently trying to bring them together, have good reason to ask: if these two were unable to solve the conflict, and Mr Talat was ejected by Turkish-Cypriot voters after 18 months of talks, what chance will anybody else have?
It would be wrong to see this as an issue of only local interest. Cyprus casts a shadow across Europe. In May 2004 the European Union foolishly admitted the (Greek-Cypriot) Republic of Cyprus even though Greek-Cypriot voters had rejected the UN's Annan plan for unification. As a member, Cyprus has played a destructive role, undermining both the EU's efforts to help the Turkish-Cypriots, who voted for the Annan plan, and Turkey's membership talks. Because Turkey is in NATO (but not the EU) and Cyprus is in the EU (but not NATO) these two organisations find it hard to work together. In search of a solution
What should be done? It is tempting to give up trying to resolve the conflict altogether. Nobody is being killed because of the island's division. Crossing the ""green line"" has become far easier in recent years. And, as the election of Mr Eroglu suggests, de facto partition suits many on both sides. Turkey may jib at the annual subsidy, worth some $600m a year, that it has to pay the isolated north. But the Turkish army is happy to have a place to garrison and train a large number of soldiers.
Yet, however frustrating Cyprus may be, it would be wrong to abandon it. Experience suggests that the Greek-Cypriots and Turkish-Cypriots will not solve their conflict alone. To leave their dispute to fester would be bad for the Turkish-Cypriots, whose unrecognised republic is denied direct trade and transport links with the world; bad for the Greek-Cypriots, who face a large Turkish army in the north and have lost territory and property; and damaging to the whole island's economy, especially its tourist industry. Moreover, it is hard to see how Turkey can ever join the EU without a settlement in Cyprus, since it would first have to recognise the Greek-Cypriot government and abandon the Turkish-Cypriots. Indeed, France and Germany shamelessly use Cyprus as another excuse to keep Turkey out.
There are three ways to revive hopes of a Cyprus settlement. First, Turkey's government, which pays Mr Eroglu's bills, must press him to restart the talks where Mr Talat left off. This will be hard. But it will help that the uncharismatic Mr Eroglu does not have much of a following in Turkey itself. Second, the Turkish prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, must find a way of talking directly to the Greek-Cypriots. This is delicate, because he cannot be seen to go behind Mr Eroglu's back. His best shot would be to use the good offices of Greece's prime minister, George Papandreou, whom Mr Erdogan will meet in Athens next month. A joint demarche by the Greek and Turkish governments could do much to offset the damage of Mr Eroglu's arrival on the scene.
However the biggest problem is not on the Turkish-Cypriot side, but the lack of pressure on the Greek-Cypriots to make concessions. Mr Papandreou may be able to help with this as well. But an even more promising possibility is a potential initiative from Brussels.
A regulation to allow direct EU trade with northern Cyprus has been blocked by the Cypriot government ever since 2004. Now, under an obscure article of the Lisbon treaty, it is being revived in the European Parliament. If it passes, it could be approved by a majority vote of EU governments, clearing the way for the Turks to drop their refusal to open Turkish ports and airports to trade with the Greek-Cypriots. If such an EU manoeuvre were to end the economic isolation of the Turkish-Cypriots, the pressure on the Greek-Cypriots to push harder for a settlement would rise--and the long saga of the Cyprus conflict might just reach a satisfactory ending after all.",350,Greece,A30-94,,False,,0,True

ANGELA MERKEL'S political credibility has not yet been downgraded to junk status, but the past few days have done it no good at all. A few weeks ago the German chancellor was basking in plaudits for taking a hard line against a European bail-out of Greece. That was before George Papandreou, the Greek prime minister, bowed to the inevitable on April 23rd and asked for the EUR 30 billion ($40 billion) loan pledged by Greece's euro-zone partners, of which Germany's share is about EUR 8 billion. A further slice, of perhaps EUR 15 billion, may come from the IMF.
Now Mrs Merkel is under fire both from those who had praised her and from those who now blame her for dragging out the rescue, further destabilising financial markets and raising the ultimate cost of the bail-out. Reported politicians' estimates of the whole bill have soared to EUR 120 billion and far beyond, with a correspondingly greater contribution from Germany.
Many Germans feel they are being forced to choose between two basic principles of their post-war economic order: economic stability and integration within Europe. They gave up the D-mark in 1999 on the understanding that the euro would be equally stable and that German taxpayers would not have to pay for other members' mistakes. The impending bail-out of Greece--and perhaps later of Portugal and even Spain--would mean the end of that bargain. A Greek bail-out would no doubt face a challenge in Germany's constitutional court. But to withhold aid would endanger the currency and rattle the banks, some of them German, with billions of euros' worth of Greek debt on their books. 
The crisis could not have come at a politically more awkward moment. On May 9th elections will be held in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state. There, a coalition of the Christian Democratic Union and the liberal Free Democratic Party, the same alliance that Mrs Merkel leads in Berlin, is fighting an uphill battle to remain in office. A loss would cost her government its majority in the Bundesrat, the upper house of the legislature. But the perception that she is dragging out the process to avoid irritating voters is also damaging her credibility both at home and abroad. 
Now the process seems to have shifted into higher gear. On April 28th the chiefs of the IMF and the European Central Bank met German parliamentary leaders in Berlin. The finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, says the government could agree on legislation by May 3rd and get it through the parliament by May 7th. Voters in North Rhine-Westphalia will then decide whether to punish Mrs Merkel. 
If Germans resent having to bail out the Greeks, the Greeks dislike the terms on which the rest of the euro zone and the IMF will come to their aid. The official jobless rate has risen to more than 11%, but that fails to take into account many women reluctant to register as unemployed. 
Things are about to become more difficult. A three-year reform programme being put together by the imf, the European Commission and the ECB aims to cut the budget deficit from 13.6% to 2.7% of GDP in just three years, an ambitious target in a shrinking economy. A new pensions law, which is due to be adopted in May, will raise the retirement age for both men and women and reduce the pensions paid by state-controlled corporations. Applications by civil servants to take early retirement under the existing scheme have already jumped by 30%.
The overstaffed public sector will be severely pruned. No one is certain how many jobs will go. But if the programme is rigorously implemented, more than 100,000 Greek public-sector workers will be put out of work by 2013--by a government that came to power promising ""more social protection"".
So far, resignation not fury has marked street protests organised by trade unions and the Greek communist party. Fortunately for Mr Papandreou, his Panhellenic Socialist Movement, known as Pasok, dominates both ADEDY, the umbrella public-sector union, and GSEE, its private-sector partner. But the austerity measures the government adopted before the crisis reached boiling point--civil service pay cuts and a hiring freeze--are only just beginning to bite. Infighting in both unions is on the rise; small private-sector unions have already broken ranks and other hardliners are likely to gain ground. 
Opinion polls suggest more than 60% of Greeks oppose the government's decision to call in the fund. The IMF's reputation for imposing harsh reforms, along with the partial surrender of sovereignty to an American-based institution, seems bound to make Greeks cross. Criticism of Germany, by comparison, is muted.

THE headlines this week were about riots, petrol bombs, tear gas and strikes. In Athens demonstrators stormed up to the steps of the parliament building, where an austerity plan was about to be debated, calling on the parliamentary ""thieves"" to come out. Three people were killed when protesters set fire to a bank. Hours later, with tear gas drifting over the adjacent square, parliamentary leaders held a brief, sombre exchange on the significance of the deaths, vowing to sustain the principle that protest must be peaceful. Many citizens agreed that it was a sad moment for the birthplace of democracy.
Yet Athenians were also saying, with wistful smiles, that, for the past ten years or so, it had been a good party. For the backdrop to the riots was that, in a mixed mood of resignation, black humour and bitterness, Greeks were bidding farewell to a decade in which everything good and bad about their country grew feverishly as money washed over it. There were sporting and cultural extravaganzas, starting with the 2004 Olympics. Archaeological sites were spruced up, spanking new buildings erected. The middle class grew larger and more sophisticated. And many people at the bottom of the pile breathed a bit easier, if only because immigrants from poorer places came to harvest their olives and work in their restaurants.
At the same time Greece's worst habits--the plundering of state coffers, the hiring of cronies, the abuse of public office, impunity for the powerful--were multiplying. A handful of Cassandras said it would all end in tears but, while the party lasted, nobody listened. Now, with the news on May 2nd of loans from the IMF and the European Union worth a total of EUR 110 billion ($145 billion), plus an austerity plan, the party is well and truly over.
Indeed, this week's riots will usher in what promises to be the rockiest period in the recent history of Greece. By slashing pay in the public sector, raising taxes and (hesitantly) starting to reform the labour market, the plan is to cut the budget deficit from 13.6% of GDP in 2009 to less than 3% by 2014. But it will deepen the recession that is already hitting Greece, with the drop in GDP in 2010 now expected to be at least 4% and a further fall forecast for 2011 (see chart on next page). 
George Papandreou, Greece's Socialist prime minister, can count on a degree of understanding from half the electorate (not all of them voters for his party) that the country faces a make-or-break moment in which wrenching change is the only alternative to outright disaster. He can also take comfort because the centre-right opposition, New Democracy, is in quarrelsome disarray as the full extent of its mismanagement in 2004-09 becomes obvious. But will that be enough? Even those who accept that Greece's problems are largely self-made are depressed by an austerity plan that seems to offer so little hope for the medium term, and will punish many hard-working and modestly paid ordinary Greeks. 
And there is a hotheaded minority, at least, that does not believe the government when it says it had no choice. Mikis Theodorakis, Greece's most famous composer, expressed the visceral reaction of many when he said the crisis was probably a plot by dark forces in America and other capitalist centres to subdue proud, independent nations. Crazy as such talk may sound to euro-zone governments that believe they have strained every muscle to save Greece from collapse, it will convince some people in a country where conspiracy theories (and, indeed, conspiracies) have a long history.
Greek politics still includes a Communist Party that is rigorously Stalinist (it damns Khrushchev as a liberal backslider) and commands some 8% of the vote. There is an emerging party of religious-nationalist far-rightists under the acronym LAOS (the Greek word for people), which has tried to gain respectability by accepting the need for tough measures, but still stands to gain from the ferment. So do groups of malcontents even further removed from the political mainstream. 
Not for the first time, the IMF and the EU will be cast as lightning-rods for xenophobic anger. In the radical press and on the internet, the IMF is already being called a junta, comparable to the colonels who took power in 1967 with the connivance (most Greeks believe) of the United States. That Greece invoked IMF help in late April, just after the anniversary of the April 21st 1967 coup, is seen by some in the Helleno-blogosphere as confirmation that the country faces a new period of foreign-backed despotism. 
Such talk resonates in Greece. Throughout its 200-year history, the role of foreign powers has generated red-hot passion. Protagonists in Greece's internal quarrels have long invoked external assistance, while furiously denouncing any foreign help given to their rivals. During the right-left civil war of 1946-49, each side reserved particular loathing for its foe's foreign backers, American or Soviet. Dimitris Livanios, a historian, says that the idea of a manipulating ""foreign finger"" is a recurring motif in Greek affairs. 
The unprecedented prosperity enjoyed by most Greeks during the past decade helped to disguise some sentiments that were never far below the surface: ultra-leftism (including the violent sort which spills over into terrorism), ultra-nationalism and xenophobia. Such feelings may now be unleashed. The government claims some successes in rounding up a small ultra-leftist group of urban guerrillas called ""Revolutionary Struggle"". But there are palpable fears that austerity and riots will now spawn a new generation of self-styled Robin Hoods practising both political and criminal violence.
Meanwhile, cooler-headed Greeks are racking their brains for ways to regain the economy's lost competitiveness and make better use of Greece's abundant human and natural assets. Much of the growth over the past decade reflected the windfall of cheap euro interest rates, which stoked an exuberant consumer market, complete with smart cars, foreign travel and personal trainers. All this will contract sharply now.
What about tourism, Greece's mainstay? Some Greek islands have been overbuilt by Athenians taking advantage of corrupt planning laws, but all over the mainland there are villages in beautiful settings that are decaying for want of anybody ready to refit handsome stone houses and attract year-round visitors. There, at least, is an opportunity. But there can be no devaluation to make Greece a newly cheap destination, and harsh new taxes on business included in the government's austerity plan may kill the entrepreneurial spirit of those bold enough to try new things. New taxes on business and property will also limit the attractiveness of state assets that the government may want to sell to raise revenue, notes Stefanos Manos, a former finance minister.
There is also a well-founded suspicion that light-fingered bureaucrats and greedy politicians, the very people who caused the crisis, should be held to account but won't be. President Carolos Papoulias, a soft-spoken leftist whose office is meant to be above politics, reacted to the austerity plan with a one-sentence call for people who robbed the state coffers to be punished. Many agreed. ""The wage and spending cuts will be implemented with great efficiency, but with our chaotic justice system, the pursuit of tax-dodgers and bribe-takers will just run into the sand,"" predicted an Athenian architect.
""It's all very well for Papandreou to compare himself to Odysseus making a long, heroic voyage,"" read one electronic message doing the rounds between Athenian offices this week. ""But Odysseus had a miserable journey and lost all his companions. And he washed up on Ithaca without any clothes on."" At street level, sentiments are even less poetic. ""We do not recognise this debt,"" was the slogan of the militant trade unions, from teachers to dockers, that went on strike this week. The number of Greeks who believe in Bolshevik-style autarky may be small. But the idea of working hard for years just to win an IMF/EU certificate of good behaviour holds little appeal. 
Either in fear or in hope, many Greeks detect a breakdown of a political system, over a century old, in which two political groups (notionally of the centre-left and the centre-right, but both given to patronage and graft) progressively exhaust the national exchequer by outbidding each other. After the post-party riots, it is anybody's guess what might take its place.","Greeks greet another government austerity plan , and an IMF / EU rescue package , with riots and violence

SINCE feudal days, subjects have hoped that petitioning the sovereign can have great effects. E-mail made writing to politicians easy. Now a new technology is making those missives public. Twitter messages (""tweets"" in the jargon) are like public telegrams. No more than 140 characters in length, they can be sent from any computer or mobile phone. Anyone with an account (there are 100m and rising) can send a public message to anyone else by placing the @ sign before a username or a # sign before a topic.
That makes it much easier for voters to reach politicians and for politicians to react to them (or at least to pretend to). It helps election organisers too. At its height Barack Obama's campaign (@barackobama) employed 100 staff working on social media such as Twitter. But now it is catching on elsewhere. In July just four of the world's top 20 cities for Twitter use were outside America, according to HubSpot, a marketing firm. By January it had grown to eight.
Sebastian Pinera, the newly elected president of Chile, has asked all cabinet members to start tweeting. His own account is now the most-followed in the country. Venezuala's Hugo Chavez tweets too (@chavezcandanga). In June only three Japanese politicians had accounts; now Politter, a site dedicated to Twitter and Japanese politics, lists 485. An analysis of last year's German elections by the University of St Gallen discovered that 577 politicians had opened Twitter accounts, three-quarters of them in 2009. Greece's prime minister George Papandreou uses Twitter. But @primeministergr is the office, not the man. His staff tweet for him, sometimes using a code to signal who wrote what. 
Twitter, says Mr Pinera's spokeswoman, Ena von Baer, means assessing reactions to announcements before presenting them in a press conference. But the scale of response makes it hard for office-holders to tweet themselves. Mr Obama reads just a select ten of the messages (20,000 of all kinds) he receives daily. During the presidential election campaign, Ms von Baer answered every message to @enavonbaer herself, but now her staff respond, or pass questions on to other ministries.
Twitter works well for extrovert and conscientious individual politicians. Denis Coderre (@deniscoderre) started using it for relief and rescue messages after the Haitian earthquake in January (his electoral district in Montreal has a big Haitian population). He writes social messages, such as commentaries on ice-hockey matches (he was a sportscaster before he became a politician). A second category is service messages for his constituents. A third is purely political. To benefit, a politician must do all of them himself, he says. But few match his talent or output. Twitter may feel personal but it is all too public. The risk is asymmetric. An ill-judged tweet can do severe, instant damage. Kerry McCarthy, a Labour candidate in Britain's election, revealed early postal-vote counts in a tweet that ended ""#gameON!"". That may have seriously breached electoral law.
As well as boosting the profile of individual politicians, Twitter may be better designed for campaigning and opposition than for governing. ""We'll change Washington"" is easy to fit into 140 characters. Explaining the messy and inevitable compromises of power is a lot harder. In January of this year a study by Fleishman Hillard, a Washington PR firm, discovered that Republicans in the House twittered more than five times as often as Democrats.

The days when tweets involved a sweaty-thumbed real-life politician giving candid thoughts on the day's events may be passing. Risk-averse politicians are likely to make their tweets bland, and bland tweeters may be less likely to be followed. Once politicians understand that everything is public, they are much less likely to offer the unadorned truth, at least to ordinary voters. William Hague, a top Tory politician, amused his followers by responding to a tweeted inquiry about the menu at a recent fast-food supper (Chicken Royale and a Fanta)--but his interrogator was not just anyone, but Bryony Gordon, a hotshot columnist for a national daily. Few subjects will ever come truly close to their sovereigns. But the impression of doing so remains tantalising.","Twitter makes politicians seem more accessible . To matter , it needs to change their behaviour 
 SINCE feudal days , subjects have hoped that petitioning the sovereign can have great effects . E - mail made writing to politicians easy . Now a new technology is making those missives public . Twitter messages ( "" tweets "" in the jargon ) are like public telegrams . No more than 140 characters in length , they can be sent from any computer or mobile phone . Anyone with an account ( there are 100 m and rising ) can send a public message to anyone else by placing the @ sign before a username or a # sign before a topic . 
 That makes it much easier for voters to reach politicians and for politicians to react to them ( or at least to pretend to ) . It helps election organisers too . At its height Barack Obama 's campaign ( @barackobama ) employed 100 staff working on social media such as Twitter . But now it is catching on elsewhere . In July just four of the world 's top 20 cities for Twitter use were outside America , according to HubSpot , a marketing firm . By January it had grown to eight . 
 Sebastian Pinera , the newly elected president of Chile , has asked all cabinet members to start tweeting . His own account is now the most - followed in the country . Venezuala 's Hugo Chavez tweets too ( @chavezcandanga ) . In June only three Japanese politicians had accounts ; now Politter , a site dedicated to Twitter and Japanese politics , lists 485 . An analysis of last year 's German elections by the University of St Gallen discovered that 577 politicians had opened Twitter accounts , three - quarters of them in 2009 . George W. Papandreou's uses Twitter . But @primeministergr is the office , not George W. Papandreou . George W. Papandreou's staff tweet for George W. Papandreou , sometimes using a code to signal who wrote what . 
 Twitter , says Mr Pinera 's spokeswoman , Ena von Baer , means assessing reactions to announcements before presenting them in a press conference . But the scale of response makes it hard for office - holders to tweet themselves . Mr Obama reads just a select ten of the messages ( 20,000 of all kinds ) he receives daily . During the presidential election campaign , Ms von Baer answered every message to @enavonbaer herself , but now her staff respond , or pass questions on to other ministries . 
 Twitter works well for extrovert and conscientious individual politicians . Denis Coderre ( @deniscoderre ) started using it for relief and rescue messages after the Haitian earthquake in January ( his electoral district in Montreal has a big Haitian population ) . He writes social messages , such as commentaries on ice - hockey matches ( he was a sportscaster before he became a politician ) . A second category is service messages for his constituents . A third is purely political . To benefit , a politician must do all of them himself , he says . But few match his talent or output . Twitter may feel personal but it is all too public . The risk is asymmetric . An ill - judged tweet can do severe , instant damage . Kerry McCarthy , a Labour candidate in Britain 's election , revealed early postal - vote counts in a tweet that ended "" # gameON ! "" . That may have seriously breached electoral law . 
 As well as boosting the profile of individual politicians , Twitter may be better designed for campaigning and opposition than for governing . "" We 'll change Washington "" is easy to fit into 140 characters . Explaining the messy and inevitable compromises of power is a lot harder . In January of this year a study by Fleishman Hillard , a Washington PR firm , discovered that Republicans in the House twittered more than five times as often as Democrats . Ms von Baer says that the Chilean opposition uses Twitter to make up for its poor coverage in the mainstream media . Not really real life

AT A Hindu temple in Chicago, hundreds of people of Indian descent, professing many faiths, turned up from across Illinois and farther afield to hear a speaker from back home. But the meeting on May 15th was not the usual style of diaspora politics, in which a nation's far-flung children are urged to cheer for the homeland.
The man they came to see was Jayaprakash Narayan, head of a movement called Lok Satta which opposes corruption and wants electoral reform. And the aim of his month-long American tour, which includes venues like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Google headquarters in California, is to get support from Indian-Americans for a drive to correct some of India's failings. That sounds a lot better than passing round the hat for hardline Hindu nationalist causes, something else that occurs in the diaspora.
Bad, sleazy government, Mr Narayan says, is holding India back, crippling the country in its race with China. Having voted with their feet by leaving the country, he adds, Indians abroad should now help make their homeland worth staying in. Independent India's early rulers had picked up statist ideas when studying in Britain; a new cohort of Indians, having thrived in economies like America's, are nudging the country towards a freer market. This transmission of ideas, he notes, is easier in an electronic age.
All this is a long way from ethnic lobbying of the old school, in which people from country A are persuaded to use their votes to tilt their new homeland's policies and make them less favourable to country (or regime) B, their ancient bugbear. Or else they are urged to fight old causes in an even more direct way--by sending money to extremist groups. In almost every democracy that has received migrants from troubled places, the influence (or at least, perceived influence) of groups committed to particular national causes has been a feature of political life, and of foreign-policy debates. 
Zbigniew Brzezinski, a former American national security adviser, has controversially described the Cuban-Americans, the Armenian-Americans and the supporters of Israel as the three most effective groups in Washington, DC--while agreeing that the lobby of his native Poland ""was at one time influential"". A landmark in the efforts of ethnic groups to affect American foreign policy was the arms embargo placed on Turkey in the 1970s, under the sway of Greek-Americans angry over the Turkish takeover of northern Cyprus.
Until recently at least, it seemed that the influence of ethnic constituencies was doomed to fade. For one thing, the communities on which they were based are blurring into wider societies. Gone are the days when Irish-Americans looked mainly to fellow Hibernians to socialise with; today's Lebanese-Australian teenager is as likely to hang out with youngsters from Vietnam as with other Levantines. In America, meanwhile, support for Israel is no longer an especially Jewish cause; the largest body of pro-Israel hawks are evangelical Christians, while many Jews are critical of Israeli policies,
True, groups can hold together as long as there is one big woe to be redressed. For Armenians, the big cause is recognition that the mass killings of 1915 were genocide. Yet the power of a single issue cuts both ways: once the great cause is achieved (as with Baltic independence in 1991) or lost (as with Sri Lanka's Tamils), the reason for hanging together can fade away. Life in the old dog
Despite all this, the latest signs are that diasporas have life in them yet. As Mr Narayan shows, they are interacting with their homelands in more creative ways. The American Ireland Fund has raised over $250m, mainly from rich Irish-Americans, to promote charitable causes, and above all inter-community relations; a lot better than giving money for guns. A new breed of wealthy Greek-Americans is doing more interesting things than counting congressional votes: funding libraries, scholarships and university chairs in Hellenic studies in the United States, for example. And this week George Papandreou, the Greek prime minister, met successful businessmen of Hellenic origin from five countries (such as Andrew Liveris, chief executive of America's Dow Chemical company), in the hope that they could lend their struggling homeland some badly needed pizzazz.
But perhaps the main reason why diasporas are perking up is simply the new ease of communications. With the internet and social networks, people with a common origin or concern can stay in touch and pool their efforts--with a flexibility and spontaneity that would amaze old-time lobbyists, reliant on faxes, phones and foreign-ministry briefings.
Take a diaspora as obscure as the Indians are visible. The Circassians descend from a Caucasus nation obliterated by Russia's tsar in the mid-19th century, losing around half its 2m population. Nine out of ten Circassians now live in diaspora: survivors fled to all corners of the Ottoman empire and beyond. Only 20 years ago, they were dwindling, with moribund diaspora bodies under Soviet tutelage. The internet is rekindling the cause. Facebook and Twitter link thousands of Circassians, helping them raise the national profile. Facebook groups and Twitter feeds enabled Circassians to co-ordinate the protests held on May 21st in Berlin, Istanbul, New York, The Hague and Washington, DC, to mark the 146th anniversary of what they term a genocide. They plan to make their feelings known at Sochi--the site of the killings--during the 2014 Olympics.
Politics is just one part of the diaspora's e-revival. Reassembling fragmented cultures is another. Circassians can find their long-lost music and dance on YouTube. Information about history and culture that was once obscure or falsified is now a click away. Online Circassian dictionaries and language courses are emerging. Internet forums can facilitate the search for a spouse. 
For some diasporas, any alternative to politics is welcome. In Ukraine the diaspora is the biggest donor for the Ukrainian Catholic University, the country's main independent provider of higher learning. Rigorous education is less glamorous than getting Ukraine into NATO or keeping the Russian bear at bay. But the gains are palpable, in contrast to the chaos and corruption of Kiev politics which faze many emigres. 
Such stories mark a big turnaround for diasporas, which over the last century have often had to wage an uphill struggle against time and geography. ""One by one, all remaining links to our old life are vanishing [...] Our Baghdad, my Baghdad is gone for ever."" So concludes ""Memories of Eden"", Violette Shamash's reflections on Jewish life in that city. A community which a century ago made up almost 40% of the city's population now lives chiefly in fading memories. But the people to whom memories are dear (if only because of things heard from grandparents) can now cultivate and share them more easily.
E-communications provide some hope of keeping at bay all the forces which threaten the existence of diasporas, especially small ones: assimilation (seen in the decline of once-mighty tongues like Yiddish and Latino) and the danger of irrelevance as the world moves on. But that will only work if the will to keep old languages and cultures alive really exists. In the easy-come, easy-go ethos of the electronic age, virtual communities die as well as live.

GREEK trade unionists have smartened up in response to global television coverage of anti-austerity protests in the capital. Members of communist unions now march in brand-new red-and-white caps; unionists at DEH, the electricity utility, favour bright orange T-shirts. 
Yet the new look cannot disguise the shrinking numbers of demonstrators turning out to resist the reforms and austerity measures being pursued by George Papandreou's Socialist (Pasok) government as part of a EUR 110 billion ($134 billion) bail-out by the European Union and International Monetary Fund. Fewer than 20,000 people took to the streets in the latest general strike on June 29th, compared with more than 50,000 on May 5th--the biggest and most violent protest to date, in which three bank employees were killed in a fire started by a petrol-bomb. 
The latest walkout was called to protest against an overhaul of the state pension system and labour-market reforms, due to be approved this month by parliament. From 2013, the retirement age for public workers will rise to 65 for both men and women, up from about 57 and 52 respectively. Pension payments will be cut. The government has also threatened to impose by law a three-year pay freeze for private-sector workers if it is not agreed in wage talks between unions and employers. 
The impact of job losses at private companies and wage cuts for civil servants is starting to be felt more widely. Although the IMF hopes that the recession will be less deep than forecast, GDP is still expected to shrink by more than 3% this year. Annual inflation is already at a 13-year high of 5.4%. It is set to jump again this month after VAT rates are increased by another two percentage points, to 23%. Black-market cigarettes and fuel are in high demand.
The summer tourist season is off to a poor start, with visitor numbers expected to fall by at least 8%. Cancellations followed wildcat strikes last month by a breakaway seamen's union that blocked ferry sailings from Piraeus port to the islands. By contrast, air-traffic controllers have refused to join recent walkouts to ensure that flights keep arriving. 
Between foreign trips and weekends on the islands, Mr Papandreou spends time soothing angry party members who fear Pasok's 25-year effort to build a welfare state is threatened. Under pressure, he is overseeing a campaign to curb corruption. A group of wealthy doctors is being investigated for alleged tax evasion after high-profile raids on their offices by the financial police. Akis Tsochatzopoulos, a former Socialist deputy prime minister who owns a lot of property, has had his party membership suspended. Owners of popular nightclubs are likewise under scrutiny.
Greece is also seeking investments from large sovereign-wealth funds. Mr Papandreou visited Libya, winning a promise from Muammar Qaddafi to support projects in Greece. Cabinet ministers have travelled to the Gulf states and China. Ambitious projects worth billions of euros--natural gas pipelines, port expansion and giant wind parks--are on the agenda. Mr Papandreou is hoping that a vision of future prosperity will offset the misery of today's austerity.","Grim resignation as austerity bites

VIEWED from afar, Europeans are a complacent, ungrateful lot. Nannied from cradle to grave by the world's most generous welfare systems, they squeal like spoiled children when asked to give up just a few of their playthings. As governments in the euro zone trim benefits and raise the retirement age in the wake of the sovereign-debt crisis, a wail of indignation has rung out and a wave of protests set in. ""Unfair!"" thundered Antonis Samaras, the Greek conservative opposition leader, this week, at the government's proposed pension-reform plans. ""Totally unfair!"" howled Martine Aubry, the French opposition Socialist leader, at her country's attempt to do the same.
American commentators seem particularly amused to watch Europeans ""dismantle"" their welfare systems, just as America embraces European-style universal health care. Only a year ago Europe's leaders were laying into American free-marketry and declaring unbridled capitalism finished. ""After listening to two years of stern and self-righteous lectures about the 'failure' of the American capitalist model,"" writes Walter Russell Mead, an academic, ""many Americans...are quietly enjoying the spectacle of the smug Europeans writhing in helpless indecision and pain over the continent's self-inflicted wounds.""
Could it be, though, that behind Europe's petty, possessive talk about rights and entitlements there is something more fundamental going on? The reason that Europeans struggle to accept the need to work more, and get less from the state is that it seems to signal an abrupt reversal of the decades-long advance towards an ever-more civilised society: in short, the end of progress. 
The construction of the welfare state is part of a European narrative that conjures civilisation from chaos. Take France, a country that, in welfare matters, more resembles Mediterranean Europe than its more rigorous northern neighbours. The incremental entrenchment of new rights in law, as a mark of progress towards a better society, dates back to just after the first world war. In 1919 the Senate limited the working day to eight hours. Leon Blum introduced the two-week paid holiday for all workers in 1936. Francois Mitterrand extended this to five weeks in the early 1980s. He also brought in retirement at 60, and the 39-hour working week. Ms Aubry, only ten years ago, reduced that to 35. By progressively shrinking the number of hours worked a week, or years worked over a lifetime, society seemed to be rolling towards some sort of ideal, with vin rose and deckchairs on the beach for all. This fits France's sense of secular, revolutionary History, carrying the country forward, however fitfully, like an ""endless cortege proceeding towards the light"", in the words of Jules Ferry, a 19th-century educationalist. Even President Nicolas Sarkozy, usually averse to abstract nouns, has spoken of ""the politics of civilisation"" and asked economists to measure output in terms of happiness, not just growth.
Put simply, if Europe stands for something, it is decent treatment for all. To this way of thinking, to guarantee a comfortable retirement is akin to banning child labour or giving women the vote: not optional perks, but badges of a civilised society. Such social preferences are what Europe is for, and what makes it different from America. Europe may no longer be a global power, or have much military muscle. Its churches may be empty, its spiritual fibre weak. It may not boast much cutting-edge innovation or economic growth. But it knows how to look after its sick and elderly, take a long lunch break and abandon the office in August. The cold realisation that time is up, and that such progress is over, prompts anger, denial and shock. Living with disillusion
Perhaps, however, the ideal of progress has been a myth for longer than Europeans may care to admit. The oil shock in 1973 was Europe's first wake-up call. Since then many countries have been creating an illusion of continual progress by running up hefty debts to finance their welfare states. More recently profligate countries in the euro zone have hidden behind German fiscal credibility and low interest rates to build a way of life that they could not afford, and which the Greek debt crisis blew apart a few months ago. 
Dealing with the end of progress is also partly about confronting the myth. Deep down, Europeans probably knew that they could not go on living beyond their means for ever, even if it took the bond markets and German finger-wagging rather than bold politicians to drive the message home. Greek, Spanish, Italian and French unions have certainly been staging protests and strikes--six so far this year in Greece alone. But governments are going ahead with reforms anyway. The most recent protests in Greece, Spain, Italy and France have not drawn massive crowds on to the streets. As they watch tour buses disgorge groups of sprightly 60-year-old pensioners in trainers into cobbled squares and historic cathedrals, most Europeans know that there is something amiss. Despite the drastic cuts and the humiliation of a rescue package, George Papandreou, the Greek prime minister, still enjoys an approval rating of 50%.
To accept that progress is an illusion is only one step. To change behaviour is another. Until now, much of Europe has chosen to put its values before growth. In reality, the 35-hour working week in France was not a mark of progress, but a brake on job creation and a spur to deindustrialisation to lower-cost countries; the French may have more time on their hands, but they have little money to do anything with it. Retirement at 60 in an ageing society is not a sign of civilisation, but a cruel joke played on the next generation. The euro-zone crisis has exposed such hypocrisy. It may still take time before Europeans conclude that they must compromise their ideals in order to secure the growth needed to preserve what they can of their lifestyles. But if they did, that would be real progress.","Europeans thought they were progressing towards an ideal civilisation. Now time is up, and it hurts

He also brought in retirement at 60, and the 39-hour working week. Ms Aubry, only ten years ago, reduced that to 35. By progressively shrinking the number of hours worked a week, or years worked over a lifetime, society seemed to be rolling towards some sort of ideal, with vin rose and deckchairs on the beach for all. This fits France's sense of secular, revolutionary History, carrying the country forward, however fitfully, like an ""endless cortege proceeding towards the light"", in the words of Jules Ferry, a 19th-century educationalist. Even President Nicolas Sarkozy, usually averse to abstract nouns, has spoken of ""the politics of civilisation"" and asked economists to measure output in terms of happiness, not just growth.
Put simply, if Europe stands for something, it is decent treatment for all. To this way of thinking, to guarantee a comfortable retirement is akin to banning child labour or giving women the vote: not optional perks, but badges of a civilised society. Such social preferences are what Europe is for, and what makes it different from America. Europe may no longer be a global power, or have much military muscle. Its churches may be empty, its spiritual fibre weak. It may not boast much cutting-edge innovation or economic growth. But it knows how to look after its sick and elderly, take a long lunch break and abandon the office in August. The cold realisation that time is up, and that such progress is over, prompts anger, denial and shock. Living with disillusion
Perhaps, however, the ideal of progress has been a myth for longer than Europeans may care to admit. The oil shock in 1973 was Europe's first wake-up call. Since then many countries have been creating an illusion of continual progress by running up hefty debts to finance their welfare states. More recently profligate countries in the euro zone have hidden behind German fiscal credibility and low interest rates to build a way of life that they could not afford, and which the Greek debt crisis blew apart a few months ago. 
Dealing with the end of progress is also partly about confronting the myth. Deep down, Europeans probably knew that they could not go on living beyond their means for ever, even if it took the bond markets and German finger-wagging rather than bold politicians to drive the message home. Greek, Spanish, Italian and French unions have certainly been staging protests and strikes--six so far this year in Greece alone. But governments are going ahead with reforms anyway. The most recent protests in Greece, Spain, Italy and France have not drawn massive crowds on to the streets. As they watch tour buses disgorge groups of sprightly 60-year-old pensioners in trainers into cobbled squares and historic cathedrals, most Europeans know that there is something amiss. Despite the drastic cuts and the humiliation of a rescue package, George Papandreou, the Greek prime minister, still enjoys an approval rating of 50%.
To accept that progress is an illusion is only one step. To change behaviour is another. Until now, much of Europe has chosen to put its values before growth. In reality, the 35-hour working week in France was not a mark of progress, but a brake on job creation and a spur to deindustrialisation to lower-cost countries; the French may have more time on their hands, but they have little money to do anything with it. Retirement at 60 in an ageing society is not a sign of civilisation, but a cruel joke played on the next generation. The euro-zone crisis has exposed such hypocrisy. It may still take time before Europeans conclude that they must compromise their ideals in order to secure the growth needed to preserve what they can of their lifestyles. But if they did, that would be real progress.",350,Greece,A30-94,,False,,0,True

Why is France such an outlier? It could be Catholic guilt, or lingering Marxism (economics textbooks teach pupils about the conflict between capital and labour). It may be the enduring romance of revolutionary rebellion, or the creed--or at least myth--of equality.

Perhaps, however, it is time to let the French, as well as other corners of market-averse Europe, in on a dark secret. The truth is that theirs is a capitalist society. For while Europe's leaders rail against profits and wealth, its firms stride into new markets and rack up giant profits. Spain's Inditex dresses men and women in Zara outfits in 76 countries. Belgium's Anheuser-Busch InBev, which makes Budweiser, is the world's leading brewer. France boasts more Fortune 500 companies than Germany. A French company, Sodexo, is chief caterer to the American marine corps. 
Such firms strut unapologetically into China, India and Brazil, vaunting their ""sales-driven, consumer-centric"" mission to achieve ""world-class efficiency"". And (whisper it) they also create the riches that the French, Belgians, Spanish, Greeks and others say they despise (but are happy to redistribute).

Does all this matter? Up to a point, corporate profit-seeking and political profit-denunciation can rub along together. The French seem to have no trouble filling up their shopping trolleys with American-branded washing powder or cheap plastic swimming pools made in China, selected from a vast choice stacked in hangar-like suburban hypermarkets. They like the low prices global competition brings them, just not the profits their supermarkets make. Mr Sarkozy can declare that he will ""not accept"" French carmakers building their products in low-cost European countries in order to sell them in France. But, thanks to the European single market, Renault continues to do so.
The reason that all this does matter is that France is supplying so many of the new ideas for the European Union. Whether these concern an ""economic government"" for the euro zone, tax harmonisation, environmental border tariffs or what Mr Barnier calls ""a more humane, social Europe"", these tend to drag the whole EU project disproportionately to the left. The worry in Brussels is that when French leaders pander to French fears about ""unfair"" competition, they are undermining the principle of the single market. Or that when they call for ""economic government"", they mean imposing costly social rules on all. Everybody knows that Mr Sarkozy often makes more noise than trouble.

FIRST came the truckers. Soon it will be the turn of lawyers, pharmacists and civil engineers. Greece's Socialist (Pasok) government has belatedly started to embrace structural reforms, buoyed by the success of a swift but messy overhaul of the pension system last month.
""I'm very satisfied with what Greece has done so far,"" purred Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the eurogroup, the 16 countries that use the single currency. He was speaking after the government stood up to 33,000 owner-drivers who went on strike in protest against plans to double the number of truck licences and allow Greeks to set up road-haulage companies.
The eight-day strike, which caused a severe petrol shortage, keeping tens of thousands of Greeks and foreign tourists off the road, may turn out to have been a defining moment in the country's struggle to reshape its outdated economy. An umbrella law liberalising all ""closed-shop"" professions is now due to pass parliament by December--months earlier than had been agreed under the conditions of Greece's EUR 110 billion ($145 billion) bail-out by the European Union (EU) and the IMF.
More than 150,000 Greeks, from lawyers to undertakers, work in about 70 such professions. These vested interest groups keep the cost of services high; liberalising the closed shops could boost Greek GDP by 13.2% over three to four years, according to IOBE, a Greek economic think-tank. 
Next to go will be the pharmacists' guaranteed 35% profit margin, and the basic fees charged by all lawyers and civil engineers. Though more strikes are expected, few groups are in a position to paralyse the country as the truckers have.
George Papandreou, the prime minister, who dithered for months before agreeing to the EU-IMF rescue package, now wants to get all the structural reforms finished by the end of the year. It is a daunting task--but Mr Papandreou is gambling that it will eventually spur recovery, improving the chances that his ten-month-old government will survive a full four-year term. 
Many Greek families hit by wage and pension cuts are already finding it hard to get by. Things will get worse. The economy is set to shrink by 4% this year and another 2.5% in 2011, though it should start growing again in the second half of next year. Inflation may finish 2010 at 4.75%. Unemployment, already in double digits, is set to soar; to 20%, say some trade unionists.
The next round of reform will bring public-sector job losses for the first time in living memory. Tens of thousands of contract workers are being sacked. Local banks are refusing to lend to the loss-making state railways and the Athens transport system. Both will shed jobs in a restructuring that cannot be postponed. Several thousand posts in local government will disappear when municipalities are merged at the end of this year. Employees are sceptical of the government's promise to find other positions for redundant public-sector workers.
Pasok is certain to take a battering at local elections in November. More worrying, perhaps, Mr Papandreou has been unable to build a consensus for reform. The conservative opposition voted against the EU-IMF package, although it has backed some individual measures. Alex Tsipras, leader of Syriza, a small but vocal left-wing party, says he still expects Greece to default. 
Monitors from the ""troika""--the European Commission, European Central Bank and IMF--announced this week that they were impressed by what has been achieved so far. The next quarterly EUR 9 billion loan tranche will duly be supplied in mid-September. But they worry that unrest will erupt again once the holidays end. 
So they are urging the government to rally disgruntled Greeks by making an example of wealthy tax evaders. In spite of revelations of widespread tax-dodging by doctors, lawyers and entertainers, no offender has yet been led away in handcuffs in front of the television cameras.

WHATEVER the travails of the Greek economy, George Papandreou has a gift for accentuating the positive. Ask the prime minister about his country's comparative advantages, and he is likely to mention the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet. His latest paean on the subject, at a resort south of Athens on October 22nd, had a sympathetic audience: a grouping of Mediterranean politicians, including Israelis, Palestinians, Greek-Cypriots and Turks, who probably found it easier to agree on culinary matters than on most other things.
As it turns out, there is at least one other thing on which Mediterranean leaders concur, at least in theory: the need to protect their sea and its shore from the worst effects of a looming ecological threat that could make it much harder to produce all that healthy fruit, wine and oil. According to Dimitri Zenghelis, a co-author of the 2006 Stern report on climate change, the region can expect to see a drop in precipitation of 25-30% by the middle of the century, with wide variation either side of the mean. If rainfall on bits of the northern Mediterranean coast were to fall by, say, 50%, the landscape could become more like the southern shore--and the struggle to save bone-dry forests from fire might become nearly hopeless. With all that in mind, representatives of 17 Mediterranean countries--including Recep Tayyip Erdogan, prime minister of Turkey--joined Mr Papandreou in pledging to work for ""low-carbon, resource-efficient and climate-resilient"" economies.
What difference will such fine words make? There is no lack of ideas for ways in which the two shores of the sea could collaborate in producing and distributing green energy. The most ambitious is Desertec, an initiative backed by German firms that would see vast solar power plants built in north Africa at a cost of up to EUR 400 billion ($552 billion), with much of the electricity sent to Europe. 
But the potential backers of such projects are in shock after an abrupt change of tack by the Spanish government, which has slashed subsidies for windmills and solar panels. Italy is also scaling back incentives for solar energy, looking, like Spain, to trim its budget deficit. Nor is there any guarantee that north African countries with abundant fossil-fuel stocks will welcome big solar installations. 
One of the ideas of the Athens gathering was to change the political climate and restore investors' nerve. In the short term, though, there are obstacles. For example, some north European green investment funds will not put money into Greece until its financial problems are sorted out. But there are some easy things the Mediterranean countries could help each other do: retrofitting buildings to save energy, and creating more efficient grids, for example. Before they cook up anything really juicy, the politicians of the Mediterranean may need something simpler to chew on.

A WAVE of failed letter-bombs targeting Angela Merkel, Silvio Berlusconi and Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as a clutch of foreign embassies, has revived Greek fears that local anarchist groups, who played a big role in last spring's anti-austerity riots, are preparing a fresh round of violence to coincide with local-government elections on November 7th. This week police arrested two men with booby-trapped jiffy-bags in their backpacks close to the offices of a courier company where an employee had been slightly injured by an exploding package. The men are suspected of belonging to the Conspiracy of the Cells of Fire, an extremist group that specialises in headline-grabbing but unsophisticated attacks. 
It was the kind of publicity that George Papandreou, the Greek prime minister, could have done without. He has already made the elections a high-risk test for his Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) by calling them a ""referendum"" on the harsh economic reforms required under Greece's EUR 110 billion ($145 billion) bail-out package from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. On October 25th Mr Papandreou said that if voters turned away from Pasok he might call a snap general election in December, barely a year after winning the previous one. This could undermine Greek efforts to maintain the confidence of financial markets and avoid a forced restructuring of its debt. 
Yiannis Ragoussis, the interior minister, spelled out what the prime minister meant. The decision on whether to call a general election will hinge on the outcome of 13 contests for the powerful post of periferiarch (regional governor), the first time in Greece that senior administrators have been directly elected. If Pasok candidates for periferiarch trail their conservative New Democracy rivals by a wide margin, the government will seek a new mandate.
Pasok supporters appear to be uncertain. Many say they will cast a blank ballot, or simply stay away on election day. Wage cuts for public-sector workers--Pasok's core constituency--have angered party loyalists. But few are likely to switch to New Democracy, which ran the country between 2004 and 2009 and is blamed for running up the huge deficits that took Greece to the brink of bankruptcy. 
The markets are worried. When Mr Papandreou made his threat, yields on Greek bonds shot up towards the levels reached in May, just before the EU and IMF stepped in. But things could get worse. If an election is held, the outcome could be an unwieldy coalition government. Antonis Samaras, the New Democracy leader, opposes the EU-IMF reform programme, as do Greece's small left-wing parties. Fiscal consolidation would be likely to slow; structural measures would be postponed. Greece's chances of avoiding default would be slimmer than ever.
Even now there are signs that reform efforts are flagging. Pieces of vital legislation behind schedule include the liberalisation of closed-shop white-collar professions. Tax collection is falling behind target: revenues were up by only 3.6% in the first ten months of the year, compared with a hoped-for 8.7%. Although VAT receipts jumped by around 15% in September and October, payments of income and corporation tax slowed down. 
An ambitious scheme to settle arrears owed by businesses had got off to a poor start.

""How can I go on voting for a Pasok government when it treats me like a villain?"" fumes Markos Papadopoulos, an importer who claims his books are in perfect order.","A tense mood in Greece ahead of high - stakes local elections 
 A WAVE of failed letter - bombs targeting Angela Merkel , Silvio Berlusconi and Nicolas Sarkozy , as well as a clutch of foreign embassies , has revived Greek fears that local anarchist groups , who played a big role in last spring 's anti - austerity riots , are preparing a fresh round of violence to coincide with local - government elections on November 7th . This week police arrested two men with booby - trapped jiffy - bags in their backpacks close to the offices of a courier company where an employee had been slightly injured by an exploding package . The men are suspected of belonging to the Conspiracy of the Cells of Fire , an extremist group that specialises in headline - grabbing but unsophisticated attacks . 
 It was the kind of publicity that George W. Papandreou , could have done without . George W. Papandreou has already made the elections a high - risk test for George W. Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement ( Pasok ) by calling them a "" referendum "" on the harsh economic reforms required under Greece 's EUR 110 billion ( $ 145 billion ) bail - out package from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund . On October 25th George W. Papandreou said that if voters turned away from Pasok George W. Papandreou might call a snap general election in December , barely a year after winning the previous one . This could undermine Greek efforts to maintain the confidence of financial markets and avoid a forced restructuring of its debt . 
 Yiannis Ragoussis , the interior minister , spelled out what George W. Papandreou meant . The decision on whether to call a general election will hinge on the outcome of 13 contests for the powerful post of periferiarch ( regional governor ) , the first time in Greece that senior administrators have been directly elected . If Pasok candidates for periferiarch trail their conservative New Democracy rivals by a wide margin , the government will seek a new mandate . 
 Pasok supporters appear to be uncertain . Many say they will cast a blank ballot , or simply stay away on election day . Wage cuts for public - sector workers -- Pasok 's core constituency -- have angered party loyalists . But few are likely to switch to New Democracy , which ran the country between 2004 and 2009 and is blamed for running up the huge deficits that took Greece to the brink of bankruptcy . 
 The markets are worried . When George W. Papandreou made George W. Papandreou's threat , yields on Greek bonds shot up towards the levels reached in May , just before the EU and IMF stepped in . But things could get worse . If an election is held , the outcome could be an unwieldy coalition government . Antonis Samaras , the New Democracy leader , opposes the EU - IMF reform programme , as do Greece 's small left - wing parties . Fiscal consolidation would be likely to slow ; structural measures would be postponed . Greece 's chances of avoiding default would be slimmer than ever . 
 Even now there are signs that reform efforts are flagging . Pieces of vital legislation behind schedule include the liberalisation of closed - shop white - collar professions . Tax collection is falling behind target : revenues were up by only 3.6 % in the first ten months of the year , compared with a hoped - for 8.7 % . Although VAT receipts jumped by around 15 % in September and October , payments of income and corporation tax slowed down . 
 An ambitious scheme to settle arrears owed by businesses had got off to a poor start . Thousands of tax demands were sent to company owners who believed they were up - to - date on their liabilities -- a mistake that is likely to cost votes .

THE old, sad, Jewish joke about Moses taking a wrong turn and ending up in a corner of the Middle East without any oil can at last be discarded. Israel has struck gas--lots of it. Deep-sea wells off the north of the country should soon supply all the country's own gas needs, and much more is in prospect for export. But such bonanzas inevitably bring headaches. 
Tension with next-door Lebanon over demarcating the maritime border is rising. A big battle has begun in Israel over royalties, with some demanding a sovereign-wealth fund when the money starts flowing. There is excitement and volatility on the Tel Aviv stock exchange, where the government has moved belatedly to curb heady trading in drilling licences. 
The find could also have far-reaching strategic consequences, especially if a pipeline is laid across the seabed to Greece, where relations with Israel have been noticeably warming as Turkey moves to shut down its longstanding alliance with the Jewish state.
For decades Israel drilled for oil with scant success. But in 1999 a maritime drill struck gas in commercial quantities just 250 metres beneath the Mediterranean, 40km (25 miles) out from Israel's southern port of Ashdod. Production began in 2004 at what is called the Mari-B, and some 2.8 billion cubic metres of gas are piped ashore each year from reserves that may be as large as 22 bcm. 
But that is a mere bubble compared with the Tamar field discovered last year, also in the Mediterranean, 90km off the northern end of Israel's coast. Tamar, where the gas is much deeper down, holds 238 bcm. Production, by a consortium led by the same Israeli and American partners who own Mari-B, is to begin in 2014. Tamar was the world's largest gas find in 2009.
But it, too, may be dwarfed by another find by the same consortium, 45km farther out to sea. Noble Energy, the consortium's American part, says this field, called Leviathan, has a potential of 453 bcm and an even chance of ""geological success"". An exploratory drill is under way. The results should be known early next year. If good, production could begin by 2016. 
The two fields could provide gas worth $4 billion a year. As Israel's energy bill is $10 billion--more than 5% of GDP--the gas would sharply improve the country's trade balance. Indeed, Tamar should supply all Israel's domestic gas needs, both for industry and household consumers, for at least 20 years. Leviathan's reserves should be available for export. 
This is where Greece may come in. The two countries, cold and distant in the past, have suddenly become bosom friends. Israeli military aircraft, no longer welcome in Turkish skies, are training over Greece in concert with the Greek air force. The two prime ministers, Binyamin Netanyahu, an arch-capitalist, and George Papandreou, a socialist scion, have exchanged cosy visits. Israeli businessmen and tourists who once flocked to Turkey are switching to Greece. Recent diplomatic talks in Jerusalem included a session with Israel's petroleum commissioner. Israel sees Greece not only as a gas purchaser but also as a European hub from which Israeli gas could be sold and piped on.
But Greece may not sign on the dotted line until Israel has agreed with Lebanon and Cyprus on where a border is to be drawn in the sea, demarcating each country's economic exclusion zone. Israeli and Lebanese ministers have already traded accusations and threats. Tension has risen since Iran began offering to help develop Lebanon's share of the undersea wealth. 
The Israelis say they are close to agreeing with Cyprus on a ""median line"" to let them share some of the seabed between them; as economic exclusion zones generally extend 200 miles (322km) out to sea, there is an overlap. The Israelis then intend gingerly to approach Lebanon, though the two countries are formally in a state of war, in the hope eventually of holding a UN-backed international arbitration.
Meanwhile, the Israelis have run a string of buoys into the sea off the coastal border point between Israel and Lebanon. But the Lebanese say they are angled too far northward. The Israelis point out that Tamar and Leviathan (see map) are anyway well south of the line that Lebanon claims as the correct maritime one.
In any event, unlike Mari-B, where a derrick standing on the sea floor pumps up the oil, Tamar and Leviathan will present no target above the waterline for anti-Israeli guerrillas from outfits such as Hizbullah, the Lebanese Shia party-cum-militia. Nearly 2,000 metres deep, the wells will be installed and operated by robot-like machines capable of withstanding the intense underwater pressure. 
The Palestinians, especially in Gaza, are watching developments twitchily. A decade or so ago, British Gas wanted to work with the Palestinian Authority to develop the Marine field off Gaza; most or all of the gas was to be sold to Israel. But Ariel Sharon, when he was Israel's prime minister, vetoed the project, ostensibly on security grounds, and the field lies unexploited. A big bonus for poor Israelis?
Back on land, a committee of experts appointed by the finance minister has recommended a steep rise in the government take on successful gas or oil finds. A series of tax breaks and low royalties would mean, the committee found, that Israeli citizens would do poorly out of their country's natural resources by international standards. So the committee proposed progressive taxes on profits that could mean the government taking 66% of profits on flourishing gasfields. Oil and gas executives, apparently backed by the American administration, are complaining loudly. The offshore consortium has retained legions of lobbyists and public-relations people to make its case. 
Lined up against them are civil-society campaigners such as Michael Melchior, who hailed the recommendations as ""a significant step in the right direction"". As a former chief rabbi of Norway and later an Israeli politician linked to the Labour party, he is urging the government to follow Norway's example by putting the state's share of profits into a sovereign wealth fund and earmarking the income for social welfare.

EVEN as Greece's Socialist government struggles to avoid bankruptcy, its long-suffering voters have opted out of party politics. For the first time in memory, more than half abstained in the second round of local elections on November 14th. Almost 30% of mayors who won run-off contests around the country were independents, including Yiannis Dimaras, a civil engineer who took Patras, a port in western Greece where the ruling Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) usually holds sway. Two progressives, both new to politics, won in Athens and Thessaloniki after a quarter of a century of right-wing control of both cities. George Kaminis, a constitutional expert, left his job as national ombudsman to run for mayor of Athens. In Thessaloniki, Greece's second city, Yiannis Boutaris, a winemaker and environmentalist, scored a surprise victory. Both candidates were hand-picked by George Papandreou, the prime minister, in a bid to bring fresh talent to local government.
Mr Kaminis faces the tougher task. He has pledged to make life easier for the capital's large immigrant population. Anti-immigrant feeling is intensifying as the recession deepens. Afghans and Africans, in particular, are targeted by right-wing, anti-Islamic Greek groups. In some districts the police openly support the right-wingers. One lot, Chryssi Avghi, has won a seat on the Athens city council for the first time. On November 16th young right-wingers pelted Muslims with eggs as they marked their Eid festival with an outdoor prayer meeting (Athens has no official city mosque). ""The atmosphere round here is quite frightening,"" says Marina Vichou, a member of a neighbourhood support-group for immigrants in the Aghios Panteleimonas district.
Yet in spite of the high rate of abstention, Pasok won more votes than New Democracy, the conservative opposition. So Mr Papandreou can claim that there is a consensus, however reluctant, for continuing the rigorous austerity programme agreed with the European Union and the IMF as a condition for Greece's EUR 110 billion ($145 billion) bail-out in May. The going is getting rougher, though. 
Once again Greece's budget deficit has been revised upwards (see chart). It reached 15.4% of GDP in 2009, compared with a previous estimate of 13.6%. This year's deficit target of 7.8% will be missed as a result, although Greece is still aiming to cut the deficit by six percentage points of GDP, just ahead of what was agreed with the IMF and EU.
But this can be achieved only by making savage cuts to public investment, including programmes that are funded jointly with the EU. The government is also postponing some spending obligations. Exporters, for example, claim that VAT refunds are being unreasonably delayed. A return to growth, now forecast in the second half of 2011, looks to be disappearing into the future. 
So another round of spending cuts looms. Civil servants and pensioners have already seen their incomes shrink by more than 20%. Next year it will be the turn of workers in public corporations and other overstaffed state bodies. The ""troika""--representatives of the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF--are pressing for cuts to jobs as well as wages for public-sector workers. Mr Papandreou still insists that workers made redundant will be moved elsewhere in the public sector, but even Pasok loyalists are starting to doubt that he will be able to keep his word.","Support for the government 's austerity programme is still holding up , just

IN MAY, when they rescued Greece from the bond markets at the 11th hour, the members of the euro zone vowed never to get into such a mess again. To keep the speculators at bay, they armed themselves with the biggest gun they could muster: a trillion-dollar loan fund. Many hoped the weapon would prove such a deterrent that, like the ""bazooka"" of Hank Paulson, America's treasury secretary under George Bush, it would never have to be used. Yet, just as with Mr Paulson's guarantee, the euro zone's weapon barely deterred the barbarians. 
Now Ireland is under assault and the euro zone has loaded the first bullet into the chamber. On November 16th euro-zone finance ministers said there would be a ""short and focused consultation"", involving the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF, to assess the best way of helping Ireland to salvage its collapsed banks (
). There has been a curious role reversal between the Greek crisis in May and the Irish one now. In the spring everything was made worse by the hesitation of the main donor, Germany, over helping spendthrift Greeks. This time it is the would-be recipient, Ireland, that is prevaricating dangerously. Yet, like it or not, the rescue party is being saddled up. Will it succeed?
It would certainly help if the riders showed better order and learnt to shoot straight. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, is at the forefront, but she is also the subject of much mutinous talk since leading her colleagues into the badlands at last month's EU summit. She persuaded them to reopen last year's Lisbon treaty to create a bail-out system that would allow the restructuring of a country's debts. No longer, she declared, would good European taxpayers have to bear the risk of protecting their financial system alone; she would exact a price from speculators too. Jean-Claude Trichet, the ECB president, warned the leaders that they risked stirring up restive markets, but was ignored.
Within days, the euro countries cantered into a new ambush. Yields on the bonds of weak countries broke new euro-zone records. A fortnight later, at the Seoul G20 summit, Mrs Merkel was still in combative mood. ""Let me put it simply: in this regard there may be a contradiction between the interests of the financial world and the interests of the political world."" But a day later the EU sent out a peace party. The finance ministers of the five biggest countries explained that they had been misunderstood. The debts of euro-zone members were protected by their bail-out fund until 2013; any notion of imposing ""haircuts"" on bondholders would apply only to new debt issued thereafter.
For economists such as Jean Pisani-Ferry, director of Bruegel, a think-tank in Brussels, Mrs Merkel's action was a good idea that went wrong. Investors should indeed bear some of the pain, but she would have done better to venture into this territory next year, once markets had calmed down, and with a proper map. Brian Cowen, Ireland's prime minister, grumbled about the turmoil being an ""unforeseen consequence"" of the German move. His Greek colleague, George Papandreou, was less charitable. Germany, he said, risked creating ""a self-fulfilling prophecy"". It was placing greater burdens on countries already in trouble. ""This could break backs. This could force economies towards bankruptcy."" Wolfgang Schauble, the German finance minister, made clear he thought the Greeks were being ungrateful for the help they received earlier this year. 
Other politicians have exacerbated matters, too. Portuguese ministers spoke openly about needing a rescue or even having to leave the euro. Hours before the finance ministers' meeting, Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council, carelessly talked of Europe being ""in a survival crisis"". It was left to Olli Rehn, the laconic Finnish economic commissioner, to call for ""cool heads"". Plainly, the rescue of Ireland is not made any easier by all the political bickering. But in a union of 27 countries, decisions inevitably take longer and messages get more confused than markets would like. European politicians who delayed the Greek rescue and now seem to be making a dog's dinner of the Irish one deserve blame for responding slowly and fitfully to the signals from financial markets--a charge that has much resonance when it comes to the Germans. Yet it would be wrongheaded to leap from this to blaming Germany for the euro's crisis.
It was the Greeks, not the Germans, who lied about their deficit numbers (this week, the true Greek deficit for 2009 was pushed up again by the European statisticians, to 15.4% of GDP). It was Dublin (and Madrid), not Berlin, that presided cheerfully over a hugely inflated house-price bubble. It was Irish politicians, not German ones, who happily took plenty of campaign-finance contributions from their property-developer chums. Mrs Merkel has much to answer for when it comes to running a large current-account surplus and imparting a deflationary bias to the euro zone. But she is not to blame for the feckless failure of weaker euro-zone countries to push through reforms that might have made up for their loss of competitiveness. The benefit of self-harm
If there is any silver lining at all to emerge from the turmoil of recent weeks, it is that the value of the euro has fallen, or at least that it has stopped rising. A euro crisis is certainly an expensive way to achieve this goal, but at least exporters will be grateful. According to the latest figures, the euro zone as a whole posted a larger-than-expected trade surplus in September. Many feared that the euro might get caught in the crossfire of the currency war between America and China. They were wrong. Ranged against the shotgun of America's quantitative easing, and the shield of China's capital controls, Europe does at least have leaders who are well drilled in shooting themselves in the foot.","European leaders are blamed for exacerbating the euro crisis , but for the wrong reasons

GREECE'S prime minister, George Papandreou, claims that his country has clawed back credibility with the markets after nine months of austerity. His economic team suggests Greece may be able to borrow again, despite its ""junk"" rating. They are cheered that the payback period for last year's EUR 110 billion ($150 billion) loan from the European Union and IMF is being extended, perhaps to 30 years, and the interest rate cut. 
Yet ordinary Greeks are not happy. From pharmacists angry at losing their 35% profit margin on prescription drugs to train drivers facing mandatory transfers to other jobs, resistance to reform is stiffening. A daily list of strikes and protests appears on local websites. And middle-class professionals are just as cross. Doctors staged a sit-in at the health ministry this week because they had not been consulted over health-care cuts. Walk-outs by lawyers, architects and civil engineers loom as the finance ministry draws up a law to abolish their professional privileges. 
More pain is certainly on its way. Unemployment, now at 13.5%, is forecast to hit 15%. The economy could shrink by 3.5% this year, after an estimated 4.2% contraction in 2010, according to KEPE, a state-run research institute. Investment is on hold; a new incentives law has been delayed, and banks are reluctant to lend so long as Greece runs the risk of default.
Mr Papandreou's commitment to overhauling the public sector is not in doubt, yet the pace of reform remains slow. On its trip to Athens, the ""troika"" (the European Commission, IMF and European Central Bank) has found that Greece has missed deadlines for cost-cutting and revenue-raising because of bureaucratic foot-dragging. Louka Katseli, the labour minister, has publicly criticised the troika's programme. Both a second round of pension reform and measures to make it easier to hire and fire are making only slow progress. 
Such delays are preventing Greece from hitting its targets of raising revenues by 5% and cutting the budget deficit as a share of GDP by another 2.2 points, after a six-point reduction in 2010. Signs that Greece is slacking off may undermine any chance of arranging an orderly debt restructuring as part of the planned Franco-German ""grand bargain"" in the euro zone. 
Greece hopes to be allowed to buy back debt held by the ECB at a 25% discount, using money borrowed from the European Financial Stability Facility. Private bondholders may be offered a 10-15 year extension of maturities and a lower interest rate. If some such restructuring went ahead, Greece's debt burden could be trimmed by 20-30 percentage points. Yet it would still be 130% of GDP, the highest in the euro zone (see chart). 
Even Greece's supporters doubt if such a huge debt can ever be repaid in full. Annual budget surpluses would have to be intolerably high. There is talk of mass privatisations of public property (although Mr Papandreou balks at selling off any Aegean islands). Even so, nothing is likely to be big enough to make the threat of default go away.","Despite impressive austerity , Greece may still be unable to repay all its debts

THE little red-tiled complex outside the Greek village of Filakio is not much to look at. But stand next to the fence and arms start to wave through the bars. ""I am hungry!"" shouts one voice. ""No toilet!"" adds another. They cry out their nationalities--Algerians, Moroccans, Iranians. The bellowing turns political. ""Ce n'est pas la Grece, c'est Guantanamo!"" claims one man. Another screams: ""German, Hitler, Nazi! German dog!""
The policemen hardly resemble vicious camp-guards. They do not try to stop a stranger speaking to detainees being held for illegally crossing the border from Turkey. But last month the European Court of Human Rights ruled that conditions at Greek immigrant detention centres are so squalid as to breach the ban on ""torture or inhuman or degrading treatment"". Even before the ruling, several countries had stopped sending asylum-seekers back to Greece under ""Dublin II"", a convention ruling that applications must be heard in the first country of entry.
This humiliation is of Greece's own making, but it also reflects the pressure of numbers. In recent years Greece has become the main illegal migration-route into the EU. Its border controls have been lax and its asylum-processing system slow and questionable (the approval rate for asylum applications is tiny compared with other EU countries). Hundreds of thousands of foreigners are adrift in a semi-legal limbo, sleeping rough in Athens or in ports from which they hope to get to Italy. Greek xenophobes are beating up immigrants. Traditionally a country of emigrants, Greece is unready for a mass influx.
Like a river seeking the easiest path to the sea, immigration that once flowed to Spain and Italy now courses to Greece. People first crossed to Greek islands; now they prefer the border marked by the Evros river. Nearby is the Turkish city of Edirne, the former Adrianople. Here in 1922 Ernest Hemingway recorded the flight of Greeks across the Evros during the population swap with Turkey: ""twenty miles of carts drawn by cows, bullocks and muddy-flanked water buffalo, with exhausted, staggering men, women and children, blankets over their heads, walking blindly along in the rain beside their worldly goods."" Greek cavalry, he wrote, moved them on ""like cow-punchers driving steers"".
These days the staggerers include Afghans, Iranians, Pakistanis, Somalis, Congolese and Eritreans. And the cow-punchers are human traffickers, pushing them into the river on flimsy dinghies or across fields of sunflower and garlic. About 50 have drowned in the Evros; ten more have died in the cold. This is one of the most militarised frontiers in Europe. Yet at its most vulnerable stretch, a land section cutting across a bend in the river, slipping into Greece takes no more than a stroll through farmers' fields. Greece wants to build a fence there. 
About 47,000 crossed the border last year. ""They do not have any documents,"" says Colonel Georgios Salamagkas, police chief in the town of Orestiada. ""All the white people say they are from Palestine. All the Africans say they are from Somalia. They know we cannot send them back to those countries."" Most immigrants are trying to pass through Greece to reach richer countries. They avoid Turkey's border with Bulgaria, but that would change if it were let into the EU's Schengen passport-free zone.
Greece's crisis is Europe's problem. Frontex, the EU border agency, has deployed a rapid-response team--including border guards, dog-handlers and interpreters--to help. The flow has reduced, partly because the Turks are co-operating. But no sooner has one gap tightened than another is reopening on the Mediterranean. Some 5,000 immigrants, mostly young men, have arrived on the Italian island of Lampedusa. Italy stroppily accuses the EU of doing too little. Political oppression may push people to flee, but the end of dictatorship in Tunisia has also lifted an obstacle. Events on Lampedusa must alarm all EU countries about the popular revolts across the Middle East. A double tragedy in Greece
Two big European projects, the euro and Schengen, are under severe strain in Greece. To work, they require mutual trust. But this has been eroded, first by broken public finances and now by broken border controls. Greece says harsh spending cuts make its immigration and asylum system harder to fix.
As with the sovereign-debt crisis, countries facing an immigration emergency need help from the EU, in exchange for deep reforms. EU countries need to align their asylum policies more closely so as to bridge the big disparities between them. Some means of sharing the resettlement of refugees makes sense. Southern countries want the option, in times of stress, to halt the return of asylum-seekers to their first country of entry. Northerners fear this might encourage southerners to export their problem. A painful compromise might be tried: if Greece wants to suspend Dublin II, it should accept a temporary suspension of Schengen and the return of border controls.
Part of the answer lies in co-operating with Europe's neighbours, helping a free Tunisia to re-establish border controls, say. Greece is under pressure because Turkey allows visa-free entry for some of its neighbours. Turkey also maintains the ""geographical limitation"" in the 1951 convention on refugees, restricting asylum to Europeans only. If Turkey wants more influence in both the EU and the Middle East, it should end this legal anomaly.
An effective asylum regime must be part of a more sensible immigration policy, not least because an ageing Europe will in future need more foreign workers. But refugees should not be confused with economic migrants. As long as there is war and oppression, there must be sanctuary. Greece's prime minister, George Papandreou, should know this more than most: under the Greek colonels, his family was given asylum in Sweden.","In Greece and now Italy , illegal immigration is straining the European Union

FOR months now European leaders have been striving to get on top of the euro-area debt crisis. But as the deadline for a supposedly comprehensive and enduring solution nears--summits are due to be held on March 11th and March 24th--the ""grand bargain"" is looking ever less grand. A disappointing outcome will fuel market doubts about the fiscal sustainability of the most troubled euro-area economies. Those doubts remain intense. Ten-year bond yields are sky-high for Greece and Ireland, despite the bail-outs of 2010; at an intolerable level for Portugal, generally seen as next in line for a rescue; and still worryingly high for Spain (see chart).
This being a sovereign-debt crisis, politics has a habit of upsetting the tidy reckonings of market spreadsheets. The Irish election on February 25th may have delivered the predicted outcome in the shape of a new ruling coalition dominated by Fine Gael. But it also injects fresh uncertainty since Enda Kenny, the new Irish leader, has a popular mandate to revisit some of the terms of the bail-out in November. The outcome of his negotiations--chiefly with Germany, the euro area's reluctant paymaster--will in turn help shape a permanent debt-restructuring mechanism that will replace the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) when the interim rescue arrangements expire in mid-2013. 
Politics has intruded in Germany, too. Angela Merkel's ability to face down domestic opposition to a deal involving big German concessions has been undermined by the drubbing her party took in a recent regional election, and by the forced departure of her defence minister. Awkwardly, the chancellor faces an even more vital verdict from voters, in the big state of Baden-Wurttemberg, on March 27th, just after the second European summit.
Only one firm decision has so far been made in the run-up to the summitry: that the European rescue funds announced last May will actually match the original promise of EUR 500 billion ($690 billion). Hopes that the EFSF could be used to facilitate a voluntary reduction in debt, notably Greece's towering 140% of GDP, have dwindled. The idea was that it could lend funds to Greece, which would buy back its debt at market prices--ie, at a deep discount to its par value. 
On a recent visit to Berlin, George Papandreou, the Greek prime minister, pleaded for such buy-backs to be on the negotiating table. But German opposition to the notion has hardened. In late February, for instance, the Bundesbank, the country's central bank, condemned the idea as an opaque inter-governmental transfer. 
Whether buy-backs would help is in any case unclear. As Nouriel Roubini and Brad Setser, two economists, argue in ""Bail-outs or Bail-ins?"", a book drawing on the experience of debt crises in emerging economies, a determined programme to repurchase bonds would drive up their price, so reducing any relief. Removing debt held by private holders and replacing it with strict obligations to the EFSF could make an eventual restructuring harder, should that prove unavoidable.
Whereas excessive public debt in Greece has arisen from years of public profligacy, Ireland's problem has been made acute by the unbearable cost of propping up its oversized and undercapitalised banks. This amounts to at least 36% of GDP, according to Dermot O'Leary, an economist at Goodbody Stockbrokers, helping already to push public debt to almost 100% of GDP. A possible target for write-downs by the new government is the EUR 21 billion of bank debt (worth 13% of Irish GDP) not covered by state guarantees. But that option is steadfastly opposed by the European Central Bank, which fears it might rock a euro-area banking system that is still far from healthy. 
A more realistic objective for Mr Kenny is to bring down the interest rates on the bail-out funds. These were reckoned at the time of the deal in late November to average 5.8% on the EUR 67.5 billion of external support, two-thirds of which comes from European sources (the remainder is from the IMF). The funding, which has an average maturity of 7.5 years, will protect Ireland from having to borrow in the markets over the next three years. But the Irish will press for a reduction of as much as two percentage points on the European funds, arguing that this high cost of borrowing was originally devised for a serial fiscal offender like Greece rather than a country whose public finances have been laid waste by an unfortunate banking accident.
How much would lower rates help? David Mackie, an economist at JPMorgan Chase, argues that the real prize would be to offer low-cost finance beyond 2013. Otherwise, if Greece and Ireland have to return to the markets, they will have to pay punitive rates that would keep their debt burdens rising even if they are running primary (ie, excluding interest payments) budget surpluses by then. But even if such a concession was achieved, the point at which debt would peak would still be very onerous--over 150% of GDP for Greece and around 125% of GDP for Ireland. 
Moreover, securing a more favourable interest rate will be tough. The Bundesbank, for example, is no keener on the idea than it is on bond buy-backs. Other parts of the grand bargain are also in trouble: German proposals to impose Teutonic discipline on the flakier members of the euro area have sparked plenty of opposition. Indeed, some insiders are now saying that European leaders will not be able to resolve their differences in March. 
Fears of an adverse reaction in the markets--Portugal's position is looking precarious, with bond yields exceeding the unsustainable level of 7% over the past month--should focus minds enough to produce an agreement. But it looks unlikely to be enough to get ahead of the crisis. 
A more fundamental rethink is needed. It may be better to bite the bullet of default, starting with Greece. A recent report from Bruegel, a think-tank, concluded that Greece had become insolvent, called the current wait-and-see approach ""a dubious strategy"" and said that restructuring was necessary. The main objection to such a policy is the risk of destabilising the European banking system. But that risk could be contained, the authors argued, if banks' weaknesses were addressed following new stress tests, which get under way this month and whose results will be published in June. The idea of resolving the debt crisis through restructuring may still be anathema in official European circles, but it won't go away.","The ""grand bargain"" may prove less grand in reality than in rhetoric
FOR months now European leaders have been striving to get on top of the euro-area debt crisis. But as the deadline for a supposedly comprehensive and enduring solution nears--summits are due to be held on March 11th and March 24th--the ""grand bargain"" is looking ever less grand. A disappointing outcome will fuel market doubts about the fiscal sustainability of the most troubled euro-area economies. Those doubts remain intense. Ten-year bond yields are sky-high for Greece and Ireland, despite the bail-outs of 2010; at an intolerable level for Portugal, generally seen as next in line for a rescue; and still worryingly high for Spain (see chart).
This being a sovereign-debt crisis, politics has a habit of upsetting the tidy reckonings of market spreadsheets. The Irish election on February 25th may have delivered the predicted outcome in the shape of a new ruling coalition dominated by Fine Gael. But it also injects fresh uncertainty since Enda Kenny, the new Irish leader, has a popular mandate to revisit some of the terms of the bail-out in November. The outcome of his negotiations--chiefly with Germany, the euro area's reluctant paymaster--will in turn help shape a permanent debt-restructuring mechanism that will replace the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) when the interim rescue arrangements expire in mid-2013. 
Politics has intruded in Germany, too. Angela Merkel's ability to face down domestic opposition to a deal involving big German concessions has been undermined by the drubbing her party took in a recent regional election, and by the forced departure of her defence minister. Awkwardly, the chancellor faces an even more vital verdict from voters, in the big state of Baden-Wurttemberg, on March 27th, just after the second European summit.
Only one firm decision has so far been made in the run-up to the summitry: that the European rescue funds announced last May will actually match the original promise of EUR 500 billion ($690 billion). Hopes that the EFSF could be used to facilitate a voluntary reduction in debt, notably Greece's towering 140% of GDP, have dwindled. The idea was that it could lend funds to Greece, which would buy back its debt at market prices--ie, at a deep discount to its par value. 
On a recent visit to Berlin, George Papandreou, the Greek prime minister, pleaded for such buy-backs to be on the negotiating table. But German opposition to the notion has hardened. In late February, for instance, the Bundesbank, the country's central bank, condemned the idea as an opaque inter-governmental transfer. 
Whether buy-backs would help is in any case unclear. As Nouriel Roubini and Brad Setser, two economists, argue in ""Bail-outs or Bail-ins?"", a book drawing on the experience of debt crises in emerging economies, a determined programme to repurchase bonds would drive up their price, so reducing any relief. Removing debt held by private holders and replacing it with strict obligations to the EFSF could make an eventual restructuring harder, should that prove unavoidable.

POOR Enda Kenny. Folksy and ruddy-cheeked, the new boy from Dublin was roughed up badly by European leaders during his first outing to Brussels. The Irish prime minister caught the eye of the class bully, Nicolas Sarkozy. Nobody defended the taoiseach; even the head prefect, Angela Merkel, put the boot in.
Mr Kenny's offence? To seek help for his bankrupt country and to keep the promise he made to his voters to defend Ireland's low-tax system. At a summit of euro-zone leaders on March 11th-12th, called to launch the ""pact for the euro"" (a pledge to align members' economic policies and enhance their competitiveness,
), his plea for a cut in the interest rate Ireland pays for its EU loans irritated Mrs Merkel; the bail-out terms were agreed on just three months ago. His defence of Ireland's 12.5% corporate-tax rate annoyed Mr Sarkozy, who regards it as ""fiscal dumping"".
The Irish financial crisis has many causes, but low corporate tax was not one of them. Attracting foreign investment offers Ireland its best chance of economic recovery and of repaying its debts--a fact recognised by the euro zone when it granted the bail-out. In any case, nominal corporate-tax rates hide a complex reality. Companies in France, with a rate double that of Ireland, enjoy so many exemptions and incentives that they end up paying substantially less tax than those in Ireland. At the summit the euro zone belatedly recognised that the interest rate it charges bailed-out countries (about 3% above the cost of raising the loans in the market) sinks troubled economies further into debt.
But there is no appealing to reason. The deal was clear: to secure lower interest charges, Ireland had to back down on tax. ""We weren't very pleased with what the Irish had to offer,"" declared Mrs Merkel. Gallingly for Mr Kenny, who dared to challenge the honour code and lost, George Papandreou, his Greek counterpart, won a 1 percentage point reduction in the interest rate his indebted country must pay--apparently a reward for agreeing to an ambitious privatisation plan he had approved a month ago. 
All this betrays Mr Kenny's inexperience. He knew he would come under pressure on taxes, but brought no alternative offering to satisfy Mrs Merkel (if not Mr Sarkozy). Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the European Council (who presides over the summits), suggested Ireland should sign up to a promise of ""constructive engagement on tax co-ordination"" on the basis of the pact for the euro. This meaningless commitment was intended to offer Mr Kenny an escape route. Instead he saw it as a trap. As positions harden, it is unlikely such an offer will be renewed when leaders meet at the next summit on March 24th.
Still, for all of Mr Kenny's mistakes, the beating he received reveals something disturbing about the nature of the euro zone's ""economic government"", as Mr Sarkozy likes to call the process of economic integration, complete with now-regular summits of the euro-zone states (plus countries that wish to join the pact). The euro zone talks of competitiveness, but seeks to deny Ireland its competitive advantage. It thus gives the impression of disliking internal competition, treating low taxes to attract foreign companies as an evil to be exorcised, not a virtue to be emulated.
Such dirigiste instincts raise legitimate worries about what should be a good idea in European tax policy: this week's proposal by the European Commission to create a simplified EU-wide system of calculating and collecting corporate taxes. This is not a harmonisation of tax rates, which will remain a national prerogative, but creates an alternative tax base to enhance the single market. The Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB) would allow companies trading across the EU to set off losses in one country against profits in another. Tax would be collected by a single national authority and redistributed to treasuries according to a formula based on the group's assets, labour force and sales. It is designed to lessen the burden of filing up to 27 tax returns. It is also meant to reduce disputes over ""transfer pricing"", the means by which subsidiaries of a group seek to shift profits to where they will be taxed most favourably.
Crucially, the system would be voluntary. Each company would decide whether it wants to adopt the Europe-wide system or stick with national tax regimes. It should be most appealing to small and medium-sized companies seeking to expand beyond national boundaries, and to foreign firms that want to invest in Europe. European businesses have welcomed the proposal, as has the American Chamber of Commerce to the EU. Even a country such as Britain, which jealously guards its sovereignty on tax matters, thinks the arrangement might offer benefits.
But there are two political obstacles. One is the distribution of winners and losers in any new system of sharing out revenues. A second is the fear that a common corporate-tax base will be the first step to a common tax rate. A liberalising measure risks being turned into a protectionist tool. Given the antics of Mr Sarkozy and Mrs Merkel, can anyone blame Mr Kenny for declaring that the CCCTB is the ""back door"" to tax harmonisation? Punch or parry?
Mr Kenny should fight for Ireland's right to set its own tax policies. But not every change need be an assault on Irish independence. With his country in such a weak economic state, Mr Kenny cannot risk a bare-fisted fight with his tormentors, however much the press may want it. Instead he needs to outsmart them. 
So at the next summit in Brussels, he should declare that, in return for a cut in Ireland's interest rate, he will support the CCCTB, and challenge others to do likewise. Done properly, the plan would spur tax competition in Europe, particularly in favour of burgeoning firms, by making it clearer who offers the best tax rates. In an open and fair contest, the bullies may well decline to take on Mr Kenny. Many others will cheer him on.","By picking on Ireland, the euro zone shows a worrying side to its ""economic government""

WHEN the ancient Greeks invented the word ""crisis"" they had in mind a short period of acute stress. The modern Greeks have been experiencing crisis for over a year and no end is in sight. As Portugal this week joined Ireland and Greece in requesting international rescue funds, it would have drawn little comfort from the example in the eastern Mediterranean. The mood in Greece is one of deepening pessimism. A plan drawn up last May to sort out the country's public finances risks trapping the economy instead.
At Syntagma, the Athenian square opposite the parliament, taxi-drivers picking up fares report falls of 40% or more in custom. Bar-owners in nearby streets hassle tourists to fill seats in near-empty restaurants. In smart Kolonaki, streets are scarred by the boarded-up premises of failed shops. Tourists snap away at the Parthenon on the Acropolis but the city's prime attraction is hardly teeming. Nine hotels in the centre have closed in recent months.
The rescue plan was never going to be easy to achieve. In order to get EUR 110 billion ($155 billion) in funding from other euro-area countries and the IMF over three years, the Socialist government led by George Papandreou committed itself to a drastic austerity programme. The project envisaged a two-year stint in the economic workhouse as GDP fell and Greece regained lost competitiveness. At the same time Mr Papandreou promised to carry out a comprehensive repair of the economy's deep-seated structural flaws.
Some important reforms have certainly been made, in the teeth of protests and demonstrations. Unaffordable promises on pensions, an already high 11.6% of GDP last year, have been slashed: instead of doubling to 24% in 2050, the burden will rise by 2.5 percentage points. The labour market has become slightly more flexible through changes in arbitration arrangements and opt-outs for individual firms from collective-bargaining agreements. The government has also sought to tackle entrenched monopolies such as the trucking industry.
Whether these reforms really measure up to the gravity of Greece's plight is disputed. Yannis Stournaras, director-general of IOBE, an economic think-tank in Athens, calls the shake-up of the monopolies a qualified success. Stefanos Manos, a finance minister in the early 1990s, thinks that too little has been accomplished. The trucking reform is being phased in over two-and-a-half years. Pharmacists have retained their monopoly and continue to enjoy fat profit margins. Law firms still cannot open branches in different cities. 
But the real source of gloom is the shorter-term impact of austerity. A year ago the plan forecast that GDP would shrink by 4% in 2010 and 2.5% in 2011. Instead it fell by 4.5% last year and IOBE predicts it will decline by 3.2% in 2011. The unemployment rate has risen from 9% in mid-2009 to 14.2% in the last quarter of 2010, and is expected to average 15.5% this year (see chart 1). 
Misery was inevitable, given sharp spending cuts and big tax rises. Last year's retrenchment was on an unprecedented scale in recent European history, insists George Papaconstantinou, the finance minister, involving cuts of 15-20% in public-sector workers' pay, reductions of more than 10% in pensions and painful increases in VAT and other taxes. There is more pain to come: a three-year public-sector pay freeze and the government payroll falling from 800,000 in 2009 to 650,000 by 2013.
Even so, the fiscal figures have come in worse than planned. For one thing, the starting point was even grimmer than realised last May. Late last year the budget deficit for 2009 was revised from 13.6% of GDP to 15.4% and public debt went from 115% of GDP to 127% as a string of loss-making public enterprises were put on the government's books. For another, progress in cutting the deficit in 2010 was slower than envisaged. Provisional estimates put it at an oppressively high 10.6% of GDP rather than the original target of 8.1%. Debt is now close to 145% of GDP (see chart 2).
Measures to tackle tax evasion, for which Greece is notorious, have obvious potential to lift revenue. Mr Papaconstantinou reels off a host of initiatives, including centralisation of tax collection, which are designed to do just that. They may eventually bear fruit but as Michael Massourakis, chief economist at Alpha Bank, points out, there are no swift gains to be made because the problem is so deeply entrenched.
The fiscal setbacks have made the markets even more wary of Greek debt. Ten-year government-bond yields have climbed to almost 13%. The credit-rating agencies have recently downgraded Greek sovereign debt still further, from junk to junkier. This does not affect the government for the time being, because it can cover its financing needs this year from the rescue funds. But under last May's plan Greece was scheduled to raise about half of what it will require in 2012 from the markets. Since that looks infeasible, it will need even more official help than the EUR 110 billion already pledged. 
Greece's banks--in contrast to Ireland's--were not a cause of the country's difficulties. But they are being poisoned by the toxic public finances, not least because sovereign-debt downgrades hurt their own credit ratings. Cut off from sources of wholesale funding, they have become ever more reliant on liquidity support from the European Central Bank, now equivalent to almost a fifth of their total liabilities. Depositors are skittish and banks are having to offer them higher rates.
Higher funding costs have pushed up lending rates, but the main way that the banks' difficulties are affecting the economy is through credit rationing. Demand would be anaemic anyway but credit growth to the private sector, which ran at over 21% a year in 2006 and 2007 and a still perky 16% in 2008, has collapsed. Lending fell by 0.2% in the 12 months to January. As banks shrink their balance-sheets the squeeze on business intensifies, which in turn hurts the banks through higher loan losses. Non-performing loans have grown to 10% of the total. 
In a sign of the pressures on business, more companies quoted on the Athens stock exchange made losses last year than reported a profit. The economy is stuck in a vicious circle. If it stays weak, that will undermine the government's ability to achieve additional fiscal retrenchment; that in turn will cause further loss of confidence on the part of the markets, which will continue to lock the banks out of funding sources. Is there a way out of the trap? 
The government argues that the exit is in sight and will come, in essence, by sticking to the plan. Just as the darkest hour comes before dawn, so with the Greek economy. Mr Papaconstantinou points to some encouraging signs: a rapid growth in goods exports in recent months, a significant fall in labour costs and indications that tourism will pick up later this year. 
But even if Greece is starting to become more competitive, it still has a long way to go. The IMF estimated in March that the country's costs are 20-30% too high. Bringing them down will take time, and Greece does not have much of that. Dimitri Papalexopoulos, who runs Titan, a cement company, fears that the economy will continue to flag as private investment is stunted by lack of credit and confidence.
Many have argued that restructuring is the only answer. Winning a reprieve from the markets would certainly require something much bolder than a slightly stricter version of the same plan. One option would be to turn the commitment to raise funds through privatisation into a broader opening of the Greek economy. At a summit in March the government promised to raise as much as EUR 50 billion (22% of GDP) by selling assets in return for better terms on its European loans. 
There was immediate doubt about the seriousness of its intent, given dissent within government and from trade unions. Facing down such opposition would make full-throttle privatisation even more potent as a way of bolstering confidence. 
The bulk of the proceeds would also have to come from land sales, which could call forth another important and long-overdue reform: a land registry. The state owns more property than the private sector but no one can be sure about its precise holdings--and those of private owners--because of the lack of a proper registry except on some islands such as Rhodes (formerly occupied by Italy). Establishing a proper register, says Mr Papalexopoulos, would be ""the single most effective way to kick-start growth throughout Greece"".
All this requires firm leadership, however, and Mr Papandreou is, in the eyes of many, failing to provide it. ""The oarsmen are rowing back and forward at the same time,"" says a business boss. The optimists' view of Greece is as a giant, sun-kissed development opportunity, Florida minus the swamps. Without decisive political action the harsher judgment of the markets will be the one that prevails.","The international plan to rescue Greece is instead starting to paralyse it

There is more pain to come : a three - year public - sector pay freeze and the government payroll falling from 800,000 in 2009 to 650,000 by 2013 . 
 Even so , the fiscal figures have come in worse than planned . For one thing , the starting point was even grimmer than realised last May. Late last year the budget deficit for 2009 was revised from 13.6 % of GDP to 15.4 % and public debt went from 115 % of GDP to 127 % as a string of loss - making public enterprises were put on George W. Papandreou's books . For another , progress in cutting the deficit in 2010 was slower than envisaged . Provisional estimates put it at an oppressively high 10.6 % of GDP rather than the original target of 8.1 % . Debt is now close to 145 % of GDP ( see chart 2 ) . 
 Measures to tackle tax evasion , for which Greece is notorious , have obvious potential to lift revenue . Mr Papaconstantinou reels off a host of initiatives , including centralisation of tax collection , which are designed to do just that . They may eventually bear fruit but as Michael Massourakis , chief economist at Alpha Bank , points out , there are no swift gains to be made because the problem is so deeply entrenched . 
 The fiscal setbacks have made the markets even more wary of Greek debt . Ten - year government - bond yields have climbed to almost 13 % . The credit - rating agencies have recently downgraded Greek sovereign debt still further , from junk to junkier . This does not affect George W. Papandreou for the time being , because George W. Papandreou can cover George W. Papandreou's financing needs this year from the rescue funds . But under last May 's plan Greece was scheduled to raise about half of what it will require in 2012 from the markets . Since that looks infeasible , it will need even more official help than the EUR 110 billion already pledged . 
 Greece 's banks -- in contrast to Ireland's -- were not a cause of the country 's difficulties . But they are being poisoned by the toxic public finances , not least because sovereign - debt downgrades hurt their own credit ratings . Cut off from sources of wholesale funding , they have become ever more reliant on liquidity support from the European Central Bank , now equivalent to almost a fifth of their total liabilities . Depositors are skittish and banks are having to offer them higher rates . 
 Higher funding costs have pushed up lending rates , but the main way that the banks ' difficulties are affecting the economy is through credit rationing . Demand would be anaemic anyway but credit growth to the private sector , which ran at over 21 % a year in 2006 and 2007 and a still perky 16 % in 2008 , has collapsed . Lending fell by 0.2 % in the 12 months to January . As banks shrink their balance - sheets the squeeze on business intensifies , which in turn hurts the banks through higher loan losses . Non - performing loans have grown to 10 % of the total . 
 In a sign of the pressures on business , more companies quoted on the Athens stock exchange made losses last year than reported a profit . The economy is stuck in a vicious circle . If it stays weak , that will undermine George W. Papandreou's ability to achieve additional fiscal retrenchment ; that in turn will cause further loss of confidence on the part of the markets , which will continue to lock the banks out of funding sources . Is there a way out of the trap ? 
 George W. Papandreou argues that the exit is in sight and will come , in essence , by sticking to the plan . Just as the darkest hour comes before dawn , so with the Greek economy . Mr Papaconstantinou points to some encouraging signs : a rapid growth in goods exports in recent months , a significant fall in labour costs and indications that tourism will pick up later this year . 
 But even if Greece is starting to become more competitive , it still has a long way to go . The IMF estimated in March that the country 's costs are 20 - 30 % too high . Bringing them down will take time , and Greece does not have much of that . Dimitri Papalexopoulos , who runs Titan , a cement company , fears that the economy will continue to flag as private investment is stunted by lack of credit and confidence . 
 Many have argued that restructuring is the only answer . Winning a reprieve from the markets would certainly require something much bolder than a slightly stricter version of the same plan . One option would be to turn the commitment to raise funds through privatisation into a broader opening of the Greek economy . At a summit in March George W. Papandreou promised to raise as much as EUR 50 billion ( 22 % of GDP ) by selling assets in return for better terms on George W. Papandreou's European loans . 
 There was immediate doubt about the seriousness of George W. Papandreou's intent , given dissent within government and from trade unions . Facing down such opposition would make full - throttle privatisation even more potent as a way of bolstering confidence . 
 The bulk of the proceeds would also have to come from land sales , which could call forth another important and long - overdue reform : a land registry . George W. Papandreou owns more property than the private sector but no one can be sure about George W. Papandreou's precise holdings -- and those of private owners -- because of the lack of a proper registry except on some islands such as Rhodes ( formerly occupied by Italy ) . Establishing a proper register , says Mr Papalexopoulos , would be "" the single most effective way to kick - start growth throughout Greece "" . 
 All this requires firm leadership , however , and Mr Papandreou is , in the eyes of many , failing to provide it . "" The oarsmen are rowing back and forward at the same time , "" says a business boss . The optimists ' view of Greece is as a giant , sun - kissed development opportunity , Florida minus the swamps . Without decisive political action the harsher judgment of the markets will be the one that prevails .",350,Greece,A30-94,IN TERM,True,the Socialist government led by George Papandreou,14,True

IF APRIL is the cruellest month for poets, May is the harshest one for European leaders. A year ago they tore up the rule book to bail out Greece and to ward off market attacks on other fiscal reprobates in the euro area. The first anniversary of the rescue mission has been nothing to celebrate. Despite a year of grinding hardship Greece looks ever more likely to have to restructure its debts. The official rescue funds hastily mustered in May 2010 have had to be deployed twice more since then, first to support Ireland late last year, and now to keep Portugal afloat. 
The most pressing concern is Greece. The big hitters in the euro area--in particular Germany and the European Central Bank--are squabbling furiously about how to deal with the country's debt burden. News of a ""secret"" meeting on May 6th between finance ministers from Greece and its main euro-area creditor states leaked out along with a report that Greece might leave the euro. That claim was strenuously denied. But policymakers seem unable to agree on much else. 
The original plan in May 2010 was conceived on the notion that Greece faced an acute but temporary funding problem. A liquidity issue could be addressed by using official lending from the euro area and the IMF of EUR 110 billion ($157 billion) to replace funding from the markets, which were by then demanding punitive rates. The country would meanwhile take drastic steps to reduce its deficit. That would rebuild investor confidence and allow Greece to return to the bond markets, partially in 2012 and completely by mid-2013.
That schedule now looks hideously overoptimistic. Investors have become even more loth to provide long-term funding: ten-year bond yields now exceed 15%, compared with a peak of 12.3% a year ago. This reflects, in part, an appreciation that Greece's fiscal woes are even graver than they first appeared. The starting-point in 2009 for both debt and the deficit turned out to be worse than realised; tax revenues have proved disappointing as austerity measures have undermined growth. As a result Greek government debt at the end of last year was close to 145% of GDP and the deficit for 2010 was a colossal 10.5% of GDP, well above the original target of 8.1%. 
Even the most cohesive and determined government would be hard-pressed to get out of this kind of fiscal mess. Instead, the Socialist government of George Papandreou is split over the prospect of yet more painful reforms. There is talk of installing EU officials at Greek ministries where the most foot-dragging has occurred. The hardest task will be pushing through a EUR 50 billion privatisation programme which is openly opposed by Mr Papandreou's closest cabinet allies, Tina Birbili, the environment and energy minister, and Louka Katseli, the labour minister. 
If the sovereign-debt crisis had been confined to Greece, it could be treated as a special case that did not threaten the euro area as a whole. But that has been given the lie by the fall of Ireland and Portugal. Each of these economies had particular features that made them vulnerable. In Ireland, unlike Greece and Portugal, a toxic banking system contaminated the state's finances. In Portugal a decade of wretchedly low growth testified to problems afflicting the whole economy.
But when three different countries stumble, the claim of sui generis does too. Once safely tucked inside the euro area and benefiting from low interest rates, all three mismanaged their economies and public finances. Greece and Portugal ran huge current-account deficits while Ireland presided over a prodigious property boom that disguised underlying fiscal weaknesses through flaky housing-related revenues. In varying degrees all three lost competitiveness, as measured by unit labour costs compared with Germany's. (Much the same story can be told of Spain's far bigger economy, even though for the moment investors seem to be giving it the benefit of the doubt.)
The original diagnosis of Greece was wrong. Its fiscal malaise was too profound to be sorted out by a bridging loan. The same mistake may well be being made with the bail-outs of Ireland and Portugal: the salve of temporary liquidity support does not necessarily help countries with deeper fiscal weaknesses. 
Not before time some European countries are having second thoughts. Behind the scenes Germany has been pushing for Greece to ""reprofile"" its debt--a soft form of restructuring that would leave principal and coupon payments intact but extend bond maturities. That would not go far enough in tackling Greece's indebtedness but it would relieve other euro-area states of the need to send extra funds to Greece in 2012, and it would also protect banks that hold Greek debt in their books at par from having to take write-downs. But the European Central Bank is adamantly opposed to any form of restructuring; others are nervous, too. 
Even though it would be hard to sell to restive northern European electorates, the temptation may be to postpone the inevitable yet again with the drug of more official funds. That might calm markets in the short term. But it would leave European leaders where they have been for most of the past year--struggling to control the situation because the solution of a big haircut on Greece's debt is too unpalatable. Restructuring will be needed, and probably not just in Greece.","A bail - out strategy as bankrupt as Greece should be ditched . It probably wo n't be

STROLL through Athens of an evening and the signs of economic distress are obvious. Shops are shut. Even cheap restaurants are half-empty. But Syntagma Square--the focal point for social gatherings, concerts, rallies and riots--is full throughout the night, not with revellers but with protesters denouncing the government's austerity and the ills of capitalism.
These days the liveried doormen in Athens's finest hotels stare out at sleeveless drummers in a protest tent camp inspired by Spain's indignados. Young Greeks talk of sweeping away the kleftes (thieves) in the parliament building above, of their anger with the European Union and the IMF or, more darkly, of revolutionary violence. The prime minister, George Papandreou, has mused about reviving the debating spirit of the ancient agora, but he never imagined such a revolt. One banner demands ""George go home"" (a reference to his birthplace in America).
Greece is teetering on the edge. It is bankrupt. Worse, the austerity measures and reforms that Mr Papandreou has pushed through are not visibly making anything better. The markets are growing more alarmed about the risk of Greece defaulting on its mountainous debt. For the second time in a year, Mr Papandreou is having to beg European leaders for billions of euros in emergency loans. In return he promises even more belt-tightening, structural reform and the breakneck privatisation of state-owned firms and land. All this is causing fury among both creditors in Europe and party loyalists at home.
What has gone wrong: has Greece broken its promises to act responsibly, or is the reform programme crushing its economy? The latest EU/IMF assessment spreads the blame. Yes, the austerity-induced recession has been deeper than expected. Greece has yet to raise a single euro from fresh privatisations. And after a brisk start, reforms slowed. But European leaders, says the IMF, have made things worse by rattling the markets with ""mixed messages"" over restructuring Greek debt. The experts say Greece has been the victim of a statistical cruelty: a revision of the data showed that Greece's debt and deficit were worse than previously thought, so it has a steeper climb to recovery.
Even so, if Greece sticks to a revised programme, it should return to growth next year and enjoy a primary surplus (ie, before interest) by 2014. Greek officials point to hopeful signs: the economy grew in the first quarter, export industries are booming and, partly thanks to unrest in the Arab world, more tourists are expected this summer than last. But a closer look at the data reveals a worrying fact: despite sharp tax rises, Greece raised less money in the first four months of this year than a year ago. That is a sign, say some, that austerity is killing the economy, not curing it.
The coming weeks will be decisive. To pay its bills, Greece needs the tranche of loans due next month. They are being held up by several interconnected problems. The first is that Mr Papandreou must secure backing for a detailed reform programme. Members of his PASOK party are recalcitrant, not least because the reforms threaten the party's power-base in the unions. The opposition New Democracy (ND) party, damaged by its lies about Greece's parlous finances when it was in government, has declined calls by the EU and IMF to support ""failed"" reforms (though it supports privatisation). The IMF wants the EU to agree to a bail-out to tide Greece over the next three years, because it will not be able to tap the markets in 2012, as hoped. But Germany and the European Central Bank disagree over whether and how private creditors should share the pain.
In the end, a new rescue will be agreed. If there is one thing on which all Greek parties, including the anti-EU communists, agree it is that Greece must not leave the euro. Antonis Samaras, the ND leader, writes an imaginary banner with his hand: ""No restructuring whatsoever. Stay in the euro at any cost."" EU leaders are unlikely to let Greece go under. If their economies are too fragile to reschedule Greek debt, then they certainly cannot bear a messy default. America also wants a solution; a Greek default would be ""disastrous for us,"" Barack Obama has said.
So the EU will, as ever, muddle through. With time, the hope is, Europe's economies and banks will strengthen; Greece may seem less dire if its economy starts to grow. Economists produce graphs showing how, even with debt peaking at about 170% of GDP, Greece could pay its way. But that needs decades of high growth, tight budgets and benign interest rates. And Greece is one of Europe's most fettered economies, where politicians have piled up debt even in good times and treated the state as a source of pillage and patronage. The Balkan tiger within
Some economists argue that, precisely because the Greek economy is so sclerotic, it has great potential. Reform-minded Greeks see the crisis as an opportunity to set their country right. They quietly praise foreigners for turning the screws on their politicians. And they point to opinion polls showing that many Greeks favour privatisation, despite the cries that the country is being sold out. Yet releasing Greece's energy would take an uncharacteristic zeal for the free-market and administrative reform, squeezing out corruption, taking on unions and rioters, reaching lasting cross-party consensus for fiscal discipline and more. Can the Greeks be more Scandinavian and less Balkan?
Perhaps with decisive leadership. Yet even some of Mr Papandreou's backers think he lacks boldness. Many EU leaders also think Mr Samaras is irresponsible in his criticism of the EU-backed reforms. To have any chance of success, Greece needs a sense of national purpose. Time is short. Money is leaving the country. If the economy does not revive soon, the mood on Syntagma Square could turn even uglier.","The streets of Athens are in the grip of an ugly mood

George Papandreou, the prime minister, reshuffled his government and sought a vote of confidence to get the measures passed. With negotiations continuing over a second bail-out package for Greece, Standard & Poor's, a rating agency, downgraded the country's long-term sovereign debt to just above default status; it now has the lowest credit-rating of any country covered by S&P. 
Turkey's ruling Justice and Development (AK) party won a third consecutive general election, taking almost half the votes. But it did not secure enough seats to enable it unilaterally to rewrite the constitution, as Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the prime minister, had hoped. In his victory speech Mr Erdogan pledged to work with opposition parties, which criticised him before the election for what they say is an authoritarian ruling style. 
Italy's government was trounced in four referendums, on nuclear power, legal immunity for government ministers and two on water privatisation. The setback for Silvio Berlusconi came just weeks after the prime minister had seen his favoured candidate defeated in a mayoral election in Milan, his home town.
The Conservative-Liberal Democrat government in Britain accepted the results of an independent review into its reforms of the National Health Service. The coalition's emphasis on internal competition will be weakened and the pace of change will slow. Doctors welcomed the move; the opposition Labour Party said it was a humiliating U-turn. Meanwhile, public-sector unions promised to bring hundreds of thousands of workers out on strike in co-ordinated protests against cuts. Exiting Gates
Robert Gates, America's departing defence secretary, attacked the lack of commitment from some European members of NATO, describing the organisation as a ""two-tiered alliance"" with diminishing abilities to mount operations. Mr Gates complained that ""while every alliance member voted for the Libya mission...fewer than a third have been willing to participate in the strike mission.""
The Republicans held their first proper presidential debate, with seven candidates taking part in the proceedings in New Hampshire. Mitt Romney got off lightly, as his rivals held back from attacking the Obama-like health-insurance mandate he introduced while governor of Massachusetts. Michele Bachmann, a tea-party favourite, formally entered the race at the debate. Newt Gingrich also attended, despite the earlier mass resignation of his campaign staff.

Hugo Chavez, Venezuela's president, underwent an operation for a pelvic abscess in Cuba. 
Argentina returned cargo to the United States that it had seized from an American military aircraft in February, including satellite equipment and morphine. Although the American government said the materials were intended for a police training course, Argentine officials had accused it of trying to smuggle the goods into their country. A rocky outlook
The squabbling intensified over territory in the South China Sea. After a tussle between Chinese and Vietnamese boats, China demanded that Vietnam halt its exploration for oil around the Spratly Islands. Vietnam responded by conducting live-fire drills and drawing up plans for conscripting troops. The Philippines reasserted its claims in the Spratlys, and Taiwan announced plans to reinforce its garrison there.
Police authorities in China and Taiwan were among those of several countries that co-operated to bust a South-East Asian crime ring. Nearly 600 suspects were arrested, 177 of them in Indonesia alone. Most were Taiwanese nationals. The criminals used an array of scams to defraud their victims, who were mostly ethnic Chinese residents in six countries. 
Myanmar's army engaged one of the country's largest rebel militias in pitched battles in the north-east, where China is building a series of vast hydropower projects. Most of the fighting took place just 30km from the Chinese border. Thousands of civilians fled, most of them ethnic Kachins, and many sought refuge across the border. 
Sequenced bomb blasts in Peshawar, in north-west Pakistan, killed at least 39 people. The Pakistani Taliban denied responsibility. Afghanistan's president, Hamid Karzai, had been in Islamabad only hours earlier. 
A court in Jakarta found Abu Bakar Basyir guilty of terrorism-related charges and sentenced him to 15 years in prison. The radical Islamic cleric has previously been blamed for a number of bomb plots across Indonesia. He was jailed for conspiring in the Bali attack in 2002, but the Supreme Court eventually quashed that conviction. 
Ayman al-Zawahiri took over as al-Qaeda's new leader following the killing of Osama bin Laden by American forces in Pakistan. The organisation's former number two vowed to continue its jihad against America and Israel. No conversion in Damascus
At least 8,500 Syrians fled to Turkey after government troops backed by helicopters and tanks entered the restive town of Jisr al-Shughour, near the border. Demonstrations continued to spread across the country. Turkey castigated President Bashar Assad's regime. But the Russian and Chinese governments seemed likely to block a UN Security Council resolution condemning the crackdown.

EUROPE'S year-long attempt to grapple with the sovereign-debt crisis is becoming more nailbiting by the day. For weeks European leaders have been feuding over what to do about Greece, which clearly needs more help with its precarious public finances. But a second rescue, adding even more funding to the original bail-out in May 2010, cannot work unless the Greeks push through more painful reforms. These are now in doubt, sending tremors through financial markets and causing stockmarkets to fall around the world. 
From the nation that coined the word drama, there was plenty of it on June 15th. As a general strike took hold across the country, there were violent protests in central Athens, where tens of thousands of people had rallied. After failing to form a government of national unity, George Papandreou, the prime minister, announced that he would reshuffle his cabinet and later call a vote of confidence in parliament. The indignation of the protesters is widely shared. A recent poll published by Kathimerini, a newspaper, found that 87% of the public thought the country was heading in the wrong direction. 
The same could be said for Europe's approach to the sovereign-debt crisis, as it has spread relentlessly round the southern and western periphery of the euro area. The single-currency zone as a whole is doing well, outgrowing both America and Britain in the first three months of this year. The euro-wide budget deficit also compares favourably with that of other big advanced countries. But the debt crisis is proving intractable, partly because leading policymakers disagree about the way forward and at times seem lost themselves. Time is short. There is a summit of European leaders next week, and Greece must soon pass an austerity budget. The way it all began
With hindsight, it was no surprise that the debt crisis started in Greece, which failed to join the euro area when it was set up in 1999 because it did not meet the economic or fiscal criteria for membership. Revisions to its budgetary figures showed that it shouldn't have been allowed in when it did join, in 2001. When its debt crisis flared up last year European leaders hoped to contain it at the Greek border, providing a bail-out worth EUR 110 billion ($158 billion) over three years, of which EUR 80 billion came from other euro-area members and EUR 30 billion from the IMF. 
Any hope of containment was shattered when Ireland's banking difficulties forced a second rescue last November. After that a third bail-out became inevitable, for Portugal, as the cost of its government borrowing shot up and Portuguese banks were shut off from normal funding, coming to rely on the European Central Bank (ECB), based in Frankfurt. What caused consternation was a new shock--from Greece, again--that the first package was insufficient and that the country needed more money for longer. 
This sent European policymakers into a frenzy. Their attempts to find a solution have sometimes seemed to spring from the pages of an overwrought thriller. A secret session in early May of some of the main negotiators in Luxembourg leaked out amid official denials that it was even happening. Shortly afterwards the IMF, which has been playing a crucial role, lost its managing director when Dominique Strauss-Kahn had to resign after charges were brought against him for attempted rape in New York. Blazing rows have erupted between Jean-Claude Trichet, the usually unflappable French president of the ECB, and Wolfgang Schauble, Germany's redoubtable finance minister, over German demands to inflict some of the pain on private holders of Greek bonds and the central bank's resistance to anything that could be construed as a default.
Europe's heads of state will decide on the second Greek rescue package when they meet in Brussels on June 23rd and 24th. Help will be forthcoming only if the Greek parliament endorses the extra doses of austerity the country must swallow, together with a big programme to privatise state assets worth EUR 50 billion (20% of GDP). Assuming that Greece does buckle down despite the commotion of this week, as it has promised, it can expect to get an additional EUR 85 billion in bail-out funding that will now stretch to 2014. 
How much of this will have to come from taxpayers? The answer hinges on how far private creditors who have lent to the Greek government can be made to ""participate"", a euphemism for picking up some of the bill. The Germans have been pressing hard for debt maturities to be extended; the ECB has been adamantly opposed to such a policy, although it may accept a promise by bondholders to buy new bonds when the existing ones mature. Worries about a possible restructuring led Standard & Poor's to downgrade Greek government debt this week from B to CCC, making it the credit-rating agency's lowest-rated sovereign debt in the world. 
Already the prolonged irresolution of European leaders about a second Greek bail-out has increased uncertainty for investors and businesses. If they make a false move, the repercussions will affect not just Europeans but Americans too, and indeed the global economy. President Barack Obama recently said that America's growth depends on a successful resolution of the Greek crisis; an uncontrolled default (the first in an advanced country since 1948) would be disastrous. The risk of contagion to other countries through banking losses, which prompted the original rescue, remains acute, not least since the markets would immediately fret about Ireland and Portugal falling in turn. Worries would be rekindled, too, about Spain, which has so far managed to avoid needing a bail-out.
But a still bigger issue is at stake. Even if the European Council manages to cobble together a compromise that buys time for Greece, the fear is that Europe's bold experiment--creating a monetary union among diverse economies without the underpinning of a fiscal union--may have been too audacious. If it founders, this would be an extraordinary setback for the larger cause of European integration. Charlemagne's coin
Europe's creation of a single currency remains both futuristic and weighted with history. At a conference about the ECB on June 10th, Volker Wieland, an economist at Goethe University in Frankfurt, said that the euro was the first venture on such a scale in Europe since Charlemagne created a single currency in his empire in 794. In more recent history central banks have capped political unions--as when the Reichsbank was founded in 1876 in the aftermath of Bismarck's unification of Germany through ""blood and iron"". 
The ECB, by contrast, is a supranational institution, although it emerged from an old-fashioned Franco-German deal. The French wanted to fetter German power--in particular the dominance of the German central bank in European monetary policy--after its second unification, in 1990, following the fall of the Berlin Wall. The Germans believed the ECB could be their Bundesbank writ large. Along with these political objectives, the single currency was expected to produce economic gains by eliminating the nuisance and cost of having to change money within Europe, removing exchange-rate uncertainty within the euro area and enhancing price stability. The mantra of its proponents was ""one market, one money"". The single currency would reinforce the single market, emerging from reforms in the late 1980s and the early 1990s to open national economies to Europe-wide competition.
A stand-alone monetary union without the usual fiscal and political foundations was conceived at the momentous Maastricht summit in December 1991. The treaty set ""convergence"" criteria, such as low enough inflation and long-term interest rates, to check whether countries were economically fit enough to join the single currency. These also included fiscal criteria, notably ceilings for budget deficits of 3% of GDP and for public debt of 60%. The treaty stipulated that there would be no bail-out of a country that got into fiscal trouble.
But the rules were less strict than they appeared. Belgium and Italy were allowed to join the euro at the outset, even though their debt exceeded not 60% but 100% of GDP--because that debt was falling. Economic convergence at one point in time also proved misleading. What determines whether a country can survive, let alone thrive, in a monetary union is flexibility in both labour and product markets, since it can no longer realign its costs by devaluing. 
As for the fiscal tests, what was to stop countries from misbehaving once they had joined? The answer, tacked on in the late 1990s to the Maastricht criteria, was a ""stability and growth pact"" to reinforce responsible public finances within the euro area. But this too was watered down in 2005, largely at the insistence of France and Germany, after they themselves faced possible sanctions for breaching the budget-deficit limit.
None of this seemed to matter during the first few years of the monetary union. While Germany went through a weak patch, the peripheral economies (Portugal excepted) flourished, thanks to the low interest rates that euro membership brought them. The elimination of exchange-rate risk unleashed cross-border lending, which built up large exposures among the banks in the lending countries while debt piled up in the borrowing countries. 
The lending was on lax terms. Credit markets paid no heed to the risks that were building up from sustained big current-account deficits, which would have caused alarm in emerging economies (see chart 1). They smiled on Ireland's property boom, overlooked Portugal's slack growth and forgave Greece its poor public finances. Spain also benefited from dirt-cheap money even though it shared many of the same weaknesses, notably a housing-market bubble and a huge current-account deficit. Weakness exposed
The flood of easy money disguised the hard truth that the competitiveness of the peripheral economies, gauged by measures like unit labour costs, had steadily worsened after joining the euro. This deterioration came from a poor starting-point, for Greece in particular. As one senior negotiator in the bail-out talks laments, Greece is part of the single-currency area even though it has managed in effect to stay out of the single market. With the lowest exports-to-GDP ratio in the euro area, membership became a way to import cheap goods on the never-never rather than a means to foster higher productivity. Ireland, with exports now roughly equal to GDP, is quite different, but Portugal also has a lowish exports-to-GDP ratio for a small economy within a single-currency zone and, like Greece, has insulated much of its economy from the single market.
Once the credit machine went into reverse as the financial crisis broke in the summer of 2007, the underlying weaknesses of the peripheral economies were exposed. The debt that had piled up in the good years became oppressive once lenders scented trouble. Spreads on government bonds over safe German Bunds, which had earlier narrowed to wafer-thin margins, ballooned out (see chart 2). Ireland had what looked like impeccable public finances, with government debt as low as 25% of GDP in 2007, but these were flattered by swollen property-market taxes and then swamped by the costs of propping up banks that had gone on a bender, the bill for which is now reckoned at 42% of national output. As a result, the debt burden will reach 112% this year, according to the European Commission's May forecast. Portugal's, too, will vault above 100% of GDP, while Greece's will rise to almost 160% (see chart 3).
Fundamentally, then, the crisis that has engulfed three countries is rooted in a severe loss of competitiveness combined with levels of public debt that look unsustainable in the case of Greece and worryingly close to that for Ireland and Portugal. The rescue packages are accordingly trying to shake up the sclerotic economies of Greece and Portugal through sweeping changes to liberalise markets controlled by producer interests. The priority for Ireland's more flexible economy, which has been regaining some of its lost competitive ground, is to finish healing its banks. All three economies are having to push through harsh austerity measures to create primary budget surpluses (ie, before interest payments) that will stabilise debt. As long as the three live up to their side of the bargain, the European creditor nations, led by Germany, have been prepared to provide bridging finance. Voter resistance
The bail-out strategy made some sense in May 2010, since banking systems were still weak after the convulsions of 2008, exposures to Greek debt were not well mapped out and private creditors had had little time to adjust their positions. But it has lost credibility over the past year as Ireland and Portugal have also succumbed, and as markets have concluded that a bail-out will fail to put Greek debt, in particular, on a sustainable path. 
Inherently, there are two conflicting economic tensions in the rescue packages. The first is that the austerity programmes needed to cut deficits are killing the growth needed to make debt bearable. If Greece had got into trouble outside the euro, the drachma would have fallen, creating an external offsetting boost to the economy by making exports cheaper and curbing imports. The other inherent tension is that the steps needed to improve competitiveness within the euro require prices and wages to be held down, making it even harder to cope with debt. 
There are also conflicting political forces within both the borrowing and lending countries. The Greeks are not alone in feeling resentful about having to pay so high a price for past misdemeanours. Many Irish now see themselves as victims, paying a penalty for having done a favour to other European countries by propping up their banks and thus preventing losses by foreign bondholders that had lent to them. If the mood turns sourer, it may be harder for the new Irish government led by Enda Kenny to push through the further austerity that is needed.
Lender countries are also becoming restive. The recent general election in Finland propelled a loan-refusenik party, the True Finns, to third place in the polls. In Germany a majority of the public thinks that the original rescue of Greece was a mistake. On June 10th the ZDF Politbarometer showed 60% rejecting further assistance and only 33% backing it. A poll in April showed an overwhelming majority fearful that more countries than Greece, Ireland and Portugal will require help. 
This stroppiness means that one solution to the debt crisis is a non-starter. Sharing budgetary resources, either through direct transfers or through the issue of ""E-bonds"" underwritten by the euro area's taxpayers, is anathema in Germany, where the notion of a ""transfer union"" in which the better-off subsidise the worse-off is political poison, not least because of the vast transfers from western to eastern Germany since reunification. Northern taxpayers would also recoil from the idea of a future ""ministry of finance of the union"" which Mr Trichet recently floated. 
An alternative course would be to try to make a ""no bail-out"" model work. Jordi Gali, an economist at Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona, would ban collective rescues and stop trying to patrol euro-area states through debt and deficit limits. Instead he would leave the job of policing their public finances to investors. This would require recapitalisation of European banks so that they could withstand sovereign defaults, but that is not the only snag. The pass has already been sold. Investors know that when a banking crisis looms, European governments will flinch and extend taxpayer support.
Both these courses of action at least offer clear paths forward. By contrast, the long-term reforms set out by European leaders in March fall short of the comprehensive solution they purported to provide. Under a ""pact for the euro"" there will be economic and fiscal workouts that will allow countries to cope better with the rigours of monetary union--including, for example, greater wage flexibility. They will have to put into law their determination to get a grip on public finances. The temporary support measures will be turned into a permanent ""stability mechanism"" with an effective lending capacity of EUR 500 billion that will be available to countries only if their debt is deemed sustainable. Private bondholders are served notice that they will be at risk from mid-2013 when the new regime comes into force. 
In effect the reforms formalise the bail-out strategy, but try to ensure it will not have to be used again and leave open the possibility of restructuring. One objection is that the pressure remains on deficit countries within the euro area to put their houses in order, whereas none is brought to bear on surplus countries such as Germany. But the bigger worry is that the reforms will be overtaken by events.
The European summit on June 24th seems unlikely to get on top of things. Even if private bondholders can be made to share in some of the pain by rolling over their debts, this will still leave Greek public indebtedness unsustainably high. As long as that is so, markets will continue to bet on an eventual default. The pre-summit wrangling has only served to underline the extreme difficulty of reaching any solution that can be sold successfully to voters. The Greek protests have forcibly made the point that debt sustainability is ultimately a matter of political resolve. 
At best, European leaders may buy more time. But the markets have a different timetable from the politicians, and their scepticism may continue to undermine the weaker economies by hurting their banks. Though the ministers will doubtless go on talking, it is increasingly hard to see a safe way out of this crisis.

All three economies are having to push through harsh austerity measures to create primary budget surpluses ( ie , before interest payments ) that will stabilise debt . As long as the three live up to their side of the bargain , the European creditor nations , led by Germany , have been prepared to provide bridging finance . Voter resistance 
 The bail - out strategy made some sense in May 2010 , since banking systems were still weak after the convulsions of 2008 , exposures to Greek debt were not well mapped out and private creditors had had little time to adjust their positions . But it has lost credibility over the past year as Ireland and Portugal have also succumbed , and as markets have concluded that a bail - out will fail to put Greek debt , in particular , on a sustainable path . 
 Inherently , there are two conflicting economic tensions in the rescue packages . The first is that the austerity programmes needed to cut deficits are killing the growth needed to make debt bearable . If Greece had got into trouble outside the euro , the drachma would have fallen , creating an external offsetting boost to the economy by making exports cheaper and curbing imports . The other inherent tension is that the steps needed to improve competitiveness within the euro require prices and wages to be held down , making it even harder to cope with debt . 
 There are also conflicting political forces within both the borrowing and lending countries . The Greeks are not alone in feeling resentful about having to pay so high a price for past misdemeanours . Many Irish now see themselves as victims , paying a penalty for having done a favour to other European countries by propping up their banks and thus preventing losses by foreign bondholders that had lent to them . If the mood turns sourer , it may be harder for the new Irish government led by Enda Kenny to push through the further austerity that is needed . 
 Lender countries are also becoming restive . The recent general election in Finland propelled a loan - refusenik party , the True Finns , to third place in the polls . In Germany a majority of the public thinks that the original rescue of Greece was a mistake . On June 10th the ZDF Politbarometer showed 60 % rejecting further assistance and only 33 % backing it . A poll in April showed an overwhelming majority fearful that more countries than Greece , Ireland and Portugal will require help . 
 This stroppiness means that one solution to the debt crisis is a non - starter . Sharing budgetary resources , either through direct transfers or through the issue of "" E - bonds "" underwritten by the euro area 's taxpayers , is anathema in Germany , where the notion of a "" transfer union "" in which the better - off subsidise the worse - off is political poison , not least because of the vast transfers from western to eastern Germany since reunification . Northern taxpayers would also recoil from the idea of a future "" ministry of finance of the union "" which Mr Trichet recently floated . 
 An alternative course would be to try to make a "" no bail - out "" model work . Jordi Gali , an economist at Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona , would ban collective rescues and stop trying to patrol euro - area states through debt and deficit limits . Instead he would leave the job of policing their public finances to investors . This would require recapitalisation of European banks so that they could withstand sovereign defaults , but that is not the only snag . The pass has already been sold . Investors know that when a banking crisis looms , European governments will flinch and extend taxpayer support . 
 Both these courses of action at least offer clear paths forward . By contrast , the long - term reforms set out by European leaders in March fall short of the comprehensive solution they purported to provide . Under a "" pact for the euro "" there will be economic and fiscal workouts that will allow countries to cope better with the rigours of monetary union -- including , for example , greater wage flexibility . They will have to put into law their determination to get a grip on public finances . The temporary support measures will be turned into a permanent "" stability mechanism "" with an effective lending capacity of EUR 500 billion that will be available to countries only if their debt is deemed sustainable . Private bondholders are served notice that they will be at risk from mid-2013 when the new regime comes into force . 
 In effect the reforms formalise the bail - out strategy , but try to ensure it will not have to be used again and leave open the possibility of restructuring . One objection is that the pressure remains on deficit countries within the euro area to put their houses in order , whereas none is brought to bear on surplus countries such as Germany . But the bigger worry is that the reforms will be overtaken by events . 
 The European summit on June 24th seems unlikely to get on top of things . Even if private bondholders can be made to share in some of the pain by rolling over their debts , this will still leave Greek public indebtedness unsustainably high . As long as that is so , markets will continue to bet on an eventual default . The pre - summit wrangling has only served to underline the extreme difficulty of reaching any solution that can be sold successfully to voters . The Greek protests have forcibly made the point that debt sustainability is ultimately a matter of political resolve . 
 At best , European leaders may buy more time . But the markets have a different timetable from the politicians , and their scepticism may continue to undermine the weaker economies by hurting their banks . Though the ministers will doubtless go on talking , it is increasingly hard to see a safe way out of this crisis .

IN THE middle of Syntagma Square in central Athens, flanked on one side by parliament and on another by luxury hotels, would-be revolutionaries jostle for space with phlegmatic African street-traders selling handbags. On June 22nd one group of youngsters conducted a spontaneous ""economics lesson"" in which terms such as ""credit event"" and ""haircut"" were explained and deconstructed. Petrograd 1917, or even Paris 1968, it was not.
Nonetheless, the stakes are very high. It is entirely possible that in the weeks to come the situation in Athens could go from being strained, angry and confused to plain catastrophic: negotiations between Greece's economic rescuers and its political leaders may fail, and the state may run out of money and/or crash out of the euro, triggering a financial crisis that would reverberate round the world. 
Even if that were avoided, Greece's fundamental problems would hardly improve. For the country is not just bust, it is deeply uncompetitive, and dealing with that will require years of painful reforms. 
But those gritty realities seem to have escaped most of the actors in the drama which is unfolding inside and outside the Greek parliament. In time-honoured fashion, the country's political parties are jockeying for advantage, with little regard for the disaster that they might help to bring about. Meanwhile, the demonstrators outside are chanting slogans implying that the happy days of living well on borrowed money can come back if they only shout loud enough, and if the ""traitors"" and ""thieves"" who spoiled the party are given their just deserts. 
In the short term, the Socialist government has gained some breathing space in its struggle to endure the twin pressures of popular discontent (over the austerity already imposed) and international demands for reform. The ruling party's fractious legislators, galvanised by fears they might lose power, rallied behind George Papandreou, the prime minister, in the early hours of June 22nd to give his new cabinet a vote of confidence. All 155 Socialists turned out for the roll-call vote, which went strictly along party lines.
Minutes before the vote the opposition walked out because of a noisy, petty argument over whether ""democracy"" had returned to Greece in 1974, when the military dictatorship fell, or in 1981 when the first left-of-centre administration was elected. Mr Papandreou managed to coax his opponents back by pointing out what an appalling impression such squabbles make on the rest of the world at such a grave hour in the country's history. 
New Democracy, the centre-right opposition party, is withholding support for an internationally agreed austerity and privatisation plan on the ground that it can and should be renegotiated, with more emphasis on tax cuts. Few people outside Greece see much scope for that. But some of the government's critics, especially on the left, gleefully observed that Greece's international partners seemed to soften their stance slightly around June 15th, when street protests came to a head and the country looked ungovernable. 
This week's small successes for the government left the anti-austerity protesters outside parliament unimpressed. They said they were issuing their own vote of no confidence in the country's entire political class. Admittedly, their four-week-old tent village (modelled on the Spanish version) looks scruffier by the day. But the protesters say they will stick it out at least until the next critical vote, on a five-year austerity package intended to prevent a default and put the country on the road to recovery. They are planning a ""day of action"" as the vote takes place.
Regardless of the atmosphere on the streets, there are big question-marks over Greece's future. The current EUR 110 billion ($159 billion) bail-out package from its European partners and the International Monetary Fund will not be enough. Mr Papandreou is betting that the EU and the IMF will come up with another EUR 100 billion (or so) to keep the country going until well into 2014, when, perhaps, it can move seamlessly into the EU's new stability mechanism for propping up fiscal miscreants. 
The vote reassured anxious European bureaucrats who have been relying on Mr Papandreou to impose fiscal discipline, setting aside his ""soft"" Socialist credentials. The prime minister had already won a standing ovation from his Panhellenic Socialist Movement's (Pasok's) parliamentary group after reneging on an earlier suggestion that he might make way for a non-political premier--Lucas Papademos, a respected former deputy president of the European Central Bank--and a group of technocrats to handle the next crucial round of reform. 
Some of Mr Papandreou's party faithful were riled by the fact that he mooted the idea of a national-unity government at a meeting with Antonis Samaras, the leader of New Democracy, before he had cleared it with his Socialist colleagues. Aides to Mr Papandreou say his proposal to Mr Samaras, made in the highest interests of the country, was torpedoed within hours when New Democracy leaked the content of their discussion to the press. So it was clear enough who had acted in a statesmanlike way, and who was playing small-time politics. Tough men to the fore
The prime minister moved quickly to shore up his own position within the party by promoting some old Socialist warhorses and dispensing with some young proteges who were seen as personal friends. Out went Tina Birbili, the environment and energy minister, who opposed privatisation of the state electricity company, and Dimitris Droutsas, whose youth and inexperience had made him a surprising choice as foreign minister. Also demoted was Louka Katseli, an American-trained economist who, as labour minister, had got involved in public disagreements with number-crunchers from the IMF. 
Into the forefront of politics came a group of tough Socialists led by Evangelos Venizelos, formerly the defence minister, who has now been appointed finance minister. Mr Venizelos was once a rival of Mr Papandreou's, challenging him unsuccessfully for the party leadership after Pasok's 2007 election defeat. The burly constitutional lawyer, a powerful orator whose manner is both earthy and cerebral, took over from George Papaconstantinou, a technocratic figure who had become a liability because of his indefatigable efforts to carry out EU- and IMF-mandated reforms to the letter. 
Mr Venizelos has held seven previous cabinet posts; he oversaw preparations for the 2004 Athens Olympics, which were considered a huge success in spite of serious cost overruns and a graveyard of white-elephant buildings left behind. In a passionate speech during the confidence vote, he caught public attention by saying that whatever the numbers might show, the government understood how desperate things were for many ordinary folk. 
On the debit side, Mr Venizelos has never held a finance portfolio. And he annoyed his colleagues at his first meeting of euro-area finance ministers by suggesting, in a piece of posturing, that the euro zone needed Greece just as much as Greece needed the zone (see Charlemagne). 
Will the new cabinet prove any more effective at reforming? The lenders' demands seem huge: cutting 150,000 public jobs and raising EUR 50 billion from privatisation sales by 2015. Job protection in the public sector and keeping control of state-owned utilities are two of Pasok's most cherished sacred cows. Mr Venizelos may chip away at the edges by closing down some outdated state entities and selling shares in some profitable state companies. But the sweeping changes required by the EU and the IMF are unlikely to happen, at least in the short term. 
Mr Samaras, as opposition leader, has taken an equivocal position. He argues that the medium-term budget targets are correct, but the methods proposed to hit them are wrong. The economy, he says, has already been squeezed to the point of collapsing. 
The depth of Greece's recession, with the economy set to shrink by another 3.8-4% this year--more than projected--after dwindling by 4.5% in 2010, suggests that Mr Samaras has a point. The conservatives voted for more than a dozen pieces of legislation required under the current bail-out, but are insistent that they will vote against the new package. This stance infuriates both the EU and the IMF, who worry that if Greece's fractious politicians cannot unite even when bankruptcy threatens, then they have little chance of avoiding that fate. Summer's respite
The stakes are rising. Greece needs to get a EUR 12 billion loan tranche by mid-July or risk being unable to pay wages and pensions at the end of the month. EU and IMF officials arrived on June 22nd to help fine-tune EUR 6 billion of emergency fiscal measures aimed at bringing this year's budget back on track, as well as the EUR 22 billion medium-term package--just as Mr Venizelos and Mr Papaconstantinou, now the energy minister, were tweaking some unpopular measures to make them more palatable to voters. Mistrust between Greece and its international lenders runs high, after months of near-standstill in Athens on the reform effort. 
With his new government in place, Mr Papandreou has a good chance of winning the votes on the new package and an enabling law to ensure that individual measures can be implemented quickly. Greeks will then start feeling moderately hopeful that euro-zone finance ministers will sign off on the July loan tranche and, if all goes better than expected, even reach a deal on the second, EUR 100 billion-odd bail-out loan for their country. 
The political mood in Greece improves almost automatically in July and August as the urban population heads en masse for family villages in the islands or mountains. There are few human woes that cannot be eased a little by exposure to the dreamlike beauty of the Aegean. But this year may yet prove an exception, especially if politicians and protesters alike insist on behaving as if they lived almost anywhere except on planet Earth.

 The depth of Greece 's recession , with the economy set to shrink by another 3.8 - 4 % this year -- more than projected -- after dwindling by 4.5 % in 2010 , suggests that Mr Samaras has a point . The conservatives voted for more than a dozen pieces of legislation required under the current bail - out , but are insistent that they will vote against the new package . This stance infuriates both the EU and the IMF , who worry that if Greece 's fractious politicians can not unite even when bankruptcy threatens , then they have little chance of avoiding that fate . Summer 's respite 
 The stakes are rising . Greece needs to get a EUR 12 billion loan tranche by mid - July or risk being unable to pay wages and pensions at the end of the month . EU and IMF officials arrived on June 22nd to help fine - tune EUR 6 billion of emergency fiscal measures aimed at bringing this year 's budget back on track , as well as the EUR 22 billion medium - term package -- just as Mr Venizelos and Mr Papaconstantinou , now the energy minister , were tweaking some unpopular measures to make them more palatable to voters . Mistrust between Greece and its international lenders runs high , after months of near - standstill in Athens on the reform effort . 
 With his new government in place , Mr Papandreou has a good chance of winning the votes on the new package and an enabling law to ensure that individual measures can be implemented quickly . Greeks will then start feeling moderately hopeful that euro - zone finance ministers will sign off on the July loan tranche and , if all goes better than expected , even reach a deal on the second , EUR 100 billion - odd bail - out loan for their country . 
 The political mood in Greece improves almost automatically in July and August as the urban population heads en masse for family villages in the islands or mountains . There are few human woes that can not be eased a little by exposure to the dreamlike beauty of the Aegean . But this year may yet prove an exception , especially if politicians and protesters alike insist on behaving as if they lived almost anywhere except on planet Earth .

THE streets of Berlin are quieter than those of Athens, but the euro crisis is making life almost as hellish for the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, as it is for the Greek prime minister, George Papandreou. Partly because of it, Mrs Merkel is going through her ""roughest patch so far"" in more than five years in office, says Renate Kocher of Allensbach, a pollster. Members of her coalition, consisting of her Christian Democratic Union (CDU), its Bavarian sibling, the Christian Social Union, and the liberal Free Democratic Party, are restive about the costs of saving the currency. The opposition is openly speculating, prematurely, that the government may fall. 
The immediate danger is the wrangle over a second rescue for Greece. On June 10th the Bundestag endorsed a bail-out on condition that private investors make a ""fair contribution"". Even then, ten legislators from the coalition either voted no or abstained, a worrying dent in the government's 20-vote majority. Since then, Mrs Merkel's room for manoeuvre has narrowed. On June 17th, under French pressure, she endorsed the non-confrontational ""Vienna"" model, under which Greece's creditors are expected voluntarily to buy new Greek bonds as old ones fall due. That makes it less likely that they will make the large contribution that Mrs Merkel's parliamentary allies are demanding.
Television images of Greeks haranguing their government over reforms do not help. The protests make it ""very difficult for MPs to explain the rescue measures to voters"", says Klaus-Peter Flosbach, the CDU's fiscal-policy spokesman in the Bundestag. Nearly half the electorate favours throwing Greece out of the euro, according to a recent poll. Depending on how it is structured, the Greek rescue may not need explicit approval by the Bundestag, but there will be pressure to bring it to a vote. If that happens the coalition will support it, believes Mr Flosbach. ""The MPs know what is at stake."" The mood is fiercer in Finland and the Netherlands, which have influential Eurosceptic parties, German officials point out.
Even if the Greek hurdle is overcome, others loom. The Bundestag will vote later this year on whether to top up the temporary European Financial Stability Facility, which helped to finance the Irish and Portuguese bail-outs, and to create a permanent successor, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). Many coalition MPs want every ESM rescue put to a parliamentary vote, which would make it unworkable. Germany's highest court is deliberating on complaints that the bail-outs violate the constitution and European law. 
Mrs Merkel sees herself as steering between catastrophic alternatives. Hawkish demands for imposing losses on creditors or submitting every future bail-out to parliamentary scrutiny could endanger the euro. But the doveish idea that only ""more Europe"" will resolve the crisis is also distasteful. Mrs Merkel rejects fixes such as a finance minister for the euro area (an idea floated by Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank) or ""Eurobonds"" backed by every country in the zone. To spectators on both sides her cautious middle course, with its many abrupt corrections, looks directionless, defensive and eventually doomed.

EVANGELOS VENIZELOS is a big man, built more like a rugby forward than a bookish finance minister. As the politician now charged with fixing Greece's broken finances, he will need to muster all his strength. On his first outing to meet European colleagues in Luxembourg this week he found himself like a prop pinned under a ruck, with studs tearing into his flesh.
The inexperienced Mr Venizelos left himself dangerously exposed. He tried to reopen the austerity and labour-reform package, particularly the pace of privatisation, that is a condition for receiving more bail-out money and saving Greece from default. He suggested the parliament might not meet a deadline to approve the measures by the end of the month. Worst of all, Mr Venizelos insinuated that other Europeans had no choice but to save his country because a default would be more painful for the euro zone than for Greece. Boots and fists were soon flying.
Still, he had a point. For months now, the European Central Bank and European Commission (and, more quietly, parts of the IMF and the Americans) have been urging ministers not to entertain even a modest restructuring of Greek debt, let alone a full-blown default, for fear of disastrous contagion. With signs of trouble spreading to other countries, including Spain and Italy, the words ""Lehman Brothers"" are uttered ever more often. The dilemma is summed up by Keynes's adage: ""If I owe you a pound, I have a problem; but if I owe you a million, the problem is yours.""
The assumption is still that the euro zone will somehow muddle through, at least for a while. George Papandreou, the Greek prime minister, won a vote of confidence this week, raising hopes that his reform programme, perhaps with some tinkering, will be approved by the end of the month. Euro-zone finance ministers are due to meet on July 3rd to endorse the next tranche of loans, worth EUR 12 billion ($17 billion), followed days later by approval from the IMF. Greece should then stagger on until September. These days, European ministers are no longer trying to gain a few more years; a few months or even weeks will do. ""They keep kicking the can down the road, but the can is getting heavier,"" comments one high-level diplomat. 
By autumn, euro-zone ministers expect to have finalised a second bail-out for Greece that will protect it until 2014. At that point, claim the EU's and IMF's economists, Greece will have returned to growth and reached a primary budget surplus (ie, it will raise more revenue than it spends, before interest). Officials say repaying the vast debt will be ""difficult but not impossible"". They have to affect optimism: as they try to save Greece from default today, they can hardly admit that it is sure to default tomorrow.
But even if ultimate salvation is possible, Greece could fall into plenty of immediate traps. One is the mood at home, with almost daily mass protests outside parliament, interspersed with riots. What if Mr Papandreou cannot get a majority for unpopular reforms? Another is the sternness of the IMF, which says it cannot release next month's tranche of money before it knows that the euro zone will fully fund Greece next year. A third is the mood of creditor countries such as Germany, which have been insisting on a ""substantial"" contribution by private bondholders. After much argument, this is now supposed to be done ""voluntarily"" by rolling over the debt at maturity. But nobody really knows how much room this can create. 
All this is knotted up. Without sufficient private-sector help, some countries say they will not give more money; without certainty about who pays for what, the IMF says it cannot release the funds; without the IMF, the euro zone cannot pay either; and without more tranches of help, Greece will default. 
Even if Greece can be salvaged, attention is turning to the long-term survival of the euro. To Eurosceptics, notably British ones, it should be given up as a bad job. The tragedy of Greece is the inevitable outcome of EU leaders' hubris in imposing a single currency and a single interest rate on incompatible economies. Disunited states of Europe
For Euro-federalists, such as Guy Verhofstadt, a former Belgian prime minister, the answer is to move towards a United States of Europe. Even an American such as John Lipsky, the acting head of the IMF, called on Europeans to rediscover the dream of integration. Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the ECB, says that one day there should be a European finance ministry to co-ordinate fiscal policies. He argues that the euro's performance is comparable to that of the dollar and that growth per head, price stability and even the extent of economic divergence are broadly similar in America and the euro zone. Indeed, the euro zone's aggregate deficit and debt levels are healthier than America's.
But the comparison is flawed. The euro zone is not a federal state. Its key decisions are national, and hence agonisingly slow. Fiscal transfers within the EU are far smaller than in America, so cannot help countries absorb sudden shocks. For Germany, especially, the idea of a ""transfer union"" is anathema. It is willing to transfer rules on fiscal discipline and the labour reforms that helped it regain competitiveness. But the idea of closer fiscal integration will not go away. The European Commission has promised to study how countries might issue common Eurobonds.
Whether it is through tougher rules that shift economic powers to Brussels, or perhaps one day a bigger fiscal union, the crisis is forcing the euro zone into more integration. As one Eurocrat puts it, ""We are speleologists trapped in a tunnel. We cannot go backwards; we can only go forward."" But the risk is that, in trying to avert the break-up of the euro, leaders will create a bigger political backlash, against both themselves and the EU. Mr Venizelos knows it. His rescuers know it. That is why they have been at each others' throats.","The euro zone 's leaders are seeing their political choices narrow

THEY had been warned. As Greece's 300 legislators debated, and finally approved, an internationally backed financial-rescue plan with many clear downsides--it will pile pain onto hapless firms and citizens who already pay taxes, for instance, and so subsidise those who do not--some dire pronouncements on the possible consequences of saying ""no"" to the world were ringing in their ears.
A group of 18 Greek economists (mostly from the nation's academic diaspora, in flight from the cronyism and disorder that mar campuses back home) listed some of the likely results if the country opted for autarky: in other words, if it stopped paying its debt and rejected the idea of moving, with foreign help, towards fiscal and administrative health. Public-sector wages would plunge, banks would crash, the country would be barred from world debt markets for years. Leaving the euro could cause hyperinflation. 
Theodoros Pangalos, the famously blunt deputy prime minister, put it even more starkly. If Greece were to break with its would-be saviours and launch a new drachma, local banks would be besieged by panicked depositors and the army would have to keep order. ""The shops will empty, and some people will jump out of windows,"" he told El Mundo, a Spanish daily. (Last year Mr Pangalos irked some compatriots, and impressed others, by saying that ordinary Greeks, as well as the political elite, had wasted the loans and subsidies that rained down on the country: ""We ate it up together."") 
Dire as these warnings sounded, this week the country still seemed finely balanced between those ready to embrace change and those who apparently dread it so much that they might bring the entire house down rather than risk any damage to their own interests. Alexis Papahelas, editor of Kathimerini, Greece's newspaper of record, has coined the term ""coalition of the unwilling"" to describe the array of ultra-leftist and ultra-traditionalist forces bent on blocking reform. As he has noted, the number of citizens sullenly suspicious of all change may now increase, as middle-class Greeks see their hard-earned prosperity go up in smoke. 
On the other hand the country does have a constituency of modernisers: people depressed by interrelated woes, including a malfunctioning justice system, a kleptocratic civil service and impunity for the corrupt. Stathis Theodorakis, a television host and founder of www.protagon.gr, a popular website, says he finds keen interest among the public in various reforms that the mainstream parties would never dare to embrace: from liberalising drug laws to cleaning up the police. 
And for people enraged by the impunity of the well-connected, there was satisfaction this week at the uncovering of a huge match-fixing scam in Greek football. Two club chairmen were among those arrested, as police said they had amassed a 90,000-page dossier on the affair and were investigating 85 people, from players to bookmakers. ""There is a direct link between what is happening in football and broader Greek society,"" said Pavlos Yeroulanos, the culture and sport minister. 
If only Greece's broader woes were as easy to put right. As parliamentarians bickered and police battled demonstrators outside, rolling power cuts were imposed across the country because of a two-week-old strike by workers at the Public Power Corporation, whose powerful and privileged union is high on many people's list of impediments to sensible change. Also affected by a strike, timed to coincide with the debate on the so-called medium-term rescue plan agreed on with the European Union and the IMF, were schools and hospitals. Flights were disrupted by a stoppage of air-traffic controllers, and tourists were prevented from boarding ferries to the islands because of a picket by the communist labour movement, PAME. 
This will be only a small dent, perhaps, to the confidence of Greek tour operators, who say arrivals are slightly up this year, albeit not as much as in destinations like Turkey and Cyprus. The mood on popular Aegean islands remains quite upbeat, despite a rise in panic sales of gaudy new second homes which had drawn the attention of tax collectors. Still, there is only so much tear-gas that visitors to the museums and ancient sites of downtown Athens can be expected to ingest. 
Many of the malcontents--whether in unions, or the more spontaneous protesters of many ideological hues, encamped near parliament--say they were demonstrating against an entire political class; or at least the ruling Socialists and their centre-right opponents, New Democracy. One banner outside parliament asked ""how many pieces of silver"" politicians have taken to sell the nation. 
If such protests implied a mature rejection of the country's political order, that would be encouraging. As Nikos Mouzelis, a sociologist, points out, Greece's two big parties have become machines for dispensing patronage and pork on a scale that is amazing even by the standards of Mediterranean democracy. 
Can anything be done, apart from economic plans designed to stave off short-term disaster? George Papandreou, the prime minister, has floated the idea of constitutional reform that would put an end to old-time patronage politics by cutting the number of legislators and altering the electoral system. If such changes were approved in a referendum, it would mean Mr Papandreou had successfully appealed to citizens over the heads of his own parliamentarians. That may be his last, best hope of regaining the political initiative. 
But it is also possible that many Greek citizens are disappointed with politicians not because they reject the old patronage system, but because it has run out of money and is now failing to provide for them. If Mr Pangalos is right that everyone ate at the trough, then some people may still be craving handouts. In that case, the people responsible for Greece's fate--at home and abroad--will now have to cope with the politics of hunger.","Some Greeks are angry about their paralysed , corrupt country .

WITH a target of EUR 50 billion ($72 billion) by 2015, Greece's privatisation plan aims to raise more cash as a share of GDP than any OECD government has managed before. If the goal for listed companies is met, the market capitalisation of the Athens stock exchange would double. The economic benefits of privatisation are widely accepted: a 2003 OECD study found ""overwhelming support"" for the idea that ""privatisation brings about a significant increase in the profitability, real output and efficiency of privatised companies."" But is Greece's timetable too rapid?
Most privatisation programmes involve a trade-off between long-term structural reform and short-term fund-raising. In Greece's case, there is an urgent need for money. Lenders want Greece to raise as much of it as possible so they can limit the amount they have to fork out in the next bail-out; the IMF hopes that asset sales will mean less growth-sapping austerity. 
The trade-off between cash and reform is less severe in some areas than others. Property sales are expected to be Greece's single largest source of revenue. By forcing Greece to spruce up its incomplete land registry, speed could have useful wider effects. But selling stakes in state monopolies is far more complex. Putting in place a regulatory framework that fosters more competition takes time, and is likely to depress sale prices by removing firms' protections. Here revenue and reform may clash directly. 
This is not the first time Greece has embarked on a sales drive. An ambitious privatisation programme in the early 1990s was thwarted by the Socialist Party (then led by Andreas Papandreou, father of George, the current prime minister). Stakes in a handful of companies and banks were eventually sold late in the decade to meet convergence criteria for membership of the euro. But the current plan can draw on decades of privatisation experience, from Margaret Thatcher's programme in 1980s Britain to the state sell-offs in post-communist countries in eastern Europe. Those past programmes offer important lessons for Greece. 
The first is the importance of good institutions. In eastern Europe after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the initial advice to governments was to privatise as much and as fast as possible, in the expectation that private owners would demand more reform. Instead many new owners took advantage of weak corporate governance to spirit away profits. There is a particular problem when state-owned utilities are privatised without there being sufficient competition or regulation to restrain price rises. Latin American governments renegotiated more than 50% of contracts with privatised water companies in the 1990s. 
An alternative approach is ""sequencing"", whereby privatisation starts only once institutional reforms have created well-functioning markets. Unlike its Czech and Slovak neighbours, for instance, Poland did not privatise its banks until 1993, after it had imposed capital standards and requirements for loan-loss provisioning. The danger with this approach is that governments delay sales indefinitely. By the end of the 1990s a consensus began to emerge that privatisation and institutional reform should be pursued simultaneously, and that utilities should be privatised more cautiously than companies in contested industries. 
A second lesson for Greece is the need for competitive tendering. In Russia in the 1990s early attempts at mass privatisation, through share giveaways to the general public, resulted in diffuse and uninterested owners. Managers faced no pressure to improve performance. Later, the government of Boris Yeltsin offered state companies as collateral to secure bank loans, which it could not repay. That allowed local barons, who controlled banks, to acquire lucrative assets at bargain prices. 
Transparent auctions are more likely to attract foreign capital, the value of which is a third lesson. In Hungary bids for state assets from foreign companies drove up prices and government revenue, but also brought in management experience. The result was immediate output gains. Lastly, several studies show that fully privatised companies outperform partially privatised ones, where government influence may distort commercial decisions. Greased lightning
Some of this should encourage Greece. The country is not Russia in 1991: state expenditure accounts for 50% of GDP, too high but less than in France. The privatisation programme is also embedded in a wider set of institutional reforms. And Greece's membership of Europe's single market makes it a more attractive proposition for foreign investors.
But there is also plenty of cause for concern. The government will retain stakes in many companies and it is bypassing the tendering process for others. The timetable to design a regulatory environment for privatised utilities is absurdly tight. The railway is due to be sold this year along with two gas companies; the country's main power generator follows in 2012.
There are political risks, too. An IMF study of 18 countries in Africa, Latin America and the former Soviet Union found evidence that privatisation proceeds amounting to 1% of GDP tended to produce a 0.5 percentage-point increase in GDP growth in the year of the sale and another 0.4 percentage points in the subsequent year, as well as lasting reductions in the unemployment rate. But new owners of Greek assets would be taking charge in a particularly feeble economic environment, which might lead them to cut jobs (or raise prices) in the short term. Whereas the benefits of privatisation are diffuse and remote--the promise of a dynamic economy tomorrow--the costs tend to be immediate and concentrated on heavily unionised public-sector workers. Without public support the impetus toward privatisation may soon falter. Going too fast now risks a reversal later.

WITH a target of EUR 50 billion ($72 billion) by 2015, Greece's privatisation plan aims to raise more cash as a share of GDP than any OECD government has managed before. If the goal for listed companies is met, the market capitalisation of the Athens stock exchange would double. The economic benefits of privatisation are widely accepted: a 2003 OECD study found ""overwhelming support"" for the idea that ""privatisation brings about a significant increase in the profitability, real output and efficiency of privatised companies."" But is Greece's timetable too rapid?
Most privatisation programmes involve a trade-off between long-term structural reform and short-term fund-raising. In Greece's case, there is an urgent need for money. Lenders want Greece to raise as much of it as possible so they can limit the amount they have to fork out in the next bail-out; the IMF hopes that asset sales will mean less growth-sapping austerity. 
The trade-off between cash and reform is less severe in some areas than others. Property sales are expected to be Greece's single largest source of revenue. By forcing Greece to spruce up its incomplete land registry, speed could have useful wider effects. But selling stakes in state monopolies is far more complex. Putting in place a regulatory framework that fosters more competition takes time, and is likely to depress sale prices by removing firms' protections. Here revenue and reform may clash directly.

IT MUST have been a satisfying letter to write. European finance ministers meeting in Brussels at the start of this week got a stern wigging from George Papandreou, the Greek prime minister. Insisting that his country had done its bit by pushing through painful reforms, he condemned the ""indecisiveness and errors"" of the European response to the crisis: ""a cacophony of voices and views"" had prevailed, ""creating more panic than security"".
Mr Papandreou's critique rings true but there is no denying the complexity of the threefold problem confronting European leaders, who are said to be planning an emergency summit in Brussels. First, they must make up their minds on how to deal with Greece, rescued once but needing even more help. Second, they must prevent the crisis taking deeper hold, not just in Ireland and Portugal, but also in Italy and Spain, the third- and fourth-biggest economies respectively in the euro area. And third, they must ensure that the sovereign-debt crisis does not precipitate a banking crisis--results of stress tests on European banks are due to be published late on July 15th, with a stream of announcements from national authorities on how they plan to recapitalise failing institutions likely to follow.
The response to all three problems is made so complicated by the fact that Europe's monetary union lacks a fiscal underpinning. With northern electorates in the creditor countries--notably Germany, but the Netherlands and Finland, too--hostile to bail-outs of profligate peripheral borrowers, European leaders have been able to put together only a limited set of fiscal resources and tools. The most important of these is the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), whose effective lending capacity, based on guarantees from euro-area states, is due to rise from around EUR 250 billion ($350 billion) to EUR 440 billion this autumn. That does not look like enough.
The EFSF (together with another, much smaller, European pot of money) is already being used to provide rescue funding for Ireland and Portugal, with the IMF chipping in about a third of the total as in all the rescues. The EFSF will also be used to finance a second bail-out of Greece (the European contribution to the first is through bilateral loans from other euro-area states). Now European leaders are contemplating other uses for the facility.
Since it became clear that Greece would require an additional bail-out, Wolfgang Schauble, Germany's finance minister, has insisted that private holders of Greek debt should share in the pain in what is euphemistically labelled ""private-sector participation"". This would involve bondholders extending their loans or accepting ""haircuts"" on them. One way to encourage them along the road to the financial guillotine would be through debt exchanges whereby their devalued bonds would be swapped for claims on debt guaranteed by the EFSF. The facility could also be used to prop up Greek banks, which would require recapitalisation since they hold large amounts of Greek government debt.
The EFSF is such a handy device that this week has also seen renewed talk about its lending money to Greece so that the government there can buy back its bonds at today's depressed prices, which would lower the nominal value of its towering debt. But this would not be a cure-all, even assuming that the Germans are now willing to consider an option they previously rejected. One snag is that the purchases would tend to drive up the market price, so limiting the reduction of Greece's debts. Moreover, the EFSF's primary purpose is to provide emergency support for countries that find themselves locked out of financing markets by punitive borrowing costs. If large amounts were used to buy back Greek debt, that would limit its ability to support other countries. 
A summit in March ruled out another use of EFSF funds, that of intervening in secondary government-bond markets to purchase the debt of struggling countries. This week there was talk that this form of deployment may after all be permitted, giving policymakers a weapon to counter the kind of market jitters that have affected Italy and Spain. But such a change, which would require the framework agreement for the facility to be amended, again risks overburdening it. 
It would also take time to ratify. European leaders seem likely therefore to try to leave any immediate intervention with the European Central Bank (ECB). The ECB was very reluctant to embark on bond purchases through its ""securities markets programme"" last year because that took it into territory that looks suspiciously fiscal rather than monetary. Despite such qualms, the ECB is the only body at present with a hose that can douse market fires. 
Reinforcing Europe's banking system--the third task for its harassed policymakers--will be the job of national regulators following the results of the stress tests. But even if individual banks are recapitalised, the danger remains that a dodgy sovereign can drag down its banks. One answer to that could be some form of European fiscal backstop through the issue of ""Eurobonds"" underwritten by the currency area's taxpayers. The EFSF falls short of this because its backing from the euro-area states is not ""joint and several""; each country is responsible for its share of the guarantees that lie behind the EFSF's issuance, but not for the whole amount. 
The remedy of Eurobonds may be logical, providing the monetary union with the fiscal support it needs. But it looks a solution too far, politically. Northern creditor countries can now borrow cheaply and choose to limit their exposures to other euro-zone members. Persuading their electorates to sign up for unending fiscal subsidies would tax any leader.","Why the debt crisis is so hard to resolve

HOWEVER bad the economic crisis in southern Europe may be for investors, it is proving lethal for the area's political leaders. In March Jose Socrates, Portugal's beleaguered prime minister, resigned. Soon afterwards his Spanish counterpart, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, announced his intention to step down. In June George Papandreou, Greece's prime minister, came close to ejection during a fierce debate over an austerity package.
So as he stood up to make the first of two eagerly awaited speeches to parliament on August 3rd, Italy's prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, may have had an uneasy feeling he was one in a line of dominoes. If so, there was nothing in the style or content of his address to suggest it. Nor was there much to indicate that he appreciated the magnitude of the crisis facing the euro or the case for drastic action to tackle it.
Many analysts argue that the euro's difficulties are beyond resolution by any one member. But Italy is crucial. It is the biggest country on the euro zone's troubled southern flank, and its EUR 1.8 trillion ($2.6 trillion) borrowings dwarf those of any other country in the single currency. Mr Berlusconi's lacklustre, almost blithe speech looked like a missed opportunity to influence the course of events.
He was speaking after the Milan bourse had fallen for four straight days and Italy's borrowing costs had reached euro-era records. Hours before Mr Berlusconi's address, the yield on Italy's benchmark ten-year treasury bonds hit 6.25%, before slipping back fractionally. Giulio Tremonti, the finance minister, was summoned to Luxembourg for an emergency meeting with Jean-Claude Juncker, head of the euro group of finance ministers.
Not that Italy was alone. The day before, Spain's borrowing rates too had hit record highs (see next story). Both Italy and Spain face the threat of a self-fulfilling fear in the markets that they are fated to suffer a Greek-style financial emergency. 
A special euro-zone summit last month briefly calmed investors' nerves after Italy had been first contaminated by the spreading crisis. But doubts have persisted as to the effectiveness of a EUR 48 billion package of budget-reduction measures rushed through the Italian parliament in mid-July. A renewed bout of concern over the two biggest southern euro-states began gathering momentum on July 29th, when Moody's, a ratings agency, warned that it might downgrade Spanish debt. The yield on Spain's bonds started to climb, tracked closely by the return on Italian debt.
Both countries' borrowing costs have edged close to the 7% mark that heralded bail-outs for Greece, Ireland and Portugal. But even if Spain could--just--be handled, Italy is almost certainly too big to be rescued, and its presence on the international debt markets is daunting. Even though an unusually high proportion of Italy's treasury bonds and bills are in the hands of Italians, foreigners still hold around EUR 700 billion-worth of the things.
With alarm rising, Jose Manuel Barroso, head of the European Commission, issued a statement urging national leaders to get a grip. But Italy's billionaire prime minister was content to tell his fellow deputies: ""You are listening to an entrepreneur who has three companies on the stock exchange and who is therefore on the financial battlefield, aware every day of what happens in the markets."" Investors were making a big mistake, he hinted: Italy's economic fundamentals were healthy; its banks were sound (and their shares undervalued, he added).
Mr Berlusconi neither promised to stiffen the austerity package approved last month, nor to bring forward unpopular measures that will otherwise be left to the next government to apply. His most radical proposal was for an overhaul of labour law (if the unions and employers can be persuaded to agree).
Although investors clearly fear the spreading of market contagion, they also have concerns over political stability. During his address to parliament Mr Berlusconi again vowed to remain in office until 2013. Yet there is ample evidence that he is part of the problem. 
The same can now be said of Mr Tremonti, whose emphasis on fiscal rigour was until recently seen by investors as crucial to any solution. The finance minister remains vulnerable to a scandal involving a former adviser accused of influence-trafficking. Marco Milanese, who is also a deputy, made available to his boss a flat in one of the most fashionable parts of central Rome. Mr Tremonti claims to have paid him rent, but in cash--an awkward explanation for the man charged with ensuring that Italians pay their taxes.
More important is Mr Berlusconi's own vulnerability, which is increasing as supporters begin to fret over his waning popularity. His credibility is shrinking: the July austerity package was long on tax increases he had often promised to eschew. And he seems apathetic: before his appearance in parliament this week he had said next to nothing about Italy's financial crisis in nearly a month.
Mr Berlusconi's main ally, Umberto Bossi of the Northern League, whose votes keep the prime minister in power, was noticeably absent from the chamber during his speech. One of Mr Bossi's most senior lieutenants, Roberto Maroni, the interior minister, was there. But, intriguingly, he chose to sit among his party colleagues, and not with the rest of the cabinet.","Silvio Berlusconi appears to have no response to Italy's deepening economic crisis

WARM and languid, yet pregnant with autumn, August is the time for many Europeans to forget their cares. Factories and businesses across much of the continent shut down. Governments all but stop as ministers take a break. Even Charlemagne likes to sign off for a while. It is a time, too, when citizens might reconsider their reservations about European integration.
The Mediterranean, which had burdened northerners for over a year of sovereign-debt woes, can be rediscovered for its delights. Slow economic growth may not seem so bad when you can enjoy slow living under the Tuscan sun. Poor productivity in southern Europe suddenly pales next to its contribution to legend and history. By the waters of the Aegean, how angry can you be with the Greeks, who bequeathed the very name Europa?
Just a few months ago Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, admonished southerners for being lazy: ""We can't have a common currency where some get lots of holiday time and others very little."" But it is the Germans trekking southward in their caravans who enjoy some of the longest vacations in Europe. By law, they get to work fewer hours per year than southerners.
On holiday the euro reverts from curse to blessing; no more need to give money-changers a cut at every frontier. The passport-free Schengen area, often criticised as opening the doors to migrants, now makes for smoother trips. And, as they phone home, holiday-makers might even mutter a word of thanks for the European Commission's work to force down outrageous mobile-roaming fees.
August, then, should be a good time for the European project. But not this year. The French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, has told ministers to spend their holidays in France. They were, he said, ""entitled to rest, but not to a vacation""; they had to stay in close touch with their departments. Leaders worry that crises will erupt when governments are not on top of events. Wars have an odd tendency to break out in August, whether by accident (the first world war in 1914) or by design (Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990). In August 2008 Mr Sarkozy himself was scrambling to end hostilities between Russia and Georgia. Foreign holidays can be politically damaging, too: Fredrik Reinfeldt, the Swedish prime minister, has been criticised for choosing a trip to Turkey over a memorial service for the victims of the Norway killings.
But this year there is good reason for trepidation: the financial markets do not take a break in August. Cyprus may be next in line for a bail-out (
). The island has been hit by multiple crises of late. Its large banking sector has suffered losses on Greek bonds, and its biggest power station has been knocked out by munitions exploding on a naval base.
Even more alarming is the situation in Italy and Spain. Both countries' bond yields have risen to alarming levels. If markets push them into insolvency, the euro zone would melt down. Already some reckon the two will have to drop out of financing earlier rescues of Greece, Ireland and Portugal, placing even greater burdens on a shrinking number of creditors. Some fear France will not be far behind.
Just a few weeks ago a quiet August seemed assured. The leaders of the euro zone had extended the maturities and slashed the interest rates on rescue loans, helping the three bailed-out countries. But they also exposed the vulnerability of Spain and Italy. The rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), is far too small to be credible. Moreover, plans to give it more flexibility to intervene pre-emptively have to be ratified by national parliaments--which are on holiday. Charitably, perhaps, senior officials in Brussels say governments deliberately chose not to expand the EFSF so as not to signal to markets that problems were looming in Italy and Spain. But markets have instead concluded that the euro zone is unwilling, or unable, to help them. Working holiday
So the August holidays are being ruined. The Greek prime minister, George Papandreou, is staying in Athens to oversee the start of an ambitious (over-ambitious, say some) privatisation programme that he hopes will stave off bankruptcy. The turmoil of the Arab spring is encouraging tourists to shift holidays from north Africa to southern Europe. But Greece's strike-prone workers, among them taxi drivers protesting against plans to open up their trade, seem determined to put visitors off.
Just before the break Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, Spain's prime minister, called early general elections for November. He had to postpone his final holiday as prime minister (he will not stand again) to deal with the debt crisis. On August 3rd Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's prime minister, told parliament that the country's finances were sound. His finance minister, Giulio Tremonti, had earlier gone to Luxembourg for talks with Jean-Claude Juncker, who heads the euro zone's group of finance ministers. The French parliament is being recalled for an emergency session on September 6th to approve changes to the EFSF. But the Italian one will remain on leave until the 12th, so that MPs can go on pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Italy could do with some prayers, but what's wrong with St Peter's basilica? 
The return to work in September may yet bring the worst of the storm. Greece will have to negotiate the terms of its second rescue, and the IMF is more reluctant to keep financing a third of Europe's endless bail-outs. Opposition to the ever-growing cost of saving the euro will become more apparent. Very soon, as the days grow shorter and the rains return, leaders could face a momentous decision. Should they allow countries to default and break the currency union? Or should they try to save the euro by creating an unpopular fiscal union, complete with jointly backed Eurobonds? The thought of it is enough to spoil your holiday.","Europe 's leaders are going on holiday , but the markets are not 
 WARM and languid , yet pregnant with autumn , August is the time for many Europeans to forget their cares . Factories and businesses across much of the continent shut down . Governments all but stop as ministers take a break . Even Charlemagne likes to sign off for a while . It is a time , too , when citizens might reconsider their reservations about European integration . 
 The Mediterranean , which had burdened northerners for over a year of sovereign - debt woes , can be rediscovered for its delights . Slow economic growth may not seem so bad when you can enjoy slow living under the Tuscan sun . Poor productivity in southern Europe suddenly pales next to its contribution to legend and history . By the waters of the Aegean , how angry can you be with the Greeks , who bequeathed the very name Europa ? 
 Just a few months ago Angela Merkel , the German chancellor , admonished southerners for being lazy : "" We ca n't have a common currency where some get lots of holiday time and others very little . "" But it is the Germans trekking southward in their caravans who enjoy some of the longest vacations in Europe . By law , they get to work fewer hours per year than southerners . 
 On holiday the euro reverts from curse to blessing ; no more need to give money - changers a cut at every frontier . The passport - free Schengen area , often criticised as opening the doors to migrants , now makes for smoother trips . And , as they phone home , holiday - makers might even mutter a word of thanks for the European Commission 's work to force down outrageous mobile - roaming fees . 
 August , then , should be a good time for the European project . But not this year . The French president , Nicolas Sarkozy , has told ministers to spend their holidays in France . They were , he said , "" entitled to rest , but not to a vacation "" ; they had to stay in close touch with their departments . Leaders worry that crises will erupt when governments are not on top of events . Wars have an odd tendency to break out in August , whether by accident ( the first world war in 1914 ) or by design ( Iraq 's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 ) . In August 2008 Mr Sarkozy himself was scrambling to end hostilities between Russia and Georgia . Foreign holidays can be politically damaging , too : Fredrik Reinfeldt , the Swedish prime minister , has been criticised for choosing a trip to Turkey over a memorial service for the victims of the Norway killings . 
 But this year there is good reason for trepidation : the financial markets do not take a break in August . Cyprus may be next in line for a bail - out ( 
 ) . The island has been hit by multiple crises of late . Its large banking sector has suffered losses on Greek bonds , and its biggest power station has been knocked out by munitions exploding on a naval base . 
 Even more alarming is the situation in Italy and Spain . Both countries ' bond yields have risen to alarming levels . If markets push them into insolvency , the euro zone would melt down . Already some reckon the two will have to drop out of financing earlier rescues of Greece , Ireland and Portugal , placing even greater burdens on a shrinking number of creditors . Some fear France will not be far behind .

PATROCLES, a taxi driver, had to borrow his wife's car to ferry customers to and from Athens airport to avoid being spotted by his colleagues on strike. ""I'm with them in principle but I have to earn an income,"" he said. Last week Athens's 14,000 taxi-drivers--5,000 more than are needed, according to Sata, their union--wrapped up a strike that had lasted for almost three weeks, infuriating summer tourists and giving Greece's battered reputation a further kicking. The cabbies, already losing business as recession-hit Athenians switch to public transport, were angry about a scheme that aims to liberalise their closed-shop by lifting the ceiling on taxi licences. 
Yet, as with last year's strike by lorry-drivers, another benchmark dispute, Greeks are betting on liberalisation. The price of a taxi licence on the grey market has slumped to around EUR 30,000 ($43,000) from around three times that figure three years ago. Along with taxis, another 140 closed-shop professions, among them architects, lawyers and public notaries, were liberalised by decree last month. But back-up regulation for the new arrangements is not yet ready, suggesting that, after 15 months of assistance from the European Union and the IMF, most Greek politicians remain unenthusiastic about reform. 
The latest bail-out plan--a complicated mix of cash loans, bond swaps and debt rollovers intended to meet EUR 120 billion in gross financing needs over the next three years--is more or less in place. However, the recent turbulence in global markets may mean that officials take longer than hoped to get banks, insurance companies and other private bondholders to sign up. 
Yet that is hardly Greece's biggest problem. Few believe the deal will do enough to make the country's debt pile manageable, and the goal of allowing Greece to return to the international markets by 2014 looks optimistic. The trouble is that, as fears have grown over Spain and Italy, much larger members of the euro-club, Athens's second bail-out looks likely to be its last. This may be why George Papandreou, the prime minister, has told his cabinet to speed up reforms.
Evangelos Venizelos, the new finance minister, will be central to the effort. A constitutional lawyer from northern Greece, Mr Venizelos is not a details man. But he is keen to produce results and has set himself two tasks: pushing through enough privatisation deals to satisfy Greece's international lenders (the new bail-out includes provisions for EUR 28 billion from sales of companies and real estate) and reversing a disastrous fall in tax revenues that has derailed this year's budget.
The budget deficit jumped by almost 30% on an annual basis in the first six months of 2011. It would have been 60% had Mr Venizelos's predecessor not slashed public investment. Without drastic measures to reduce spending and boost revenues, say private-sector economists, this year's deficit could reach 13.5% of GDP, compared with a target of 7.5%. 
Mr Venizelos has opted for a tax amnesty to increase revenues, the second in less than a year. But such policies are frowned on by the IMF because today's amnesty encourages taxpayers to dispute tomorrow's tax claims in the hope that they can sit it out until the next pardon. Moreover, the EUR 2 billion that the policy could net may not be enough to offset a continuing shortfall, as a third year of recession eats into consumer spending and firms' profits. 
As for privatisation, more than 20 deals are supposed to have been completed by January, according to the latest EU-IMF agreement. ""Mission impossible"", says one senior official. One or two long-awaited disposals could go through, and some European investors are showing interest, hoping for fire-sale prices. But with only EUR 390m of privatisation revenues in the bag so far, this year's target of EUR 5 billion will be as elusive as Patrocles's taxi.","Does the government have the will to see through its ambitious bail - out plan ?

A FEW weeks ago The Economist invited readers who enjoy our Big Mac index to help invent other quirky economic indicators. We received many suggestions for different products with which to calculate exchange rates at purchasing-power parity, ranging from Coca-Cola and bottled water to mobile-phone charges and taxi fares. But given recent financial jolts, we were more interested in ideas that might help to show where the economy is heading.
Many readers already have their pet indicator--sometimes literally. A vet claims that his business leads the economic cycle by as much as six months, because when times get tough pet owners are quick to cut back on vaccinations and non-essential surgery, such as neutering; they also delay getting a new dog. A reader from the pharmaceutical industry recommends tracking suppositories. ""Financial worries and austerity changes in diet cause intestinal disorders,"" he says, and sales of suppositories therefore rise as the economy goes down the pan.
Another reader suggests that stress also reduces libido, so a fall in condom sales may signal recession, whereas a rise could point to a virile recovery. More down-to-earth readers tipped packaging materials, such as wooden pallets, cartons and plastic stretch-wrap, as useful leading indicators. The snag with all these ideas is that the data are not widely and quickly available. That is why many readers favour anecdotal gauges, such as the ease of getting a taxi or finding a parking space. 
Since the 1920s rising and falling hemlines have been a time-honoured gauge of confidence, but one reader suggests taking a close look at leaders' hairlines as a measure of how much stress they and their economy are suffering. The balding pate of George Papandreou, Greece's prime minister, is a sell sign, and Silvio Berlusconi's hair transplant cannot hide Italy's troubles. When hairlines recede, runs the thin theory, economies are likely to follow.
But the hottest tip came from Edward Ritchie, an investment analyst in London. He tracks Google searches for the ""gold price"" as an indicator of economic confidence. This does not follow the gold price itself. For example, during most of 2008 when the world's financial system was melting down, the gold price tumbled yet the number of searches soared. The number of gold-price searches shoots up when American consumer confidence dives and subsides when households perk up again (see chart). That makes it a handy device for spotting turning-points in economic confidence, with the added advantage that the data are available earlier than for conventional survey-based figures. Worryingly, the number of searches has recently vaulted above its 2008 peak, signalling the possibility of a double dip.","Receding hairlines and other signals of where the economy is heading

WHAT'S the French for ""this sucker could go down""? Echoes of 2008, when the global financial system wobbled and George Bush gave his pithy view of the American economy, now resound on the other side of the Atlantic. Credit-default-swap spreads for European banks, a measure of how costly it is to buy insurance against their default, are at record highs (see chart 1). 
The rates that banks charge each other for loans in the interbank market are rising, too, as they did then. Rumours swirl and panic flares: shares in BNP Paribas, a well-run French bank, dropped by 12% on the morning of September 13th following reports that no one would lend it dollars. BNP's denials saw the shares bounce back later in the day. Shares in Societe Generale, another French bank, whipsawed too. The French banks' reliance on short-term dollar funding, which American money-market funds are increasingly leery of providing, is one reason why Moody's, a ratings agency, downgraded Societe Generale on September 14th, though exposure to sovereign default is also a key factor.
Meanwhile large banks in Germany, Switzerland and Britain have more cash than they can put to good use as corporate customers shift their deposits from weaker countries or smaller banks. The beneficiaries are loth to tie the cash up in long-term loans because they fear that the flows could reverse at any moment. ""It's hot money,"" says one bank chairman. 
Thus the role of the Frankfurt-based European Central Bank (ECB) grows larger. The northern banks deposit their excess cash there rather than lend in the interbank market. The banks on the periphery increasingly depend on the ECB for liquidity. More than a fifth of Greek bank funding is now provided through Frankfurt; Italian lenders have upped their ECB borrowing sharply over the summer.
Banks are finding it hard to issue longer-term debt, too. The market for unsecured bonds has been closed for weeks, leaving banks with no option but to sell covered bonds at usurious interest rates that will challenge their profitability. 
One way of bolstering the banking system would be to inject more capital into it. Goldman Sachs, an investment bank, reckons that Europe's 38 biggest banks might need between EUR 30 billion and EUR 92 billion ($41 billion-$126 billion) in extra capital to cope with haircuts to Greek, Irish and Portuguese government bonds and losses on Italian and Spanish government debt. An analysis by the IMF suggests that banks would see a hit of close to EUR 200 billion if the default probabilities implicit in today's market prices were realised, although European governments and banks dispute the fund's calculations.
Raising capital in current markets will not be easy. Bank valuations are low; several banks might need to raise several times more than their current market value. Those shareholders that do not participate will have their holdings deeply diluted. That suggests governments might have to underwrite some of the rights issues.
Here the parallels with the credit crisis three years ago become ominously inexact. In 2008 governments did what was needed to protect their banks: guarantees were issued, equity injected. In the euro-zone crisis the threat of sovereign default renders some governments impotent, while those which could act have chosen not to do so decisively.
The government at the heart of concerns again this week is that of Greece. Panicked officials are racing to plug a gaping hole in the budget and accelerate reforms in the face of speculation that international lenders will withhold the next EUR 8 billion tranche of the country's bail-out. If the funds are not released within two weeks, the government risks being unable to pay wages and pensions. A hastily announced property tax should raise about EUR 2 billion, which may just keep the budget deficit below 9% of GDP this year. 
The troika monitoring the Greek plan (the European Commission, the ECB and the IMF) also wants to see a realistic budget draft for 2012. That means making drastic spending cuts as revenues are being squeezed by the deepening recession. The Greek economy is likely to contract by at least 5.3% this year. The government has already decided to increase the number of public-sector workers parked on 60% of their salaries pending dismissal or retirement. About 40,000 workers are now likely to be made redundant by year-end. Greece's debt managers are also finalising a EUR 135 billion package of debt swaps and rollovers for private-sector investors which would allow the country to delay the repayment of about one-third of its bills for up to 30 years.
The scrambling might be enough to allow Greece to escape immediate default; but it will also make a more brutal restructuring in the future much harder. And such a future restructuring seems inevitable. On September 12th Philipp Rosler, the leader of Germany's Free Democratic Party, the junior partner to Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union, said it was time to address the taboo subject of a possible Greek bankruptcy. Some go further still: the prospect of a Greek departure from the euro is now widely discussed. Stark choices
Mrs Merkel is having none of it. On September 14th, after a conference call with George Papandreou, the Greek prime minister, she and Nicolas Sarzoky, the French president, reaffirmed Greece's place in the euro zone. For now euro-zone leaders seem determined to plough ahead, shepherding the second Greek bail-out package through national parliaments along with measures to increase the scope and firepower of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), Europe's bail-out fund. 
The problem is that although a beefed-up EFSF will be able to cope with the smaller peripherals, it is unable to support the refinancing needs of an economy as big as Italy. At an auction of Italian five-year bonds on September 13th its borrowing costs jumped to 5.6%, up from 4.9% at a similar auction in July. 
The pressure on European banks will keep increasing unless something else is done. Rumours that China will ride to the rescue of struggling countries are fanciful. Again, the real last resort is the ECB, which could relieve the pressures on the system by being prepared to buy without limit the bonds of solvent euro-zone countries. But the ECB is itself riven by disagreement.
On September 9th Jurgen Stark, the central bank's chief economist and a former Bundesbanker, announced his resignation ""for personal reasons"". Mr Stark opposed the ECB's buying of Greek government bonds last year. When the bank began supporting Italian and Spanish government bonds, too, it was apparently more than he could take. Axel Weber, the head of the Bundesbank until May 1st, ruled himself out of the running to replace Jean-Claude Trichet, the ECB president, earlier this year because of similar qualms.
The German government moved swiftly to fill the hole left by Mr Stark. Jorg Asmussen, chief secretary at the finance ministry, will move to the ECB, assuming the formalities go without a hitch. Both Mr Asmussen and Jens Weidmann, Mr Weber's successor at the Bundesbank, appear more flexible personalities than their predecessors. But persuading them, and the German public, to sign up to what amounts to a policy of massive quantitative easing (creating money to buy bonds) will be extremely difficult. In 2008 free-market Americans swallowed their misgivings to rescue Wall Street. Inflation-phobic Germans now face a similar choice.","The euro zone is in intensive care.

Credit-default-swap spreads for European banks, a measure of how costly it is to buy insurance against their default, are at record highs (see chart 1). 
The rates that banks charge each other for loans in the interbank market are rising, too, as they did then. Rumours swirl and panic flares: shares in BNP Paribas, a well-run French bank, dropped by 12% on the morning of September 13th following reports that no one would lend it dollars. BNP's denials saw the shares bounce back later in the day. Shares in Societe Generale, another French bank, whipsawed too. The French banks' reliance on short-term dollar funding, which American money-market funds are increasingly leery of providing, is one reason why Moody's, a ratings agency, downgraded Societe Generale on September 14th, though exposure to sovereign default is also a key factor.
Meanwhile large banks in Germany, Switzerland and Britain have more cash than they can put to good use as corporate customers shift their deposits from weaker countries or smaller banks. The beneficiaries are loth to tie the cash up in long-term loans because they fear that the flows could reverse at any moment. ""It's hot money,"" says one bank chairman. 
Thus the role of the Frankfurt-based European Central Bank (ECB) grows larger. The northern banks deposit their excess cash there rather than lend in the interbank market. The banks on the periphery increasingly depend on the ECB for liquidity. More than a fifth of Greek bank funding is now provided through Frankfurt; Italian lenders have upped their ECB borrowing sharply over the summer.
Banks are finding it hard to issue longer-term debt, too. The market for unsecured bonds has been closed for weeks, leaving banks with no option but to sell covered bonds at usurious interest rates that will challenge their profitability. 
One way of bolstering the banking system would be to inject more capital into it. Goldman Sachs, an investment bank, reckons that Europe's 38 biggest banks might need between EUR 30 billion and EUR 92 billion ($41 billion-$126 billion) in extra capital to cope with haircuts to Greek, Irish and Portuguese government bonds and losses on Italian and Spanish government debt. An analysis by the IMF suggests that banks would see a hit of close to EUR 200 billion if the default probabilities implicit in today's market prices were realised, although European governments and banks dispute the fund's calculations.
Raising capital in current markets will not be easy. Bank valuations are low; several banks might need to raise several times more than their current market value. Those shareholders that do not participate will have their holdings deeply diluted. That suggests governments might have to underwrite some of the rights issues.
Here the parallels with the credit crisis three years ago become ominously inexact. In 2008 governments did what was needed to protect their banks: guarantees were issued, equity injected. In the euro-zone crisis the threat of sovereign default renders some governments impotent, while those which could act have chosen not to do so decisively.
The government at the heart of concerns again this week is that of Greece. Panicked officials are racing to plug a gaping hole in the budget and accelerate reforms in the face of speculation that international lenders will withhold the next EUR 8 billion tranche of the country's bail-out. If the funds are not released within two weeks, the government risks being unable to pay wages and pensions. A hastily announced property tax should raise about EUR 2 billion, which may just keep the budget deficit below 9% of GDP this year. 
The troika monitoring the Greek plan (the European Commission, the ECB and the IMF) also wants to see a realistic budget draft for 2012. That means making drastic spending cuts as revenues are being squeezed by the deepening recession. The Greek economy is likely to contract by at least 5.3% this year. The government has already decided to increase the number of public-sector workers parked on 60% of their salaries pending dismissal or retirement. About 40,000 workers are now likely to be made redundant by year-end. Greece's debt managers are also finalising a EUR 135 billion package of debt swaps and rollovers for private-sector investors which would allow the country to delay the repayment of about one-third of its bills for up to 30 years.
The scrambling might be enough to allow Greece to escape immediate default; but it will also make a more brutal restructuring in the future much harder. And such a future restructuring seems inevitable. On September 12th Philipp Rosler, the leader of Germany's Free Democratic Party, the junior partner to Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union, said it was time to address the taboo subject of a possible Greek bankruptcy. Some go further still: the prospect of a Greek departure from the euro is now widely discussed. Stark choices
Mrs Merkel is having none of it. On September 14th, after a conference call with George Papandreou, the Greek prime minister, she and Nicolas Sarzoky, the French president, reaffirmed Greece's place in the euro zone. For now euro-zone leaders seem determined to plough ahead, shepherding the second Greek bail-out package through national parliaments along with measures to increase the scope and firepower of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), Europe's bail-out fund. 
The problem is that although a beefed-up EFSF will be able to cope with the smaller peripherals, it is unable to support the refinancing needs of an economy as big as Italy. At an auction of Italian five-year bonds on September 13th its borrowing costs jumped to 5.6%, up from 4.9% at a similar auction in July. 
The pressure on European banks will keep increasing unless something else is done. Rumours that China will ride to the rescue of struggling countries are fanciful. Again, the real last resort is the ECB, which could relieve the pressures on the system by being prepared to buy without limit the bonds of solvent euro-zone countries. But the ECB is itself riven by disagreement.
On September 9th Jurgen Stark, the central bank's chief economist and a former Bundesbanker, announced his resignation ""for personal reasons"". Mr Stark opposed the ECB's buying of Greek government bonds last year. When the bank began supporting Italian and Spanish government bonds, too, it was apparently more than he could take. Axel Weber, the head of the Bundesbank until May 1st, ruled himself out of the running to replace Jean-Claude Trichet, the ECB president, earlier this year because of similar qualms.
The German government moved swiftly to fill the hole left by Mr Stark. Jorg Asmussen, chief secretary at the finance ministry, will move to the ECB, assuming the formalities go without a hitch. Both Mr Asmussen and Jens Weidmann, Mr Weber's successor at the Bundesbank, appear more flexible personalities than their predecessors. But persuading them, and the German public, to sign up to what amounts to a policy of massive quantitative easing (creating money to buy bonds) will be extremely difficult. In 2008 free-market Americans swallowed their misgivings to rescue Wall Street. Inflation-phobic Germans now face a similar choice.",350,Greece,A30-94,,False,,0,True

IN THE Centennial Hall in Wroclaw, Poland, in early September, Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, warned Europe's finance ministers how grave the global financial crisis was. The euro area, he said, was currently its epicentre, and the consequences could be much worse than anything seen so far.
But since most citizens are not yet feeling the pain, politicians are struggling to act decisively. A lightning visit to Wroclaw by Tim Geithner, America's treasury secretary, to express his alarm over the ""catastrophic risk"" of cascading sovereign defaults seemed to have little impact. The Europeans offered either excuses (decisions in a European Union of 27 countries are hard to reach) or hostility (America should sort out its own debt). After two days of talks, the euro-zone ministers came no closer to a solution.
One week later, at the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank in Washington, the Americans and others, including China, berated the Europeans for threatening the world economy. In fact, there was some progress: the Europeans agreed that there must be a plan to ring-fence solvent but illiquid economies, beef up the main bail-out fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), recapitalise Europe's banks and, not least, deal with Greece, which may yet default chaotically. But there was no agreement on any of the details of such a plan. 
The euro zone has the firepower to solve this crisis--its aggregate deficit and debt numbers compare favourably with America's and Britain's. But it is not a single entity, politically or economically. The currency is European, but treasuries are national and economies are only partially integrated. Each country wants to limit its liability for the debt of others and to curb the interference of peers in its economic policies. All 17 members have a veto on key decisions, which must then be ratified by unruly parliaments. Now the euro zone is trying to re-design itself even as it sinks--and every country is wondering whether to help others or save itself. 
Half-step by half-step
By its own ponderous standards, the euro zone has changed course quite fast. It has bailed out three countries, created an embryonic rescue fund and, only this week, toughened up fiscal discipline with threats of early sanctions for miscreants. Yet each belated half-step exposes how much is left to do. A deal agreed in July, including a second bail-out for Greece with a ""voluntary"" contribution from creditors, recapitalisation of banks and more flexibility for the EFSF, is still struggling through national parliaments; and, in any case, these measures are already obsolete. Contagion has spread to Italy, and nobody pretends that the EFSF, even after July's reforms, could save it without more money. 
The euro zone may have only a few weeks to come up with a more credible plan; the informal deadline is the next G20 summit in Cannes in early November. Are Europe's squabbling leaders up to it? To one despairing outsider, Austan Goolsbee, a former adviser to Barack Obama, Europeans are like the ineffective windbags in Monty Python's ""Life of Brian""--""where, you know, the guy comes out and says, 'We need to act,' and the next one says, 'You're right, let's draft--no more talking...I second the motion. Let's start doing something'."" 
One could easily imagine Jean-Claude Trichet as the hapless Brian, left to rot on the cross as his comrades walk away. To many, Mr Trichet has been the saviour of the euro, freely breaking with orthodoxy and acting decisively to buy the bonds of vulnerable euro-zone governments while the politicians talk. Others, though, see him as the politicians' lackey, and his purchase of sovereign bonds has driven two German colleagues to resign. 
Mr Trichet works hard at being a paragon of charm and composure. But his self-control crumbled earlier this month when he was asked whether the ECB was now a European ""bad bank"". ""We have delivered price stability over the first 12-13 years of the euro! Impeccably! Impeccably!"" he thundered, adding that he ""would like very much to hear some congratulations"" for delivering greater price stability in Germany than even the mighty Bundesbank ever managed. 
Mr Trichet is clever enough to find justifications for his actions: the ECB, he claims, buys bonds not to bail out governments but to help the ""transmission"" of its interest rates to the market; and it accepts dubious Greek collateral on the ground that bailed-out countries are by definition solvent. He rightly warned the politicians that their campaign to make private bond-holders take a hit in future bail-outs would only spook the markets. But he may be wrong to oppose any kind of debt restructuring for Greece, which is patently bust.
Mr Trichet could, in theory, solve the immediate problem single-handedly by announcing that the ECB would buy unlimited amounts of sovereign bonds if a solvent country came under attack. There are signs that it is ready to provide longer-term liquidity (up to one year) to banks and to ease interest rates. But Mr Trichet is the first to declare that the ECB cannot alone hold the breach in the bond markets.
In any case, time is running out for a grand move. Mr Trichet will step down at the end of October, making way for Italy's Mario Draghi. The change makes many nervous. The Italian central banker is impeccably orthodox in his economic thinking. Moreover he may find it hard, as an Italian, to expand the ECB's bond-buying when Italy is especially vulnerable. 
It's all up to Angela and Wolfgang
In the end, the future of the euro will be decided largely in Germany. It has the deepest pockets, and its post-war renaissance is intimately bound up with European integration. If Europe takes decisions slowly, it is partly because of Germany's complex federal structure and messy coalition politics. And for all the criticism, it is easy to understand Germany's hesitation (see Charlemagne). It faces an agonising choice: to back the euro with almost unlimited taxpayers' funds, or risk the break-up of the single currency. The government has tried to steer away from both horrors. Many Germans think it is already going too far, too fast towards a ""transfer union"".
Germany's slow response also has something to do with the personality of the chancellor, Angela Merkel. She is a physicist by training, methodical to a fault and ultra-cautious; faced with conflicting advice, her instinct is always to put off a decision. She may be fully committed to the project, but for her Europe is a cost-benefit calculation rather than historical destiny.
Not so her finance minister and one-time rival, Wolfgang Schauble, a disciple of the ex-chancellor, Helmut Kohl. Mr Schauble, who is wheelchair-bound since an assassination attempt in 1990, does not demur when interviewers describe him as the cabinet's ""last European"". His relations with Mrs Merkel have not always been easy. She became chairman of her Christian Democratic Union in 2000 after Mr Schauble was forced out of the job over his involvement in a party-financing scandal. These days the Merkel-Schauble dynamic is watched as closely as bond spreads. At least once, the chancellor has countermanded a deal struck by her finance minister. Mr Schauble is hawkish on the need for fiscal discipline and may be readier than Mrs Merkel to push Greece into a default, yet he is also more prepared for greater integration in the future, including joint Eurobonds, which the chancellor opposes.
Mrs Merkel may be lacking high-quality advice. Her newish economic adviser is Lars-Hendrik Roller, known for his writings on competition rather than high finance. He replaced Jens Weidmann, a long-serving adviser with an economics PhD who took over at the Bundesbank in May. Mr Schauble, for his part, has Jorg Asmussen as his Europe man, a Social Democrat kept on for his experience of financial fire-fighting. But Mr Asmussen is heading for the ECB, where he and Mr Weidmann--it is hoped--may be more flexible than their predecessors, Juergen Stark and Axel Weber. His replacement, Thomas Steffen, was the chief insurance regulator.
Yet personalities have less influence on policymaking in Germany than elsewhere. Powerful institutions such as the Bundesbank, the trusted guardian of economic stability, and the constitutional court, which has said Germany is close to the limit of how much power can be surrendered to the EU, do much to set the boundaries of the euro debate. Public opinion is ambiguous: voters tell pollsters they dislike bail-outs, but do not want to see the euro destroyed. 
The strange silence of Nicolas
Though pre-eminent, Germany still needs the support of France to get its way. In contrast with Germany's dispersed power, economic policymaking in France is concentrated in Nicolas Sarkozy's Elysee Palace. Francois Baroin, an inexperienced and floppy-haired political hack who took over from Christine Lagarde as finance minister when she went to the IMF in July, attends formal meetings with Mr Schauble. But France's ""real finance minister"", says one insider, is Xavier Musca, the presidential chief of staff. Mr Musca cut his teeth at the French treasury, working for Mr Trichet during the talks that led to the 1992 Maastricht treaty, the foundation of the euro. He is backed by Ramon Fernandez, head of the treasury, and Emmanuel Moulin, Mr Sarkozy's economic adviser. None is a trained economist. 
Although unpopular, the mercurial Mr Sarkozy faces none of Mrs Merkel's problems of public opposition to bail-outs. And he is never shy of a bold plan, particularly in the run-up to a tight election next spring. Curiously, though, French ideas have been modest of late. Mr Sarkozy tends to propose only what he knows Mrs Merkel will accept, such as the idea of a European tax on financial transactions. French officials may be keen on Eurobonds, but dare not speak of them in public. Perhaps this caution stems from Mr Sarkozy's worries about whether France is a creditor or a soon-to-be supplicant. French banks, heavily exposed to the troubled Mediterranean periphery, are wobbly. And as the most highly indebted of the euro zone's AAA-rated countries, France fears losing its place in the top tier.
The French president, though, may be about to secure a prize that France has long wanted and Germany has long resisted: European ""economic government"". For Mr Sarkozy, this means the 17 leaders of the euro zone meeting separately from the ten non-euro EU members (including Britain) to co-ordinate economic policies. Over time, this might lead to a new bureaucracy separate from the European Commission. In a smaller-core Europe, Mr Sarkozy thinks, France's voice will be louder. Yet to get this French-inspired institutional structure, Mr Sarkozy has to accept German ideas: peer pressure to promote fiscal discipline and economic competitiveness.
Other countries in the euro zone matter less than France and Germany. The fate of Greece is being negotiated over the heads of its prime minister, George Papandreou, and his bruiser of a finance minister, Evangelos Venizelos. Italy's experienced fiscal hawk, Giulio Tremonti, has been weakened by scandal at home and a row with his prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi. Spain's Elena Salgado has generally deferred to her leader, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero; in any case, her Socialists are heading for defeat in an election in November. The Dutch and Finns, under pressure from Eurosceptic parties, are increasingly obstructive, as is Slovakia. But in the end it is still France and Germany that count. 
To organise things, they rely on their political fixer, Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the European Council. This former Belgian prime minister blends the austere demeanour of a monk (he famously writes Japanese haiku verses) with the wiliness of a French cardinal. He operates in the background, almost in the confessional, finding a point of balance between Paris and Berlin and then selling their ideas to leaders in other capitals. He will deliver proposals for economic governance to a European summit in mid-October; if adopted, these will undoubtedly shift power and influence within the euro zone. 
First, they will enhance the role of leaders at the expense of finance ministers, so giving Mr Van Rompuy a greater role as ""Mr Euro"" than Jean-Claude Juncker, Luxembourg's prime minister and finance minister, who chairs that group in the euro-zone. Mr Juncker has lived through all the single currency's vicissitudes, but these days gives a mumbling, wayward performance, admitting earlier this year that he has sometimes lied about the state of policy discussions. Having upset both France and Germany over the years, the hard-puffing Mr Juncker should have realised his days were numbered in March when smoking was banned from all summit meetings.
A second power shift is likely to be from the European Commission to national leaders. Though the commission is the traditional guardian of the European ideal, it is regarded with some disdain by the Germans and French. Even its friends despair of the timidity of its president, Jose Manuel Barroso, once Portugal's prime minister. It is hard to imagine Jacques Delors, one of his most energetic predecessors, lying so low with the euro in such a state.
Even so, the commission retains the bureaucratic power. Mr Van Rompuy often finds himself working with its ideas, and national leaders often end up endorsing its plans. Olli Rehn, the Finnish commissioner for economic policy (and a former professional footballer) is more capable than his stiff public persona suggests. And Michel Barnier, the French commissioner for the single market, is moving systematically to regulate the financial sector, often pushing Britain into rearguard actions to defend the interests of the City of London.
The shift to inter-governmentalism, Mr Barroso declared this week, could spell ""the death of the united Europe that we seek"". Striving to regain the initiative, the commission will soon push for Eurobonds and greater decision-making autonomy in its rescue fund. It's My Friend (or Foe?)
These days, the IMF has a big voice in the euro zone. Its quarterly judgments about Greece's performance will decide whether the country remains on life-support. And it is speaking more bluntly under its new managing director, Ms Lagarde. She infuriated her former European colleagues in August with a hard-hitting call for recapitalising Europe's banks. More recently her chief economist reinforced the mood of panic by warning that the world economy was entering a ""dangerous new phase"".
Ms Lagarde's tough tone may reflect the views of David Lipton, her new deputy, recently an adviser in the White House on international economics. Mr Lipton was a senior figure in the Clinton administration during the 1990s emerging-market crash. His priorities, notably boosting bank capital, also reflect official assessments of what worked in America in the earlier phases of its own crisis. He is becoming one of the most important non-European voices in the sovereign-debt debacle. 
European leaders such as Mr Barroso may well feel ""wounded"" by the patronising lectures of outsiders. But unless the euro zone's countries listen to good advice, and quickly act on it, they will face not just humiliation but economic catastrophe.

 A second power shift is likely to be from the European Commission to national leaders . Though the commission is the traditional guardian of the European ideal , it is regarded with some disdain by the Germans and French . Even its friends despair of the timidity of its president , Jose Manuel Barroso , once Portugal 's prime minister . It is hard to imagine Jacques Delors , one of his most energetic predecessors , lying so low with the euro in such a state . 
 Even so , the commission retains the bureaucratic power . Mr Van Rompuy often finds himself working with its ideas , and national leaders often end up endorsing its plans . Olli Rehn , the Finnish commissioner for economic policy ( and a former professional footballer ) is more capable than his stiff public persona suggests . And Michel Barnier , the French commissioner for the single market , is moving systematically to regulate the financial sector , often pushing Britain into rearguard actions to defend the interests of the City of London . 
 The shift to inter - governmentalism , Mr Barroso declared this week , could spell "" the death of the united Europe that we seek "" . Striving to regain the initiative , the commission will soon push for Eurobonds and greater decision - making autonomy in its rescue fund . It 's My Friend ( or Foe ? ) 
 These days , the IMF has a big voice in the euro zone . Its quarterly judgments about Greece 's performance will decide whether the country remains on life - support . And it is speaking more bluntly under its new managing director , Ms Lagarde . She infuriated her former European colleagues in August with a hard - hitting call for recapitalising Europe 's banks . More recently her chief economist reinforced the mood of panic by warning that the world economy was entering a "" dangerous new phase "" . 
 Ms Lagarde 's tough tone may reflect the views of David Lipton , her new deputy , recently an adviser in the White House on international economics . Mr Lipton was a senior figure in the Clinton administration during the 1990s emerging - market crash . His priorities , notably boosting bank capital , also reflect official assessments of what worked in America in the earlier phases of its own crisis . He is becoming one of the most important non - European voices in the sovereign - debt debacle . 
 European leaders such as Mr Barroso may well feel "" wounded "" by the patronising lectures of outsiders . But unless the euro zone 's countries listen to good advice , and quickly act on it , they will face not just humiliation but economic catastrophe .

THIS summer the euro zone's endless sovereign-debt crisis took a more dangerous turn, as the markets turned their guns on the Spanish and Italian economies. Neither country is out of the woods--this week Moody's, a ratings agency, downgraded Italy's debt--but attention has returned to the country where it all began last year: Greece. 
The Greeks won some breathing-space this week, thanks to a last-minute fudge over next year's budget agreed with the European Union and IMF ""troika"". Yet it could prove short-lived. If property-owners fail to come up with at least EUR 1.7 billion ($2.3 billion) in extra tax revenues by the end of the year, the budget deficit will rise above the new limit of 8.5% of GDP--already worse than the target set in last year's bail-out agreement (see chart)--and derail next year's projections. Evangelos Venizelos, the finance minister, speaks admiringly of the sacrifices Greeks have made, but warns that more is to come. His officials whisper that default is looming.
After merging this year's missed budget targets with those of 2012 ""to correct slippage"", as he puts it, Mr Venizelos hopes to achieve a fiscal tightening of EUR 7.1 billion next year, and to rack up a primary budget surplus (ie, before interest payments) of EUR 3.2 billion. But debt-servicing costs would still leave an overall deficit of 6.8% of GDP. Total debt will rise to 172% of GDP. 
George Papandreou, the prime minister, insists that Greece will meet its obligations. Others are more realistic. ""It's a myth that this amount of debt can ever be paid back in full, so we might as well get on with restructuring it,"" says one Athens banker. That would mean forcing Greece's biggest banks to merge, recapitalising them with funds from the EU and IMF and putting them under state control. 
Even so, Greece's chances of receiving the next slice of its loan from last year's bail-out, worth EUR 8 billion, and of staying afloat for a few more months have improved following the budget's approval, although the funds will now not be disbursed before November, later than scheduled. Beyond that, the outlook is cloudy, especially since euro-zone leaders are talking about rejigging Greece's second bail-out package, agreed last July. 
Mr Venizelos insists that Greece has enough cash to pay this month's EUR 1.5 billion bill for public-sector wages and pensions. Greece does not have to repay much debt until December, giving the troika a one-off opportunity to enforce compliance with structural reforms. There is plenty of arm-twisting to do.
Legislation to open up closed-shop professions, among them truckers, taxi-drivers, pharmacists and lawyers, needs fine-tuning. The unions, supported by former cabinet ministers, are fighting a proposal to replace collective wage agreements with company-level ones, a reform that would make it easier to fire workers. An overhaul of Greece's corrupt and unwieldy tax administration has been delayed.
A general strike by Greece's two main trade unions on October 5th went off peacefully (by Greek standards). This may be because many of the 30,000 public-sector workers facing dismissal are near retirement anyway. But renewed unrest is likely. The government has agreed to cut another 120,000 public-sector jobs by 2014. In the meantime, civil servants face a fresh round of wage cuts. Higher-paid officials will lose 15-20% of their monthly salary, on top of an across-the-board 20% reduction last year. ""I'm back where I was a decade ago in terms of income but now I have a young family and a mortgage,"" says a senior archaeologist at the culture ministry.
Fresh tax demands make things worse. In the next two months Greeks will have to pay a ""solidarity"" tax worth 2-5% of last year's income, along with a new property tax. Most taxpayers have not yet forked out for an earlier property tax. Taxing property makes sense because of the widespread Greek tendency to understate income. More than two-thirds of Greeks own their homes, and a large chunk of earnings from the grey economy during the boom years of the early 2000s was laundered through the construction of luxurious second homes. 
For the first time, middle-class Greeks are worried about making ends meet. The unemployment rate is set to remain above 16%. The recession will continue; some analysts warn that the official forecast of a contraction in GDP this year of 5.5% will prove to be an underestimate. If next year's projection of a 2.5% slump is right, Greece's economy will have shrunk by a frightening 14% over five years. 
The Greeks are in low spirits. A survey by Epipsy, a research institute, found that 54% of respondents regularly feel depressed. Few believe that politicians can lead them out of the mess. Mr Papandreou's approval rating has collapsed, along with that of his Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok), but the opposition New Democracy party has been unable to pick up the slack. At the halfway point of Mr Papandreou's term, almost half the electorate say a national-unity government would make a better fist of reforms. 
With the energetic Mr Venizelos also serving as his deputy prime minister, Mr Papandreou appears to have distanced himself from the day-to-day handling of Greece's plight, although he speaks frequently to Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and to Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president. Yet his party has stayed loyal; in spite of repeated rumblings of discontent among Pasok lawmakers, even the toughest measures have passed smoothly through parliament. Talk of an early election has subsided amid polls showing that neither of the two big parties would win a majority. Pasok deputies are likely to keep supporting Mr Papandreou; at least they will be able to hold on to their jobs for another two years.","How much more can Greeks take ?

IN AUGUST Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's prime minister, received a chilling letter. It warned him that ""pressing action by the Italian authorities is essential to restore the confidence of investors"". It set out a blueprint for privatisation and economic liberalisation, urging cuts in government spending so that the budget could be balanced in 2013, a year earlier than planned. This diktat was signed by Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, and his Italian successor, Mario Draghi, who takes over on November 1st. The threat was clear: the ECB would help Italy only if the prime minister took action to bring down its vast debt.
Mr Berlusconi adopted a new austerity budget (with some dubious numbers) but did virtually nothing to accelerate Italy's sclerotic growth. So on October 23rd, at the first of two European summits intended to deal with the euro's crisis, he was told by Germany and France to come up with a credible reform plan in time for the next summit, three days later. ""Italy has to save itself,"" says one German official. If Italy does perish, the euro dies too.
Partly for that reason, Europe's leaders do not have a great deal of leverage over Italy. But humiliation has had a certain effect. At a press conference after the first summit, Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy were asked whether they were reassured by Mr Berlusconi's promises. The German and French leaders hesitated, stole a glance and smirked. The room burst into laughter. Rarely has a leader--from a founding member of the European Union, no less--been treated so disdainfully by his peers. George Papandreou, the Greek prime minister, is regarded more with pity than with anger. Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, Spain's prime minister, has regained respect for belatedly pushing through reforms that cost him his leadership. 
Mr Berlusconi's friends feigned indignation at his treatment; supporters organised a ""laugh-in"" outside the French embassy in Rome (Germany commands greater courtesy). But even Mr Berlusconi does not appear to take himself seriously. The prime minister returned to Brussels with a letter long on self-justification and promises, most old and some new. But even his minor concessions are endangering his coalition. Mr Berlusconi blames Umberto Bossi, leader of the Northern League, for holding back pension reform. Mr Bossi, in turn, accuses Mr Draghi of trying to unseat the government. The ECB's letter, Mr Bossi says, was ""a fusillade against Berlusconi"". The euro's future could thus be determined by the actions of two Italians: Mr Berlusconi, the buffoon who may kill it; and Mr Draghi, the technocrat who may be the last man able to save it. Their new relationship may not start well; Mr Berlusconi broke off from discussions during the October 26th summit to tell an Italian television show that the euro was ""a currency without a central bank behind it"".
Mr Berlusconi rose from the collapse of Italy's old political order following the fall of the Berlin Wall and a succession of corruption investigations known as Mani Pulite (Clean Hands). He launched his own party; as a media mogul, he seemed fresh and dynamic. Court cases over alleged financial wrongdoings were an irritant but, in a country with widespread fraud and tax evasion, hardly fatal. At least, thought many, Mr Berlusconi might bring entrepreneurial vigour to government; his ribald comments about women were, well, part of being an Italian male. 
Set aside for a moment the squalid allegations of bunga-bunga parties. Mr Berlusconi's greatest failing has been his inability to reform the Italian economy despite ruling with a comfortable majority. Some saw him as a new Margaret Thatcher, but his economic liberalism was shallow; he perpetuated the old clientelism without the old parties. True, he has benefited from a weak opposition. But over time former allies, such as the Catholic church and business leaders, have turned against him. 
Some bits of excellence survive in Italy, such as family firms in the north of the country. In public life, the Bank of Italy is the last refuge of professionalism. It is as if Italian politicians have understood that, however much they mismanage the state, the central bank must be allowed to do its job. It is hardly unblemished (one ex-governor is appealing against a jail sentence), but it has produced a technocratic elite of sorts. It has bequeathed presidents and prime ministers (Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, an ex-governor, served as both) when trusted neutral figures were needed.
Mr Draghi is not entirely of this world: he served in the finance ministry, and also spent time in the private sector (at Goldman Sachs). Yet as the Bank of Italy's outgoing governor he has taken on its aura of competence and independence. He will preside over the ECB at a time of peril. Mr Trichet stretched his mandate by buying the bonds of distressed euro-zone states. He did so reluctantly, urging governments to take over the burden. But treasuries are short of money, and may never be able to protect large countries like Italy. If the firewall fails, only the ECB's unlimited fount of liquidity can quench the flames. Will Mr Draghi dare use it against the wishes of his biggest shareholder, Germany? Povera Italia
Nobody wants to test the proposition. It would help if Italy itself were less flammable. Yet Italy is stubbornly resistant to reform. The indolent political generation brought forth by Mr Berlusconi may finally be booted out, but there is no obvious replacement. One idea is to resort, as in the past, to a technocratic government to implement EU-inspired reforms, with support from all sides.
So 150 years after Italy cast off foreign rule and won independence, the country still needs the vincolo esterno, the ""external constraint"". For a time the role was played by the Americans and Europe. Now the constraint has an Italian name, Mr Draghi. If the euro is to survive, the ECB's new boss will need to save his country not just from the markets, but also from its politicians.","One could doom the euro; another could save it

EVEN by the euro zone's undemanding standards, a summit deal that survived less than a week is lamentable. Early on October 27th Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, hailed a ""comprehensive package"" to save the euro. Yet by the time The Economist went to press, their plans were in tatters. Greece's prime minister, George Papandreou, looked doomed, rejected by some of his ministers, many in his party--and, possibly, most of his country. 
The shallowness of the summit's achievements has been brutally exposed. Instead of settling into a period of calm, markets were thrown into new turmoil (see
). One way or another, the euro is destined for an unavoidable test of popular support. Unless the euro zone's leaders shape up, this is an encounter their currency may well lose. Heed the messenger
Mr Papandreou was in part the author of his own misfortune. Seeking the backing of the Greek people in a referendum, he was immediately condemned in the capitals of Europe as a fool or a traitor. Why had he wrecked all their good work? How dare he bring disaster on the rest of the euro zone when it had so generously bailed out his scapegrace of a country? A furious Mr Sarkozy and Mrs Merkel summoned him for a dressing-down on the fringes of the G20 summit in Cannes. Mr Sarkozy's hopes that this gathering might set the stage for generous emerging-market investment to support the euro were already faint. They now look impossible. 
There is no disputing that Mr Papandreou, in spectacularly chaotic style, has left the euro zone racked by uncertainty. His referendum now seems unlikely to take place. Perhaps Pasok, his party, will enter a government of national unity with New Democracy, the opposition, headed by a technocrat. Perhaps there will be an election. Perhaps even these plans will fall apart, just as the last did (see
). All the while, the clock is ticking: within a month or so, Greece must receive fresh funds from the IMF and its European rescuers--or messily default.
Mr Papandreou has created an almighty mess, but he is better cast as the messenger than the villain. He was not to blame for the summit's shortcomings. The spreads between Italian and German government debt had begun to widen well before Mr Papandreou dropped his bombshell. If the euro zone had put a credible firewall around the government bonds of Italy and other troubled euro countries, a Greek default would not now be threatening contagion. Stable sovereign borrowers would have helped to safeguard Europe's banks, and a decent plan to strengthen the weakest banks would have secured the door. But last week's summit deal--concocting a jerry-built firewall and asking the banks to boost their capital ratios by June next year--was not up to scratch. No wonder the markets took fright only days later.
At one level, Mr Papandreou does not deserve blame even for seeking a mandate on the summit's main achievement (though he must now be ruing his decision). Although the proposal to write down the face value of privately held Greek-government debt by 50% would be substantial and welcome, Greece's stock of debt would, even on best assumptions, still add up to 120% of GDP by 2020. All the while, the Greek people would be living with austerity.
Hence Mr Papandreou's most important message. Until now the euro crisis has chiefly been about pressure from the markets. But a country's finances are not defined by markets alone. Rather the limits of solvency are tested by people's willingness to accept tax rises and spending cuts. A government runs out of political capital long before it runs out of things to tax. In the end, won't pay matters more than can't pay.
Greece is farther down this road than any other member of the euro zone--even though other countries such as Portugal and Ireland have already seen their governments toppled and Spain is about to follow suit. Beset by rebels in his own party, by a hostile media and by strikes and protests, Mr Papandreou concluded that he would find it hard to impose the austerity being asked of Greece. Every quarter the EU, the IMF and the European Central Bank (ECB) scrutinise Greece before releasing the next chunk of money. With nowhere to hide, he decided to appeal over the heads of his opponents to the people. 
Greece's next government, whatever its composition, cannot escape the growing resentment of the country's political class. A growing but still small contingent of Greeks wants to defy the EU's treaties and quit the euro altogether. Fully 60% reject the summit deal. But Greek withdrawal still looks like a terrible mistake. Depositors would rush to pull their money out of Greek banks to protect their savings from being converted into new drachma. Greek firms would be bankrupted by their euro debts. The gain in competitiveness from devaluation would be transient if, as is likely, wages inflated along with prices. Even Greece's EU membership would be in doubt. What to do?
Greece's government must wisely spend what scant political capital it may have. Above all, the economy needs to grow. Despite their anger, 70% of Greeks say they want to remain in the euro, but their tolerance for austerity has limits. The government must devote less effort to growth-destroying tax rises and instead undertake growth-promoting structural reforms. It will have to begin facing down public-sector unions and enforcing barely implemented reforms. Mr Papandreou's government consistently took the easy way out.
The euro zone's emphasis on austerity rather than structural reforms has aggravated Greece's political woes. Instead it should favour medium-term fiscal consolidation. The creditor nations could boost domestic demand, to provide a bigger market for debtors' exports. Most of all, they should dispel the threat of contagion by putting the ECB's balance-sheet behind the debt of solvent governments, like Italy and Spain. Throughout this crisis, creditors--particularly Germany--have worried about being too soft on the euro zone's weaklings, for fear that they would go slow on reform. Mr Papandreou has shown that they also need to worry about being too austere.","The markets are not the euro 's only threat . Voters may be too

""WE SHOUT outside parliament, we call the politicians thieves and traitors, but they don't take any notice, they just go on letting us down,"" said Alexis Anagnostopoulos, an unemployed welder, after hearing about this week's plan by George Papandreou, his prime minister, to hold a referendum in December on the euro crisis. Yet as it turns out he and other angry Greeks may not even get to vote.
A first hurdle was a vote of confidence to endorse Mr Papandreou's proposed plebiscite. By the end of the week it seemed unlikely that his Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) could muster the required 151 votes and thus that he would even keep his job. After the October 2009 election Pasok had 160 seats in the 300-seat parliament. At the start of the week it had 152, but several more deputies promptly broke ranks. The most likely outcome as we went to press was a new government of national unity, perhaps led by a technocrat such as a central banker. Or there might be a fresh election. 
Mr Papandreou had already infuriated Greece's partners. He announced it without informing them or even his finance minister, Evangelos Venizelos, who conveniently retired to a hospital bed. The prime minister then demanded to renegotiate the country's EUR 130 billion ($179 billion) bail-out, less than a week after it had been accepted. The plebiscite would be held on the renegotiated package, he said at first. But an angry EU response and a summons to the Cannes G20 summit for a reprimand led Mr Papandreou to back down. The question would now be in or out, he said. Greeks feel blackmailed. Polls show that 60% are against the rigorous terms of the bail-out; but 70% want to stay in the euro.
But Mr Venizelos upped the stakes by openly opposing a referendum and, behind the scenes, fomenting a revolt within Pasok. Mr Papandreou was forced to call yet another emergency cabinet meeting on November 3rd, with most of his allies apparently deserting him. Whether this presages an abandonment of the referendum, an election or a new national government remained unclear. 
To add to the turmoil, Panos Beglitis, the defence minister and a close ally of Mr Papandreou's, had earlier sacked the armed forces' chiefs of staff. Sources in his office say that the generals, who were appointed by the previous New Democracy government, were ""misbehaving."" They had encouraged a group of retired officers to stage a protest inside the ministry over planned cuts in military pensions. Mr Beglitis said the top brass should have gone months ago. Yet the move suggests that, almost 40 years after the fall of the junta, Greek politicians are still nervous about the army's capacity to stir up trouble. 
Whatever now happens, it is clear that Mr Papandreou's risky gamble has backfired. The IMF and the European Commission made plain that they will withhold EUR 8 billion of funding due by mid-November. That would mean the government could not pay civil servants' salaries and hospital suppliers at the end of the month and might have difficulties meeting EUR 2 billion in debt repayments due in early December. As it is, a lot of Greece's much-touted reforms, including such promised privatisations as the loss-making Agricultural Bank of Greece, seem to be delayed or stuck, not least because the public sector is paralysed by protests.
As Greece's recession deepens (GDP is expected to shrink by at least 6% this year and a further 2.5% in 2012) the mood is growing ever bleaker. If the referendum went ahead, it is not even certain that 40% of the electorate, the required minimum to validate the result, would turn out to vote. At last year's local elections, turnout fell below 50% in many places. Many Greeks living in Athens and other cities are unlikely to make the journey back to the islands and villages where they are registered to vote. ""The price of a ferry ticket has doubled and it only goes twice a week. Why should I pay to participate in a political charade?"" says Angelos Papadakis, an engineer from the Cyclades.
If Greece ends up with an early election, New Democracy will surely finish ahead of Pasok, but it may not win an outright majority. Mr Papandreou's departure from office, and perhaps from politics, would not make Greece's relations with its creditors any easier. Antonis Samaras, New Democracy's leader, is unpopular in Europe because of his sustained opposition to the EU-IMF reform programme. Greece might have to settle for a new coalition, backed by EU officials installed in key ministries to push reforms through a recalcitrant bureaucracy. In any event, the prospect for ordinary Greeks is grim.","The uncertain political ramifications surrounding Greece and the euro

""DOES Greece want to remain part of the euro zone, yes or no?"" That was the blunt, existential question European leaders put to the Greek prime minister, George Papandreou, when they summoned him to an emergency dinner in Cannes on the eve of the G20 summit to explain his unexpected call for a referendum on the latest deal to salvage the euro. And that is the question they wanted the Greek people to vote on in the hope that the answer might be yes. But that referendum may never take place. As The Economist went to press, the prime minister's position seemed untenable, putting the vote into doubt. Much, it must be said, to the relief of some European leaders.
Greece does not have much time. Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, said it would not receive ""a single cent"" until it had cleared up the uncertainty. Barely a week after their ""comprehensive"" solution to the euro's crisis, European leaders must openly consider a chaotic Greek default, and its departure from the euro.
Finance ministers are rushing to erect the EUR 1 trillion ($1.4 million) firewall that the euro zone had designed at its last summit. But with markets already in panic, it may not be strong enough. Only the European Central Bank (ECB) can put up the ""wall of money"" that, in the words of Ireland's finance minister, Michael Noonan, is needed to protect vulnerable but solvent big debtors like Spain and Italy. Senior officials hope the ECB's new president, Mario Draghi, will ""do what is necessary to ensure that we will still have a euro"". But nobody can be sure.
No wonder markets are panicking, and no wonder European leaders are furious. ""Papandreou is an idiot,"" says one senior official. The Greek prime minister did not tell anyone, even his own finance minister, that he was about to gamble Greece, and the euro, on a referendum. His action smacked of ingratitude. The deal was the best yet offered to Greece: writing off half its debt to private creditors, with EUR 130 billion of cheap loans to keep the country going. The Greek move threatened to wreck the euro zone's painstakingly negotiated big solution. To add insult to injury, it ruined Mr Sarkozy's hopes for the G20 summit on November 3rd-4th, which was his chance to take the world stage ahead of his re-election campaign next year. But most dramatic of all, the move backfired on the prime minister himself. His finance minister, Evangelos Venizelos, who attended the grim dinner in Cannes, returned to Athens to declare defiantly that Greece's membership of the euro was an historic achievement that ""cannot depend on a referendum"". Mr Papandreou's last gamble may have hastened his demise. 
In truth, the euro zone's rescue was coming unstuck even before Mr Papandreou's blow. The details of the second Greek bail-out were left vague and, even if boosted, the euro's rescue fund was still inadequate. After a brief rally, the markets soon started worrying about Italy. Despite cobbling together a plan for growth and to bring down Italy's vast debt, government-bond yields have risen to dangerously high levels.
This new phase of the euro crisis shows, once again, how the underlying causes are political as much as economic. Doubts persist about the ability of the burlesque Silvio Berlusconi to carry out real reforms. Resistance from creditor countries, mainly Germany, constrains the rescue fund and the ECB. Popular anger in debtor countries, notably Greece, is testing the limits of austerity. 
The Greek population is at the point of revolt; the bureaucracy is refusing to modernise; the ruling Pasok party is scheming against its leaders; and the opposition New Democracy party is refusing to support vital reforms. So, Mr Papandreou must have wondered, why not turn to the people for support? Yet the EU has a deep fear of referendums. Voters in Denmark rejected the Maastricht treaty in 1992, those in France and the Netherlands threw out the draft constitution in 2005; the Irish temporarily blocked the Lisbon treaty in 2008. Eurosceptical British Tories want a referendum to force a renegotiation of Britain's membership or perhaps get out altogether. 
As a supranational body designed to overcome national jealousies, the EU is vulnerable to a backlash in one or other member. Integration has been slow and partial, often through technocratic measures that maintain enough ambiguity for all to claim victory. Fragmentation may often be inefficient--the EU does not yet have a single system of patents--but it is not usually fatal. This time it's different
Not so in the case of the euro. The euro zone is a hybrid: a single currency with 17 national fiscal and economic policies. It has no common treasury, no tax-raising powers, no joint bonds and no central bank acting as lender of last resort. In good times, this did not matter. But in the worst financial crisis in decades, the flaws are glaring. Even Mr Berlusconi cruelly described the euro as ""a strange currency that has convinced nobody"".
Countries cannot quit the euro without extreme economic pain, but nor is it easy to fix. Vetoes may be needed to maintain democratic consent, even if they make for poor crisis management. A blockage in one country endangers all. The markets are testing the ambiguities to destruction. Vague promises to ""do whatever it takes"" to save the euro are not enough. Will the ECB deploy its full resources to stop the crisis? How much intrusion into national policies are Greece and Italy ready to accept? How far is Germany willing to extend its credit? Will the euro zone's states hang together or hang separately?
These are big questions, affecting the nature of the state, sovereignty and democracy. Mr Papandreou may have messed up his tactics, but he was right on one point. The changes needed to save the euro are so profound in nature that, sooner or later, they must have the explicit consent of the people--or they will fail.","George W.

And that is the question they wanted the Greek people to vote on in the hope that the answer might be yes . But that referendum may never take place . As The Economist went to press , George W. Papandreou's position seemed untenable , putting the vote into doubt . Much , it must be said , to the relief of some European leaders . 
 Greece does not have much time . Nicolas Sarkozy , the French president , said it would not receive "" a single cent "" until it had cleared up the uncertainty . Barely a week after their "" comprehensive "" solution to the euro 's crisis , European leaders must openly consider a chaotic Greek default , and its departure from the euro . 
 Finance ministers are rushing to erect the EUR 1 trillion ( $ 1.4 million ) firewall that the euro zone had designed at its last summit . But with markets already in panic , it may not be strong enough . Only the European Central Bank ( ECB ) can put up the "" wall of money "" that , in the words of Ireland 's finance minister , Michael Noonan , is needed to protect vulnerable but solvent big debtors like Spain and Italy . Senior officials hope the ECB 's new president , Mario Draghi , will "" do what is necessary to ensure that we will still have a euro "" . But nobody can be sure . 
 No wonder markets are panicking , and no wonder European leaders are furious . "" George W. Papandreou is an idiot , "" says one senior official . George W. Papandreou did not tell anyone , even George W. Papandreou's own finance minister , that George W. Papandreou was about to gamble Greece , and the euro , on a referendum . George W. Papandreou's action smacked of ingratitude . The deal was the best yet offered to Greece : writing off half its debt to private creditors , with EUR 130 billion of cheap loans to keep the country going . The Greek move threatened to wreck the euro zone 's painstakingly negotiated big solution . To add insult to injury , it ruined Mr Sarkozy 's hopes for the G20 summit on November 3rd-4th , which was his chance to take the world stage ahead of his re - election campaign next year . But most dramatic of all , the move backfired on George W. Papandreou W. Papandreou . His finance minister , Evangelos Venizelos , who attended the grim dinner in Cannes , returned to Athens to declare defiantly that Greece 's membership of the euro was an historic achievement that "" can not depend on a referendum "" . George W. Papandreou's last gamble may have hastened George W. Papandreou's demise . 
 In truth , the euro zone 's rescue was coming unstuck even before George W. Papandreou's blow . The details of the second Greek bail - out were left vague and , even if boosted , the euro 's rescue fund was still inadequate . After a brief rally , the markets soon started worrying about Italy . Despite cobbling together a plan for growth and to bring down Italy 's vast debt , government - bond yields have risen to dangerously high levels . 
 This new phase of the euro crisis shows , once again , how the underlying causes are political as much as economic . Doubts persist about the ability of the burlesque Silvio Berlusconi to carry out real reforms . Resistance from creditor countries , mainly Germany , constrains the rescue fund and the ECB . Popular anger in debtor countries , notably Greece , is testing the limits of austerity . 
 The Greek population is at the point of revolt ; the bureaucracy is refusing to modernise ; the ruling Pasok party is scheming against its leaders ; and the opposition New Democracy party is refusing to support vital reforms . So , George W. Papandreou must have wondered , why not turn to the people for support ? Yet the EU has a deep fear of referendums . Voters in Denmark rejected the Maastricht treaty in 1992 , those in France and the Netherlands threw out the draft constitution in 2005 ; the Irish temporarily blocked the Lisbon treaty in 2008 . Eurosceptical British Tories want a referendum to force a renegotiation of Britain 's membership or perhaps get out altogether . 
 As a supranational body designed to overcome national jealousies , the EU is vulnerable to a backlash in one or other member . Integration has been slow and partial , often through technocratic measures that maintain enough ambiguity for all to claim victory . Fragmentation may often be inefficient -- the EU does not yet have a single system of patents -- but it is not usually fatal . This time it 's different 
 Not so in the case of the euro . The euro zone is a hybrid : a single currency with 17 national fiscal and economic policies . It has no common treasury , no tax - raising powers , no joint bonds and no central bank acting as lender of last resort . In good times , this did not matter . But in the worst financial crisis in decades , the flaws are glaring . Even Mr Berlusconi cruelly described the euro as "" a strange currency that has convinced nobody "" . 
 Countries can not quit the euro without extreme economic pain , but nor is it easy to fix . Vetoes may be needed to maintain democratic consent , even if they make for poor crisis management . A blockage in one country endangers all . The markets are testing the ambiguities to destruction . Vague promises to "" do whatever it takes "" to save the euro are not enough . Will the ECB deploy its full resources to stop the crisis ? How much intrusion into national policies are Greece and Italy ready to accept ? How far is Germany willing to extend its credit ? Will the euro zone 's states hang together or hang separately ? 
 These are big questions , affecting the nature of the state , sovereignty and democracy . George W. Papandreou may have messed up George W. Papandreou's tactics , but George W. Papandreou was right on one point . The changes needed to save the euro are so profound in nature that , sooner or later , they must have the explicit consent of the people -- or they will fail .",350,Greece,A30-94,IN TERM,True,George Papandreou,19,True

""JUST when I thought I was out, they pull me back in."" Investors must be tempted to echo the words of Al Pacino in ""The Godfather: Part III"". Markets rally every time euro-zone leaders announce a plan to solve their debt crisis, as they did again on October 27th. But within a few days, it becomes apparent that each package has not solved the underlying problems, and investors are pulled back into the mayhem.
On October 31st the unheralded announcement by George Papandreou, the Greek prime minister, that he would call a referendum on the debt deal turned market sentiment drastically. It prompted intense pressure from Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, that any such referendum be held as soon as possible and become a vote on staying in the euro. By November 3rd, as The Economist went to press, the prospect of a vote that could pave the way for an exit from the euro, and a disorderly default, had pushed the Greek government to the brink of collapse.
A Greek default would alarm investors in other indebted nations, such as Portugal and Italy, and might trigger the very financial meltdown the authorities have been striving to avoid. European bank shares, which rallied on initial news of the deal, slumped again on the referendum news (see left-hand chart). There is also the risk that depositors will shift their funds from banks in weak countries to safer havens. David Owen, an economist at Jefferies International, notes that Portuguese and Irish banks have pushed up deposit rates in recent months in an attempt to dissuade savers from withdrawing their money. 
If Mr Papandreou is ousted or his government falls, a referendum becomes much less likely. But uncertainty about Greece's ability to stay the painful course and remain in the euro will persist. 
Doubts about the deal had emerged even before the Greek thunderbolts. It was not clear that the euro-zone leaders had done enough to bolster their rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), so that it could plausibly stand behind the debts of Italy and Spain. Ten-year Italian bond yields rose back above 6%, with the spread over German Bunds reaching a record euro-era high. 
European leaders hoped that emerging economies, particularly China, might put money into a special purpose investment vehicle (unhappily, SPIV) capitalised by the EFSF. That would help bolster the EFSF's remaining firepower to EUR 1 trillion ($1.4 trillion). But the early signs were that such countries would be willing to invest only small amounts, and then on terms that would leave European governments bearing even more of the risks. A EUR 3 billion bond issue by the EFSF was postponed on November 2nd because of the uncertainty.
Nor was it clear whether the requirement for banks to raise EUR 106.5 billion of capital would be enough to reassure investors, or if it would instead force banks to shrink their balance-sheets, thereby shrinking the supply of credit to industry. 
Investors were also unnerved by signs that the European economy seems to be slipping closer to recession. The euro-zone purchasing managers' index for the manufacturing sector fell to 47.1 in October, the third month it has been below the crucial 50 level, signifying a decline in activity. Unemployment in the region rose to 16.2m in September, the highest since the launch of the euro. The OECD cut its forecast for euro-zone growth in 2012 from 2% to 0.3%.
European stockmarkets fell heavily on November 1st, with Greek and Italian indices falling by 7%. The euro also dropped to $1.37, having been as high as $1.42 in the wake of the debt deal. It made for a very uncomfortable first day at work for Mario Draghi, the new head of the European Central Bank. The ECB was reportedly buying Italian bonds this week but it has not made the kind of unlimited commitment to purchase bonds desired by many commentators (see Economics Focus). Many have their eyes on the huge amount of bond redemptions Italy faces next spring (see right-hand chart on previous page).
Global markets took their cue from Europe, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling by 573 points over the course of October 31st and November 1st. In October stocks on Wall Street enjoyed their best monthly gain since 1974 on the back of economic data that soothed fears of a double-dip recession and robust third-quarter earnings reports from S&P 500 firms. But a European collapse would still be very bad news for American banks and exporters.
Investors rushed for the safety of Treasury bonds, where the ten-year yield dropped back below 2%. Worries about the euro also prompted traders to flee to the perceived safety of the yen, prompting the Japanese authorities to attempt to weaken their currency. All of which meant yet another crisis-strewn agenda for the G20 leaders meeting in Cannes as The Economist went to press. If only summits created economic wealth, the world's problems would all have long been solved.","George W. Papandreou's botched referendum plan has left the debt deal in trouble

WHEN BRITAIN ABANDONED the gold standard in 1931, it was not only forsaking a system for managing the currency but also acknowledging that it could no longer bear the mantle of empire. When America broke the dollar's peg with gold in 1971, it ushered in a decline that continued until Paul Volcker re-established confidence in the currency in the early 1980s. As Joseph Schumpeter, the great Austrian economist, once wrote: ""The monetary system of a people reflects everything that the nation wants, does, suffers, is.""
In the same way, the crisis that has engulfed the European Union (EU) is about much more than the euro. As government bonds, share prices and banks swoon and global recession knocks on the door, the first fear is of financial and economic collapse. But to understand what is happening to the currency you also need to look at what is happening to Europe. 
The euro will not be safe until Europe answers some fundamental questions that it has run away from for many years. At their root is how its nations should respond to a world that is rapidly changing around them. What will it do as globalisation strips the West of the monopoly over the technologies that have made it rich, and an ageing Europe starts to look increasingly like the western peninsula of a resurgent Asia?
Some Europeans would like to put up carefully designed fences around the EU's still vast and wealthy market. Others, including a growing number of populist politicians, want to turn their nations inward and shut out not just the world but also the elites' project of European integration. And a few--from among those same elites, mostly--argue that the only means of paying for Europe's distinctive way of life is not to evade globalisation but to embrace it wholeheartedly.
This is not some abstract philosophical choice. It is a fierce struggle for Europe's future, being waged in Athens as George Papandreou loses power to a temporary government of national unity, in derelict factories in France and Belgium and in the wasted lives of millions of unemployed young Spaniards. This struggle will set the limits on Europe's welfare state. It will determine how the unbalanced partnership between Germany and France, and an increasingly detached Britain, will shape the EU. It will define the high politics of Brussels and the low politics of European populism. And it will decide the fate of the device that Schumpeter would see as the embodiment of all this: the euro.
Just now the euro zone is caught in a dismal downward spiral. Fears about whether the governments in Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Spain and, most alarmingly, Italy will honour their EUR 3 trillion ($4.2 trillion) or so of borrowing are wrecking European banks, which own their debt. Struggling banks undermine confidence and credit. Coming on top of fiscal austerity, this is bringing on recession, deepening fears that governments will be unable to pay back their debts, which further weakens the banks. And so the vice turns, down towards disaster.
The euro zone still has the capacity to stop this run on its banks and governments. As a block, it is less indebted than America and its public-sector deficit is lower. It has the money to fortify its banks against the default of Greece--and Portugal and Ireland, if need be. And it is minded by the European Central Bank (ECB), which can in principle stand behind those vulnerable governments by buying their debt in unlimited quantities on the secondary market. But the EU has repeatedly failed to put forward a convincing euro rescue. Its latest and bravest attempt, at the end of last month, fell short of the mark--just like all the others. That is because the Europeans are deeply at odds over what the crisis is really about, and riven by disagreement over what each country must contribute towards solving it (see next article). So long as the euro zone's members cannot settle these arguments, or at least agree that their differences matter less than finding a solution, the collective action needed to defend the euro will remain impossible. Many roads to disaster
While the world waits for Europe to make up its mind, catastrophe is in the air. It could take many forms. A country might storm out of the euro--which the treaty forbids, but who could stop a determined government? European banks might suffer a fatal loss of confidence. Italy or Spain might become unable to borrow on decent terms. Or a government trying to impose austerity might be replaced by one that rejects it. Any of these could cause contagion and plunge the world economy into depression.
Some people speculate that Germany might lead a breakaway core of euro-zone countries. But as the Teutonic euro soared in value, banks and companies would lose huge sums on their assets abroad and its exporters would find themselves at a disadvantage. Besides, for Germany to flout an EU treaty so brazenly would damage all EU law, which argues strongly against it.
Greece is more likely to buckle under austerity and quit after a succession of governments like the new one. But it would be a desperate act. Banks would collapse and capital flee, and many of Greece's companies, unable to pay their euro-denominated bills, would go bankrupt. Already shut out of debt markets, Greece would probably lose all financial aid from the EU.
Amid recession and the contagion of a debt default, bank collapse or Greek departure from the euro, Europe's single market would be in danger. At an EU summit in 2008, when the financial crisis was raging, Nicolas Sarkozy chastised the commission for being too zealous in upholding competition. A senior official reckons that, if the French president had at that moment asked for a vote, the heads of government would have suspended the rules. The crisis today is at least as grave as it was then.
Since it is possible to avoid such a catastrophe, you might think that the worst will not happen. And indeed it is unlikely--but not impossible. Precisely because of the dire consequences, everyone is counting on the next person to see reason. The new Greek government might reckon that Europe would never let Greece collapse. At the same time the ECB and Germany might refuse to step in, because they do not want countries to evade reform. Or perhaps austerity might eventually lead to populists that turn away from the euro--to hell with the consequences.
A euro-zone central banker confesses that he has lately been thinking about historical catastrophes such as the first world war and wondering how the world blundered into them. ""From the middle of a crisis"", he says ominously, ""you can see how easy it is to make mistakes.""
Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) was supposed to banish the competitive devaluations that threatened the single market in the early 1990s. It promised to bind a unified Germany into the EU and pave the way for some sort of political union in Europe. Today that dream has not vanished altogether, but the single market is under threat once more. Europe's nations are at loggerheads, Germany is in a state of outrage, and the link between the euro and the nation state is more fraught than ever. EMU truly is, writes David Marsh, author of a history of the euro, ""Europe's Melancholy Union"".
""The 2008 crisis shows that the dominant economies were not as dominant as they thought,"" says Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the French former head of the IMF. ""If Europe fails, it will suffer from low growth, economic domination and cultural domination."" Can Europe turn back from the abyss?

TIPOS INFAMES IS a fine bookshop in central Madrid, run by three young friends and stocked with the sort of books you were always meaning to read, until work and children got in the way. Well aware that the intellect needs gentle encouragement, the owners lure you in with strong coffee and generous glasses of Spanish wine. Running a bookshop is difficult, says ""Curro"" Llorca; these days he doesn't get so much reading done either. But business is passable.
Curro and his friends needed three years to set up shop. They had to obtain a full house of separate permits, one to sell books, a second to sell coffee and a third to sell wine. The town hall said not to worry and advised Curro to open his doors while he was still waiting for the paperwork. But the budding entrepreneurs wondered what they would do if the police turned up.
Tormented by unemployment, Spain needs new firms like Tipos Infames. Yet in the World Bank's ranking of how easy it is to start a business the country comes only 133rd, after Kenya. 
Next to quelling the crisis, the single most important task facing Europe's economies is to grow, because only then will they eventually be able to pay off their debts. In order to do that, they need to improve their competitiveness. And the best route to improved competitiveness is to streamline the public sector and overhaul the markets for labour and services. 
Yet Europe has failed for many years to accomplish just such structural reforms. Looking at Curro, the economic logic for change is unanswerable. But the politics is grim. Across Europe, business is held back by bureaucracy. Powerful interest groups are protected at the expense of everyone else.
The crisis only strengthens the case for reform (see box). But it also means that reform must take place against the background of austerity, as societies struggle to determine who will shoulder the burden of debt. The darkening clouds of civil disobedience and anarchy confronting Greece's new government show where this struggle can lead. Europe's future depends not just on governments putting forward the right policies but on the capacity of democracies to bring about peaceful change. How to gain in Spain
How might reform work? Again, consider Spain. Reform there should stand a good chance. The country has done well out of EU membership. After it joined in 1986, incomes caught up with the rest of the union. Its large exporters have remained an island of efficiency, as competitive as any in Europe. Spain recently signalled its commitment to the euro zone by writing a cap on future deficits into the constitution. 
Moreover, the Spanish may be about to vote for change. An election later this month is likely to bring in a new conservative government under Mariano Rajoy of the People's Party (PP). If the opinion polls are to be believed, he stands to win a sweeping victory and to be able to govern with an absolute majority. Given that the PP also controls many of Spain's regions, Mr Rajoy will have an unprecedented mandate to remake Spain. ""People know the PP is going to be severe,"" says Jose Ignacio Torreblanca of the European Council on Foreign Relations.
But what a task he faces. A prime target will be Spain's notoriously dysfunctional labour market. This provides a group of ageing, virtually unsackable ""insiders"" with gold-plated contracts, whereas the rest have to make do with highly insecure temporary contracts. Among other things, insiders benefit from wage-escalation clauses, so that in 2009 real pay rose by 3.2% even though the economy shrank by 3.7%. And Spain gives young people a terrible deal: in a downturn they are the first to be sacked. Not only are roughly half of under-30s out of work, but those who do have jobs are mainly on temporary contracts that leave them without a career structure and give firms no incentive to train them. 
Mr Rajoy is elusive about his plans. The outgoing government has undertaken some labour-market reform, but most people expect the PP to go much further and doubt that the weakened Spanish unions will be able to put up much of a fight. But that is the easy bit. To transform the Spanish economy, Mr Rajoy also needs to take on two far more elusive foes.
First is the country's dense jungle of regulation and bureaucracy. This dates back to Franco, who from the 1950s sought to give Spaniards more freedom by trying to establish the rule of law even as he denied them democracy. The profusion of administrative law created a dense and unaccountable bureaucracy. Ignacio Sanchez-Cuenca, director of the Juan March Institute in Madrid, encountered so many obstacles to hiring academics from outside the EU for the institute that it took up a quarter of his time. So he hired a firm of lawyers to do the job and now spends 5-10% of his budget that way.
What makes Spain's bureaucracy especially poisonous is Mr Rajoy's second foe: the country's fiercely independent regions. Each tends to interpret regulations in its own way, so over time the Spanish market has fragmented. Juan Jose Guemes, a PP politician and a professor at the IE Business School in Madrid, explains how the star-rating system for hotels differs slightly across Spain, which limits competition among national and international chains and reduces economies of scale. Last year the Catalan government decreed that hotels must serve pa amb tomaquet, bread with tomato, a local speciality, if they are to count as ""luxury"". Miguel Cardoso, an economist at BBVA, a Spanish bank, estimates that, thanks to a lack of competition, half of the inflation in Spain over and above the average for the euro zone in the past 15-20 years came from firms increasing their margins.
Mr Guemes's colleague at IE, Fernando Fernandez, adds that each of the regions sponsors its own development policy and its own businesses, often financed by local savings banks. This is inefficient, but the regions are popular because they spend taxes collected by the central government. Moreover, regional autonomy is an antidote to the centralising, anti-union bias of Franco's Spain. Even if the centre can control the regions' spending--a big if--""we have a free market at the national level and are protectionist at the regional level,"" says Mr Fernandez.
Each reforming government in Europe faces different obstacles, but Spain is typical of them all in the sense that radical structural reform entails rewriting the social contract. Just now the generous wages of many of those in Spain's protected jobs are supporting entire households of unemployed spouses and grown-up children. Scrapping thousands of bureaucratic rules will not just make the economy more efficient but also recast the relations between government and citizen. However unambiguous the economics of reform, the politics is almost always hard.
Too hard for some. Rome alone is said to have half as many lawyers as the whole of France. The legal system there moves so slowly, Italians joke, that they put you in jail when you are accused and release you when they find you guilty. Yet faced with the liberalisation of their profession in a recent budget, Italy's lawyers somehow managed to hang on to their perks--was it because so many politicians are lawyers?
Instead of imposing reforms, the fag-end of a government under Silvio Berlusconi has relied excessively on tax rises. After he was shamed by euro-zone leaders during recent summits Mr Berlusconi at last came up with a more ambitious programme--but even then he was obliged to accept the supervision of the IMF. The mix of hopelessness and humiliation has left his government close to collapse.
Others have shown more courage. Ireland's government has cut wages and slashed benefits and services. Unit labour costs have fallen by 8% and the economy grew by 1.6% in the second quarter. The cuts have been even harsher in Estonia, where the economy shrank by 15% in 2009. Growth has soared since then and unemployment tumbled. Still, both economies face a hard slog. Because they are counting on foreign demand as a source of growth, they are vulnerable to a global recession.
The nightmare is Greece. Government there has never been about the rational design and administration of policy, but about dishing out patronage. When George Papaconstantinou, the country's finance minister at the time, was asked why tax receipts collapsed in 2009, the year his government came to office, he explained that ""the first thing the government does in an election year is pull the tax collectors off the streets."" 
Even so, the government of George Papandreou (in which Mr Papaconstantinou served) undertook reform with a savagery that would once have been unthinkable. He had a gun to his head, because the troika of the EU, the IMF and the ECB release aid each quarter only if the Greek government meets its targets. 
Yet, beset by protests, a shrinking economy, the dishonour of being bossed around by foreigners and the prospect of a decade of further austerity, Mr Papandreou could not carry the country with him. His reluctantly resigned, following a botched proposal to hold a referendum on the euro zone's plans for Greece. The installation of a new government of national unity smacks of Argentina, where a succession of short-lived administrations fought to avoid default--before eventually succumbing.
Mr Papandreou's ejection contains a warning. At root, the solvency of a country is determined by the government's capacity to raise revenues and cut spending. Politicians run up against the popular will long before they run out of things to tax.
The crisis has also brought down governments in Ireland, Portugal and Slovakia. Spain, and others, are likely to follow. Where will voters turn when they have had their fill of austerity and reform? The lesson of the 1930s and of emerging-market crises down the years is that people can take only so much austerity. If the burden gets too heavy, the political system collapses.
This fear lies behind the warnings of Milton Friedman and Martin Feldstein, two American economists, who said that the euro is inherently unstable. Until recently euro zone leaders scoffed at such talk. But in the past couple of weeks they have suddenly begun to contemplate Greece's departure from the single currency. And contemplation is one step short of action. Their change of heart is not just because of mayhem in Athens, but also because of the difficult politics of the euro at home.""
Spain needs new companies like Tipos Infames. Yet the country comes only 133rd in the World Bank's ranking of how easy it is to start a business""

 TIPOS INFAMES IS a fine bookshop in central Madrid , run by three young friends and stocked with the sort of books you were always meaning to read , until work and children got in the way . Well aware that the intellect needs gentle encouragement , the owners lure you in with strong coffee and generous glasses of Spanish wine . Running a bookshop is difficult , says "" Curro "" Llorca ; these days he does n't get so much reading done either . But business is passable . 
 Curro and his friends needed three years to set up shop . They had to obtain a full house of separate permits , one to sell books , a second to sell coffee and a third to sell wine . The town hall said not to worry and advised Curro to open his doors while he was still waiting for the paperwork . But the budding entrepreneurs wondered what they would do if the police turned up . 
 Tormented by unemployment , Spain needs new firms like Tipos Infames . Yet in the World Bank 's ranking of how easy it is to start a business the country comes only 133rd , after Kenya . 
 Next to quelling the crisis , the single most important task facing Europe 's economies is to grow , because only then will they eventually be able to pay off their debts . In order to do that , they need to improve their competitiveness . And the best route to improved competitiveness is to streamline the public sector and overhaul the markets for labour and services . 
 Yet Europe has failed for many years to accomplish just such structural reforms . Looking at Curro , the economic logic for change is unanswerable . But the politics is grim . Across Europe , business is held back by bureaucracy . Powerful interest groups are protected at the expense of everyone else . 
 The crisis only strengthens the case for reform ( see box ) . But it also means that reform must take place against the background of austerity , as societies struggle to determine who will shoulder the burden of debt . The darkening clouds of civil disobedience and anarchy confronting Greece 's new government show where this struggle can lead . Europe 's future depends not just on governments putting forward the right policies but on the capacity of democracies to bring about peaceful change . How to gain in Spain 
 How might reform work ? Again , consider Spain . Reform there should stand a good chance . The country has done well out of EU membership . After it joined in 1986 , incomes caught up with the rest of the union . Its large exporters have remained an island of efficiency , as competitive as any in Europe . Spain recently signalled its commitment to the euro zone by writing a cap on future deficits into the constitution . 
 Moreover , the Spanish may be about to vote for change . An election later this month is likely to bring in a new conservative government under Mariano Rajoy of the People 's Party ( PP ) . If the opinion polls are to be believed , he stands to win a sweeping victory and to be able to govern with an absolute majority . Given that the PP also controls many of Spain 's regions , Mr Rajoy will have an unprecedented mandate to remake Spain . "" People know the PP is going to be severe , "" says Jose Ignacio Torreblanca of the European Council on Foreign Relations . 
 But what a task he faces . A prime target will be Spain 's notoriously dysfunctional labour market .

IT TOOK several days of back-and-forth talks, missed deadlines and public and private outrage, but Greece finally has a new prime minister. On November 10th Lucas Papademos, a former vice-president of the European Central Bank, was named to replace George Papandreou, who had pledged to stand down four days earlier. The decision meant Greece had come full circle in less than a working week: on November 7th Mr Papademos had looked like a shoo-in for the job before negotiations went sour.
It may have taken a while to reach, but the choice at least looks sensible. Mr Papademos, an academic economist and a member of no political party, has the reputation to reassure Greece's bail-out partners, and his financial expertise should prove useful when it comes to implementing the complexities of the looming 50% haircut private holders of Greece's bonds must suffer, under a deal struck in Brussels on October 26th.
The last casualty of this week's wrangling was Philippos Petsalnikos, the speaker of parliament. A German-speaker skilled at keeping Greek lawmakers in order, he looked like a dead certainty to replace Mr Papandreou on the afternoon of November 9th. Mr Papandreou even delivered an emotional valedictory television address to the nation (although he did not name Mr Petsalnikos as his successor). Yet later that day Mr Papandreou (pictured, above, with President Karolos Papoulias) was forced to withdraw Mr Petsalnikos's candidacy amid a threatened rebellion by backbenchers in his Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok). They blamed Mr Petsalnikos for helping Mr Papandreou put together his ill-fated proposal for a referendum on Greece's new EUR 130 billion ($178 billion) bail-out package. That plan had been shot down by euro-zone leaders at the G20 summit in Cannes, triggering Mr Papandreou's decision on November 6th to step down (see Charlemagne).
Mr Papademos's ""first"" candidacy fell foul because he wanted to choose his own economic team. This proved unacceptable to Pasok, largely because it would probably not have included Evangelos Venizelos, Mr Papandreou's finance minister, who is not popular among EU and IMF officials. New Democracy was not keen on Mr Papademos either; he wanted an open-ended term rather than stick to an agreed February 19th deadline for elections.
Mr Venizelos threw his hat into the ring at the last moment, after running a whispering campaign against Mr Papademos. An ambitious constitutional lawyer, he is keen to succeed Mr Papandreou as Pasok leader. But he needs a position from which to build his campaign.
Mr Papademos kept a dignified distance from the chaotic politicking of the last week. But he reportedly added two more conditions. He wants support from New Democracy, which was reluctant to take up more than a few cabinet posts in the new government. And in line with a European Commission demand, he insists that both party leaders should sign a letter of commitment to the new bail-out terms. 
Mr Papandreou is willing to sign up. But Mr Samaras caused consternation in Brussels by apparently refusing to do so following objections from his party (though a later statement left open the possibility). Mr Samaras annoyed Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and other European conservatives by opposing Greece's first bail-out. He says he supports the second one, but EU officials are still unconvinced.
Over the next few weeks Mr Papademos will struggle with the country's first coalition government in modern times. Left-wing parties rejected Mr Papandreou's call for national unity. They plan to take their opposition to the streets.","How not to form a government

That plan had been shot down by euro - zone leaders at the G20 summit in Cannes , triggering George W. Papandreou's decision on November 6th to step down ( see Charlemagne ) . 
 Mr Papademos 's "" first "" candidacy fell foul because George W. Papandreou wanted to choose George W. Papandreou's own economic team . This proved unacceptable to Pasok , largely because it would probably not have included Evangelos Venizelos , George W. Papandreou's finance minister , who is not popular among EU and IMF officials . New Democracy was not keen on Mr Papademos either ; he wanted an open - ended term rather than stick to an agreed February 19th deadline for elections . 
 Mr Venizelos threw his hat into the ring at the last moment , after running a whispering campaign against Mr Papademos . An ambitious constitutional lawyer , he is keen to succeed George W. Papandreou as Pasok leader . But he needs a position from which to build his campaign . 
 Mr Papademos kept a dignified distance from the chaotic politicking of the last week . But he reportedly added two more conditions . He wants support from New Democracy , which was reluctant to take up more than a few cabinet posts in the new government . And in line with a European Commission demand , he insists that both party leaders should sign a letter of commitment to the new bail - out terms . 
 George W. Papandreou is willing to sign up . But Mr Samaras caused consternation in Brussels by apparently refusing to do so following objections from his party ( though a later statement left open the possibility ) . Mr Samaras annoyed Angela Merkel , the German chancellor , and other European conservatives by opposing Greece 's first bail - out . He says he supports the second one , but EU officials are still unconvinced . 
 Over the next few weeks Mr Papademos will struggle with the country 's first coalition government in modern times . Left - wing parties rejected George W. Papandreou's call for national unity .

EUROPE has claimed the scalps of two leaders in almost as many days. First George Papandreou, the Greek prime minister, promised to resign, and then Italy's Silvio Berlusconi did the same. Both leaders have been in trouble for some time, but the immediate cause of their downfall is plain: the ultimatum they received from euro-zone leaders at the G20 summit in Cannes to reform their economies--or else.
Mr Papandreou was instructed to approve the last European bail-out deal or risk losing his loans and being ejected from the euro. He scrapped his call for a referendum, and agreed on November 6th to make way for a government of national unity. With Italy's bond yields reaching danger levels, Mr Berlusconi was told he lacked credibility and was made to ""invite"" the IMF to supervise his reforms. On November 8th, though, Mr Berlusconi lost his majority in parliament, and agreed to step down once the reforms are passed. 
Two taboos were broken in Cannes. It was the first time euro-zone leaders accepted that a member could default and leave the euro. (And once the unthinkable is possible, why stop at Greece?) It was also the first time leaders intruded so deliberately into the internal politics of other countries. 
True, the European Union has long influenced national politics. Think of how Conservative divisions over Europe contributed to the resignation of Britain's Margaret Thatcher in 1990, or how new members have transformed themselves to join the EU, or how Italy reformed its public finances to qualify for the euro in 1999. In the past year the crisis has brought down the prime ministers of Ireland and Portugal after they needed to be bailed out.
Yet something has changed. Europeans see themselves as a family; they have rows, but nobody questions a member's right to be part of the clan. But at Cannes euro-zone leaders made plain that family members could be forsaken, even disinherited. Some see this as an assault on national democracies by the European elite, be it unelected or self-appointed (as in the case of the German-French duo of ""Merkozy"", Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy). Much has been written about the subjugation of Greece, the cradle of democracy, under a second German occupation. 
And much of it is nonsense. Italy and Greece chose freely to join the euro, and every club has norms of behaviour. In a monetary union, irresponsibility by one member endangers the well-being of others. If Italy and Greece had not been so over-indebted and sclerotic, they would not be in such trouble today. Countries that extend financial help have a right to impose conditions to ensure that their loans are repaid. The alternative to euro-zone diktat is being abandoned to the market. And if a response is needed, it will inevitably be led by Germany and France.
Yet there is something to the critics' charges. For many countries, such as Spain, the EU has been an anchor of democracy. But as the crisis persists, austerity drags on and the euro zone integrates to save itself, the legitimacy of the enterprise will suffer. The pain would be more acceptable if the creditors acted as if they believed they faced an existential threat. But rather than commit their full resources to the crisis, they are seeking to limit their liability. This raises a sense of double standards: one kind of democracy for creditors, another for debtors. Everybody must understand the constraints on Mrs Merkel. But Mr Papandreou commits a ""breach of trust"" if he calls a referendum.
The debtors, moreover, bear the cost of the creditors' mistakes. In Greece the IMF (rightly) wanted the adjustment programme to focus more on growth-promoting structural reforms; the Europeans prioritised deficit-reduction. A deeper-than-forecast recession means Greece must chase ever-receding fiscal targets with ever more austerity. Its first bail-out gave it three-year loans at punitive interest rates, with no debt reduction. The latest rescue offers Greece cheap rates for up to 30 years, with a 50% haircut on private bondholders. At least one of these options was wrong, and neither may be enough to save Greece. Germany belatedly accepted the need for the rescue fund to be larger and more flexible. Had all this been done sooner, the crisis might have been contained more easily, and at lower cost. First fight the fire
Right now the emphasis needs to be on firefighting. Italy is burning, and the rest of the euro area could be consumed with it. Decisions cannot be hostage to the vicissitudes of 17 national parliaments. And Germany restraining the European Central Bank is like insisting that water buckets are used instead of fire engines.
In the longer term, though, the euro zone will need a new fire code. The EU's treaties are likely to be reopened, again. Euro members will have to abide by stricter fiscal rules and accept intrusive inspection by outsiders. The loss of sovereignty would be more acceptable to debtors if the creditors were to accept the need, eventually, to issue joint Eurobonds. 
Independent institutions are needed to make the system work. Most would prefer the unelected European Commission over an intergovernmental body dominated by Merkozy. The commission, moreover, would act as a vital link between the 17 euro ""ins"" and the ten non-euro ""outs"", preventing the sort of two-speed Europe now openly advocated by France. More Europe should not mean more Sarkozy and less single market.
Saving the euro requires more pain for some, more generosity from others and fundamental change for all. Is it worth it? Sooner or later, citizens must be asked. Without their support, no reform can last. And a real choice must include the option of leaving the euro. Now that this taboo has been breached, the euro zone should start thinking about how best to arrange the departure of those that cannot, or will not, live by Germanic rules.","Efforts to save the euro can not run against the will of the voters indefinitely

FOR a taste of the real Spain, try Castile-La Mancha. This is the land of Manchego cheese and saffron. The vast plains are dotted with the windmills at which Don Quixote once tilted. Squatting incongruously among them is a EUR 1.1 billion ($1.5 billion) white elephant: Ciudad Real's airport. Other than the chirping of autumn crickets, the silence is absolute. The last commercial flights ceased at the end of October (the airport remains open to private planes). The only signs of life at the visitor centre are bats in the ventilation shafts. 
This airport tells a tale about Spain. In the past decade, during el boom, money poured in, inflating a huge construction bubble. Grand infrastructure projects like Ciudad Real airport sprouted. Many of Spain's 17 regional governments channelled cash into trophy schemes--universities, art galleries, high-speed rail--with no concern for whether they would pay their way. They were abetted by the cajas, small unlisted savings banks, often with opaque ownership structures, that lent recklessly on the assumption that property prices could move only in one direction. 
All these sins are evident in Ciudad Real's airport. Although private, it was backed by Castile La-Mancha's Socialist government. It was part-funded by a caja that went bust. After a couple of years of misery, in which passenger numbers came nowhere near estimates, the airport's managers filed for bankruptcy. It is tempting to call the project quixotic, but the owners got there first: the airport was opened under the name ""Don Quijote"" in 2008.
The story also explains why, in a general election on November 20th, Spain will eject its prime minister--the last of the five most troubled euro-zone countries to do so since the crisis broke. At least the exit of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, Spain's Socialist prime minister since April 2004, looks graceful next to the chaotic departures of George Papandreou of Greece and Silvio Berlusconi in Italy. Mr Zapatero's days have been numbered since April, when he said he would not seek a third term. Instead, he made Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba his party's candidate.
Mr Zapatero's legacy will be unhappy. When the crisis hit in 2008 the construction boom was already over. Yet Mr Zapatero would not accept that Spain was vulnerable. Its well-regulated banks had avoided dodgy subprime ventures, he insisted. But over the years the economy had grown unproductive, uncompetitive and unbalanced. By 2008 construction accounted for 10% of output, twice the euro-zone average. Wages had outpaced productivity. Although public debt remained low, private-sector indebtedness had soared. By the time Mr Zapatero saw the light in May 2010, it was too late. His reform efforts since have been halting at best.
The results are ugly. Unemployment in Spain, at 22.6%, is the highest in the European Union and the OECD. Among 18- to 24-year-olds it is an eye-watering 46%. The economy is heading into another recession. Spain is going to miss its budget-deficit target of 6% of GDP for 2011. The markets will ask some hard questions next year. And the man charged with answering them will be Mariano Rajoy, leader of the centre-right People's Party (PP).
Mr Rajoy is no stranger to Spaniards, having led the PP to defeat in general elections in 2004 and 2008. This time, thanks to disillusionment with the Socialists, his party has a double-digit poll lead and looks set to win an absolute majority, a feat that eluded Mr Zapatero. The stars have aligned neatly for Mr Rajoy. Unlike the new technocratic prime ministers in Greece and Italy, he will have a strong mandate for reform. He will be constrained neither by pre-election promises (he has made few) nor, probably, by the need to placate smaller parties. After sweeping local and regional elections in May, the PP runs most of Spain's regions, which account for one-third of public spending; this should make fiscal consolidation easier.
Yet the euro crisis will not wait. Mr Zapatero's belated reforms have eased some of the pressure. At a euro summit in Brussels on October 26th, the Financial Times reported that an early draft of the communique included a long section applauding Spain for its reforms above a section on ""Italy"" that was left blank. Bond investors agree. Since the European Central Bank first intervened to buy debt from the two countries in August, Spain has partly ""decoupled"" from Italy (see chart, next page).
For how long? Italy's difficulties only make Spain more vulnerable. The size of the PP's poll lead and investors' faith in Mr Rajoy have won time. But the new government, which will take office in mid-December, will still have to move fast. Luis de Guindos, an economist at IE, a business school, widely tipped to be Mr Rajoy's finance minister, says it must have a ""comprehensive plan"" by the end of February. Spain's destiny may lie beyond its control; this week it paid almost 7% in a ten-year bond auction, its highest since 1999. ""Our short-term fate is in the hands of the ECB,"" says Jorge Galindo, a public-policy analyst. Do not underestimate the quiet man
What can Spaniards expect from their next prime minister? Mr Rajoy's enigmatic personality fits the Spanish archetype of the gallego, a native of his home region of Galicia. ""People who work with him often don't understand what he wants,"" says Carlos Cue, a correspondent for El Pais. ""This is entirely intentional."" Lacking in public charisma, Mr Rajoy is said to be charming and witty in private. Although he lacks the belligerent streak of Jose Maria Aznar, his predecessor as PP leader and a previous prime minister, his persistence at the top of the party suggests a certain steeliness. ""He's not an active leader,"" says Mr Cue. ""He waits for others to make mistakes. Over 30 years this has proved a very successful strategy."" Mr Rajoy is not keen on international travel (to the despair of advisers) and, typically for Spaniards of his generation, not fluent in English. He has been taking intensive lessons this year, helped by his two young bilingual sons.
Some observers fear that Mr Rajoy is more likely to give Spain a gentle prod than the smack of firm government. But others say his conciliatory style is just what is needed: the more he can drag his country with him through the painful reforms, the more likely he is to succeed. ""He is a man of dialogue,"" says Jorge Moragas, Mr Rajoy's chief of staff and a possible foreign minister. There may even be an attempt to work with the Socialists in parliament. 
Either way, a degree of public disquiet seems certain. A general strike may come next year. But the unions are weak: a previous strike in September 2010 fell humiliatingly flat. Josep Lobera of Metroscopia, a pollster, says that no more than 20% of Spaniards will be implacably opposed to Mr Rajoy. ""Spanish society is prepared to accept reform,"" says Mr Moragas.
In the run-up to the election the PP has talked tough on the need for reform but been short on specifics. Mr Rajoy says unemployment will be his first priority, and he is likely to take up Mr Zapatero's unfinished work on labour-market reform. Antiquated rules, some dating from Franco, have left a deeply distorted system. Collective arrangements for wage bargaining create inflexibility. Spain's array of job contracts sets up rigid distinctions between protected insiders and vulnerable outsiders, especially the young, who toil on temporary contracts without job security, if they find work at all. No wonder thousands have become indignado protesters. 
Another issue is the banks. Earlier this year Spain's central bank took on the cajas, nationalising some and forcing others to merge. But their asset books are clogged with bad debts and repossessed property. Shrinking credit is a big threat to the economy. ""Banks need to be helped to do their job,"" says Ignacio Munoz Alonso, CEO of Addax Capital, a fund manager. ""That is to lend money, not to be large real-estate managers."" Worse may be to come: property prices are only 22% off their 2008 peak. Guesses at the recapitalisation needs of the cajas run as high as EUR 100 billion.
Then there is the question of where Spain can turn for growth, now that its construction adventure has juddered to a halt. Spain lacks Italy's broad industrial base, but as Rafael Domenech of BBVA, a bank, points out, it has a number of strong, diversified international companies. Exports are doing well, shrinking the gaping current-account deficit. There is a well-educated cadre of scientists and engineers, though links between academia and business are weak. With public spending shrinking the private sector has a lot of slack to take up. Cristina Garmendia, Spain's outgoing science minister, warns that slashing R&D in a fit of deficit mania will harm Spain's prospects. 
One piece of good news is that Spain is so riddled with inefficiencies that there are relatively obvious reforms to be made. Powers in such areas as health and education are distributed across central, regional and local levels, with inevitable duplication. Mr Rajoy has indicated that he plans to tackle this issue. ""There is an opportunity to introduce some rationality into the regional accounts,"" says Mr de Guindos. 
A potential trouble-spot is Catalonia, which accounts for a fifth of Spain's economy. The Catalan government, run by the nationalist, pro-business Convergence and Union (CiU) since an election last November, is at one with the PP on the need to control spending. ""On issues like labour reform we should coincide,"" says Andreu Mas-Colell, the Catalan economy minister. But, as several speakers at the party's glitzy election launch in Barcelona made clear, CiU is spoiling for a scrap with Madrid over the distribution of powers and revenues. Its first aim is to secure for the Catalans the right to raise more of their own taxes. The Basques enjoy this privilege, they say; why should they not as well?
Another priority is to keep more of their own money. Transfers to Madrid from Catalonia, one of Spain's richest regions, amount to 8-9% of the Catalan economy. Interviewed at his 14th-century palace in Barcelona, Artur Mas, the Catalan president, likens himself to Margaret Thatcher demanding a budget rebate from Britain's European partners. This ""Catalan agenda"", says Mr Mas, will be the price of his support for a Rajoy government in Madrid should the PP fail to secure a majority. 
Mr Rajoy will be hoping that the outcome for his party on November 20th will be as happy as the polls predict. He looks likely to get his wish. But for his sake and Spain's, he must hope that his reserves of luck extend far beyond election night.

A potential trouble-spot is Catalonia, which accounts for a fifth of Spain's economy. The Catalan government, run by the nationalist, pro-business Convergence and Union (CiU) since an election last November, is at one with the PP on the need to control spending. ""On issues like labour reform we should coincide,"" says Andreu Mas-Colell, the Catalan economy minister. But, as several speakers at the party's glitzy election launch in Barcelona made clear, CiU is spoiling for a scrap with Madrid over the distribution of powers and revenues. Its first aim is to secure for the Catalans the right to raise more of their own taxes. The Basques enjoy this privilege, they say; why should they not as well?
Another priority is to keep more of their own money. Transfers to Madrid from Catalonia, one of Spain's richest regions, amount to 8-9% of the Catalan economy. Interviewed at his 14th-century palace in Barcelona, Artur Mas, the Catalan president, likens himself to Margaret Thatcher demanding a budget rebate from Britain's European partners. This ""Catalan agenda"", says Mr Mas, will be the price of his support for a Rajoy government in Madrid should the PP fail to secure a majority. 
Mr Rajoy will be hoping that the outcome for his party on November 20th will be as happy as the polls predict. He looks likely to get his wish. But for his sake and Spain's, he must hope that his reserves of luck extend far beyond election night.

""DINNER for one"", a 1963 British comedy sketch barely known in its country of origin, is Germans' favourite television viewing on New Year's Eve. Year after year they delight at the sight of Miss Sophie celebrating her 90th birthday with only her butler, James, for company. He is commanded to follow ""the same procedure as last year"", going around the table impersonating each of the now-dead dinner guests, raising toast after toast and becoming ever more drunk. 
As one awful year for the euro zone made way for another, the German television network ARD digitally retouched the original sketch to create a spoof of European Union summits. Angela Merkel was the bossy dowager. Nicolas Sarkozy was the faithful butler, taking on the roles of departed leaders: George Papandreou of Greece, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero of Spain and, although he is still in office, David Cameron of Britain. (Italy's Silvio Berlusconi is a tiger-skin carpet on the floor.) The joke was clear: summits are empty charades, only Mrs Merkel matters and Mr Sarkozy is her comical servant. 
The new year will begin rather as the old one ended, with a Merkel-Sarkozy meeting, on January 9th, to prepare the way for yet another EU summit on January 30th. Both sides of the ""Merkozy"" couple started the year trying to outdo the other in gloom. For the French president, this crisis is the worst since the second world war. For the German chancellor, the road to recovery ""remains long and won't be free from setbacks, but at the end of it, Europe will emerge stronger"". For Germany itself 2012 will prove ""more difficult"" than 2011. Even Mr Cameron has seen fit to evoke ""debt storms now battering the euro zone"". 
There is a dose of politicking in all this doom-mongering. Mr Sarkozy wants to tell French voters ahead of this spring's presidential election that only he is up to the task of protecting them in hard times. Mrs Merkel wants to make clear that more pain this year (including for Germany) is not a failure of her politics of austerity but a necessary part of Europe's healing. Mr Cameron wants to blame the euro zone for at least some of Britain's woes. 
None of this is to suggest that the euro crisis is anything other than acute. It may well intensify; indeed, 2012 could see the currency's partial collapse. There are cracks everywhere: Italy has huge amounts of debt to refinance this year; Spain's budget deficit is soaring above its target; France and other AAA-rated countries may be downgraded; Greece is getting worse, not better; European banks remain fragile. The euro zone's much-promised (but inadequate) firewall has not even been created. An incipient recession is making everything much harder. 
Yet the actions of Europe's leaders fail to match their gloomy warnings. Governments and the EU are busily drafting the text of a minor new treaty agreed at December's summit, where Mr Cameron famously cast his veto. Here is a quick reminder. Under pressure from Germany, EU leaders agreed upon a new ""fiscal compact"" to toughen budget rules. They would amend the EU's treaties with two goals: to remove some political discretion in the first step towards subjecting national governments to tighter fiscal monitoring and sanctions; and to enshrine balanced-budget rules in national constitutions, with the European Court of Justice (ECJ) given powers to rule on whether they comply with European guidelines. Britain demanded a partial veto on future financial regulation. When this was rejected, it vetoed the treaty itself. This did not block anything, but it complicates the legal process by forcing the 17 euro-zone members (and most of the euro ""outs"") to draft a text outside the EU treaties. 
The new pact may help prevent a future crisis, but does little to halt the current one. Yet much energy will be wasted in drafting it. Mrs Merkel wants to harden the text with new sanctions for those who ignore ECJ rulings. And she wants ratification of the fiscal compact to be made a condition for countries receiving future bail-outs. That, she hopes, would concentrate the minds of voters in Ireland, were a referendum to be called. 
The French, for their part, want to dress up the treaty as the beginning of a core euro zone, and to extend its scope beyond mere budgetary issues. The European Commission wants to prevent the creation of any rival bodies, and wants the treaty brought back into the EU treaties within five years. The British, despite their veto, have joined the compact as ""observers"" but are laying low for now. Populated as it is by lawyers and diplomats, Brussels loves this kind of wrangling. The idea is to have a draft treaty ready for discussion by leaders at their January 30th summit, with a view to their signing it in March. 
Will the markets be convinced by this? Many want the European Central Bank to buy as many sovereign bonds as it takes to calm markets. That kind of unlimited funding will not happen, although the ECB is providing more money indirectly, in the form of three-year liquidity for banks that may (or may not) use it to buy bonds. It says much about this debate that giving bucketloads of cheap money to banks is seen as preferable to shoring up governments. Just keep talking 
In the absence of the ECB's wall of money, governments are putting up a wall of words. Perhaps they hope that by keeping busy, even on a fairly marginal treaty, they will persuade markets that they are acting decisively. This would be more convincing if they were to include a path, even if only a conditional one, for the mutualisation of at least some euro-zone debt. But joint bonds are unthinkable for Mrs Merkel, at least this side of the German election in 2013. As the ""Dinner for one"" spoof concludes, Merkozy will carry on, ""always without Eurobonds"". Such self-delusion would be funny, if it were not so scary.","The self-delusion of European leaders as they wrangle over yet another treaty

THE news from Greece gets ever grimmer. GDP will shrink in 2012 for the fourth year in a row. Talk of a default and/or departure from the euro is growing. This week Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor, demanded urgent progress towards a deal imposing a ""haircut"" on private creditors (which may now have to be bigger than 50%), saying that Greece might otherwise not get its second European Union/IMF loan. And thieves have just stolen a Picasso painting from the national gallery, where only one guard was on duty. 
Yet most evenings Athens is buzzing. Around Syntagma Square, the scene of so many protests, the streets are crowded, with cheery music playing. In nearby Karytsi Square, bars and restaurants are packed with rowdy people; some are even jolly. The mojitos may have been replaced by cheap beer, but Athenians live for an evening out with friends. ""Staying home is not an option,"" says a classics student from Athens University. ""It's too depressing."" 
But when day follows night, the buzz gives way to bleakness. Sofokleous Street, home of the Athens Stock Exchange until 2007, is now the site of the city's main soup kitchen. It is a meeting-place for the homeless and for those too poor to afford food. To the east, on Kifissias Avenue, many small shops have gone bust, often to be replaced by gold dealers, pawnbrokers or seedy shops selling sexual paraphernalia. 
There has been a surge in crime. Police statistics show both petty theft and breaking and entering on the rise. In the first half of 2011 some 314 house burglaries were reported in Athens, over twice as many as in 2010. Crime has spread to places thought of as safe only a couple of years ago. 
Homelessness has also shot up. Klimaka, a charity, estimates that 20,000 people in Greece have no home, 25% more than in 2008. Before the crisis, the homeless were usually 35- to 50-year-old reclusive men from poor backgrounds. Now the streets are home to the young, struggling to find jobs, and the middle-aged, whose careers have been cut short. Many are educated; some are graduates. Most have lost their homes because of debts. Georgios Barkouris, a musician from a middle-class Athenian family, worked for two decades for the national radio station. When recession hit he found himself without a job--and, soon enough, without a home, too. One in five Greeks lives below the poverty line. ""Expecting homelessness to double this year"", says Mr Barkouris, ""is awfully optimistic."" 
Since Greece's first bail-out in May 2010, the government has imposed austerity, increasing taxes so much that people can barely manage. The unemployment rate is 19% and rising. GDP has contracted by 12.5% since 2008 and is expected to fall by another 3% this year. Even middle-class Greeks are being driven into poverty. Property prices and rents have plunged. But property taxes have tripled. 
The biggest blows have fallen on small family businesses (with 50 employees or fewer), which make up 99% of enterprises and employ three-quarters of the private-sector workforce. Many have closed or sacked most of their staff. Big businesses (such as banks or private hospitals) are suffering, too. Indeed, the entire private sector is haemorrhaging workers. Of the 470,000 who have lost their jobs since 2008, not one came from the public sector. The civil service has had a 13.5% pay cut and some reductions in benefits, but no net job losses. Already low, public-sector productivity has fallen further. This has led to deep resentment of the civil service, which has mushroomed in the past three decades and now employs almost a fifth of the workforce. 
Outside Athens the situation is a little better. Except for Thessaloniki, Greece's second city, the rest of the country has not seen the protests and social unrest of the capital. The cost of living and house prices are lower and family ties stronger. ""Everyone has a place to stay here,"" notes a teacher in Preveza, a coastal town in the north-west. Crime is lower. Figures from the Research Institute for Tourism show that in 2011, 64% of murders and 75% of robberies took place in the capital. 
The economy is also holding up better outside Athens. Tourism and agriculture have always counted for more in the countryside and on the coasts. The Association of Greek Tourism Enterprises reports that, in the first half of 2011, tourist arrivals increased by 13.9% (and revenues by 13.4%) over the same period in 2010. And farm exports have risen by 9.1%. A few city workers are even going back to the land. Outside Athens some in the public sector see their jobs as a sideline to earn pin money while their main occupation is farming. 
Many Greeks have chosen to move abroad in search of a better future. Successful academics, bankers and engineers have already fled for better pay and work conditions. Some have even gone without a job offer, usually to places such as Australia or Canada, where the Greek diaspora is large. The most destructive brain drain is of the young. Since 2008, ever more young people (mostly in their 20s) have gone, often to foreign universities. ""When I left to study abroad in 2006 I was the odd man out,"" says a young Greek lawyer. ""Now I thank my lucky stars."" Greece's archaic education system and strikes have held back those who pursued their education at home. Exams have been delayed or cancelled. Some students are a year or more behind in their studies. 
If they manage to graduate, the prospects are still poor. Youth unemployment is over 47% (and rising). Those lucky enough to find a job are underpaid, overtaxed and, often, overqualified. They, too, may drift abroad. Young doctors go to Sweden for specialist training; engineers move to Abu Dhabi; many others head for Berlin, where life is cheaper and more fun. All this hugely damages Greece's prospects, given an ageing population. Within a decade the workforce will be shrinking, although the number of pensioners will keep growing. Disenchanted on Syntagma Square 
Not surprisingly the popularity of politicians and political parties is at an all-time low. Some voters have warmed to a populist, anti-EU message. But they have not yet gathered enough traction to challenge Greece's pro-EU, pro-euro course. The chief feeling is of disenchantment, not with Brussels or Berlin, but with the two main parties whose corruption, nepotism and incompetence helped create such a terrible mess. Polls find 77% of Greeks wanting the unity government led by Lucas Papademos, a technocrat and former central banker, to take all necessary measures to keep Greece in the euro. For the time being, the consensus is that an exit would spell disaster. 
The preference for Mr Papademos reflects his apolitical credentials and financial expertise. His 66% approval rate is the highest among political leaders and over three times that of his Socialist predecessor, George Papandreou. Since he took over in November a measure of calm has returned. But that is now threatened by renewed crisis--and by a general election expected in April. The election may prove a risky distraction from the structural changes required for Greece to secure its next tranche of aid. The centre-right New Democracy is expected to trounce the Socialists, but voters could yet elect a parliament with seven or eight parties, forcing it into a coalition that might find it harder to push through reforms. 
For over 30 years Greeks lived lavishly as the public sector became bloated, EU money poured in and many people routinely tricked the system. During the past three years, Greeks have been asked to endure hardship and humiliation. It is no wonder that they have often taken to the streets, nor that they feel depressed. The question is how much more they can take. The election could prove to be a breaking-point, as Greece stumbles towards disorderly default. So far the Greek people have demonstrated extraordinary stoicism--but that may not last forever.

RETIRED policemen, judges and presidents who support radical drug-law reform still greatly outnumber those who pipe up while still in the job. But calls for a rethink are increasingly coming from incumbents too. Last year Bolivia's left-wing government briefly withdrew from the UN's Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, the 1961 treaty underpinning prohibition. It returned after negotiating an opt-out for coca, a traditional mild stimulant (unlike cocaine, no more harmful than caffeine) protected by the country's constitution. 
More hawkish leaders are also thinking twice. Felipe Calderon, Mexico's conservative president, said in August: ""if you [America] are determined and resigned to consume drugs, then seek market alternatives...or establish clear points of access other than the border with Mexico. This position can no longer go on."" Soon after, Juan Manuel Santos, the centre-right president of Colombia, said he would welcome legalisation if it cut criminals' profits. 
European leaders so far lack these cojones. Though the Netherlands tolerates cannabis sales to locals in designated coffee shops and Portugal has decriminalised the consumption of all drugs, neither has legalised supply, meaning that consumers' cash still goes to the mobs who behead, boil and skin in Latin America. Last year George Papandreou, then prime minister of Greece, became the only sitting European leader to advocate legalising cannabis. 
Given the weight of opinion in rich countries such as America, caution is understandable. ""If someone wants to destroy their own neurones, that can be their own decision,"" says Mauricio Lopez Bonilla, interior minister of Guatemala, a stepping stone between Andean coca fields and American nostrils. But legalisation ""is not politically backable...it would have a political and economic cost for us."" This month Peru replaced its drugs chief, Ricardo Soberon, who had halted coca-bush spraying (funded by America) to assess its effectiveness. The new woman toes the line. 
Sometimes, radical suggestions have preceded a career at the top. As a lowly parliamentarian, David Cameron was part of a committee that recommended that the government begin a discussion within the UN on ""the possibility of legalisation and regulation"" of drugs. As prime minister, he keeps quiet. In opposition his deputy, Nick Clegg, declared: ""the so-called war on drugs is failing."" Yet on a visit to Mexico last year he had only praise for the ""courageous"" battle, which has produced a murder rate over 15 times Britain's. Doubtless he will be forthright in his memoirs.","Bravery comes with retirement

""If someone wants to destroy their own neurones, that can be their own decision,"" says Mauricio Lopez Bonilla, interior minister of Guatemala, a stepping stone between Andean coca fields and American nostrils. But legalisation ""is not politically backable...it would have a political and economic cost for us."" This month Peru replaced its drugs chief, Ricardo Soberon, who had halted coca-bush spraying (funded by America) to assess its effectiveness. The new woman toes the line. 
Sometimes, radical suggestions have preceded a career at the top. As a lowly parliamentarian, David Cameron was part of a committee that recommended that the government begin a discussion within the UN on ""the possibility of legalisation and regulation"" of drugs. As prime minister, he keeps quiet. In opposition his deputy, Nick Clegg, declared: ""the so-called war on drugs is failing."" Yet on a visit to Mexico last year he had only praise for the ""courageous"" battle, which has produced a murder rate over 15 times Britain's. Doubtless he will be forthright in his memoirs.",350,Greece,A30-94,,False,,0,True

T HOU shalt not incur a structural deficit. Thou shalt pay down thy excessive debt. Thou shalt adopt a balanced-budget rule in thy constitution, and subject it to the European Court of Justice... 
It took just a little more than 40 days and 40 nights for Angela Merkel to bring down the tablets of fiscal law. At a summit in Brussels this week, 25 European leaders pledged to observe this covenant and made burnt offerings of their economic sovereignty. But the children of Europe are crying into the wilderness: ""How long, Lord, must we be tormented by austerity?"" 
Mrs Merkel holds out the prophecy of a political union. For the time being, though, and for years to come, deficit-cutting is the only path to righteousness, she says. Look at Italy and Spain: markets relented once they started reform in earnest. Look at Greece, the doubters retort: EU-induced budget cuts are pushing it into recession and insurrection, and closer to chaotic default. And Portugal is testing the notion that Greece is alone. 
Some see hope in things that Mrs Merkel has not yet done. She did not block a debate, due in March, on enlarging the euro's rescue fund. She did not demand the return of unused EU money, instead allowing it to be redirected to projects to boost growth and jobs. And she did not strike down the European Central Bank for creating a torrent of liquidity for banks ( 
). Still, the promised land of Eurobonds, and of the ECB lending to sovereigns, seems beyond the reach of today's politicians. 
In the third year of Europe's debt crisis, leaders are under pressure from three sides: the bond markets, which threaten to push countries into insolvency; EU institutions, armed with new powers to monitor budgets and economic policies; and fellow leaders, who are no longer shy about meddling in neighbours' affairs. 
This combination is almost impossible to resist. It took only a smirk between Mrs Merkel and the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, to doom Italy's prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi. The Greek prime minister, George Papandreou, was also replaced under pressure from ""Merkozy"". The new Belgian government, led by Elio Di Rupo, a Socialist, was forced to cut cherished social programmes under threat of EU sanctions (a general strike forced leaders to fly in to this week's summit via a military airport). 
What about citizens? They are being given little say in the loss of national prerogatives. Surely democratic politics is nothing if not about how wealth is created and distributed. Yet the treaty was drafted to avoid referendums, above all in Ireland (although that may be tested by the courts). Even if it is put to a vote, it will come into force when 12 of the euro zone's 17 approve it. Countries that do not ratify will not receive new bail-outs from 2013. 
Despite riots in Greece, and protests elsewhere, the fear of economic meltdown is still a brake on popular dissent. ""In periods of recession you can ask people to make more sacrifices than in good times,"" argues a senior Brussels official. The technocrats in Rome and Athens still rely on the support of elected parties. Most other EU governments are run by centre-right parties that tend to believe in budget consolidation. 
But such consensus is fragile, and could soon be tested. Greece may hold elections in April that would probably be won by Antonis Samaras, leader of the conservative opposition party, New Democracy. He infuriates European leaders by only partly backing the international reform programme. Will the euro zone allow Greece to default if he resists its diktats? In France Francois Hollande, the Socialist who polls suggest will win the presidency in May, wants to renegotiate the fiscal pact. Should he refuse to adopt a balanced-budget rule it is hard to imagine Mrs Merkel taking him to court. 
Such pressures may explain Germany's heavy hand. Mrs Merkel's decision to campaign for Mr Sarkozy's re-election looks ill-judged. A German official's call for a ""budget commissioner"" with veto rights over Greek spending prompted accusations that Germany was trying to appoint a ""G auleiter"". Mrs Merkel disavowed the idea, but her plans for stronger ""monitoring"" may not be very different. All this feeds anti-German feeling. 
Some suggest elected national governments are being crushed by an undemocratic Europe. That is facile. For several countries, the EU is a guarantee of democracy. Many would rather surrender sovereignty to a Europe, where they have influence, than to financial speculators. And in a monetary union, members surely have a right to speak up if others act recklessly. In the end, countries choose whether to join the EU, or even the euro. Democracy begins at home 
Still, the EU is not like other international clubs. It intrudes deeply into the internal workings of its members. It would be hard, and extremely painful, to leave the euro. The EU's decision-making is unintelligible to most people. 
Consider the unelected European Commission. It may be less influential in the Brussels power game than it once was, but it is acquiring important powers over members, notably the authority to recommend sanctions. Yes, democratic governments grant independence to a lot of important jobs, from central bankers to judges. But the commission has a political as well as a technocratic role. And in the Council of Ministers, which represents elected governments, decisions are prone to opaque back-room deals. The European Parliament hardly commands voters' passion. 
Citizens are thus left feeling impotent. Their governments are eviscerated at home, yet voters lack the means to throw the bums out of Brussels. This is dangerous. Bringing debt under control and, more importantly, promoting reforms to boost growth, will take years of sacrifice and suffering. It can be sustained only with a strong national mandate. Without that, both governments and the EU will eventually be discredited.","A pact to cut budget deficits is achieved at the cost of a growing democratic deficit

TAKING big decisions on Greece's future suggests high drama. But the delays, muddle and political posturing dogging efforts to win a EUR 130 billion ($170 billion) bail-out from its European Union partners could be from an old Athenian comedy. This week the three political leaders supporting a fractious government were arguing over the details of an austerity package with Lucas Papademos, the caretaker prime minister. Their meeting was repeatedly delayed as the ""troika"" (the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF) grappled with Evangelos Venizelos, the finance minister, over EUR 3 billion of spending cuts. 
Foot-dragging over reform is a big reason for Greece's sick state. The economy may shrink this year by around 3%, after 6% last year. Unemployment hit 19% in January. Almost one in two young Greeks is without a job. Given the outlook, investors have unsurprisingly shied away from new privatisations. Delays by finance-ministry officials have also infuriated the troika. Only after it had dismissed their latest proposals as ""unrealistic"" and ""farcical"" did Mr Venizelos cave in. A 20% reduction in the minimum wage, another round of pension cuts and 15,000 public-sector job cuts are among the measures the politicians are being asked to swallow in the next 15 days. 
Once the deal is done, Greece can arrange a ""voluntary"" debt swap, in which private owners of Greek bonds would write off 70% of their value, but could eventually recoup a chunk if the economy recovers. The debt would be reduced by EUR 100 billion (from EUR 350 billion) but would still be 120% of GDP in 2020 (from 160% now). Greece might one day be able to pay back the full amount, argue the project's backers, though many are sceptical that a full-scale default can be avoided. 
The politicians care only about the short term. As soon as the bond swap is approved, the EU and IMF will release fresh funding, a EUR 14.4 billion bond expiring on March 20th will be repaid and an election campaign can begin. Mr Papademos, a former ECB vice-president, will not run; he is expected to take an academic post in America. Antonis Samaras, leader of the conservative New Democracy party, has called for an election on April 8th. His party holds an unassailable lead in the opinion polls, yet not enough for an outright majority. New Democracy would win 33% of the vote, says a recent poll, ahead of the 18% for the Democratic Left, led by Fotis Kouvelis, a veteran left-winger. 
Greece needs political stability to turn the economy around. Yet there is no obvious coalition partner for Mr Samaras apart from the right-wing Laos (People's) party under George Karatzaferis, now enjoying its first taste of power as a junior partner in Mr Papademos's government. The once powerful Panhellenic Socialist Movement has plunged to 8%, a record low, say the polls. A leadership battle started after George Papandreou, who handed power to Mr Papademos only halfway through his four-year term, announced he would step down, though without saying when. He is unlikely to run again. Mr Venizelos, the front-runner to succeed him, may have to put in a longish spell in opposition. 
Voters brought up on Greece's ""relationship"" politics, in which party connections win public-sector jobs and perks, feel betrayed. A new popular movement, ""I won't vote"", may attract strong support. Smaller left-wing parties will make gains. So will the far-right, anti-immigrant Chryssi Avgi (Golden Dawn) group, which is close to reaching the 3% threshold for entry into parliament, according to recent polls.

Greeks have grown used to street protests after consecutive years of economic decline, but they were still shocked by the damage on the night of February 12th. Criminals, not leftists, were to blame, some victims claimed. George Stergiakis, another cinema owner, said his property was firebombed after he refused a demand for protection money. Whoever was responsible, the arson attacks have reinforced fears that, as the economy deteriorates, social disruption will continue.

The uneasy coalition between the socialists of Pasok and the conservatives from New Democracy (Laos, a small right-wing party has pulled out) under Lucas Papademos, a former central banker, has accepted EUR 3.3 billion ($4.3 billion) in spending cuts. The next step is to sign up to a new three-year reform programme in return for a fresh EUR 130 billion bail-out, which, with a big debt restructuring, is meant to avert a disorderly default next month. 
The latest measures are tougher than their predecessors. Revenue-raising plans were dashed by the depth of the recession, and by the finance ministry's failure to crack down on corrupt tax officials. Instead, wages and pensions are to be cut. So is spending on defence, health and local government, where officials had turned a blind eye to budget overruns. The troika's critics say these cuts will only increase the Greeks' misery. They claim that a 22% reduction in the minimum wage, aimed at boosting competitiveness, will shrink the economy by another 1.5% this year as cash-strapped workers consume less. 
Yet the politicians have set aside their populist instincts to follow their creditors' instructions. Parliament approved the austerity measures by a two-thirds majority (though 22 socialist and 21 conservative lawmakers voted against, and lost their party whips). Then George Papandreou, the former Pasok prime minister, and Antonis Samaras, New Democracy's leader, both sent letters to the troika pledging to implement the new programme no matter who wins the election expected in April. 
There was relief when Mr Samaras, who had opposed previous reforms, made his letter public. If New Democracy wins the election, he wants ""modifications"" (meaning extra spending aimed at promoting recovery). But he insists these would be made only in agreement with the troika. Opinion polls give the conservatives a strong lead, though it may be waning and is not enough to win an outright majority. Pasok is picking up support following the emergence of Evangelos Venizelos, the finance minister, as the likely next leader (Mr Papandreou will stand down). There is talk of a conservative-socialist coalition being formed after the election, which could provide enough stability for Greece to keep reforming. 
Yet the euro group of finance ministers is not convinced. It delayed approving the austerity package, and not just because Mr Venizelos at first failed to give details of an extra EUR 325m of cuts. The group will probably say yes on February 20th, but there is talk of holding back some bail-out money until after the election or of offering a bridging loan. The German, Dutch and Finnish finance ministers are impatient with Greece's poor record of reform. North Europeans suspect that Mr Samaras will be tempted to give up on austerity. 
To make the reforms stick, Wolfgang Schauble, the German finance minister, even suggested postponing the election and setting up a small technocratic cabinet like Italy's to run Greece for the next two years.

GREEK politicians have rarely been so unpopular. Back at home for the carnival holiday weekend, one lawmaker was thumped with a fake plastic club. Others were dubbed thieves, vagabonds and traitors by angry voters. Even backbenchers are blamed for the country's deepening economic woes, whether they come from the conservative New Democracy party, a reckless borrower when in power, or the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok), which failed to clean up the mess. 
Under Lucas Papademos, a former central banker serving as an unelected prime minister, most ND and Pasok legislators have backed further austerity measures in return for a new EUR 130 billion ($174 billion) bail-out by the European Union and the IMF. (Greece's fragmented left-wing parties voted against.) The government has done better than expected, so some leading Greek businessmen want Mr Papademos to stay on until its term runs out in October 2013. That is wishful thinking, given the urgency within Pasok over choosing a new leader to replace George Papandreou, the former prime minister, who is to step down this month. And Antonis Samaras, the ND leader, is growing ever more impatient to lead the country. 
Mr Papademos promises that an election will be held, implying soon. Many Greeks expect to go to the polls in late April or May, after the government completes its debt restructuring and draws the first instalment of the new loan. Voters are bitterly divided, say the polls, which show ND finishing first, with 25-30%, but well short of an overall majority. Mr Samaras is trying to win back right-wingers who opposed the bail-out. 
Pasok is doing worse, on 8-12%, behind three left-wing parties that were against the bail-out. Some Socialists have been talking up the Democratic Left, a catch-all party for the dissatisfied middle class led by Fotis Kouvelis, a veteran lawyer. With 15-18% of the vote, Mr Kouvelis's party is now second to ND, but he has little appetite for power-sharing. 
Pasok's leadership battle is one reason why its popularity has plunged. Half-a-dozen candidates are jostling to succeed Mr Papandreou. Evangelos Venizelos, the finance minister and front-runner, has been too preoccupied with the bail-out and debt restructuring to devote much time to campaigning. But by the time of the leadership contest on March 18th, he may have swept most rivals aside. He has few qualms about forming a coalition with Mr Samaras, continuing the present arrangement, though sceptics worry that having two populists in charge without the calming presence of Mr Papademos would be bad for the cause of reform. 
Some observers fret over an apparent explosion of support for small parties. Others say this is just a gesture of protest. At the election, the protesters may well abstain. Whichever parties come to power, Greece's commitment to cutting 150,000 public-sector jobs by 2015 will mean that lawmakers have trouble finding cosy positions for their supporters. If the politicians can no longer fulfil their side of a 150-year-old bargain, say the cynics, voters might just as well stay at home.

 Under Lucas Papademos , a former central banker serving as an unelected prime minister , most ND and Pasok legislators have backed further austerity measures in return for a new EUR 130 billion ( $ 174 billion ) bail - out by the European Union and the IMF . ( Greece 's fragmented left - wing parties voted against . ) The government has done better than expected , so some leading Greek businessmen want Mr Papademos to stay on until its term runs out in October 2013 . That is wishful thinking , given the urgency within Pasok over choosing a new leader to replace George W. Papandreou . And Antonis Samaras , the ND leader , is growing ever more impatient to lead the country . 
 Mr Papademos promises that an election will be held , implying soon . Many Greeks expect to go to the polls in late April or May , after the government completes its debt restructuring and draws the first instalment of the new loan . Voters are bitterly divided , say the polls , which show ND finishing first , with 25 - 30 % , but well short of an overall majority . Mr Samaras is trying to win back right - wingers who opposed the bail - out . 
 Pasok is doing worse , on 8 - 12 % , behind three left - wing parties that were against the bail - out . Some Socialists have been talking up the Democratic Left , a catch - all party for the dissatisfied middle class led by Fotis Kouvelis , a veteran lawyer . With 15 - 18 % of the vote , Mr Kouvelis 's party is now second to ND , but he has little appetite for power - sharing . 
 Pasok 's leadership battle is one reason why its popularity has plunged . Half - a - dozen candidates are jostling to succeed George W. Papandreou . Evangelos Venizelos , the finance minister and front - runner , has been too preoccupied with the bail - out and debt restructuring to devote much time to campaigning . But by the time of the leadership contest on March 18th , he may have swept most rivals aside . He has few qualms about forming a coalition with Mr Samaras , continuing the present arrangement , though sceptics worry that having two populists in charge without the calming presence of Mr Papademos would be bad for the cause of reform . 
 Some observers fret over an apparent explosion of support for small parties . Others say this is just a gesture of protest . At the election , the protesters may well abstain . Whichever parties come to power , Greece 's commitment to cutting 150,000 public - sector jobs by 2015 will mean that lawmakers have trouble finding cosy positions for their supporters . If the politicians can no longer fulfil their side of a 150 - year - old bargain , say the cynics , voters might just as well stay at home .

IF GREECE'S creditors had their way, its politicians would be getting on with reforms and not wasting time and EUR 30m ($39m) on a snap general election. Opinion polls suggest that the May 6th vote is unlikely to produce a clear result. Yet the leaders of the PanHellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) and the conservative New Democracy (ND) party, fractious coalition partners for five months, are spoiling for a fight, even if their parties end up joining forces in government again. 
The voters are angry with ND over a public-spending spree that set Greece on the road to ruin, and with Pasok for failing to haul it back from the brink. ND has a modest but persistent poll lead. But Antonis Samaras, its leader, trails Evangelos Venizelos of Pasok by a small margin as the better choice as prime minister. Many Greeks plan to abstain. Others intend to protest by voting for one of ten small parties that oppose the harsh reforms imposed by the European Union and the IMF. 
The latest numbers from MRB, a usually reliable pollster, gives ND 25.4%, down a smidgen from a month ago. Pasok has risen a little, to 15.8%. The same poll also suggests that, despite being dissatisfied with the outgoing coalition, two-thirds of voters want another one to succeed it. 
Mr Samaras has been hit by the defection of Panos Kammenos, a wayward backbencher who wants Russia to replace the EU and IMF as Greece's lender of last resort. His Independent Greeks party could capture 10% of the vote. ND will also lose votes to four right-wing splinter groups. Yet Mr Samaras insists that he can become prime minister, banking on the 50 extra seats awarded to the front-runner under a new electoral law. He threatens to call another election within months if he fails to win an outright majority. 
Mr Venizelos, a former finance minister who took over Pasok's leadership from George Papandreou last month, is trying hard to win back left-of-centre voters. His speeches feature self-criticism and sympathy for impoverished Greeks. He has made overtures to Fotis Kouvelis, the soft-spoken leader of the Democratic Left party, a refuge for aggrieved socialists that is polling around 9%. Pasok's electoral list includes a respectable number of new faces and a record number of women. With a new-look Pasok behind him, Mr Venizelos aims to capture more than 20% of the vote (that is still less than half the 44% that Pasok won under Mr Papandreou in 2009). 
Whatever the outcome, Greece will be even harder to govern than usual. Mr Venizelos says he will not serve under Mr Samaras, though several moderately competent socialists would join a ND-led government. The conservatives are still casting around for a suitable technocrat for finance minister--a job that requires good English, a sound grasp of macroeconomics and a willingness to co-operate with the troika of the EU, IMF and European Central Bank that oversees reforms. Lucas Papademos, a former ECB vice-president who has been serving as a technocratic prime minister, has said he wants to go back to academic life in America. But he might perhaps be lobbied to stay on as deputy prime minister and finance minister. 
Greece is a long way from hitting its fiscal targets. By June the new government must agree another EUR 11 billion of spending cuts for 2013-14. A first-quarter revenue shortfall of almost EUR 400m is a reminder that the economy is still shrinking--GDP will fall by 5% this year, after a 6.9% drop in 2011, says IOBE, an Athens think-tank. Tax evasion is as pervasive as ever. Whatever the candidates may promise, voters know the election is but a brief diversion in another grim year of austerity.","The voters may be unhappy , but the election will not change much

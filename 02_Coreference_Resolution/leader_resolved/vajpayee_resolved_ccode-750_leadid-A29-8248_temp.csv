THE pundits in Delhi are preparing for change. Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, has promised a general election in April and his ruling Congress party is likely to do badly. Businessmen, bureaucrats and diplomats are trying to get used to the thought that the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) may dominate a new, coalition, government.
The BJP's policies sound like a recipe for turmoil both domestically and in foreign relations. The party says it will ""assert Hindu rights"" at the expense of the Muslim minority. In 1992, BJP leaders were in the crowd that tore down a Muslim mosque at Ayodyha, claiming it was built on the site of a Hindu temple. Many people fear communal clashes if the party takes power. The party says it will be more restrictive about foreign investment. And it has promised, as a western diplomat puts it, ""to pull the nuclear sword from the scabbard"".
Atal Vajpayee, the BJp leader and a possible future prime minister, is keen to reassure foreigners. In conversation he comes across, for the most part, as an amiable gentleman. His party is not anti-Muslim, he insists. All it wants to do is to end special treatment for Muslims-such as laws allowing polygamy. ""We can explain things to our minority friends,"" he says. But Mr Vajpayee's critics point to the BJa's links to extremist Hindu groups, which may want to rip down more mosques.
 As for ""our foreign friends"", their money is welcome in high-tech industries, but the production of consumer goods should be reserved for Indians. Nuclear issues are presented as simply a matter of international fairness. Why should the big powers have nuclear weapons, while India is denied the right to its own nukes?
Yet even in the quiet of his office in parliament, there is a more emotional and ferocious side to the BJp leader. India, he declares, has been humiliated because it lacks nuclear weapons. China and Pakistan have grabbed Indian land. India's efforts to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council have been scorned. ""We will have to show the world that we are not so weak,"" he says.
But many in the Delhi elite take a sanguine view of BJP policies. BJP governments in the states of Gujarat and Rajastan have not provoked communal violence and have taken a pragmatic attitude to foreign investment. Nuclear threats and Hindu chest-beating may be just electioneering.
The coming election is for the lower house of parliament, the more powerful of the two chambers. But the constitutional amendments needed to impose a uniform code of civil law on Muslims must pass both houses. At present, there is little prospect of the upper house giving its approval. As for the BJP's economic nationalism, most pundits think the party will be content with a token gesture against wellknown foreign investors, but leave the key reforms in place. Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, regarded as the architect of India's economic reforms, says that the reforms are now ""irreversible"".
Diplomats play down the nuclear threat, too. Since the world knows that India can make nuclear weapons-it carried out a test in 1974-it would be pointless, they argue, for the BJP to court international condemnation by staging another test.
What of the slPs electoral arithmetic? The party's prospects may have been damaged by a corruption scandal implicating a prominent leader, L.K. Advani. But seven government ministers have also resigned in connection with the scandal, four of them this wee Some in Delhi predict that Congress will once again emerge as the largest single party-despite the scandal and dismal results in state elections.
The likeliest outcome is a coalition, with the BJp and Congress competing for support from smaller parties. There is another intriguing prospect. Despite the rude words exchanged between Congress and the BJP, Mr Vajpayee and Mr Rao are personally friendly. Mr Rao hosted a party for a book of Mr Vajpayee's poems. Might they wait for the electoral hubbub to subside and then form a grand Congress-BJP coalition? Mr Vajpayee declines to answer. To do so, he says, would be ""embarrassing"".","DELHI

That is because the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) stands above all for Hindu nationalism, and is regarded with fear and suspicion by secular liberals both inside and outside India. 
In fact Mr Sharma may have made an astute decision when, on 15th May, he appointed Atal Behari Vajpayee, the BJP's leader, as prime minister, replacing the outgoing Congress administration of Narasimha Rao. To stay in power, the BJP must now muster enough votes to survive a vote of confidence in India's Parliament by May 31st. If the BJP fails, it will not be able to claim it was kept out by a conspiracy. And if it succeeds, it will do so only by putting together a coalition whose other members will, with luck, moderate the wilder tendencies of the Hindu nationalists. 
In terms of seats, though not of votes, the BJP was the clear winner of the election. Because its 20% of the vote was more concentrated than Congress's nearly 3o%, the BJP won 160 MPS to Congress's 136. The results were a disaster for Congress, which lost nearly half its seats. A left-wing coalition, the National-Front Left-Front (NF-LF), won i8% or so of the vote, and111seats. 
When Mr Vajpayee was invited to form a government this week, the BJP had attracted only enough allies among minor parties to bring its total of mps to 194 (see chart). It needs to find another 80 to secure a majority by the deadline of May 31st. This will be difficult, since most of the secular parties are wary of the BJP's anti-Muslim bias. By contrast, the NF-LF had expanded its tally of Mps to 175-180 by forging alliances with regional parties and Congress dissidents. If Congress, with its 136 MPS, stuck to its pledge to back the left, the new coalition would have more than enough for a simple majority of the Parliament's 545 MIs. So it is still possible that the BJP's hold on government will last only a few weeks. 
For now, Mr Vajpayee and his party are in the limelight. The BJP rose to popularity late in 1992 by calling for the destruction of a mosque, built on a holy Hindu site in the northern Indian town of Ayodhya. The party claims to be secular, has a few ornamental Muslims in its ranks, and says it simply wants to end what it considers to be the Congresspromoted pampering of Muslims and other minorities. In fact, it has stoked many communal riots over the years and has blood on its hands. 
Mr Vajpayee is the party's moderate face. A foreign minister in the late 197os, he has national and international standing, and is no firebrand. But he is not entirely his own master. The BJP has extremists in its ranks and LK Advani, the party's president, hews to a much harder line. Critics say it will return to militancy once it gets into power. Others find hope in the fact that power often leads a party to moderate its extremism. In some states, the number of communal clashes actually decreased after the BP took over from Congress. 
Paradoxically, Mr Vajpayee's attempt to rein in the radicals may be helped by the BJP's precarious parliamentary position. In its attempt to woo allies, the BJP have hinted that the party would not pursue its more controversial election pledges of ""cultural nationalism"" (or Hinduvt), such as removing special legal and educational privileges for Muslims and other minorities. Mr Vajpayee says, not entirely reassuringly, that a new Hindu temple will be built on the ruins at Ayodhya only ""by agreement. 
But if the BJP still fails to get enough allies, the NF-LF will probably have a go at forming a government. Although Congress has more seats than the left, it seemed initially too demoralised to push to be the leading party in the coalition and, anyhow, would probably be unable to persuade the left to serve under a Congress prime minister. Faced with the BJP surge, the NF-LF has now dropped its previous insistence that it would never make an alliance with Congress. 
Congress and the NF-LF have plenty of common ground. Both agree on secularism. Both agree on the need to encourage private investment. The NF-LF, which draws much support from regional and caste-based parties, is keen on greater federalism, and Congress can go along with that. The left also wants to restrict some kinds of foreign investment, and to go slow on further import liberalisation, which Congress will also be able to accept Both sides agree that nothing should be done to overhaul India's labour laws, even though they make it virtually impossible to lay off workers or close loss-making companies. 
However, the NF-LF has been outspoken in accusing Mr Rao and his colleagues of corruption. It will be loth suddenly to keep quiet, especially since the Supreme Court will not allow outstanding cases to be swept under the carpet. The NF-LF would like to send Congress's top officials to jail, and this is not a firm basis for an enduring relationship. 
Perhaps the biggest long-term issue is whether Congress, which has dominated Indian politics for so long, is now in permanent decline. Congress led India's independence movement during the British Raj by appealing to all sections of society. After independence it continued to be inclusive. It abolished feudal land laws, passed bills to raise the status and education of untouchable and backward castes, protected Muslims from Hindu militants and reduced disparities between prosperous and hackward reigions. 
But over the years it has come to be seen as a cynical party that is more interested in patronage than good government, and in the urban rich than the rural poor. Muslims, untouchables, backward castes and backward regions are all turning away from Congress and towards sectarian parties that stand for parochial goals. 
The problem now for Congress is that, in addition to losing its claim to speak for all sections of the population, it also risks losing its reputation as the only provider of stable national government. National governments were formed without Congress in 1977 and 1989, but their early collapse made disillusioned voters return to the Congress fold. However, in the 1980s Congress's rivals managed to form stable governments in several states-such as West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. In the1990sthe BJP provided stable governments in some northern and eastern states. So the Congress claim to be the only provider of stability is no longer credible. 
Its days of dominance may be over, but it is too soon to write Congress off. It remains important in many parts of India. Much of its collapse in the south can be ascribed to a miscalculated electoral alliance with an unpopular local leader in the state of Tamil Nadu. That kind of mistake can be put right. Congress also still has many of the ingredients-such as national organisation and willing potential supporters-required for a recovery. But it needs to rediscover its priorities, make them fit its natural groups of support and, above all, do something about its deserved reputation for corruption. 
If it did all this successfully, Congress could find common cause on many issues with the Janata Dal (which includes many of its ex-members) and with the smaller regional and caste-based parties that have moved on to its patch. That would provide a real challenge to the BJP and would give India a clear choice between, on the one hand, a grass-roots secular party advocating decentralisation and federalism and, on the other, a Hindu-nationalist party advocating centralism and faster economic liberalisation. But so far Congress has shown little sign of rising to the challenge. ","WHEN the votes were counted , many people wondered whether Shankar Dayal Sharma , India 's president , would follow convention and ask the party that had won the most seats in the election to form the next government .

They could soon go even worse. Mr Vajpayee has to submit his minority government to a vote of confidence in India's lower house of Parliament by May 31st. The vote may come even sooner, and he looks likely to lose it. 
The defeat, if it comes, will be at the hands of a motley group of opponents. These include the Congress party, which itself suffered a stinging defeat in the general election two weeks ago, and a fissiparous coalition of leftist and regional parties that has this week renamed itself-perhaps a touch optimistically the United Front. 
These parties and fragments of parties have between them 310 to 320 Mps. The BJP has thus far been able to muster only about 195, in the absence of a rush of defections from either Congress or the regional parties in the Front. 
The BJP's leaders had hoped that more mps would flock to their side once they were seen to be running a government. In an effort to play down the BJP's old firebrand image,Jaswant Singh, the urbane finance minister, has delivered robust and reassuring messages on economic reform and foreign investment that even his Congress predecessor, Manmohan Singh, could scarcely have faulted. 
The new minister for industry, Suresh Prabhu, has been sounding similarly responsible. Although he is a member of Shiv Sena, which is even more chauvinist in its defence of Hindu interests than its ally the BJP, Mr Prabhu is best known as an entrepreneur and chairman of India's largest cooperative bank. He talks of reforming the public sector and wants to encourage foreign investment, albeit under close government control: ""We don't want just to welcome foreign investors with garlands at the airport. We must also guide them through the bylanes of India,"" he says. 
But by showing his government's moderate face, Mr Vajpayee has already alienated some of his own rank and file, while nonetheless failing to command the extra support he needs from other parties in Parliament. Extremists on the right have already accused Mr Singh of going soft on foreign investment. They are also worried that pet projects, such as rebuilding a controversial Hindu temple at Ayodhya in northern India, on the site of a mosque destroyed by rioters in 1992, might be shelved. And Mr Vajpayee will have angered them further by giving the important foreign-affairs portfolio to Sikander Bakht, the only Muslim in his cabinet. Mr Bakht will combine this job with the less glamorous post of minister for urban affairs and employment. 
But not perhaps for long. The opposition is likely to succeed in bringing Mr Vajpayee's government down. If-or rather when-the BJP government falls, India's president, Shanker Dayal Sharma, must decide whom to invite next to try to form a government. Logically, he would turn to the Congress, which is the next largest single party. 
However, Narasimha Rao, the Congress leader, would almost certainly refuse, preferring to stay on the sidelines for a little longer after his party's defeat in the general election. Mr Sharma had dinner with all the party leaders earlier this week, so Mr Rao may have already indicated this. 
That leaves the United Front, which, sensing power, got its act together on May 22nd and formally elected Deve Gowda, a little known regional politician who is chief minister of the state of Karnataka, as its parliamentary leader. To take up that post, and become prime minister, Mr Gowda would have to give up the chief ministership and be elected to Parliament. Mr Gowda's reputation in Karnataka is of a compulsive politician, but he has no political pull nationally and might be no match for the wily Mr Rao on whose support he would have to depend.

Atal Behari Vajpayee, India's shortest-serving prime minister, wound up a noisy debate in parliament with a flamboyant speech. Without waiting for a confidence vote that he knew would go against him, he walked out of the chamber, announcing he was off to present his resignation to India's president, Shankar Dayal Sharma. 
Moving at a speed rare in Indian public life, Mr Sharma immediately invited Deve Gowda, a little-known regional politician from southern India and leader of the United Front, to form a government. Mr Gowda was due to be sworn in on June ist. His Front consists of a motley collection of 13 broadly leftist and regional parties. The Congress party, which lost power in the May general election, will support it, but not take part in the government. Providing Mr Gowda can keep his partners happy with ministerial jobs and policy compro mises, he will have no problem surviving a vote of confidence required by June 12th and may even be in power for a year or so. 
Mr Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) could not muster parliamentary support primarily because it has a strong Hindu-nationalist base that makes possible supporters frightened about the risk of communal disturbances. However, Mr Vajpayee has added to his reputation as a responsible and practical politician. One of his government's few actions was to persuade the state government of Maharashtra, which is run by a coalition of the BJP and the even more Hindu-fundamentalist Shiv Sena, to reopen an official inquiry into the 1993 anti-Muslim riots in Mumbai (Bombay) that had been abandoned. 
The 13 parties of the United Front and their Congress supporters were brought together after the election by a common desire to oust the BJP government. Now they have a common interest in staying united under Mr Gowda because, together, they can wield power and avoid an election that would be universally unpopular. Mr Gowda has pledges of support from 19o members of Parliament which, together with 136 CongressMPS, far exceeds the BJP's 194. Eventually, the bonds will break-probably when either Congress or the BJP has managed to steal enough MPs from the Front or each other to bid for power. 
This seems unlikely to happen until well into next year at the earliest. The BJP has had its turn, and Congress is in no state to face an election, nor to form a government. So the Congress party will allow the United Front to retain power for some time. It is also in the Front's interest not to destabilise Congress. 
The United Front (which fought the election as the National Front-Left Front) is dominated by three national parties, the leftist Janata Dal and two Communist parties, which together have 86 mrs. There are also 26 dissidents from Congress, plus smaller parties based on caste and leftist politics. A new factor is provided by regional parties from the states of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Assam (with 38 Mrs) which have linked with the Front since the election and have been asserting a degree of regional political power not seen in India for many years. 
Mr Gowda, who has been the Janata Dal chief minister of Karnataka, was chosen as the Front's candidate for prime minister on May i4th not by the Front's Mrs, but by a cabal of other chief ministers (none ofthem Mrs) from states such as Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Bihar and West Bengal. These ambitious barons will want to influence the policy of the new government, especially on devolution of power from Delhi to the state capitals. Some of them also want Mr Gowda's administration to bail their states out of financial trouble. 
With such a mix of interests, and coming so soon after an election in which the parties attacked Congress policies, drafters of the Front's programme have had difficulty this week reaching compromises. Social, defence and foreign policies are likely to follow broadly those of the former Congress government. Congress has said that its support is conditional on continuation of its reform programme; but that need not cause much difficulty because Congress itself ducked urgently needed action on taxation, subsidies and the public sector. There is also agreement on boosting rural development, small firms and the alleviation of poverty. 
The differences over foreign investment have been more important. Infrastructure might be favoured and consumer goods penalised. However, two of the Front's leaders would argue against a restrictive approach. Mr Gowda has blazed a foreign-investment trail in Karnataka. P. Chidambaram, a reformist commerce minister in the last Congress government, is now a leader of a group of dissident Congress MPs allied with the Front Mr Chidambaram is being tipped for a senior government position, possibly his old commerce post or even finance minister, unless Mr Gowda is keeping that job for himself.

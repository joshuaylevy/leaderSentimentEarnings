""WE SHOUT outside parliament, we call the politicians thieves and traitors, but they don't take any notice, they just go on letting us down,"" said Alexis Anagnostopoulos, an unemployed welder, after hearing about this week's plan by George Papandreou, his prime minister, to hold a referendum in December on the euro crisis. Yet as it turns out he and other angry Greeks may not even get to vote.
A first hurdle was a vote of confidence to endorse Mr Papandreou's proposed plebiscite. By the end of the week it seemed unlikely that his Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) could muster the required 151 votes and thus that he would even keep his job. After the October 2009 election Pasok had 160 seats in the 300-seat parliament. At the start of the week it had 152, but several more deputies promptly broke ranks. The most likely outcome as we went to press was a new government of national unity, perhaps led by a technocrat such as a central banker. Or there might be a fresh election. 
Mr Papandreou had already infuriated Greece's partners. He announced it without informing them or even his finance minister, Evangelos Venizelos, who conveniently retired to a hospital bed. The prime minister then demanded to renegotiate the country's EUR 130 billion ($179 billion) bail-out, less than a week after it had been accepted. The plebiscite would be held on the renegotiated package, he said at first. But an angry EU response and a summons to the Cannes G20 summit for a reprimand led Mr Papandreou to back down. The question would now be in or out, he said. Greeks feel blackmailed. Polls show that 60% are against the rigorous terms of the bail-out; but 70% want to stay in the euro.
But Mr Venizelos upped the stakes by openly opposing a referendum and, behind the scenes, fomenting a revolt within Pasok. Mr Papandreou was forced to call yet another emergency cabinet meeting on November 3rd, with most of his allies apparently deserting him. Whether this presages an abandonment of the referendum, an election or a new national government remained unclear. 
To add to the turmoil, Panos Beglitis, the defence minister and a close ally of Mr Papandreou's, had earlier sacked the armed forces' chiefs of staff. Sources in his office say that the generals, who were appointed by the previous New Democracy government, were ""misbehaving."" They had encouraged a group of retired officers to stage a protest inside the ministry over planned cuts in military pensions. Mr Beglitis said the top brass should have gone months ago. Yet the move suggests that, almost 40 years after the fall of the junta, Greek politicians are still nervous about the army's capacity to stir up trouble. 
Whatever now happens, it is clear that Mr Papandreou's risky gamble has backfired. The IMF and the European Commission made plain that they will withhold EUR 8 billion of funding due by mid-November. That would mean the government could not pay civil servants' salaries and hospital suppliers at the end of the month and might have difficulties meeting EUR 2 billion in debt repayments due in early December. As it is, a lot of Greece's much-touted reforms, including such promised privatisations as the loss-making Agricultural Bank of Greece, seem to be delayed or stuck, not least because the public sector is paralysed by protests.
As Greece's recession deepens (GDP is expected to shrink by at least 6% this year and a further 2.5% in 2012) the mood is growing ever bleaker. If the referendum went ahead, it is not even certain that 40% of the electorate, the required minimum to validate the result, would turn out to vote. At last year's local elections, turnout fell below 50% in many places. Many Greeks living in Athens and other cities are unlikely to make the journey back to the islands and villages where they are registered to vote. ""The price of a ferry ticket has doubled and it only goes twice a week. Why should I pay to participate in a political charade?"" says Angelos Papadakis, an engineer from the Cyclades.
If Greece ends up with an early election, New Democracy will surely finish ahead of Pasok, but it may not win an outright majority. Mr Papandreou's departure from office, and perhaps from politics, would not make Greece's relations with its creditors any easier. Antonis Samaras, New Democracy's leader, is unpopular in Europe because of his sustained opposition to the EU-IMF reform programme. Greece might have to settle for a new coalition, backed by EU officials installed in key ministries to push reforms through a recalcitrant bureaucracy. In any event, the prospect for ordinary Greeks is grim.","The uncertain political ramifications surrounding Greece and the euro

IT TOOK several days of back-and-forth talks, missed deadlines and public and private outrage, but Greece finally has a new prime minister. On November 10th Lucas Papademos, a former vice-president of the European Central Bank, was named to replace George Papandreou, who had pledged to stand down four days earlier. The decision meant Greece had come full circle in less than a working week: on November 7th Mr Papademos had looked like a shoo-in for the job before negotiations went sour.
It may have taken a while to reach, but the choice at least looks sensible. Mr Papademos, an academic economist and a member of no political party, has the reputation to reassure Greece's bail-out partners, and his financial expertise should prove useful when it comes to implementing the complexities of the looming 50% haircut private holders of Greece's bonds must suffer, under a deal struck in Brussels on October 26th.
The last casualty of this week's wrangling was Philippos Petsalnikos, the speaker of parliament. A German-speaker skilled at keeping Greek lawmakers in order, he looked like a dead certainty to replace Mr Papandreou on the afternoon of November 9th. Mr Papandreou even delivered an emotional valedictory television address to the nation (although he did not name Mr Petsalnikos as his successor). Yet later that day Mr Papandreou (pictured, above, with President Karolos Papoulias) was forced to withdraw Mr Petsalnikos's candidacy amid a threatened rebellion by backbenchers in his Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok). They blamed Mr Petsalnikos for helping Mr Papandreou put together his ill-fated proposal for a referendum on Greece's new EUR 130 billion ($178 billion) bail-out package. That plan had been shot down by euro-zone leaders at the G20 summit in Cannes, triggering Mr Papandreou's decision on November 6th to step down (see Charlemagne).
Mr Papademos's ""first"" candidacy fell foul because he wanted to choose his own economic team. This proved unacceptable to Pasok, largely because it would probably not have included Evangelos Venizelos, Mr Papandreou's finance minister, who is not popular among EU and IMF officials. New Democracy was not keen on Mr Papademos either; he wanted an open-ended term rather than stick to an agreed February 19th deadline for elections.
Mr Venizelos threw his hat into the ring at the last moment, after running a whispering campaign against Mr Papademos. An ambitious constitutional lawyer, he is keen to succeed Mr Papandreou as Pasok leader. But he needs a position from which to build his campaign.
Mr Papademos kept a dignified distance from the chaotic politicking of the last week. But he reportedly added two more conditions. He wants support from New Democracy, which was reluctant to take up more than a few cabinet posts in the new government. And in line with a European Commission demand, he insists that both party leaders should sign a letter of commitment to the new bail-out terms. 
Mr Papandreou is willing to sign up. But Mr Samaras caused consternation in Brussels by apparently refusing to do so following objections from his party (though a later statement left open the possibility). Mr Samaras annoyed Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and other European conservatives by opposing Greece's first bail-out. He says he supports the second one, but EU officials are still unconvinced.
Over the next few weeks Mr Papademos will struggle with the country's first coalition government in modern times. Left-wing parties rejected Mr Papandreou's call for national unity. They plan to take their opposition to the streets.","How not to form a government

T HOU shalt not incur a structural deficit. Thou shalt pay down thy excessive debt. Thou shalt adopt a balanced-budget rule in thy constitution, and subject it to the European Court of Justice... 
It took just a little more than 40 days and 40 nights for Angela Merkel to bring down the tablets of fiscal law. At a summit in Brussels this week, 25 European leaders pledged to observe this covenant and made burnt offerings of their economic sovereignty. But the children of Europe are crying into the wilderness: ""How long, Lord, must we be tormented by austerity?"" 
Mrs Merkel holds out the prophecy of a political union. For the time being, though, and for years to come, deficit-cutting is the only path to righteousness, she says. Look at Italy and Spain: markets relented once they started reform in earnest. Look at Greece, the doubters retort: EU-induced budget cuts are pushing it into recession and insurrection, and closer to chaotic default. And Portugal is testing the notion that Greece is alone. 
Some see hope in things that Mrs Merkel has not yet done. She did not block a debate, due in March, on enlarging the euro's rescue fund. She did not demand the return of unused EU money, instead allowing it to be redirected to projects to boost growth and jobs. And she did not strike down the European Central Bank for creating a torrent of liquidity for banks ( 
). Still, the promised land of Eurobonds, and of the ECB lending to sovereigns, seems beyond the reach of today's politicians. 
In the third year of Europe's debt crisis, leaders are under pressure from three sides: the bond markets, which threaten to push countries into insolvency; EU institutions, armed with new powers to monitor budgets and economic policies; and fellow leaders, who are no longer shy about meddling in neighbours' affairs. 
This combination is almost impossible to resist. It took only a smirk between Mrs Merkel and the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, to doom Italy's prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi. The Greek prime minister, George Papandreou, was also replaced under pressure from ""Merkozy"". The new Belgian government, led by Elio Di Rupo, a Socialist, was forced to cut cherished social programmes under threat of EU sanctions (a general strike forced leaders to fly in to this week's summit via a military airport). 
What about citizens? They are being given little say in the loss of national prerogatives. Surely democratic politics is nothing if not about how wealth is created and distributed. Yet the treaty was drafted to avoid referendums, above all in Ireland (although that may be tested by the courts). Even if it is put to a vote, it will come into force when 12 of the euro zone's 17 approve it. Countries that do not ratify will not receive new bail-outs from 2013. 
Despite riots in Greece, and protests elsewhere, the fear of economic meltdown is still a brake on popular dissent. ""In periods of recession you can ask people to make more sacrifices than in good times,"" argues a senior Brussels official. The technocrats in Rome and Athens still rely on the support of elected parties. Most other EU governments are run by centre-right parties that tend to believe in budget consolidation. 
But such consensus is fragile, and could soon be tested. Greece may hold elections in April that would probably be won by Antonis Samaras, leader of the conservative opposition party, New Democracy. He infuriates European leaders by only partly backing the international reform programme. Will the euro zone allow Greece to default if he resists its diktats? In France Francois Hollande, the Socialist who polls suggest will win the presidency in May, wants to renegotiate the fiscal pact. Should he refuse to adopt a balanced-budget rule it is hard to imagine Mrs Merkel taking him to court. 
Such pressures may explain Germany's heavy hand. Mrs Merkel's decision to campaign for Mr Sarkozy's re-election looks ill-judged. A German official's call for a ""budget commissioner"" with veto rights over Greek spending prompted accusations that Germany was trying to appoint a ""G auleiter"". Mrs Merkel disavowed the idea, but her plans for stronger ""monitoring"" may not be very different. All this feeds anti-German feeling. 
Some suggest elected national governments are being crushed by an undemocratic Europe. That is facile. For several countries, the EU is a guarantee of democracy. Many would rather surrender sovereignty to a Europe, where they have influence, than to financial speculators. And in a monetary union, members surely have a right to speak up if others act recklessly. In the end, countries choose whether to join the EU, or even the euro. Democracy begins at home 
Still, the EU is not like other international clubs. It intrudes deeply into the internal workings of its members. It would be hard, and extremely painful, to leave the euro. The EU's decision-making is unintelligible to most people. 
Consider the unelected European Commission. It may be less influential in the Brussels power game than it once was, but it is acquiring important powers over members, notably the authority to recommend sanctions. Yes, democratic governments grant independence to a lot of important jobs, from central bankers to judges. But the commission has a political as well as a technocratic role. And in the Council of Ministers, which represents elected governments, decisions are prone to opaque back-room deals. The European Parliament hardly commands voters' passion. 
Citizens are thus left feeling impotent. Their governments are eviscerated at home, yet voters lack the means to throw the bums out of Brussels. This is dangerous. Bringing debt under control and, more importantly, promoting reforms to boost growth, will take years of sacrifice and suffering. It can be sustained only with a strong national mandate. Without that, both governments and the EU will eventually be discredited.","A pact to cut budget deficits is achieved at the cost of a growing democratic deficit

TAKING big decisions on Greece's future suggests high drama. But the delays, muddle and political posturing dogging efforts to win a EUR 130 billion ($170 billion) bail-out from its European Union partners could be from an old Athenian comedy. This week the three political leaders supporting a fractious government were arguing over the details of an austerity package with Lucas Papademos, the caretaker prime minister. Their meeting was repeatedly delayed as the ""troika"" (the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF) grappled with Evangelos Venizelos, the finance minister, over EUR 3 billion of spending cuts. 
Foot-dragging over reform is a big reason for Greece's sick state. The economy may shrink this year by around 3%, after 6% last year. Unemployment hit 19% in January. Almost one in two young Greeks is without a job. Given the outlook, investors have unsurprisingly shied away from new privatisations. Delays by finance-ministry officials have also infuriated the troika. Only after it had dismissed their latest proposals as ""unrealistic"" and ""farcical"" did Mr Venizelos cave in. A 20% reduction in the minimum wage, another round of pension cuts and 15,000 public-sector job cuts are among the measures the politicians are being asked to swallow in the next 15 days. 
Once the deal is done, Greece can arrange a ""voluntary"" debt swap, in which private owners of Greek bonds would write off 70% of their value, but could eventually recoup a chunk if the economy recovers. The debt would be reduced by EUR 100 billion (from EUR 350 billion) but would still be 120% of GDP in 2020 (from 160% now). Greece might one day be able to pay back the full amount, argue the project's backers, though many are sceptical that a full-scale default can be avoided. 
The politicians care only about the short term. As soon as the bond swap is approved, the EU and IMF will release fresh funding, a EUR 14.4 billion bond expiring on March 20th will be repaid and an election campaign can begin. Mr Papademos, a former ECB vice-president, will not run; he is expected to take an academic post in America. Antonis Samaras, leader of the conservative New Democracy party, has called for an election on April 8th. His party holds an unassailable lead in the opinion polls, yet not enough for an outright majority. New Democracy would win 33% of the vote, says a recent poll, ahead of the 18% for the Democratic Left, led by Fotis Kouvelis, a veteran left-winger. 
Greece needs political stability to turn the economy around. Yet there is no obvious coalition partner for Mr Samaras apart from the right-wing Laos (People's) party under George Karatzaferis, now enjoying its first taste of power as a junior partner in Mr Papademos's government. The once powerful Panhellenic Socialist Movement has plunged to 8%, a record low, say the polls. A leadership battle started after George Papandreou, who handed power to Mr Papademos only halfway through his four-year term, announced he would step down, though without saying when. He is unlikely to run again. Mr Venizelos, the front-runner to succeed him, may have to put in a longish spell in opposition. 
Voters brought up on Greece's ""relationship"" politics, in which party connections win public-sector jobs and perks, feel betrayed. A new popular movement, ""I won't vote"", may attract strong support. Smaller left-wing parties will make gains. So will the far-right, anti-immigrant Chryssi Avgi (Golden Dawn) group, which is close to reaching the 3% threshold for entry into parliament, according to recent polls. Greece's fragmented and increasingly polarised politics could become the real obstacle to reform.","Tough fiscal negotiations run into hard political reality

Delays by finance - ministry officials have also infuriated the troika . Only after it had dismissed their latest proposals as "" unrealistic "" and "" farcical "" did Mr Venizelos cave in . A 20 % reduction in the minimum wage , another round of pension cuts and 15,000 public - sector job cuts are among the measures the politicians are being asked to swallow in the next 15 days . 
 Once the deal is done , Greece can arrange a "" voluntary "" debt swap , in which private owners of Greek bonds would write off 70 % of their value , but could eventually recoup a chunk if the economy recovers . The debt would be reduced by EUR 100 billion ( from EUR 350 billion ) but would still be 120 % of GDP in 2020 ( from 160 % now ) . Greece might one day be able to pay back the full amount , argue the project 's backers , though many are sceptical that a full - scale default can be avoided . 
 The politicians care only about the short term . As soon as the bond swap is approved , the EU and IMF will release fresh funding , a EUR 14.4 billion bond expiring on March 20th will be repaid and an election campaign can begin . Mr Papademos , a former ECB vice - president , will not run ; he is expected to take an academic post in America . Antonis Samaras has called for an election on April 8th . Antonis Samaras's party holds an unassailable lead in the opinion polls , yet not enough for an outright majority . New Democracy would win 33 % of the vote , says a recent poll , ahead of the 18 % for the Democratic Left , led by Fotis Kouvelis , a veteran left - winger . 
 Greece needs political stability to turn the economy around . Yet there is no obvious coalition partner for Antonis Samaras apart from the right - wing Laos ( People 's ) party under George Karatzaferis , now enjoying its first taste of power as a junior partner in Mr Papademos 's government . The once powerful Panhellenic Socialist Movement has plunged to 8 % , a record low , say the polls . A leadership battle started after George Papandreou , who handed power to Mr Papademos only halfway through his four - year term , announced he would step down , though without saying when . He is unlikely to run again . Mr Venizelos , the front - runner to succeed him , may have to put in a longish spell in opposition . 
 Voters brought up on Greece 's "" relationship "" politics , in which party connections win public - sector jobs and perks , feel betrayed . A new popular movement , "" I wo n't vote "" , may attract strong support . Smaller left - wing parties will make gains . So will the far - right , anti - immigrant Chryssi Avgi ( Golden Dawn ) group , which is close to reaching the 3 % threshold for entry into parliament , according to recent polls . Greece 's fragmented and increasingly polarised politics could become the real obstacle to reform .",350,Greece,cb-350-2,PRE TERM,True,"Antonis Samaras , leader of the conservative New Democracy party ,",3,True

THE pattern has become familiar: a late-night austerity vote in the Greek parliament, a riot in the square outside. This time, the violence went further, as gangs of hooded youths set ablaze almost 50 buildings in the city's historic centre.

Greek GDP shrank by almost 7% in 2011. It will fall again this year, by at least another 4%, according to the troika--the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF--in charge of Greece's bail-out. Greek politicians say they are determined to do better. The uneasy coalition between the socialists of Pasok and the conservatives from New Democracy (Laos, a small right-wing party has pulled out) under Lucas Papademos, a former central banker, has accepted EUR 3.3 billion ($4.3 billion) in spending cuts. The next step is to sign up to a new three-year reform programme in return for a fresh EUR 130 billion bail-out, which, with a big debt restructuring, is meant to avert a disorderly default next month. 
The latest measures are tougher than their predecessors. Revenue-raising plans were dashed by the depth of the recession, and by the finance ministry's failure to crack down on corrupt tax officials. Instead, wages and pensions are to be cut. So is spending on defence, health and local government, where officials had turned a blind eye to budget overruns. The troika's critics say these cuts will only increase the Greeks' misery. They claim that a 22% reduction in the minimum wage, aimed at boosting competitiveness, will shrink the economy by another 1.5% this year as cash-strapped workers consume less. 
Yet the politicians have set aside their populist instincts to follow their creditors' instructions. Parliament approved the austerity measures by a two-thirds majority (though 22 socialist and 21 conservative lawmakers voted against, and lost their party whips). Then George Papandreou, the former Pasok prime minister, and Antonis Samaras, New Democracy's leader, both sent letters to the troika pledging to implement the new programme no matter who wins the election expected in April. 
There was relief when Mr Samaras, who had opposed previous reforms, made his letter public. If New Democracy wins the election, he wants ""modifications"" (meaning extra spending aimed at promoting recovery). But he insists these would be made only in agreement with the troika. Opinion polls give the conservatives a strong lead, though it may be waning and is not enough to win an outright majority. Pasok is picking up support following the emergence of Evangelos Venizelos, the finance minister, as the likely next leader (Mr Papandreou will stand down). There is talk of a conservative-socialist coalition being formed after the election, which could provide enough stability for Greece to keep reforming. 
Yet the euro group of finance ministers is not convinced. It delayed approving the austerity package, and not just because Mr Venizelos at first failed to give details of an extra EUR 325m of cuts. The group will probably say yes on February 20th, but there is talk of holding back some bail-out money until after the election or of offering a bridging loan. The German, Dutch and Finnish finance ministers are impatient with Greece's poor record of reform. North Europeans suspect that Mr Samaras will be tempted to give up on austerity. 
To make the reforms stick, Wolfgang Schauble, the German finance minister, even suggested postponing the election and setting up a small technocratic cabinet like Italy's to run Greece for the next two years. Greeks are growing increasingly resentful at what they deem to be German high-handedness. The Greek president, Karolos Papoulias, demanded, ""Who is Mr Schauble to revile Greece? Who are the Dutch? Who are the Finns?"" A protester sprayed the central bank to make the Bank of Greece sign read Bank of ""Berlin"".

GREEK politicians have rarely been so unpopular. Back at home for the carnival holiday weekend, one lawmaker was thumped with a fake plastic club. Others were dubbed thieves, vagabonds and traitors by angry voters. Even backbenchers are blamed for the country's deepening economic woes, whether they come from the conservative New Democracy party, a reckless borrower when in power, or the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok), which failed to clean up the mess. 
Under Lucas Papademos, a former central banker serving as an unelected prime minister, most ND and Pasok legislators have backed further austerity measures in return for a new EUR 130 billion ($174 billion) bail-out by the European Union and the IMF. (Greece's fragmented left-wing parties voted against.) The government has done better than expected, so some leading Greek businessmen want Mr Papademos to stay on until its term runs out in October 2013. That is wishful thinking, given the urgency within Pasok over choosing a new leader to replace George Papandreou, the former prime minister, who is to step down this month. And Antonis Samaras, the ND leader, is growing ever more impatient to lead the country. 
Mr Papademos promises that an election will be held, implying soon. Many Greeks expect to go to the polls in late April or May, after the government completes its debt restructuring and draws the first instalment of the new loan. Voters are bitterly divided, say the polls, which show ND finishing first, with 25-30%, but well short of an overall majority. Mr Samaras is trying to win back right-wingers who opposed the bail-out. 
Pasok is doing worse, on 8-12%, behind three left-wing parties that were against the bail-out. Some Socialists have been talking up the Democratic Left, a catch-all party for the dissatisfied middle class led by Fotis Kouvelis, a veteran lawyer. With 15-18% of the vote, Mr Kouvelis's party is now second to ND, but he has little appetite for power-sharing. 
Pasok's leadership battle is one reason why its popularity has plunged. Half-a-dozen candidates are jostling to succeed Mr Papandreou. Evangelos Venizelos, the finance minister and front-runner, has been too preoccupied with the bail-out and debt restructuring to devote much time to campaigning. But by the time of the leadership contest on March 18th, he may have swept most rivals aside. He has few qualms about forming a coalition with Mr Samaras, continuing the present arrangement, though sceptics worry that having two populists in charge without the calming presence of Mr Papademos would be bad for the cause of reform. 
Some observers fret over an apparent explosion of support for small parties. Others say this is just a gesture of protest. At the election, the protesters may well abstain. Whichever parties come to power, Greece's commitment to cutting 150,000 public-sector jobs by 2015 will mean that lawmakers have trouble finding cosy positions for their supporters. If the politicians can no longer fulfil their side of a 150-year-old bargain, say the cynics, voters might just as well stay at home.

A SHAKE-UP of Greece's cosy two-party political system would hardly be a surprise, given the economic and social upheaval caused by the country's worst recession in almost a century. Many voters are sick of the corruption and clientelism that has flourished under the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) and the conservative New Democracy party, which have alternated in power for 30-odd years. At Greece's general election, likely to be held on May 6th, polls suggest that many voters will back small anti-reform parties led by veteran political hacks. 
Scaremongers claim that three left-wing parties--unreconstructed communists (KKE), hardline radicals (Syriza) and spendthrift socialists (Democratic Left)--are fomenting social unrest that could undermine Greece's new bail-out, worth up to EUR 174 billion ($227 billion), and drive it out of the euro. Others worry about far-right parties like Golden Dawn, which for the first time is likely to beat the 3% threshold to enter parliament and Laos. Up to ten parties might win seats at the election. 
But will they count for much? The two big parties still look strong. New Democracy is far ahead in the polls. Pasok has been in fourth place in some, trailing Democratic Left and even the communists. Yet Evangelos Venizelos, the finance minister and sole candidate to become party leader, believes voters will flock back once he takes over. His first test comes on March 18th, when Pasok's ""friends and supporters"" are due to endorse him as leader by turning up at a polling station and paying EUR 2 for a ballot paper (to cover the cost of the election, supposedly). A turnout below 100,000 would be ""rather embarrassing"", admits one party official. 
Recently the two big parties have successfully cohabited under Lucas Papademos, a former vice-president of the European Central Bank who became prime minister in a back-room deal last November. Last week Mr Papademos's government oversaw a EUR 100 billion write-off of sovereign debt, giving Greece some breathing-space to get on with the overhaul of its economy. 
New Democracy is unlikely to win a majority. Although Antonis Samaras, its leader, is not tainted by the party's inglorious past (he took over after it lost power in 2009) his backing for the new bail-out, seen by many as a U-turn, has knocked four to five percentage points off its lead. 
Some politicians from Europe's creditor nations worry that elections will distract Greece from its tight reform timetable. Yet despite the rise of small parties, the outcome is unlikely to make a fundamental difference. Many observers believe that New Democracy, boosted by an extra 50 seats which a new election law hands the party that finishes first, will form a new coalition with Pasok. Such a pairing would enjoy a strong majority. Several senior cabinet ministers may keep their jobs. Mr Papademos might even be persuaded to stay, perhaps as Mr Samaras's deputy. That would reassure Europeans that Greece will keep plodding on.","Greece 's election may see more continuity than convulsion

WITH anti-German feelings among Greeks running at a post-war high, fewer German tourists are likely to visit the Aegean islands this summer. Many local hoteliers would almost certainly go bust were it not for the increasing number of Russians who are coming to Greece, thanks to more relaxed visa regulations. About 1m Russian holidaymakers are expected to visit Greece this year, double the number in 2010. 
Many Russians are spending lavishly and buying second homes in the Halkidiki district in northern Greece, a favourite beach destination. Vladimir Putin, Russia's president-elect, is a familiar visitor to Mount Athos, a nearby enclave of Orthodox monks. He may even attend Orthodox Easter festivities there on April 15th. Abbot Ephraim of the Vatopedi monastery enjoyed a warm official reception in Moscow last year despite facing investigation at home for alleged involvement in a land-swap scandal. Romfea, a Greek website specialising in ecclesiastical news, receives Russian funding, say grateful acolytes. 
Where tourists and politicians lead, money may follow. Greece's cash-strapped government is rushing to privatise various public utilities, including DEPA, the state gas group. Gazprom, Russia's state-backed giant, has expressed an interest in adding DEPA to its growing portfolio of international interests. DEPA already buys much of its gas from Gazprom, and one of its subsidiaries has signed up to join South Stream, a Russian project to pipe gas to central Europe via the Black Sea. There is also talk about stationing Russian naval vessels in Piraeus, Athens's main port. Russia is worried about losing access to Syrian naval bases if mounting violence brings down Bashar Assad, the president. 
Still, Antonis Samaras, Greece's probable next prime minister, shows few signs of being tempted by either deal. His centre-right New Democracy (ND) party is forecast to win a general election expected in early May, although it is likely to fall short of an overall majority. Mr Samaras has made a pre-election trip to Moscow, but enthusiasm failed to ignite on either side. His advisers say their Harvard-educated boss would prefer to improve ties with America and to sell the gas utility to an investor from the European Union. 
But as Greek politics becomes more unstable--as many as nine parties could win seats in the next parliament, not all of them with savoury views--there is still plenty of room for Russian influence-mongering. Panos Kammenos, a former ND deputy who opposes austerity and admires Mr Putin, says Greece should turn to Russia if, as expected, it needs yet another bail-out. (Russia has already lent Cyprus EUR 2.5 billion, or $3.3 billion, to avert the island's default.) Mr Kammenos's new party, Independent Greeks, is predicted to sweep into parliament with around 10% of the vote. He is hoping to replace Abbot Ephraim as Russia's best friend in Greece.

IF GREECE'S creditors had their way, its politicians would be getting on with reforms and not wasting time and EUR 30m ($39m) on a snap general election. Opinion polls suggest that the May 6th vote is unlikely to produce a clear result. Yet the leaders of the PanHellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) and the conservative New Democracy (ND) party, fractious coalition partners for five months, are spoiling for a fight, even if their parties end up joining forces in government again. 
The voters are angry with ND over a public-spending spree that set Greece on the road to ruin, and with Pasok for failing to haul it back from the brink. ND has a modest but persistent poll lead. But Antonis Samaras, its leader, trails Evangelos Venizelos of Pasok by a small margin as the better choice as prime minister. Many Greeks plan to abstain. Others intend to protest by voting for one of ten small parties that oppose the harsh reforms imposed by the European Union and the IMF. 
The latest numbers from MRB, a usually reliable pollster, gives ND 25.4%, down a smidgen from a month ago. Pasok has risen a little, to 15.8%. The same poll also suggests that, despite being dissatisfied with the outgoing coalition, two-thirds of voters want another one to succeed it. 
Mr Samaras has been hit by the defection of Panos Kammenos, a wayward backbencher who wants Russia to replace the EU and IMF as Greece's lender of last resort. His Independent Greeks party could capture 10% of the vote. ND will also lose votes to four right-wing splinter groups. Yet Mr Samaras insists that he can become prime minister, banking on the 50 extra seats awarded to the front-runner under a new electoral law. He threatens to call another election within months if he fails to win an outright majority. 
Mr Venizelos, a former finance minister who took over Pasok's leadership from George Papandreou last month, is trying hard to win back left-of-centre voters. His speeches feature self-criticism and sympathy for impoverished Greeks. He has made overtures to Fotis Kouvelis, the soft-spoken leader of the Democratic Left party, a refuge for aggrieved socialists that is polling around 9%. Pasok's electoral list includes a respectable number of new faces and a record number of women. With a new-look Pasok behind him, Mr Venizelos aims to capture more than 20% of the vote (that is still less than half the 44% that Pasok won under Mr Papandreou in 2009). 
Whatever the outcome, Greece will be even harder to govern than usual. Mr Venizelos says he will not serve under Mr Samaras, though several moderately competent socialists would join a ND-led government. The conservatives are still casting around for a suitable technocrat for finance minister--a job that requires good English, a sound grasp of macroeconomics and a willingness to co-operate with the troika of the EU, IMF and European Central Bank that oversees reforms. Lucas Papademos, a former ECB vice-president who has been serving as a technocratic prime minister, has said he wants to go back to academic life in America. But he might perhaps be lobbied to stay on as deputy prime minister and finance minister. 
Greece is a long way from hitting its fiscal targets. By June the new government must agree another EUR 11 billion of spending cuts for 2013-14.

 IF GREECE 'S creditors had their way , its politicians would be getting on with reforms and not wasting time and EUR 30 m ( $ 39 m ) on a snap general election . Opinion polls suggest that the May 6th vote is unlikely to produce a clear result . Yet the leaders of the PanHellenic Socialist Movement ( Pasok ) and the conservative New Democracy ( ND ) party , fractious coalition partners for five months , are spoiling for a fight , even if their parties end up joining forces in government again . 
 The voters are angry with ND over a public - spending spree that set Greece on the road to ruin , and with Pasok for failing to haul it back from the brink . ND has a modest but persistent poll lead . But Antonis Samaras's trails Evangelos Venizelos of Pasok by a small margin as the better choice as prime minister . Many Greeks plan to abstain . Others intend to protest by voting for one of ten small parties that oppose the harsh reforms imposed by the European Union and the IMF . 
 The latest numbers from MRB , a usually reliable pollster , gives ND 25.4 % , down a smidgen from a month ago . Pasok has risen a little , to 15.8 % . The same poll also suggests that , despite being dissatisfied with the outgoing coalition , two - thirds of voters want another one to succeed it . Antonis Samaras has been hit by the defection of Panos Kammenos , a wayward backbencher who wants Russia to replace the EU and IMF as Greece 's lender of last resort .

ALEXIS TSIPRAS, a left-wing upstart who first won a parliamentary seat less than three years ago, could be the man who takes Greece out of the euro. His Syriza (Left Coalition) party, which unites a handful of fractious radical groups, massively increased its vote in the general election on May 6th, mostly at the expense of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok). It has gone from the fringes of politics to being the second-largest party in the Greek parliament. 
The centre-right New Democracy was the largest party; Pasok, previously New Democracy's coalition partner, came in third place with just 13.2% of the vote, its worst election performance in over 30 years. Most important, parties which, like Syriza, are opposed to the austerity measures that Pasok and New Democracy had agreed to as the price of a EUR 130 billion ($169 billion) international bail-out earlier this year ended up with 70% of the vote. This, the recent fall of a budget-cutting Dutch government and the election on May 6th of a Socialist president in France are seen by some in Greece and elsewhere as a widespread challenge to Europe's politics of austerity. 
In a fissiparous display of national desperation the Greek electorate gave no party much support. New Democracy's 18.9% won it 108 seats, thanks to a rule that gives the front-running party an extra 50 seats; Syriza's 16.8% got it 52 seats, and Pasok got 41 seats. The other parties elected were the Communist Party; Independent Greeks, a right-wing splinter group; Democratic Left, a splinter from Syriza; and the neo-fascist Golden Dawn (see chart). 
The collapse of Pasok's vote deprived the pro-euro conservatives and Socialists of an overall majority in parliament, giving Mr Tsipras (pictured) a turn at playing kingmaker during this week's round of coalition negotiations. After New Democracy decided it could not put together a coalition, Mr Tsipras had a go, coming up on May 8th with a list of demands that seemed tailor-made for rejection by the two ""mainstream"" parties. Cheekily, he asked Antonis Samaras and Evangelos Venizelos, the conservative and Socialist leaders, to sign a ""letter of repentance"" reneging on a written pledge to Brussels that they would fully implement reforms. This and his other proposals were duly rejected. Another election now looms, probably on June 17th. It may also end in stalemate. That would surely lead to the terms of the bail-out being breached, and make an exit from the euro much more likely. 
Until that day of reckoning a caretaker government will run the country. Lucas Papademos, the technocrat prime minister, will stand down in favour of a senior state lawyer or judge. Mr Papademos pushed through enough reforms during his six-month tenure for Greece to receive most of its next EUR 5.2 billion loan tranche this week, ensuring that salaries and pensions will be paid until June. He made virtually no progress, though, on restoring business confidence or attracting investors from abroad. The economy is in its fifth year of recession. 
Mr Tsipras, who organised sit-ins and protest marches at high school, still enjoys stirring up the political establishment. He has demanded that Greece formally abandon the ""barbarous"" bail-out programme; place its banks under state control; and set up an international committee to audit the public debt before declaring a moratorium on repayments. Mr Tsipras argues that Greece can reject the bail-out and also stay in the euro; pro-reform politicians call this ""naive"". Any such idea is rejected outright in Berlin. 
Left-of-centre Greeks voted for Syriza both to punish Pasok for impoverishing the country and because Syriza opposes reforms that would open up closed-shop professions in a bid to make Greece more competitive. Syriza's idealistic economic programme calls for providing students with free meals and doling out pensions equal to final salaries. Mr Tsipras says the state should hire 100,000 more workers to help reduce unemployment, now running at 21%. 
One more chance 
The June election will hinge on whether Mr Samaras and Mr Venizelos can persuade the 70% of Greeks who say that they want to stay in the euro that they have had their protest, and that it is time to get serious again: they must choose between centre and fringe, between euro and drachma. 
As well as trying to sharpen up his own campaign, Mr Samaras has to fend off disappointed conservatives who think he should be replaced--not least because he insisted on holding the poll when Mr Papademos seemed to be muddling through. Mr Samaras's predecessor, Costas Karamanlis, a former prime minister, might now try to replace him, though he is not an obvious choice to lead New Democracy into the next election. Small centre-right parties may also have a role. If Dora Bakoyannis, a former foreign minister and leader of Democratic Alliance, can be persuaded to hook up with Stefanos Manos, a former finance minister and boss of Drasi, a pro-business party, they might get enough votes for a dozen seats. 
Mr Venizelos has problems of his own. If Pasok loses more votes the second time around, he will be challenged for the party leadership by Andreas Loverdos, the health minister. This means he cannot reject Mr Tsipras as stridently as Mr Samaras does, because he needs to win back voters who have been wooed away by Syriza if he is to survive. Hence his conciliatory tone--while all the time stressing that Greece cannot afford to be outside the euro zone, where Mr Tsipras would lead it.","In the first of three pieces on Europe 's future , we look at Greece 's enraged howl of an election , which makes its eventual departure from the euro zone more likely

PITY Karolos Papoulias, the 82-year-old president who has been trying to persuade Greece's fractious political leaders to form a national-unity government after the election on May 6th failed to produce a clear winner. Mr Papoulias, a soft-spoken former foreign minister, struggled for nine days, handing out and receiving several mandates and even making a three-day effort of his own before giving up. 
Success would have given Greece a breathing-space, if only a short one, to pursue urgent reforms, such as recapitalising its banks and getting on with privatisation. That might have helped it to rebuild its shattered credibility with both its European Union partners and financial markets. Instead, another election will be held, on June 17th. A caretaker government under Panagiotis Pikrammenos, Greece's most senior judge, will run the country in the interim. Lucas Papademos, a former European central banker who led a coalition government for six months, overseeing a EUR 206 billion sovereign-debt restructuring, was not asked to stay on. 
The transcripts of Mr Papoulias's final three meetings, made public at the request of Alexis Tsipras, a rising political star and leader of Syriza, a hard-left coalition, reveal a disturbing lack of vision. Rather than tackle such serious questions as how to keep Greece in the euro, prickly political leaders shrugged off warnings that a run on Greek banks was imminent and swapped insults instead. Reading the texts makes voters still more frustrated. ""They're all irresponsible, none of them is capable of ending this crisis,"" said Aristomenes Antonopoulos, a lawyer. ""How to vote now?"" 
Support among Greeks for staying in the euro is stronger than ever: up from 70% to 80% in the past three months, say opinion polls. Yet fears that prolonged political instability could trigger a Greek exit are also increasing. Greek savers withdrew as much as EUR 2 billion from local banks (almost 2% of total deposits) as hopes of forming a coalition were collapsing. And this figure does not include a surge of investment in ""safe haven"" German and British government bonds since the election. 
Greece has seen a steady erosion of bank deposits over the past two years, yet few bankers were prepared for such a rapid acceleration of withdrawals. Deposits actually increased in March and April, thanks to the smooth handling of Greece's partial default. By the middle of the week, cash was still being taken away, but in orderly fashion. There were no queues outside bank branches in central Athens or its suburbs. Customers ordered cash by telephone and picked it up 24 hours later. Some went straight into safe deposit boxes at the same bank; some was stashed under mattresses in case Greece readopts the drachma. ""People are taking preventive measures...if you own a pile of euros, you'll feel rich in a drachma environment,"" said one veteran Greek banker. 
For all their enthusiasm to keep the euro, Greeks are also fed up with the austerity that German leaders are imposing as the price of continued membership. Syriza feeds on this inconsistency, arguing that Greece can stay in the euro but reject the terms of its EU/IMF bail-out. According to an opinion poll on May 13th, Syriza would win 20.5% of the vote and come first in the June 17th election, just ahead of the pro-euro New Democracy (19.4%). Even though that would give Syriza the winner's bonus of 50 extra seats, it would still fall well short of an overall majority. The Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok), which also supports the bail-out, would come a distant third, with 11.8%. 
Mr Tsipras is reorganising his party and renewing his campaign neighbourhood by neighbourhood, concentrating on Athens and other cities where Syriza came first on May 6th. His rhetoric is sharper than ever, yet his dream of forming a left-wing coalition government is no nearer reality than at the previous election. Potential left-wing partners have been unco-operative ever since Mr Tsipras bounced into second place behind New Democracy. 
Antonis Samaras, New Democracy's leader, will pull out all the stops. If he cannot form a government this time, his career may be over. A new alliance with a small liberal party led by Dora Bakoyannis, whom he defeated for the party leadership in 2009, may give him an extra couple of points. But Evangelos Venizelos, the Pasok leader and a potential coalition partner, will struggle to stop more voters leaving for Syriza. Even if New Democracy again came first (and took those extra 50 seats) the two big parties would still struggle to form a government.

GREEK voters face a bleak choice on June 17th, in their second general election in six weeks. The sensible options are the centre-right New Democracy (ND) party or the PanHellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok). Both parties promise a future in the euro, though the cost is high: at least three more years of austerity in return for shrinking external help. So angry, jobless Greeks may prefer the alternative: the radical left Syriza coalition, which came second on May 6th and is now hard on ND's tail. They are tempted by talk of Robin Hood taxes to help the poor and the renationalising of much of the economy. 
Opinion polls are volatile and inconsistent. But most show a close contest between ND and Syriza, with Pasok trailing in third. A poll by GPO for Mega, a private television station, gives ND 23.4% to 22.1% for Syriza and 13.5% for Pasok. Efforts by Antonis Samaras, the ND leader, to rally centre-right voters may be paying off. Dora Bakoyannis, a pro-reform former foreign minister, has rejoined him along with members of her liberal splinter group, the Democratic Alliance. Right-wingers from two other small parties are also creeping back. Pasok is having a much tougher time; hardline supporters scared of losing cushy public-sector jobs have fled to Syriza. Evangelos Venizelos, its leader, is fighting to avert an all-out collapse at the polls, say campaign workers. 
The mood is gloomy. Few Greeks are confident that a stable government will emerge from the election. Optimists hope ND will win and team up with Pasok and Democratic Left, a small party of ex-Syriza moderates. If Alexis Tsipras, the charismatic Syriza leader, pulls his party into first place, he would have to find coalition partners among the same parties. Mr Tsipras argues that Greece can dump the European Union/IMF bail-out terms, yet keep the euro. If he comes to power, a confrontation with Brussels, which takes the opposite view, would surely follow. 
The EU and IMF say they will turn off the tap if political instability continues. The EU has ratcheted up pressure by holding back EUR 1 billion ($1.24 billion) of a EUR 5.4 billion tranche of help in May. With cash running out, the finance ministry will struggle to pay pensions and public-sector wages at the end of June. At cash-strapped state hospitals in Athens, patients arriving for treatment of chronic conditions are told to bring their own prescription drugs. 
Talk of a ""Grexit"" from the euro is fuelling a quiet flow of withdrawals from Greek bank accounts. Somewhere between EUR 3 billion and EUR 7 billion has become mattress money, say bankers. Economists at National Bank of Greece, an Athens lender, predict that, if Greece returns to the drachma, incomes will fall by at least 55%, bank lending rates would reach 37%, output would plunge by 22% and property values would fall by half. 
Yet some admire Mr Tsipras for answering back. His approval rating jumps whenever he takes aim at a European politician. One target is Christine Lagarde, the IMF managing director, who implied in an interview that children in Niger were more deserving than tax-evading Greeks. ""We don't need her compassion,"" Mr Tsipras retorted. Others jumped on the bandwagon. ""On her tax-free salary of EUR 400,000 a year, how dare she criticise us?"" asked Zoi Konstantopoulou, a Syriza candidate.

IT WAS a victory for the euro. It was a credit line. It was ""the thing that happened yesterday"". The one way Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy refused to describe the pledge of EUR 100 billion ($125 billion) from other euro-zone countries to recapitalise Spain's banks was as a ""bail-out"". Nor was it a rescue, the economy minister, Luis de Guindos, insisted; just ""a loan with very favourable conditions"". 
Regardless of the conditions, the outcome was less than favourable. The package had been put together during a series of rushed videoconferences of euro-zone finance ministers on June 9th. The European Commission president, Jose Manuel Barroso, says he pushed Mr Rajoy, who had previously denied the need for any deal, into accepting one. Mr Rajoy has claimed it was he who did the forcing, insisting on a deal focused only on the banks. What is certain is that a need to calm markets before the Greek election on June 17th piled on the pressure. 
The markets were not calmed. By June 12th bond yields were higher than they have been since the country adopted the euro in 1999; if they stay that high for long the kingdom of Spain itself would need a bail-out (see chart 1). Even without government circumlocution, enough was fuzzy about the deal to have investors worried. Yet some things were clear: while Spain now has a plausible plan to recapitalise its banks, the new money does little to resolve the Spanish economy's other fundamental problems. 
Not like the others 
Mr Rajoy's unwillingness to talk of bail-outs stems from a desire not to have Spain spoken of in the same breath as Greece, Ireland and Portugal (see chart 2 on next page). To reassure Spaniards that things were different he insisted that the money came with no strings in terms of new, more austere government policies, just some conditions for the banks. The euro zone's ""men in black"", as the budget minister, Cristobal Montoro, calls them, would not be visiting. 
But on June 11th Germany's finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, insisted that the troika of lenders--the European Commission, the IMF and the European Central Bank--which administers the bail-outs of Greece, Ireland and Portugal would be heavily involved in Spain too. Euro-zone ministers said Spanish policy, which they endorse, would be scrutinised and ""regularly reviewed"". 
One basis for Spanish exceptionalism is that Spain can be seen as too big to fail. ""There is not enough money to rescue both Spain and Italy,"" says one government official. That allows it to dig in its feet. According to El Mundo, a newspaper, Mr Rajoy reminded Mr de Guindos of this by text during the negotiations: ""Spain is not Uganda. We are the fourth-largest economy in the euro zone."" Officials refused to comment on this claim; wags on Twitter were quick to point out that Uganda's GDP growth and unemployment rate are both far better than Spain's, which is set to see GDP decline by 1.7% this year and suffers 24% unemployment. 
The other basis for exceptionalism is that Spain's crisis is not like those of Greece and Portugal; to begin with, at least, it really was all about the banks. When the global financial crisis hit in 2008, Madrid was relatively calm. Spain's banks were hit, but they had not invested in the toxic off-balance-sheet products that sank banks elsewhere. The then prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, boasted that Spain had ""perhaps the most solid financial system in the world."" 
But though Spain's banks had, as regulators required, made thrifty counter-cyclical provisions, they were also parties to an ungodly property bubble (see chart 3). Property prices tripled between 1995 and 2007. Construction and real-estate loans grew from 10% of GDP in 1992 to 43% in 2009, according to a new IMF report. 
A great deal of the lending was by Spain's unlisted regional savings banks, or cajas. Their share of the financial system, measured in terms of assets, rose from about 10% in the 1960s to nearly half by 2010, increasingly lending outside their region of origin. Fierce competition led to ever more bank branches opening; Spain ended up with one for every 1,000 people, making it one of the most overbanked countries in the world. 
The world's most solid financial system 
After the property bubble popped in 2008, banks began acquiring properties from developers before the loans that supported them went sour. As the economy entered recession, foreclosures mounted. Spain's banks may now own a fifth of the total stock of empty homes, according to some analysts' estimates. 
The reluctance to cut losses has delayed the adjustment in house prices, which have fallen by 25% from the 2007-08 peak, according to various indices. Irish prices, in comparison, have dropped by roughly half. Even though Irish prices rose more in the boom, Morgan Stanley, a bank, reckons that 50% could be on the cards for Spain, too, with the bulk of the remaining correction this year and the next. Supply and demand cannot be matched because the banks own so much property, says Jesus Encinar, founder of Idealista.com, a real-estate portal (see box on next page). ""Banks are only giving mortgages on their own apartments. They will give you a 100% mortgage [but only] if you buy one of their flats."" 
Mr Zapatero had several opportunities to clean up the banking system when government financing costs were lower, but dragged his feet. Spain created its bank bail-out fund, the FROB, in 2009, with a potential capacity of EUR 99 billion; by 2012 it had dispensed only EUR 14 billion. An industry-backed deposit-guarantee fund has provided another EUR 13 billion. 
A key obstacle was that the cajas didn't have shareholders; they were controlled by a mixture of politicians and depositors. Many cajas were operated by regional barons as development banks that could further their political purposes, says Luis Garicano of the London School of Economics. The cajas boasted that they had survived 200 years. Some, such as those in the Basque country, did indeed look healthier than commercial rivals. But the failure of governance at others was of epic proportions. Isabel Cambronero, a professional dancer appointed to the control committee of Caja de Ahorros del Mediterraneo, bailed out and later auctioned, said nobody ever told her there was a crisis. Other ex-board-members tell of meetings in New Delhi and Chicago. Huge pay packages and golden handshakes were the norm. 
The cajas of old are now more or less gone. The advent of FROB and a rise in capital requirements forced the country's 45 savings banks into a frenzy of consolidation. There are now just 11, all set up on modern lines. But these mergers were often fudges that simply compounded the problem. The caja ownership model made it hard to raise capital, and the reordered system reflected that lack. Last summer Bankia, a merger of seven savings banks, and Banca Civica undertook tortured stockmarket listings. A larger rival gobbled up Banca Civica at a discount; Bankia was bailed out on May 26th, its troubles calling into question assumptions about non-performing loans elsewhere in the system and spooking the markets even more. 
The EUR 100 billion loan from the euro zone should head off the sort of panic that might lead to bank runs while enabling the banks to purge their balance sheets of dud loans. But it is doing so by piling even more debt on Spain's weary shoulders. Channelled through the FROB, the loan will count as sovereign debt, potentially adding nearly 10% of GDP to Spain's debt burden this year. At 90% of GDP that burden would still be less than in other highly indebted countries in the euro zone. But markets were also rattled by the possibility that the new loans might take priority over private creditors. The money seems likely to come from the new European Stability Mechanism (ESM), which will be a preferred creditor; that would make Spanish bonds a bit more risky for other creditors. 
The loop of doom 
What is more, the bail-out does not break the feedback loop through which Spain and its banks are making things ever worse for each other. With foreign investors heading for the hills, Spanish banks have stepped in to buy even more government bonds, with the help of the ECB's cheap three-year loan programme. The more foreign investors leave the market--as they seem to have done this week--the less sustainable this becomes. 
The men in black might help with this. Spanish lenders taking bail-out money will be subject to European Union (EU) state-aid rules. Many will be forced to clean up boards and sell stakes in large industrial companies (a welcome development). Mindful of this, some banks were quick to say they did not need the cash. But the IMF report says that only the three largest Spanish banks--BBVA, CaixaBank and Santander, which account for 47% of assets--appear able to cope on their own if things get bad. 
Part of the troika's brief will be what the euro-zone governments call, opaquely, ""horizontal structural reforms"". Judging by the IMF report these might include disentangling the Bank of Spain's regulatory powers from the economy ministry's and strengthening them. The IMF also called for the introduction of a bank-resolution scheme that would impose losses on both shareholders and bondholders. And Joaquin Almunia, the EU's competition commissioner, has said that Spain may need to liquidate one of its bailed-out banks. 
Unlike the governments which oversaw bail-outs in Greece, Ireland and Portugal, all of which were booted out soon thereafter, Mr Rajoy is not in serious political danger. He has an absolute majority in the Cortes, and is only six months into a four-year term. Most of the country still blames Mr Zapatero for the mess. But Mr Rajoy risks increasing Spaniards' alienation. His People's Party has blocked an investigation of Bankia, which was run by managers the party appointed. He looks unlikely to appear in parliament to explain the bail-out until mid-July. And he seems allergic to journalists and their pesky questions. On a recent Senate visit he sneaked out of the back door to avoid them. 
There is a growing feeling, says Josep Lobera of Metroscopia, a polling company, that Mr Rajoy has no real plan for Spain's economy and merely reacts to events by improvising. Spinning ""the thing that happened yesterday"" as a famous victory will only increase that. And the public's faith in Europe is slipping too. Three years ago, 80% thought that the EU could best solve their problems. Three months ago that was down to 65%. Now it is barely over half. 
In Greece, Portugal and Ireland, Spain's ""sweet bail-out"" raised some hackles and some hopes. Portugal's prime minister, Pedro Passos Coelho, warned that he would scrutinise the final deal carefully. Syriza, a left-wing Greek party which wants to tear up the country's current bail-out agreement ( 
) said Spain had shown the way. So did the centre-right: ""Just think, at a time when a country like Spain negotiates, some""--a dig at Syriza--""argue that we have to clash with Europe,"" said Antonis Samaras, the leader of New Democracy. 
Meanwhile the markets swiftly moved on to other vulnerable euro-zone members. Cyprus is reported to be about to ask for a bail-out for its banks, which are heavily exposed to Greece. But the biggest worries are about Italy. Its budget deficit is small and its banks are not troubled by a burst property bubble, but it is in deep recession after a decade of almost no growth and investors are losing faith in the technocratic government of Mario Monti. His reform programme is seen to have stalled and he has less than nine months to go before the next election, the result of which is highly unpredictable. 
Italy's public debt of almost EUR 2 trillion makes it too big for any bail-out; after the latest EUR 100 billion to Spain, the sum left for new lending commitments will be just EUR 400 billion. And the response by the bond markets to that bail-out raises the worry that Spain might need to go back for more. Many of its regions can barely refinance their debts; they are largely to blame for Spain's deficit last year coming in at 8.9% of GDP not the targeted 6%. And while the banks may now be in slightly better shape, they are too risk-averse to lend to companies that, with credit, could grow. ""The tragedy is that these EUR 100 billion won't reach the real economy,"" says Mr Encinar of Idealista.com. ""The banks are petrified,"" agrees MartinVarsavsky, who runs Fon, a Wi-Fi hotspot company. ""They just want to save themselves."" 
That said, Mr Varsavsky sees Spain as highly unlikely to end up in as much trouble as his native Argentina when it defaulted a decade ago. ""Spain is much more mature and understanding of the role others can play in helping,"" he says. ""It is not a defiant, difficult country run by people who are abusive."" But it is still a country in a lot of trouble, likely only to be made worse when the Greek election result at least prolongs, and possibly intensifies, the euro zone's agony. Mr Rajoy may prove wise to have avoided the term ""bail-out"": Spain could be shipping water for some time yet.","The EUR 100 billion pledged to help Spain was meant to rescue the banks and calm the euro zone.

A SYSTEM is only as strong as its weakest point. Reinforcing one link in the chain exposes the vulnerability of the next. The euro zone is now so fragile in so many places that if the single currency is not to break apart, Europe must set about redesigning the system as a whole. The European summit on June 28th and 29th is a test of whether the euro zone's leaders will be capable of that (see Charlemagne). Even though some of the wiser ones are now hatching plans for a banking union and for intervening directly in government-debt markets, the evidence so far is that the task is still, alas, beyond them. 
The futility of treating the euro crisis as a series of separate national emergencies was plain for the world to see this week--first in Greece, then in Spain, and finally at the G20. On June 17th Greek voters chose parties that say they will broadly stick by the bail-out agreement . The new government, a coalition of the three parties, headed by Antonis Samaras of New Democracy, vowed that Greece's place in Europe would ""not be put in doubt"". 
It was a rare victory for the euro, but investors' relief lasted only a few hours. That was partly because Greece has so many more weaknesses to overcome. To accomplish anything at all, Mr Samaras will have to put aside a lifetime of rivalry and rise above the politics of patronage. He must persuade ordinary Greeks, battered by austerity, to accept cuts to the minimum wage, pensions and spending, as well as a programme of structural reform that has no parallel in modern Greek history. If he fails, Greece will not qualify for further tranches of rescue money. Even if Greece's official creditors give some leeway, by slightly lowering interest rates or rescheduling debt payments, the threat will remain that Greece will have to leave the euro. 
Greece, thus, is trapped. As long as the country is in danger of leaving the euro, growth will continue to shrink, bail-out targets will be missed and politics will drift to extremes. But as long as Greece lacks growth, misses targets and fails in its politics, it will be in danger of leaving the euro. 
Spain is now in a similar bind. Earlier this month it secured a pledge of up to EUR 100 billion ($127 billion) from the euro zone to shore up its banks. But this did nothing to restore confidence. Bad loans in Spain are at an 18-year high: as The Economist went to press, rumours swirled that the latest assessment of the banks' dodgy assets would be well above EUR 100 billion. And the bill for shoring up the banks is supposed to be paid by the Spanish government, which may not be able to afford it. On June 19th Spain sold 12-month bills with a coupon of over 5%, more than two percentage points higher than a month ago (and, again, not sustainable). 
To solve this problem, another fix is proposed. At the G20 summit in Mexico some countries suggested that the euro zone's rescue funds should be used to buy the bonds of governments which, like Spain's, are under attack. The European Stability Mechanism and its forerunner, the European Financial Stability Facility, can exploit a special contingency to spend hundreds of billions of euros trying to put a ceiling on borrowing costs. 
Yet again, a new wheeze sparked a market rally. But for how long? Germany, the euro-zone economy that counts, has not signed up to the plan. Even if it does, the funds would be barely enough to save Spain, to say nothing of Italy, which has EUR 2 trillion of sovereign debt. The inadequacy of the funds available risks being seen as a signal that there are limits to the euro zone's commitments--in other words, an invitation for investors to flee. 
Only if the rescue funds were free to borrow unlimited money from the European Central Bank could they credibly stand behind national debts--and there is not yet any sign of that . And even if they had such firepower, the rescue funds' intervention might prove counterproductive if bondholders fear that big purchases by the funds are merely pushing other investors back in the queue of creditors. For the euro zone to find its way through this crisis, intervention in bond markets needs to be combined with a bolder overhaul of the system itself. As we have argued, that means a detailed plan to build a banking union and to mutualise some debt. 
That sinking feeling 
The reassurances from Berlin are that, at the last hour, Germany will do what it takes. But by sticking to half-measures and emphasising the limits to Germany's ability to help, Chancellor Angela Merkel is sowing doubt and deepening the economic pain. Each quick fix that is hailed as a victory before being swept aside saps the credibility which will be necessary to push through real reforms. This lets politics drift. France's new president, Francois Hollande, is calling for cross-border help, even as he pursues policies (see next leader) guaranteed to scare Mrs Merkel's electorate into thinking that Germany is being tricked into paying for other countries' laxity. In Italy Mario Monti is meeting ever more public resistance to his reforms. 
In theory all this is manageable. In practice it is hard to see how the euro zone's leaders can reconcile the months of political wrangling ahead with investors' tendency to flight.","Europe is trying to deal with the euro crisis one problem at a time . That approach is doomed to fail

GREECE has given birth to its first proper coalition government in modern times. The three-party deal, routine by north European standards, emerged smoothly after just 48 hours of negotiations. Antonis Samaras, the centre-right New Democracy leader, was sworn in as prime minister pledging to ""give stability and hope"" to Greeks enduring the deepest recession in the country's modern history. It is a pledge he cannot fulfil without lots of help from the rest of Europe. 
That Greece has a government at all is due to New Democracy's better-than-expected performance in the June 17th election. It won 29.7% of the vote to 26.9% for Syriza, the radical left coalition led by 37-year-old Alexis Tsipras, a brash new political star whose claim that Greece could renegotiate its latest EUR 130 billion ($164 billion) bail-out yet stay in the euro appealed to many voters. The PanHellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) finished a distant third with 12.3%. 
With 129 seats, New Democracy is much the biggest party in the 300-member parliament (thanks to an electoral law that gives the front-runner an extra 50 seats). By teaming up with Pasok's 33 members and another 17 from Democratic Left, it will have a comfortable majority of 179 seats. Syriza has 71 seats in an otherwise fragmented house. Independent Greeks, the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn and the Greek communist party each have a handful of deputies. 
Many held their noses as they voted for New Democracy. Mr Samaras is a political veteran with a reputation for nationalism and poor judgment. He is widely blamed for insisting on a first, inconclusive election in May, rather than allowing Lucas Papademos, a technocratic prime minister, to govern for longer. But fear that Greece might be flung out of the euro caused voters to rally to New Democracy, including many who normally support other parties. 
To his credit, Mr Samaras was set to make two bold decisions ahead of a euro group meeting of finance ministers on June 21st. Vassilios Rapanos, a banker and public-finance specialist, will be finance minister. And Yannis Stournaras, the caretaker development minister, will stay on. Both men are technocrats with socialist connections; they were part of an efficient team that took Greece into the euro in 2002, an optimistic time marked by economic liberalisation and growth rates of more than 4% a year. Their appointment also signals a willingness to weaken Greece's clientilist political system. 
The make-up of the rest of the cabinet is unclear. So tough were the discussions between Mr Samaras's team and that of Evangelos Venizelos, the Pasok leader, that the first cabinet meeting was postponed. Fotis Kouvelis, boss of the Democratic Left, the junior coalition partner, said he would support New Democracy; his central committee has decided against seeking any cabinet posts. 
Once his government is in place, Mr Samaras must parley with Greece's paymasters in Brussels and Berlin. He will seek approval for a few tweaks such as a two-year delay until 2016 of EUR 11.7 billion of spending cuts and the sacking of 150,000 public-sector workers demanded by international lenders. Mr Samaras also wants to increase social spending to ease the pain of a deeper-than-expected recession. GDP is set to shrink this year by up to 7%, against earlier forecasts of 4.5%. 
But his room for manoeuvre is limited. Without its next slice of bail-out money, the new government would be unable to pay pensions and public-sector salaries at the end of July. And the Greek economy is desperate for a bit of stability. More than EUR 10 billion has been taken out of Greek banks since the May election; even profitable companies are denied loans because of a credit squeeze; and three international export-insurance agencies are refusing to provide cover for products sold to Greece. 
The coalition wants to govern for exactly 24 months, until the European Parliament elections in mid-2014. It might manage that. Mr Venizelos, a former finance minister who clashed with Greece's creditors, is reinventing himself as a pro-European statesman. He needs time to rebuild his party after two disastrous performances at the polls. Mr Kouvelis, the first leftist to play a big role in government, has little reason to shake things up. Another election might bring Mr Tsipras to power; Syriza might even gain the 35% of the vote needed for a parliamentary majority. That prospect should be enough to ensure the loyalty of Mr Samaras's partners. 
Mr Samaras's belief that two years will give him enough time to turn the economy around is more questionable. Funds to promote growth are already available: as much as EUR 14 billion from European Union structural funds for infrastructure and other big modernisation projects, and perhaps EUR 2 billion-3 billion from the European Investment Bank. The previous Pasok government could get only a trickle of funding from Brussels thanks to the inefficiency of its bureaucrats. Mr Rapanos and Mr Stournaras should do better, say their conservative backers. 
But the question hanging over Greece is not whether the government can unlock more official funding, but whether it can entice private capital. The big fear for foreign investors is a euro break-up, not just in Greece but elsewhere. Mr Samaras can hasten that outcome, but he cannot prevent it. Until a lasting solution is found to the euro crisis, Greece will be in limbo.","At last there is a Greek government , but it faces immense problems

IN THESE times of tribulation for the euro, Germany offers a prophecy. One day, when the euro zone has got beyond the wilderness of austerity and structural reform, it will be rewarded with prosperity. Europe will have worked off its debt and become more competitive. Markets will see that the real problems of the world economy lie in debt-laden America and Japan. 
The more the outside world criticises Germany, the more fervently senior German officials cling to this vision. Others have reason for doubt. In the third year of the euro crisis things are getting worse. Even good news brings no relief. Greece avoided the meltdown that an election victory by the anti-austerity Syriza party might have brought. But the new government of Antonis Samaras, leader of the centre-right New Democracy party, may not be able to halt Greece's death spiral. An agreement to give Spain up to EUR 100 billion ($127 billion) of euro-zone loans to recapitalise its banks did not stop the slide for long. Markets jumped at hints from the G20 summit that European rescue funds might start buying Spanish and Italian bonds, but for how long? 
All along the fundamental doubt remains. What stands behind the euro: Germany, the European Central Bank (ECB), or nothing at all? Investors in euro-zone bonds want to be sure they will be repaid, and in euros, not devalued drachmas, liras or pesetas. National currencies are backed by national treasuries with the power to tax and central banks with the power to print money. But the euro is a single currency without a single government, and the ECB cannot lend to sovereigns. 
For Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, the answer is to show that the single currency is backed by the commitment of all members to budget discipline and structural reform. Cutting debt and boosting competitiveness will, in time, win back market confidence, she says. Quick-fix solutions are ephemeral and often counterproductive. The ECB's EUR 1 trillion of cheap loans for banks was soon exhausted. Fiscal stimulus only adds debt. Enlarging the euro zone's rescue funds raises questions about the creditworthiness of even its most solid backers. 
Almost everybody disdains quick fixes. But they favour other routes to the promised land. France and others want some mutualisation of liabilities: a ""fiscal union"" through joint Eurobonds to cut troubled countries' borrowing costs, a ""banking union"" to be a joint backstop for the banks. Either of these (preferably backed by the ECB as lender of last resort) could create a European lifesaver to prevent weak sovereigns and weak banks from drowning each other. 
The germ of a banking union is the most likely outcome of the European summit on June 28th and 29th. This is partly because Spanish banks are the biggest threat to the euro right now. The European Commission is already working on essential elements, such as a system to wind up failed banks. Banking integration presents fewer political and legal problems if banks (not taxpayers) pay into a European fund to provide deposit guarantees. 
But that may not be enough to stop a Europe-wide run on banks by depositors who fear a currency break-up. Only the full power of sovereigns and central banks can do that. Germany is right to say that, in the end, banking union is the start of fiscal union. Germany may be strong, says Mrs Merkel, but not strong enough to stand behind trillions of euros' worth of European debt. For her, market pressure is the best incentive for belated reforms. After all, it was the decade of cheap credit when financial markets barely distinguished between Greek and German bonds--behaving as if Eurobonds already existed--that created the imbalances that lie behind the crisis. 
Germany's price for any mutualisation of liabilities is greater economic and political integration. Do Europeans want a banking union? Better to start with a strong European supervisor to stop the farce of national regulators applying stress tests that hide more than they reveal. Do Europeans want fiscal union? Well, first they should reduce debt levels, and get fit enough to keep up with Germany. In short, European countries must surrender much economic sovereignty before Germans will trust them to share their bank account. The Germans are already debating the future of the European project, including how to make it more democratically accountable. Others would be wise to think beyond just begging them for more unconditional support. 
Time is running short 
For the moment, Germany will provide no more than limited remedies that, at best, buy more time. There is much to be said for its belief in fiscal stability and reform, but playing for time may do more harm than good. The countries of the euro zone are not going through a normal adjustment. Their crisis is existential. Delay also raises the cost of salvaging the single currency (if Greece is to stay in the euro it will surely need yet another bail-out or debt-restructuring). Procrastination saps confidence in the euro. Loss of confidence, in turn, weakens growth in the core and deepens recession in the periphery. 
All this makes it harder for countries to balance their books, antagonises those who must endure austerity and exasperates those who must provide more credit. A chronic crisis, moreover, erodes citizens' belief in the European project, and thus their readiness to accept the integration that is needed to save it. 
Austerity and structural reforms will be of little help unless confidence returns. That requires an unequivocal, if limited, sharing of liabilities. The proposal by Germany's council of economic advisers to pool part of the euro zone's stock of debt is a good start. Mrs Merkel is understandably worried about the risks her country would be taking on. But if she does not show faith in the euro's future, neither will the markets.","The promised land that lies ahead keeps receding into the distance 
IN THESE times of tribulation for the euro, Germany offers a prophecy. One day, when the euro zone has got beyond the wilderness of austerity and structural reform, it will be rewarded with prosperity. Europe will have worked off its debt and become more competitive. Markets will see that the real problems of the world economy lie in debt-laden America and Japan. 
The more the outside world criticises Germany, the more fervently senior German officials cling to this vision. Others have reason for doubt. In the third year of the euro crisis things are getting worse. Even good news brings no relief. Greece avoided the meltdown that an election victory by the anti-austerity Syriza party might have brought. But the new government of Antonis Samaras, leader of the centre-right New Democracy party, may not be able to halt Greece's death spiral. An agreement to give Spain up to EUR 100 billion ($127 billion) of euro-zone loans to recapitalise its banks did not stop the slide for long. Markets jumped at hints from the G20 summit that European rescue funds might start buying Spanish and Italian bonds, but for how long? 
All along the fundamental doubt remains. What stands behind the euro: Germany, the European Central Bank (ECB), or nothing at all? Investors in euro-zone bonds want to be sure they will be repaid, and in euros, not devalued drachmas, liras or pesetas. National currencies are backed by national treasuries with the power to tax and central banks with the power to print money. But the euro is a single currency without a single government, and the ECB cannot lend to sovereigns. 
For Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, the answer is to show that the single currency is backed by the commitment of all members to budget discipline and structural reform. Cutting debt and boosting competitiveness will, in time, win back market confidence, she says. Quick-fix solutions are ephemeral and often counterproductive. The ECB's EUR 1 trillion of cheap loans for banks was soon exhausted. Fiscal stimulus only adds debt. Enlarging the euro zone's rescue funds raises questions about the creditworthiness of even its most solid backers. 
Almost everybody disdains quick fixes. But they favour other routes to the promised land. France and others want some mutualisation of liabilities: a ""fiscal union"" through joint Eurobonds to cut troubled countries' borrowing costs, a ""banking union"" to be a joint backstop for the banks. Either of these (preferably backed by the ECB as lender of last resort) could create a European lifesaver to prevent weak sovereigns and weak banks from drowning each other. 
The germ of a banking union is the most likely outcome of the European summit on June 28th and 29th. This is partly because Spanish banks are the biggest threat to the euro right now. The European Commission is already working on essential elements, such as a system to wind up failed banks. Banking integration presents fewer political and legal problems if banks (not taxpayers) pay into a European fund to provide deposit guarantees. 
But that may not be enough to stop a Europe-wide run on banks by depositors who fear a currency break-up. Only the full power of sovereigns and central banks can do that. Germany is right to say that, in the end, banking union is the start of fiscal union. Germany may be strong, says Mrs Merkel, but not strong enough to stand behind trillions of euros' worth of European debt. For her, market pressure is the best incentive for belated reforms. After all, it was the decade of cheap credit when financial markets barely distinguished between Greek and German bonds--behaving as if Eurobonds already existed--that created the imbalances that lie behind the crisis. 
Germany's price for any mutualisation of liabilities is greater economic and political integration. Do Europeans want a banking union? Better to start with a strong European supervisor to stop the farce of national regulators applying stress tests that hide more than they reveal. Do Europeans want fiscal union? Well, first they should reduce debt levels, and get fit enough to keep up with Germany. In short, European countries must surrender much economic sovereignty before Germans will trust them to share their bank account. The Germans are already debating the future of the European project, including how to make it more democratically accountable. Others would be wise to think beyond just begging them for more unconditional support. 
Time is running short 
For the moment, Germany will provide no more than limited remedies that, at best, buy more time. There is much to be said for its belief in fiscal stability and reform, but playing for time may do more harm than good. The countries of the euro zone are not going through a normal adjustment. Their crisis is existential. Delay also raises the cost of salvaging the single currency (if Greece is to stay in the euro it will surely need yet another bail-out or debt-restructuring). Procrastination saps confidence in the euro. Loss of confidence, in turn, weakens growth in the core and deepens recession in the periphery. 
All this makes it harder for countries to balance their books, antagonises those who must endure austerity and exasperates those who must provide more credit. A chronic crisis, moreover, erodes citizens' belief in the European project, and thus their readiness to accept the integration that is needed to save it. 
Austerity and structural reforms will be of little help unless confidence returns. That requires an unequivocal, if limited, sharing of liabilities. The proposal by Germany's council of economic advisers to pool part of the euro zone's stock of debt is a good start. Mrs Merkel is understandably worried about the risks her country would be taking on. But if she does not show faith in the euro's future, neither will the markets.",350,Greece,cb-350-2,,False,,0,True

Should its latest plans for making EUR 14.5 billion ($17.6 billion) of spending cuts over the coming two years be judged unrealistic, the next EUR 31.2 billion loan tranche will again be held back. 
If that happens, Greece would be unable to finish recapitalising its big banks. Without credit, the economy will seize up. Pensions and public-sector salaries would not be paid. A ""Grexit"" from the euro could occur within weeks. The worry for Greeks is that with Spain and Italy coming under attack in financial markets, some euro-zone members may be tempted to sacrifice Greece. 
Two previous Athens governments have failed dismally since mid-2010 to implement reforms agreed on with the Commission and the IMF, thanks to widespread official corruption and a lack of political will. Mr Samaras opposed the first Greek bail-out while in opposition; he still wants, at some point, to renegotiate parts of the second. 
Yannis Stournaras, the technocratic finance minister, has the difficult job of persuading Greece's creditors that his government can do better than its predecessors. The troika of officials from the EU, IMF and European Central Bank were especially dismayed by a looming EUR 3 billion gap in privatisation revenues this year, as well as by the lack of progress in cutting jobs in the public sector. 
Just after the troika arrived, on July 25th, Mr Stournaras announced new bosses for the privatisation agency. And Antonis Manitakis, the public-administration minister, declared that five public-sector entities would be shut immediately and another 16 merged. Their 5,250 employees would retire or be transferred to other jobs. That is still far short of the 15,000 dismissals in 2012 agreed to by the previous government. Annual savings would be a modest EUR 40m. Mr Manitakis promises another 180 mergers, with much bigger savings, within weeks. The civil service union is already threatening to strike. Will Mr Barroso and the troika think it is enough?","Greece has only a couple of weeks left to convince its creditors

BY LATE July Greece had completed only about 100 out of more than 300 reform benchmarks set by international lenders after their last visit to Athens in February. Two elections this year have not helped to speed things up. And despite two bail-outs since May 2010, left-of-centre politicians are still trying to dilute or delay a raft of fiscal and structural measures needed for Greece to stay in the euro zone and pull the economy out of a five-year slump. 
Take, for example, Evangelos Venizelos, leader of the PanHellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok), a junior partner in the six-week-old coalition government led by Antonis Samaras, the conservative prime minister (pictured left, with Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission). When he was finance minister, Mr Venizelos pushed through parliament a EUR 11.5 billion ($14.1 billion) package of spending cuts agreed upon in March as part of the second bail-out. They are to be implemented in 2013 and 2014 and the details are being worked out. Yet on July 29th Mr Venizelos, trying to rebuild Pasok's popularity with Greek voters, defiantly suggested the reforms be spread out over four years, not two (he later backtracked). 
Greece has legislated plenty of reforms but failed to implement many of them, say frustrated officials from the ""troika"" (the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank) responsible for overseeing the process. A former government adviser says: ""A huge amount of work has been done, yet almost nothing has actually been completed to the satisfaction of our partners."" 
The stakes are higher than ever. Greece will not receive any more rescue funding until the medium-term package is in place. Without that money, the government will run out of cash to pay pensions and public-sector salaries in September, if not sooner. A disorderly exit from the euro could follow within a few weeks, warned Yannis Stournaras, the finance minister. 
Greece has performed badly on many measures. On privatisation, the troika has set an ambitious goal of EUR 50 billion in revenues. But this year's target of EUR 3 billion has been slashed to EUR 300m. Only two disposals are likely to be completed by December: the state lottery and the former international broadcasting centre for the 2004 Athens Olympics, now a shopping mall. Almost 80 legislative and administrative measures will be needed before the next six deals can go ahead. 
Greece is supposed to raise EUR 19 billion in privatisation income by 2015, and the remaining EUR 31 billion over the following decade. Yet even if the deal pipeline is accelerated by the new chairman and chief executive of the Hellenic Asset Development Fund (TAIPED), the privatisation agency, appointed last month by the coalition government, few investors are likely to appear until it becomes clear whether Greece will stay in the euro zone. 
An overhaul of the tax administration, including closures and mergers of 200 regional tax offices, was due to be completed in June. Little progress has been made, and no new deadline has been set. Corruption among tax inspectors is rife, according to the state auditor. Only EUR 10 billion of some EUR 40 billion of outstanding taxes can be collected, a government adviser says. Officials are likely to keep reforms on a back burner, fearing that revenues would plunge if they attempt to transfer or sack taxmen. Several hundred big tax evaders have been identified, yet so far none has been convicted or imprisoned. 
Piecemeal adoption of measures and failure to crack down on corruption have left the health system in disarray. Spending on prescription drugs has been reduced, but another EUR 1 billion (0.5% of GDP) of annual cuts have still to be made, as doctors and hospital procurement departments are reluctant to switch from expensive branded drugs to cheaper generic versions. Plans to reduce costs by merging or closing about one-third of state hospitals are running well behind schedule. 
Ready, aim, don't fire 
Last year's target of cutting 30,000 public-sector jobs and transferring workers to a strategic reserve on lower pay was missed by a wide margin. Following pressure from trade unions, fewer than 10,000 workers were sent to the reserve. The medium-term programme calls for shedding 150,000 public-sector jobs by 2015, but with unemployment already at 22.5% the government is trying to find other ways of reducing the payroll--for example, hiring one worker for every ten who retire or leave. This year's goal of 15,000 job reductions is unlikely to be achieved. 
Moves to give teeth to Greece's feeble competition agency have been delayed. As a result cartels still control prices of many consumer products, and prices are still rising slowly, even though the economy has shrunk by more than 13% in three years. Annual inflation was almost 3% last November, but had dropped to 1% in June. 
Corruption is one reason why Greece struggles to attract investors. (One local whistle-blower found an unexploded grenade on his car windscreen last month.) Another is poor legislation. Red tape is still a problem despite two new laws aimed at removing obstacles to investment. Yet more legislation to speed up ""fast-track"" investment is awaited. Greece, home of the marathon, badly needs to start sprinting.

THE woman was from Patmos. Her husband had lost his job and come back to the island to be with their two children and find work. After he failed and she fell ill with cancer, they ran out of money. The bank seized their house; they could not pay the electricity bill. She was ashamed, she told Lazaros Papageorgiou, of Artos-Drassi, a charity in Athens that feeds the poor. Six months ago she would never have dreamt she would come to depend on charity, but today she needed help. 
Under the brilliant blue Athenian sky, anger has given way to weariness and gloom. Outside Greece's parliament, in Syntagma Square, marchers once braved tear-gas and protesters thronged a tented city. But it is quiet now. Summer has lured Greeks with money to the islands and the beaches; the growing numbers who are without it have gone home instead. On Patission Avenue, about 20 minutes away, shop after shop is barred. Nobody knows how many of them will open again when Athenians return. 
The only certainty is that life will get harder. Last week the troika was in town. Representing the IMF, the European Central Bank and the European Commission, it must judge whether Greece should receive the next EUR 31.5 billion ($39 billion) of rescue funds, which the government will mostly spend on recapitalising the banks and paying debt interest. To qualify, Greece will have to slash its budget deficit by a total of EUR 11.5 billion in 2013 and 2014. Failure would mean being cut off from European funds, leaving the government with no choice but to print its own currency. In effect, Greece would be out of the euro. 
The troika left Athens on August 5th reporting ""good progress"" and saying that it would be back in September to finish its work. A bond payment falling due before then will be covered by short-term debt. 
However, the reality is as bleak as the communique is bland. True, the economy is rebalancing. Basic wages in Greece have fallen by 22%, there has been fiscal consolidation and the private-sector labour market has been reformed. Yet the public sector has not shed any of the 100,000 jobs it gained in a splurge of spending before the crunch. The target for privatisation this year has been cut from EUR 3 billion to EUR 300m. Unemployment is over 22% and climbing month by miserable month. And the economy, which has seen only one quarter's growth since the end of 2008, is expected to shrink by more than 7% in 2012. 
The glimmer of good news is that the mercurial prime minister, Antonis Samaras, who has at times rejected the austerity deal with the rest of the euro zone, now seems fully behind it. As if pinned to the spot by his impaired vision, the result of a detached retina, he seems to recognise that his future is now based on Greece staying in the euro. That means convincing a sceptical euro zone that Greece really wants to change. ""We will prove that we mean business, that we are dedicated and mean to implement our plan,"" he declares. 
Credibility depends in turn on the finance minister, Yannis Stournaras, a respected economist, whose technical expertise might just alloy with Mr Samaras's political guile to create a machine that can get things done. The two men understand that not a euro of fresh money is to be had right now--indeed, they must know that plenty of euro-zone countries would like nothing more than to throw Greece out. 
Their strategy is to keep that threat at bay and ensure that Greece is still at the table when the euro crisis comes to a head. Greece is at its most vulnerable while its exit could serve as an example to show that a bailed-out economy will not enjoy a blank cheque. Mr Samaras is betting that if the euro crisis abates, then this calculation will change. Once the euro is safe, the rest of the euro zone might just conclude that Greece will cause less trouble for the European Union inside the euro zone than outside, where it might sink into the criminal swamp of the Balkans. 
Yet much could go wrong. Mr Samaras's coalition is vulnerable. Even if he commands his own New Democracy party, the PanHellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) has dramatically lost support and is divided under its leader, Evangelos Venizelos. And the hard-left junior partner is deeply uncomfortable with the austerity it is being asked to endorse. 
If the coalition holds, its policies may not be implemented. Cuts to pensions and public-sector wages, accounting for two-thirds of government spending after interest payments, will stir up resentment. Because the private sector has shrunk, many families depend upon a pension or public-sector wage to put bread on the table. Even if the prime minister is determined to prove that Greece has changed, many politicians, with an eye to what comes next, will seek to protect their clients. 
Most worrying of all is the economy's inability to grow. For as long as the threat of a euro exit hangs over Greece, credit will be scarce, foreign capital will stay away and investment will stall. As fiscal tightening forces down wages and demand, so the economy will shrink. Even if the government manages to cut planned spending and introduce a new property tax as promised, a shrinking economy will make it miss its targets--opening the door to euro-zone demands for yet more austerity. 
Recession will eat away at the centre parties in Greece and at the nation's institutions. Syriza, an opposition hard-left alliance, stands every chance of gaining support. So does the far right, including the neo-fascist Golden Dawn, which has sympathisers among the police. As you gaze out at parliament from the office of the finance minister, the outer glass pocked by a bullet-hole from some forgotten demo in Syntagma Square below, the grim prospect is of a hard-left government vying against hard-right law-enforcement. Already, large Greek firms are guarding against a Syriza victory by exploring how to move their listings abroad. Who can blame them?","The new government 's task is gargantuan

The number of American car dealerships rebounded in 2011, after falling sharply during the recession. 
Road work ahead 
Brazil's president, Dilma Rousseff, announced plans to invite private firms to bid to build and operate roads and railways. The government hopes they will invest $66 billion, as well as improving efficiency and cutting business costs. Meanwhile, a federal court ordered work to stop on a controversial hydroelectric dam in the Amazon, saying local people had not been properly consulted. 
Fernando de la Rua went on trial on charges that when Argentina's president from 1999 to 2001 he and several other officials bribed four senators to vote for a labour-market reform, which was part of an IMF-backed deflationary programme. Mr de la Rua denied the charges. 
Workers on the Buenos Aires metro ended a disruptive ten-day strike, but disagreements continued between the city's mayor, Mauricio Macri, and Argentina's president, Cristina Fernandez, as to who is responsible for the metro and who should finance the workers' 23% pay rise. 
Devastation in the mountains 
More than 300 people died in two earthquakes in Iran's north-western province of East Azerbaijan. At least 3,000 people were injured, and some 20 villages in the mountainous region were destroyed. 
Israel's prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, and its defence minister, Ehud Barak, appeared to move closer to taking military action against Iran over the country's nuclear programme. Leon Panetta, America's defence secretary, played down the reports. 
Fighting intensified in Syria's capital, Damascus, and its second city Aleppo. The former prime minister, Riyad Hijab, who fled the country on August 6th, said that President Bashar Assad's regime was collapsing. A UN report into the Houla massacre in May found that war crimes had been committed by government and opposition forces. 
Egypt's president, Muhammad Morsi, purged the upper ranks of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces--the collection of senior generals that has controlled the country for decades. Mr Morsi replaced long-serving defence minister, Field-Marshal Muhammad Hussein Tantawi, with a former intelligence chief, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. 
Ten people were killed in clashes between rival trade unions at a mine owned by Lonmin, a platinum producer, near Johannesburg in South Africa. Thousands were protesting over poor working conditions and wages in the latest of a series of strikes to hit the country's mining industry. 
Island hopping 
Japanese police arrested 14 activists from China, Hong Kong and Macau who had sailed to disputed islands claimed by China, Taiwan and Japan, which controls them. Five of the group were arrested on one of the islands, having swum ashore. The islands are known as the Senkakus in Japanese, and as the Diaoyus in Chinese. 
Meanwhile, a group of South Korean activists completed a 220km relay swim to another group of disputed islands, controlled by South Korea but claimed by Japan. The swim followed the first ever visit of a South Korean president to the islands, known as Dokdo in Korean and Takeshima in Japanese. 
In Japan two cabinet ministers visited Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo to mark the anniversary of the end of the second world war on August 15th. The shrine is dedicated to Japan's war dead, including war criminals, and is seen by China, South Korea and others as a reminder of Japan's military past. Yoshihiko Noda, the prime minister, had urged the ministers not to visit the shrine. 
Fifty people were killed and more than 130 wounded in a series of bombings in Afghanistan. The attacks took place near the Iranian border and in the northern province of Kunduz. Many of the victims were people shopping ahead of celebrations to mark the end of Ramadan. 
Australia's prime minister, Julia Gillard, announced that offshore detention centres to process ""boat people"" seeking asylum are to be re-established in Papua New Guinea and Nauru, four years after they were closed by her own party.

Months of tension between police and young people in the French city of Amiens led to violence when dozens of youths clashed with riot officers. A primary school and public gym were set on fire, 17 police officers were injured and drivers were dragged from their cars. 
Antonis Samaras, the Greek prime minister, announced plans for his first meetings with euro-zone leaders since taking office. Having recovered from eye surgery which prevented him from flying, Mr Samaras will fly to Berlin and Paris to ask for more time to push through his austerity programme. 
Rebels from the Kurdistan Workers' Party in Turkey kidnapped Huseyin Aygun, the deputy leader of the main opposition party, as he toured the mainly Kurdish eastern province of Tunceli.

EUROPE'S August doldrums seem to have reached even the crisis-prone euro zone. A declaration at the end of July by Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank (ECB), that he would do ""whatever it takes"" to preserve the euro has helped push down borrowing costs in Italy and Spain, the two largest troubled countries. The prime minister of Greece, Antonis Samaras, is visiting his counterparts in Berlin and Paris to ask for more time to push through budget cuts but not, he says, for more bail-out money. A damaging row between Greece and its creditors is likely to be avoided for a few more weeks--at least until the ""troika"" of the ECB, the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund decides whether to approve the next tranche of rescue money. 
Yet it would be foolish to bet on an extended lull in the euro crisis. The Greek economy is in deep recession, and Germany seems adamant that no more money will be made available to help it out. Germany's central bank remains opposed to the ECB buying bonds in order to cap the borrowing costs of Spain and Italy. To these familiar concerns is added a newish one: that efforts to shore up the euro might be scotched not in Berlin but in another austerity-minded northern capital: Helsinki. 
Last month Finland's finance minister, Jutta Urpilainen, caused a stir when she said that her country would ""not hang itself to the euro at any cost"" and that it would not be prepared to shoulder the debts of other states. More recently the foreign minister, Erkki Tuomioja, revealed that Finland had made contingency plans for the break-up of the euro. Uniquely, Finland has demanded collateral for its part of Greece's second bail-out and for the funds it underwrites to support Spain's crippled banks. If a grand bargain on the mutualisation of debts is ultimately required to keep the euro together, the Finns could block it. A few observers even think a ""Fixit"" (a Finnish exit from the euro) is more likely than a Grexit. 
Fix it or Fixit? 
It is true that Finland has the most to lose from a pooling of sovereign debts. The IMF reckons the combined gross debt of euro-area countries will peak at 91% of GDP next year, when the ratio in Finland will be just 53%, the lowest of any euro-zone country bar Estonia and Luxembourg. Finland's borrowing costs are roughly the same as Germany's. After Japan and Italy, Finland has the most rapidly ageing population among rich countries, so it is wary of adding to its debts. And having recovered from a nasty banking crisis in the 1990s through their own efforts (albeit with a favourable tailwind from the world economy), Finns are hostile to bail-outs. 
Finland might also have least to gain from keeping the euro show on the road. Its banks have little direct exposure to the euro zone's troubled periphery, in contrast to those of France and Germany. Its economy is less integrated into the euro zone than those of other northern bail-out grumps, such as the Netherlands. Only 31% of Finnish exports go to other euro-zone countries, a smaller share than is sold by Eurosceptic Britain. Five of Finland's seven biggest foreign markets lie outside the euro zone. Its biggest supplier is Russia and its largest single customer is Sweden, whose economy is growing more quickly than Finland's (see page 
). Norway is also doing better. Finns fed up with being asked to stump up for Greece and the rest cannot have missed that their nearest neighbours seem to be thriving outside the euro. 
The odds are still that the Finns could be dragged by the Germans into some form of grand bargain that involves pooling debts. Public opinion is still in favour of staying in the euro, not least because of the deep-rooted fear of being pushed back into Russia's orbit. But Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, should treat the furious Finns as yet another sign that her gradualist approach to the euro crisis is not working. 
The longer Mrs Merkel waits to unveil a grand bargain, the more Europe seems to come apart (the Dutch are also getting crankier about bail-outs). Meanwhile, the costs of a bail-out are rising, especially as the austerity programmes Mrs Merkel favours shrink Europe's economies. Could the Finns still be bullied to stay in if the euro zone's overall debt ratio jumped above 100% of GDP? Or a coalition led by the ultra-right True Finn party came to power in Helsinki? These questions are only going to get harder for Mrs Merkel.","Finland has least to gain from a grand bargain to save the euro . That could prove a big problem

WILL Spain be next? The Spanish government is trying to put off a full bail-out, but it was dealt a blow on August 28th when the regional government of Catalonia said it needed a EUR 5 billion ($6.3 billion) rescue by the Madrid government. 
First it was the banks that needed help, now Spain's second-most populous region. Bailing out Catalonia may well cost more than the requested EUR 5 billion: it may need several billion just to cover the budget deficit until the end of 2014. A government liquidity fund has EUR 18 billion in it, but Valencia, Murcia and other regions that are excluded from the markets are also queuing up for money. Spain can top up the fund by borrowing more--but only at punishing rates. The yield on ten-year bonds has stayed above 6% for more than three months. 
Not surprisingly, many think Spain will eventually need a sovereign bail-out. In public, officials claim this is not being negotiated. European leaders instead praise the reforms and austerity of Mariano Rajoy, the prime minister. Yet Spain is plunging into a double-dip recession. The economy shrank at an annual rate of 1.3% in the second quarter. Bank deposits dropped by 4.7% in July. Consumption is falling at an annual rate of 3.9%. Unemployment remains stuck at around 25% of the workforce (and 50% for youths). 
Meanwhile in bailed-out Greece the government was relieved when the first trip abroad of Antonis Samaras as prime minister went better than expected. It helped that in Berlin Mr Samaras swallowed a sizeable chunk of humble pie before Chancellor Angela Merkel. Things were easier in Paris where Francois Hollande, the French president, made reassuring noises about Greece's chances of remaining in the euro zone. 
Even so, in both capitals, Mr Samaras's talk of needing ""a breathing space"" of two more years until 2016 to turn round the economy while completing reforms agreed with the European Union and IMF, was quickly dismissed. The message from Mrs Merkel and Mr Hollande was that Athens must deliver on fiscal austerity, privatisation and tax collection before asking its international creditors for more favours. 
The task ahead looks daunting. Greece had planned to put together the new EUR 11.5 billion package of spending cuts by the end of July. Yet the finance ministry team was still battling to finish the final draft at the end of August, even as officials from the EU and IMF were flying in to make their assessment. The choices are tough. On August 27th, Yannis Stournaras, the finance minister, failed to win agreement from the Greek military's top brass and police chiefs for a 5-6% cut in officers' salaries. Until now the guardians of the Greek state have kept almost all their perks. If his opponents refuse to back down, Mr Stournaras will be forced to make deeper cuts in pensions, which have already been pared back by more than 20% in the past two years. 
More hurdles lie ahead before Greece can draw the next EUR 32 billion of its second bail-out loan to finance the budget and to recapitalise its troubled banks. The loan tranche was due to be paid in June but will now not be transferred before late October. A favourable report from the ""troika"" of officials from the EU, IMF and European Central Bank is needed; Greece's parliament must approve the new package; and finance ministers of euro-zone countries must give the go-ahead, before the loan is endorsed by EU leaders at their summit in October. With barely enough cash in its coffers to pay pensions and public-sector salaries at the end of August, the finance ministry may raise short-term funds by selling extra treasury bills to the banks, squeezing cash-strapped local companies even harder.

THE sugar-rush brought on by the European Central Bank's pledge to intervene in bond markets to help troubled euro-zone countries--some diplomats call it ""Mario Draghi's ice cream""--was bound to fade at some point. But nobody expected it to fade quite so suddenly this week. 
Anti-austerity protests in Spain and Greece, uncertainty over their bail-out terms, the resurgence of Catalan secessionism, the likely departure of Mario Monti as Italy's prime minister next year, obstacles to creating a credible banking union (see Charlemagne) and a darkening economic outlook all combined to dispel hope that the euro zone was out of the woods. Spanish and Italian bond yields shot back up and European stockmarkets fell. 
The summer's panic about the euro zone had been assuaged by the ECB's announcement of plans to buy unlimited amounts of short-dated debt of vulnerable countries such as Spain and Italy. This backstop would depend on their governments first seeking assistance from the euro-zone rescue funds, and then submitting to a formal, externally monitored reform programme. 
Both out of national pride, and because Germany does not want Spain to ask for more money, the Spanish government has hesitated about taking the ECB's outstretched hand. Behind European officials' public praise for the deficit-cutting measures taken by Mariano Rajoy, the Spanish prime minister, there is dismay over his ineptness in handling the crisis, not least the ever-changing estimates of the money needed to recapitalise Spain's banks. 
As The Economist went to press, Mr Rajoy was due to unveil a budget for next year and a new set of structural reforms, as well as the results of a detailed assessment of Spain's bank-recapitalisation needs. These have been co-ordinated with European officials, perhaps to allow Mr Rajoy to claim that Spain will face no fresh conditions beyond the ones he has announced himself. But the gains from any such choreography have been offset by clashes on the streets of Madrid during anti-austerity protests and by the resurgence of Catalan nationalism. Mr Rajoy's attempt to rein in spending in Spain's autonomous regions has prompted Artur Mas, the president of Catalonia, to call an election on November 25th, after his demand for more tax autonomy was rebuffed. Mr Mas is talking of holding a referendum on independence, which could throw Spain into a constitutional crisis on top of its economic one. 
If Mr Rajoy's stock in European capitals has fallen, that of Antonis Samaras, the Greek prime minister, has risen. Once reviled for resisting austerity while in opposition, the conservative leader has, since his election in June, impressed fellow leaders with a new-found zeal for fiscal discipline and reform. Yet it will be hard to reconcile Mr Samaras's call for an extra two years to bring down the deficit with creditors' refusal to lend him more money, in effect a third bail-out. 
Mr Samaras is caught between the rescuers' demands for more spending cuts and boiling anger on the streets. Police fired tear gas at hooded protesters hurling petrol bombs on September 26th, the day of a general strike, while tens of thousands of demonstrators outside the Greek parliament shouted ""EU, IMF Out!"". European officials say much now depends on whether, after some massaging of Greece's figures, the IMF can be cajoled into declaring its gargantuan debt to be ""sustainable"". The fund, for its part, is privately urging euro-zone countries to write off some of their loans to Greece, but that is unlikely until after Germany's election next year. 
In Italy there is nervousness about the course of still-fragile reforms after the technocratic prime minister, Mario Monti, declared that he would not seek to stay in office beyond general elections due next spring. Mr Monti told CNN: ""I think it's important that the whole political game resumes in Italy, hopefully with a higher degree of responsibility and maturity."" Given Italy's politics, and the reforms that Italy still has to undertake, that is asking a lot. 
Confidence in the future of the euro is hardly being helped by signs that Germany and other creditor countries are backtracking on last June's summit deal to create a new euro-zone bank supervisor and, thereafter, to recapitalise troubled banks directly, in countries such as Spain and Italy, with money from a euro-zone rescue fund.

PROTESTERS in wheelchairs jeered and whistled as officials from the ""troika""--the European Commission, the IMF and the European Central Bank--arrived at the labour ministry on October 2nd to press for yet more public-expenditure cuts. Beleaguered Greeks are set to endure a sixth year of recession in 2013. Greek budget planners forecast a 3.8-4% contraction, the IMF a more pessimistic 5%. 
Yannis Stournaras, the finance minister, is under huge pressure to find an extra EUR 2 billion ($2.6 billion) of last-minute savings to appease the troika. Antonis Samaras, the centre-right prime minister, has an even harder task: persuading the coalition government's left-wing partners to accept tighter austerity. Both still sound confident a deal will be reached, though the timetable is likely to slip by a couple of weeks. 
Delays are not helpful for Mr Samaras. He has struggled during his first 100 days in office to keep his fragile coalition together while Mr Stournaras put together a EUR 13.5 billion austerity package in return for Greece's second EUR 130 billion bail-out. At the European summit on October 18th, the premier promised that he would seek a two-year extension until 2016 for implementing the new measures, thereby softening their impact. But European leaders will not grant Greece's request until the package has been agreed to with the troika and approved by the parliament in Athens. As a result Greece's next EUR 31.2 billion loan tranche, needed to recapitalise Greek banks so that they can start lending again, may not arrive until mid-November. 
The draft budget for 2013 already includes almost EUR 5 billion of cuts in pensions and public-sector salaries. Mr Stournaras hopes they are deep enough to achieve a primary budget surplus (before making debt repayments) of 1.4% of GDP. The troika chiefs are concerned tax revenues will be lower than forecast, and that the budget still leaves space for spending overruns by the defence and health ministries and in local government. 
Once again the government has shied away from sacking civil servants, despite a commitment to cut the bloated public-sector payroll by 150,000 over the next three years. Instead a total of 15,000 civil servants are to be eased out of their jobs, taking early retirement after a year on 75% of their previous salary. It is an unsatisfactory solution reached to accommodate Mr Samaras's coalition partners. 
Greece's official unemployment rate hit 24.4% in June, the EU's second-highest after Spain. The jobless rate among young Greeks rose to 55.4%, overtaking Spain's for the first time. Many private-sector workers, among them teachers and nurses, complain of not being paid regularly. ""In our profession, you can't not turn up for your shift,"" said Yolanda, an intensive-care nurse taking part in a protest outside the health ministry, which owes more than EUR 1 billion to private clinics for looking after state health-service patients. 
Public-sector trade unions are planning rolling strikes to protest against the latest wage cuts. Extremists are stirring up trouble. Opinion polls show that Golden Dawn, the far-right, anti-immigrant party that won seats in parliament for the first time at the June general election, has overtaken the socialists to occupy third place behind Mr Samaras's New Democracy and Syriza, the main opposition party. 
Golden Dawn is opening more offices in provincial towns to increase support among the unemployed young. Recognisable by their black T-shirts with a swastika-like emblem, its members are growing bolder in their harassment of immigrants. One group recently attacked several stallholders at an open-air market in Rafina, a port near Athens, after posing as plain-clothes police checking their permits. The police were not much help: as often happens with Golden Dawn's transgressions, sympathetic police officers looked the other way. 
Golden Dawn is not only stepping up its vigilantism and attacks against immigrants. Nikos Michaloliakos, the party leader, encourages displays designed to show Golden Dawn's social conscience, through public distributions of food parcels to the needy. But beneficiaries must first register with the party and prove they are Greek, by showing their identity cards. 
Nikos Dendias, the citizens' protection minister, says that Golden Dawn's storm-troopers will not be tolerated.

AS a stiff Aegean breeze fluttered the hair and lapels of Angela Merkel's pale-green jacket, one Greek reporter thought the outfit looked familiar. The German chancellor, making a one-day working visit to Athens, seemed to have picked the same jacket she wore in July while watching Germany trounce Greece 4-2 at this year's European football championship. Was Mrs Merkel planning to blast the Greeks again, this time for foot-dragging over economic reforms? 
Antonis Samaras, the prime minister, need not have worried. The European Union's toughest advocate of austerity gave a positive message, even if it was typically cautious. Mrs Merkel said she hoped and wished that Greece would remain a member of the euro zone, praised the country's progress with cutting expenditure and offered ""practical"" assistance with structural reforms, such as German expertise on overhauling tax administration and modernising local government. 
The chancellor's efforts to empathise with ordinary Greeks suffering the pain of a five-year recession were less successful. Hostile protesters outside parliament waved banners declaring ""Angela you are not welcome"". Alexis Tsipras, leader of the radical left-wing Syriza, now the main opposition party in parliament, joined the demonstration, railing against ""barbarous"" measures imposed by international lenders. Several municipal workers in full Nazi uniform, one of them with an Adolf Hitler moustache, drove a jeep flying swastika flags through a central boulevard as a tasteless reminder of the German occupation of Athens in the second world war. 
At one point, as riot police briefly used tear gas and stun grenades to block protesters from approaching the parliament building, it looked as if the visit might backfire disastrously. Shortly afterwards Karolos Papoulias, the plain-speaking Greek president, told Mrs Merkel the Greeks could not endure much more austerity. At a business gathering, Greece's senior industrialist complained about pressure on Athens to legislate a lower minimum monthly wage of EUR 580 ($747), aimed at making Greek companies more competitive, The chancellor said mildly she would consult the troika--the EU, European Central Bank, and IMF officials working with the Greek finance ministry on a new EUR 13.5 billion austerity package. 
Mr Samaras's approval rating at home may benefit from having hosted Europe's most powerful politician. Even so, he must wrap up the new economic package and persuade the socialist and left-wing party leaders, his coalition partners, to back it before the European summit on October 18th. He must also push the measures through parliament before Greece can draw down a long-overdue EUR 31.2 billion loan disbursement. For as long as government suppliers continue to be unpaid and banks undercapitalised, the cash-starved economy has no prospect of moving again. 
All the measures for 2013, amounting to EUR 9 billion of spending cuts, have been agreed on, including reductions in farmers' modest pensions and a new tonnage tax that patriotic shipowners whose vessels fly the Greek flag have unexpectedly agreed to pay. The gap for 2014 is ""fairly small"" and could be closed within days, barring an upset in talks with the troika, negotiators say. Greece should be able to balance its budget next year (before interest repayments). Yet if reforms start falling behind, talk of a ""Grexit"" from the euro will quickly resurface (see Charlemagne). 
Mr Samaras has come a long way since his centre-right New Democracy party scraped a narrow election victory in June. As opposition leader he denounced Greece's first bail-out in 2010. Advisers recall that afterwards Mrs Merkel and the troika berated him as an irresponsible southern European politician. Mr Samaras says Greece has turned a page; he chose to make his first trip abroad as prime minister to Berlin. His efforts may be starting to show results, but Mr Samaras still has a long road ahead.

The German chancellor , making a one - day working visit to Athens , seemed to have picked the same jacket she wore in July while watching Germany trounce Greece 4 - 2 at this year 's European football championship . Was Mrs Merkel planning to blast the Greeks again , this time for foot - dragging over economic reforms ? 
 Antonis Samaras need not have worried . The European Union 's toughest advocate of austerity gave a positive message , even if it was typically cautious . Mrs Merkel said she hoped and wished that Greece would remain a member of the euro zone , praised the country 's progress with cutting expenditure and offered "" practical "" assistance with structural reforms , such as German expertise on overhauling tax administration and modernising local government . 
 The chancellor 's efforts to empathise with ordinary Greeks suffering the pain of a five - year recession were less successful . Hostile protesters outside parliament waved banners declaring "" Angela you are not welcome "" . Alexis Tsipras , leader of the radical left - wing Syriza , now the main opposition party in parliament , joined the demonstration , railing against "" barbarous "" measures imposed by international lenders . Several municipal workers in full Nazi uniform , one of them with an Adolf Hitler moustache , drove a jeep flying swastika flags through a central boulevard as a tasteless reminder of the German occupation of Athens in the second world war . 
 At one point , as riot police briefly used tear gas and stun grenades to block protesters from approaching the parliament building , it looked as if the visit might backfire disastrously . Shortly afterwards Karolos Papoulias , the plain - speaking Greek president , told Mrs Merkel the Greeks could not endure much more austerity . At a business gathering , Greece 's senior industrialist complained about pressure on Athens to legislate a lower minimum monthly wage of EUR 580 ( $ 747 ) , aimed at making Greek companies more competitive , The chancellor said mildly she would consult the troika -- the EU , European Central Bank , and IMF officials working with the Greek finance ministry on a new EUR 13.5 billion austerity package . 
 Antonis Samaras's approval rating at home may benefit from having hosted Europe 's most powerful politician . Even so , Antonis Samaras must wrap up the new economic package and persuade the socialist and left - wing party leaders , Antonis Samaras's coalition partners , to back it before the European summit on October 18th . Antonis Samaras must also push the measures through parliament before Greece can draw down a long - overdue EUR 31.2 billion loan disbursement . For as long as government suppliers continue to be unpaid and banks undercapitalised , the cash - starved economy has no prospect of moving again . 
 All the measures for 2013 , amounting to EUR 9 billion of spending cuts , have been agreed on , including reductions in farmers ' modest pensions and a new tonnage tax that patriotic shipowners whose vessels fly the Greek flag have unexpectedly agreed to pay . The gap for 2014 is "" fairly small "" and could be closed within days , barring an upset in talks with the troika , negotiators say . Greece should be able to balance its budget next year ( before interest repayments ) . Yet if reforms start falling behind , talk of a "" Grexit "" from the euro will quickly resurface ( see Charlemagne ) . 
 Antonis Samaras has come a long way since Antonis Samaras's centre - right New Democracy party scraped a narrow election victory in June . As opposition leader Antonis Samaras denounced Greece 's first bail - out in 2010 . Advisers recall that afterwards Mrs Merkel and the troika berated Antonis Samaras as an irresponsible southern European politician . Antonis Samaras says Greece has turned a page ; Antonis Samaras chose to make Antonis Samaras's first trip abroad as prime minister to Berlin . Antonis Samaras's efforts may be starting to show results , but Antonis Samaras still has a long road ahead .

EUROPE'S charge-sheet against Antonis Samaras has lengthened with each turn of the Greek crisis. As leader of the-then opposition New Democracy, his refusal to support the first bail-out was seen as crippling. Later on, when he backed the unity government of Lucas Papademos, Mr Samaras was evasive about the second rescue. And by forcing early elections this year, he was blamed for opening the door to extremists of all stripes. Would it not be better, some thought, if Greece just left the euro? 
These days, as prime minister, Mr Samaras has started to command a measure of respect. After a meeting of euro-zone finance ministers this week, their president, Jean-Claude Juncker, went out of his way to praise the Greek leader: ""I am impressed...The Greek government is behaving, I do think, in an admirable way."" The visit to Athens this week by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, is the clearest signal yet that ""Grexit"" is no longer on her mind. One reason for embracing Mr Samaras is that he is the lesser evil, given the alternative of Alexis Tsipras, the radical leftist. Another is that keeping Greece in the euro is less awful than the chaos of Grexit. A third factor is that Mr Samaras seems to embrace Europe's terms for assistance. 
Eurocrats detect a seriousness of purpose about him, not least in appointing a respected economist, Yannis Stournaras, as finance minister. Then there is the factor that nobody will admit to: the policy of demanding harsh, front-loaded austerity has done unnecessary harm. Greece's recession this year will, yet again, be much deeper than forecast in April, and so will next year's, according to the IMF's latest figures. The euro zone would never stoop to the mea culpa offered by the IMF in its latest World Economic Outlook, which admits to underestimating badly the effect of austerity in reducing economic output. The euro zone can, after all, always blame the indolence of earlier Greek governments. Still, when confronted with deeper-than-expected recessions, Spain and Portugal won an extra year to meet their target of bringing budget deficits below 3% of GDP. 
Backed by the IMF's boss, Christine Lagarde, Greece may well be granted the extra two years it wants to meet its objective of achieving a large primary budget balance (ie, before interest payments) in 2014. A deal is likely to be reached in November. But first Greece must overcome the political deficit among euro-zone states: they may no longer want to push Greece out, but neither do they want to lend it more billions to keep it in. 
The conundrum breaks down into three parts. First, Greece must find EUR 13.5 billion ($17.4 billion) worth of savings and taxes in 2013 and 2014 to fill a gap made worse by the paralysis of two general elections this spring. Though it claims such budget-cutting is too much, too soon, Greece seems close to agreement with the troika (the IMF, the European Commission and the European Central Bank). Second, granting Greece a two-year reprieve means finding another EUR 10 billion to EUR 20 billion. Greece contends, implausibly, that it requires no additional loans from the euro zone, yet at the very least it needs the benevolence of the ECB. The bank would have to let Greece issue more short-term bills (most will end up on the ECB's balance-sheet via Greek banks) and agree to roll over a big chunk of Greek debt it holds. The ECB says a rollover would amount to illegal monetary financing. The third, and most serious problem is that the economic outlook for Greece is so poor that it will probably miss by a long shot the target of bringing debt down to 120% of GDP by 2020--the level set to justify a big haircut on private bondholders this year, and at which the economy is deemed able to survive without outside help. 
Greece thinks confidence would make its economy rebound. So the IMF, though sceptical of the degree of austerity demanded by the lords of the euro zone, now finds itself cast as the pitiless enforcer because of its reluctance to make the numbers fit the euro zone's limits. It has quietly pushed the euro zone to write off some of Greece's debt. Unless America can convince the IMF to go soft by accepting a rosier forecast, the Europeans may have to lend Greece more money (difficult), forgive some of its debt (almost impossible), or both. As always, they will try to fudge, at least until Germany's general election. One idea is to bring forward loan disbursements to keep Greece going, with the promise to look at any shortfall later on. Another is to declare Greece's long-term outlook too uncertain even for economists to predict; the euro zone could then pledge to deal with Greece's long-term debt if growth disappoints. And if the IMF refuses to keep lending to Greece, the euro zone could take on the burden on its own, ignoring the IMF, as it once did for Latvia. 
It all began in Athens 
Fate decreed that the euro-zone crisis should start in Greece. Lies about its public finances instilled the belief, particularly in Germany, that the euro's problem was excessive debt, and the solution was tough spending cuts. Yet the woes of Spain show that even running a budget surplus is no insurance against economic meltdown. As well as worrying about excessive austerity, the IMF's report raises concern about ""policy uncertainty""--including fears about the break-up of the euro--which makes a recession deeper and recovery slower. The IMF sets out a sensible to-do list, such as creating a banking union that includes a single euro-zone supervisor. These issues will be the focus of a European summit on October 18th-19th. 
Greece may be right in thinking that the biggest boost to its economy would be to end the ""drachma drama"". But restoring confidence must also involve creditor countries, above all Germany. The euro's problem is not just dysfunctional states, like Greece, but also a dysfunctional currency zone.","But the euro zone is still struggling to find a way of keeping Greece afloat

GREEK officials used to shrug off tax evasion as ""a national sport"". The finance ministry focused on raising revenue through indirect taxes such as value-added tax. Meanwhile income from a flourishing black economy financed the building of second homes on the islands, in Greece's Arcadian heartland or moved into bank accounts abroad. 
Those days are over. As Greece struggles to put its public finances in order, property owners have been hit by a volley of new taxes and holders of Swiss bank accounts are under uncomfortable scrutiny. Hot Doc, an investigative magazine, recently published a list of 2,000 Greeks who kept accounts at a Geneva branch of HSBC. 
Costas Vaxevanis, its editor, is adamant that to publish the list was in the public interest. (Many hard-up, law abiding Greeks would agree.) He argues that reforms of taxation have not gone far enough, despite recent efforts by the conservative-led coalition government of Antonis Samaras to pursue 54,000 taxpayers who sent EUR 22 billion ($28.5 billion) abroad in 2009-11. About 15,000 people transferred funds that were not declared to the tax authorities; the government now hopes to rake in an extra EUR 2.25 billion in taxes. 
Mr Vaxevanis is due to be tried in Athens on November 1st on charges of violating data-privacy laws by publishing the list that contains names of politicians, shipowners and businesspeople. He accepts that some accounts held legitimate funds. Yet many of the 200 people contacted by the Hot Doc team either claimed the list was a fake or begged him not to publish their names, he says. 
Those most embarrassed by the revelations are two former socialist finance ministers, George Papaconstantinou, and his successor, Evangelos Venizelos, now leader of Pasok (the PanHellenic Socialist Movement). In 2010 Mr Papaconstantinou requested the list, put together by a former HSBC employee, from Christine Lagarde, then his counterpart in France. He asked Ioannis Kapeleris, the head of SDOE, the Greek financial police, to check out ten names. Although they turned out to be suspected tax evaders, Mr Papaconstantinou never pursued the matter. The CDs containing the names and a copy made on a USB stick were ""mislaid"", Mr Papaconstantinou told parliament. The next head of SDOE, Ioannis Diotis, a former public prosecutor, told Mr Venizelos an investigation into the stolen list could face legal problems. The matter was quietly dropped. 
Yannis Stournaras, the current finance minister, a technocrat, has asked Paris to send another copy of the list, which dates from 2007. Yet it may still be hard to catch up with tax evaders. According to Mr Kapeleris, delays in digitising tax records have meant that many documents going back more than five years are shredded. 
The sheer scale of Greek tax evasion angers the European Union and IMF officials trying to knock Greece's economy back into shape. One recent study suggested up to EUR 30 billion of revenue goes uncollected every year. Ms Lagarde, now the IMF managing director, has said publicly she cares more about village schoolchildren in Niger than Athenians ""who are trying to escape tax all the time.""

GREECE'S fragile coalition government only narrowly averted disaster on November 7th when it won parliamentary approval for a drastic new austerity package. The package scraped through with 153 votes to 128 in the 300-member house. 
Antonis Samaras, the prime minister, made the best of it, saying that ""Greece has turned a page."" Meanwhile furious anti-austerity protesters outside parliament hurled stones and Molotov cocktails at police in what has become a grim ritual. 
The debate over the latest austerity measures, the toughest yet, had turned angry even before lawmakers studied the 500-page ""poly-law"" before them. Presenting the four-year programme to parliament's economics committee, Yannis Stournaras, the finance minister, fended off attacks from Syriza, the leftist opposition party, pointing out that if it were voted down Greece would lose a desperately needed EUR 31.5 billion ($40 billion) slice of its bail-out funding, would default on its next debt repayment and would surely then make a disorderly exit from the euro. 
Mr Stournaras had gradually given ground over four months of negotiations with the ""troika"" of the European Union, the European Central Bank and the IMF on the package to be implemented in 2013 and 2014. Greek proposals for cuts in government operating costs were rejected as unrealistic. So they were replaced by ""permanent"" spending reductions, code for slashing salaries and pensions. 
Many elderly Greeks' worst fears were realised when the law was unveiled. The biggest chunk of savings next year, about EUR 4.6 billion, comes from reducing pensions, starting with a 5% cut for those on a modest EUR 1,000 a month. ""It feels as if the troika has selected the old for special punishment,"" commented Constantina Athanassakis, a 70-year-old retired hairdresser. 
Salaries of better-paid public-sector workers such as central-bank employees, university teachers, judges and hospital doctors, will also be cut. Salaries at public-sector corporations are being reduced by 35% and capped at EUR 5,000 a month, which means take-home pay of just EUR 2,900 for bosses and fewer perks. Some cuts will be backdated. Next year's budget assumes the economy will shrink by another 4.5%, but local economists predict that a collapse in spending by cash-strapped consumers could lead to an even bigger fall. 
Antonis Samaras, the centre-right prime minister, promises this will be the ""last and final"" round of cuts. But Greece's creditors are not so sure, given the poor record of all Greek governments on reform. The economy is not expected to start growing again before 2015. Few observers expect the government to keep to its new timetable of cutting 110,000 civil-service jobs by 2016. The privatisation programme has been disappointing. With Greece looking politically unstable and facing two more years of recession, it will be hard to attract foreign investors. 
It does not help that Mr Samaras's three-party coalition is increasingly fragile. His centre-right New Democracy party is expected to stay loyal at the next parliamentary test, approving the 2013 budget this weekend. Fotis Kouvelis, leader of the small Democratic Left, has also pledged to back the government. But his decision to abstain from the vote on November 7th has undermined his credibility with Mr Samaras. Mr Kouvelis could soon face a leadership challenge. 
Many observers also believe that Evangelos Venizelos, leader of the PanHellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok), may be unseated. Mr Venizelos's reluctance when serving as finance minister to investigate the so-called Lagarde list of 2,000 Greeks with bank accounts in Geneva has annoyed many in his party. Several former ministers think they could do a better job of rebuilding Pasok's popularity, which is at an all-time low of around 6%, according to the polls. Yet if Pasok fragments, the government risks losing its majority--and the prospect of a Grexit will loom yet again.","The government gets its latest austerity measures through , but only just

GREECE'S elite used to see stashing funds in Swiss bank accounts as an insurance policy. Until the country joined the euro zone, fears of a sudden devaluation or a freeze on capital movements loomed large. Then came a rush to transfer money made in the black economy to financial havens abroad. 
After many years of turning a blind eye to this illegal practice, a desperately broke Greek government is at last cracking down. The tax declarations of almost 2,000 Greeks with accounts at the Geneva branch of HSBC, a bank, are being scrutinised by officials at SDOE, the financial police. Their names were on a computer disk sent in 2010 by Christine Lagarde, then French finance minister, to her Greek counterpart, George Papaconstantinou. 
The ""Lagarde list"" went missing in mid-2011 but turned up again recently when Evangelos Venizelos, Mr Papaconstantinou's successor as finance minister, sent a copy to the office of Antonis Samaras, who is now prime minister. Hot Doc, a Greek investigative magazine, then got hold of another copy and published all 2,000 names. 
Several politicians and their wives and many members of prominent business families appear on the list. Yet most attention has focused on Maria Panteli, an office manager whose account contained EUR 550m ($719m), about one-third of the total in all the accounts. Ms Panteli was suspected at first of acting as a front for a Greek shipowner. Then Nikos Lekkas, deputy chief of SDOE, claimed in testimony to a prosecutor that her account was controlled by the 89-year-old mother of a former prime minister, George Papandreou. 
Margaret Papandreou, who lives modestly near Corinth, a provincial town, and her son, now a backbench MP, swiftly denied the allegations. Mrs Papandreou, a feisty feminist, threatened to sue newspapers that published Mr Lekkas's claim. 
The Papandreous felt vindicated when Sabby Mioni, a Greek-Israeli financier, came up with an explanation. Mr Mioni said he had never met any Papandreou family member. The account in question belonged to an investment fund listed on the Irish stock exchange, he said, and he used to manage the fund on behalf of EFG International, a Greek financial group based in Switzerland. According to one of Mr Mioni's former colleagues, Ms Panteli was a trusted employee permitted to sign documents on Mr Mioni's behalf. 
A day later Mr Lekkas made a U-turn, claiming that he had never linked the Papandreous with Ms Panteli's account. The embarrassing incident has raised fresh doubts about the financial police's professional competence. Critics say there has been foot-dragging over investigations of politicians, footballers, prominent lawyers and doctors suspected of tax evasion. SDOE officials complain they are overloaded with new cases. 
Greece has still not convicted any prominent tax evaders, despite promising international creditors that the worst offenders would go to jail. The government is about to name a special secretary for tax affairs, in line with a request from officials from the European Commission, the IMF and the European Central Bank who are supervising economic reforms. The new tax supremo will have his work cut out.","Not a single prominent tax evader has yet been convicted 
GREECE'S elite used to see stashing funds in Swiss bank accounts as an insurance policy. Until the country joined the euro zone, fears of a sudden devaluation or a freeze on capital movements loomed large. Then came a rush to transfer money made in the black economy to financial havens abroad. 
After many years of turning a blind eye to this illegal practice, a desperately broke Greek government is at last cracking down. The tax declarations of almost 2,000 Greeks with accounts at the Geneva branch of HSBC, a bank, are being scrutinised by officials at SDOE, the financial police. Their names were on a computer disk sent in 2010 by Christine Lagarde, then French finance minister, to her Greek counterpart, George Papaconstantinou. 
The ""Lagarde list"" went missing in mid-2011 but turned up again recently when Evangelos Venizelos, Mr Papaconstantinou's successor as finance minister, sent a copy to the office of Antonis Samaras, who is now prime minister. Hot Doc, a Greek investigative magazine, then got hold of another copy and published all 2,000 names. 
Several politicians and their wives and many members of prominent business families appear on the list. Yet most attention has focused on Maria Panteli, an office manager whose account contained EUR 550m ($719m), about one-third of the total in all the accounts. Ms Panteli was suspected at first of acting as a front for a Greek shipowner. Then Nikos Lekkas, deputy chief of SDOE, claimed in testimony to a prosecutor that her account was controlled by the 89-year-old mother of a former prime minister, George Papandreou. 
Margaret Papandreou, who lives modestly near Corinth, a provincial town, and her son, now a backbench MP, swiftly denied the allegations. Mrs Papandreou, a feisty feminist, threatened to sue newspapers that published Mr Lekkas's claim. 
The Papandreous felt vindicated when Sabby Mioni, a Greek-Israeli financier, came up with an explanation. Mr Mioni said he had never met any Papandreou family member. The account in question belonged to an investment fund listed on the Irish stock exchange, he said, and he used to manage the fund on behalf of EFG International, a Greek financial group based in Switzerland.

THE first culprit of Greece's biggest tax-evasion scandal in recent memory may not be a high-rolling tycoon but the former finance minister. In 2010 George Papaconstantinou, the chief negotiator of Greece's first bail-out by the European Union and the IMF, took delivery from the French government of a computer disk with the names of some 2,000 Greeks with Swiss bank accounts. Mr Papaconstantinou should immediately have passed the ""Lagarde list"", named after the then-French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde, to the financial police. 
Instead he kept it, according to a leaked proposal for a parliamentary inquiry. It says there are ""indications"" that Mr Papaconstantinou deleted the names of three members of his family before transferring the list to a USB memory stick. The planned investigation was dropped; two directors of SDOE, the financial police, said they never received formal instructions from Mr Papaconstantinou. 
Mr Papaconstantinou now faces a full-blown parliamentary investigation, the lifting of his immunity from prosecution as an ex-minister and trial by a special court on charges of falsifying documents and failing to carry out his duties. He has been expelled from the PanHellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) and disowned by his ex-boss, George Papandreou, a former prime minister and ex-Pasok leader. He denies tampering with the computer disk, claiming he is being made a scapegoat for foot-dragging by others who failed to ensure the people on the list were investigated as possible tax evaders. 
Evangelos Venizelos, the current leader of Pasok, who succeeded Mr Papaconstantinou as finance minister, should face a parliamentary inquiry too, according to Syriza, the main opposition party. Its lawmakers claim he kept the USB stick in his desk drawer for more than a year before sending it to Antonis Samaras, the prime minister, the day after Yannis Stournaras, the current finance minister, said he would clear things up by asking Paris for another copy of the disk. 
The names on the USB stick, which were leaked to a Greek investigative magazine, read like a roll-call of Greece's internationally educated business and professional elite. The new disk, now in the hands of a financial prosecutor, contains the names of Mr Papaconstantinou's family: Eleni Papaconstantinou, a Harvard-trained corporate lawyer and adviser to TAIPED, the privatisation agency, and her husband, whose joint account reportedly held $1.2m, as well as Ms Papaconstantinou's sister's husband, a middleman handling weapons purchases for the navy. On January 2nd Ms Papaconstantinou, who maintains that she has done nothing illegal, resigned from her role at TAIPED. 
Mr Samaras promised swift retribution for tax evaders in his new year's message, insisting that nobody would be immune from prosecution. His compatriots are sceptical: according to a recent poll, two-thirds of Greeks say that the government is failing to go after tax cheats.

THE mood in Greek business circles is brightening. Greece is still grappling with a record recession that has shrunk output by more than a fifth and pushed unemployment close to 27%, the highest rate in the European Union. But a monthly index of business sentiment produced by IOBE, a think-tank, jumped in December to its highest level in two years (see chart). 
Yannis Stournaras, the finance minister, predicts the economy will start to recover by October, boosted by a long-awaited rebound in tourism. A rush of early bookings has cheered hoteliers on Aegean Islands. Optimism in foreign markets and assurances from Berlin that Greece will be able to stay in the euro zone are helping, too. Billions of euros stashed under mattresses last summer, when a ""Grexit"" seemed imminent, have returned to their owners' bank accounts. The Athens stockmarket has perked up and private-equity firms are scouting for bargains among crisis-battered Greek companies. 
Opinion polls suggest the coalition government led by New Democracy, a centre-right party, is becoming more stable. Several recent polls showed the conservatives edging ahead of Syriza, the left-wing opposition, despite new pension and public-sector wage cuts imposed this month and a looming property tax that enrages middle-class voters. Antonis Samaras, the prime minister, has an unprecedented approval rating of 46%, compared with 28% for Alexis Tsipras, the Syriza leader. Mr Tsipras's trips last month to Berlin and Washington, DC, intended to polish his image as a future premier, annoyed his party's far left and failed to impress its moderates. 
Even so, Greece is struggling to meet a new set of targets set by the troika--the European Central Bank, EU and IMF officials who monitor the EUR 130 billion ($176 billion) international bail-out. Two slices of aid amounting to EUR 43.5 billion have been paid since December; another EUR 5.6 billion will be paid by March provided dozens of legal and administrative benchmarks are ticked off. 
The troika recently rejected a draft investment-incentives law because it favoured the same local interest groups that already have a stranglehold on a large part of the economy. A EUR 2 billion flagship privatisation deal--the sale of DEPA, Greece's gas utility, and Desfa, its pipeline subsidiary--is dragging. Two Russian energy companies, the state-owned Gazprom and Sintez, a private firm, came up with the highest offers. After American and EU officials voiced disapproval, TAIPED, the privatisation agency, suggested all five shortlisted bidders seek Western partners. 
A crackdown on tax evasion, another priority for the troika, has brought hundreds of arrests, including those of several prominent Athenian businessmen, but few convictions or seizures of property. Finance-ministry officials complain that courts hand out suspended sentences to large-scale tax evaders rather than put them in jail. Judges have blocked a troika proposal to set up fast-track tax courts to settle tens of thousands of disputed cases and make tax cheats pay up immediately. 
The government is trying to contain simmering social unrest by taking a tougher line against protesters. It has forced striking Athens metro workers and seamen working on coastal ferries back to work through civil-mobilisation orders, to the relief of commuters and islanders who export fresh produce. Hundreds of farmers who have parked their tractors across highways to protest against having to file tax declarations for the first time are being threatened with prosecution.

WHAT a difference a year makes. Last May Greece seemed to be heading out of the euro. Lagging reforms, political in-fighting and violent protests had worn out creditors' patience. An election failed to produce a clear winner. Athenians stashed euros in safety-deposit boxes and under mattresses amid fears of instability and a chaotic return to the drachma. 
Greece is still in recession, but recovery could be around the corner. The threat of ""Grexit"" from the euro has receded. Hedge funds are snapping up sovereign bonds and bank shares; one has made a bricks-and-mortar investment in a Greek energy company. Bail-out funds from the European Union and IMF are flowing in as reform ""milestones"" are reached. Greece expects to record a small primary budget surplus (ie, before interest) of about 0.5% of GDP. The economy should grow a little in 2014 and by more than 2% in 2015. 
This summer should see a record 17m tourists crowding Greek beaches. Bookings from Germany and Russia are soaring, say travel agents. A projected rise of EUR 1.5 billion-2 billion in tourist revenues will give the budget a boost, even though many hoteliers are struggling to service bank debts. Greek contractors expect to resume work in the autumn on EUR 6 billion of EU-financed motorway projects stalled since the crisis. They could create 30,000 jobs. 
Privatisation is under way after several false starts. Opap, the state gambling monopoly, has been sold for EUR 712m to a consortium of Greek and east European investors. Gazprom is expected to bid for Depa, the natural-gas monopoly. Sintez, a private Russian energy company, and Socar, Azerbaijan's state gas producer, are vying for the gas distributor Desfa. 
Antonis Samaras, the centre-right prime minister, sounded confident on a visit to Beijing that Chinese investment is coming.

Some consultants bemoan a lack of interest from the EU. But one says that, since its partial default last year, ""Greece has become a frontier market that is too risky for western companies.""

Yet the crisis has left a terrible legacy. Five-and-a-half years of recession have wiped out over 25% of output and more than a million private-sector jobs. Tens of thousands of retailers and small manufacturers have gone under. Unemployment is above 27%, a record; for youths it is over 60%.

THE sky was black, and getting blacker. The hens began to go round in circles, and the horses ran out of the barn. Uncle Henry and the men were shouting, clutching on to their hats. Bundles of weeds blew past, then whole small trees. A wide black column loomed on the horizon. The wind howled like an express train, and Dorothy and Toto were struggling to get through the gate. But no sooner were they safe in the farmhouse than the windows fell in, and the whole house took off into the storm, tumbling through the inky clouds... 
That was the moment Tim Samaras got hooked on tornadoes. He was six, and watching ""The Wizard of Oz"" only because his mother had forced him to. He never forgot the big, black, beastly monster rampaging over the plain. But he also thought how beautiful it was. The word ""beauty"" often sprang to his lips when he talked about them. Beauty in the towering, narrowing funnel, the continuous roaring, the smell of grass fresh-scythed by the wind and earth torn open by it: the sheer power of what Mother Nature could do. No video game could touch it. No movie, either. 
His favourite place was South Dakota, where on June 24th 2003, just outside the hamlet of Manchester, he encountered a tornado (measuring EF4 on the Enhanced Fujita scale) strong enough to rip telephone poles out of the ground and absorb them into itself. He was too close. But he was quick enough, in the 82 seconds before the storm reached him, to place probes on the road that could measure it. They registered the steepest fall in atmospheric pressure ever recorded, 100 millibars in less than a minute, as well as the lowest-ever pressure (adjusted for altitude) at the Earth's surface, as the twister passed over. 
For Mr Samaras was not just a storm chaser, one of the gawping hundreds who clogged the country roads of Oklahoma with their vehicles each tornado season. He was a researcher, who spent his time trying to snare phenomena other scientists thought uncatchable: what went on inside tornadoes and on the ground under them, or the precise moments when lightning formed and struck. Self-taught in engineering, he made almost all his own instruments. His probes, bright orange ""turtles"" 20 inches across and weighing 45 pounds, could lie low under storms and record their static pressure, temperature and humidity, as well as, for the first time, filming them: from video taken near Storm Lake, Iowa, in 2004, through the driving debris and the rain, he calculated that a small stick inches from the ground was moving at 72 miles per hour (116kph), and a maple leaf at 125. To measure wind speeds higher up he had his mobile mesonet system, tall antennae perched like whirligigs on top of his cars, and his modified anemometer, which could handle speeds close to those of sound. He also carried with him, in his mobile lab-trailer, Doppler radar and his extra-high-speed camera, a cold-war model converted to digital, which could shoot 1.4m frames a second--ideal for lightning. 
In the bear's cage 
With this ""whole garage"" of gear he roamed across North America, clocking up 35,000 miles in two months in some seasons, in cars pungent with sweat and stale sandwiches. April-May meant Tornado Alley, from the Great Plains southwards; June-July was the time for Canada; August took him to the south-west and its thunderstorms. His four-man Twistex team (for Tactical Weather Instrumental Sampling in Tornadoes Experiment) included his son Paul, who manned the videocamera and could be heard on one clip shouting ""Dad, we don't have time, we don't have time, seriously."" But his father's mind would be on finding the right spot to plant the probe, in order to catch the moment and to understand more. 
For all that, he was known to be cautious. The very reason for his work was to give people more time to escape from tornadoes, more knowledge of them and more ways to survive. Tornadoes were unpredictable and erratic, sometimes with multiple vortices, changing direction without warning, and often wrapped in rain, a phenomenon chasers called ""the bear's cage"". When inside the cage, observing the bear up close while it whipped and raged, he tried never to leave his car. The team was trained in first aid, in case they came across casualties of the storm, and in 2011 he helped to rebuild houses in Alabama, where he had registered 1,000 tornado tracks in a single day. 
When he appeared on ""Storm Chasers"" on the Discovery Channel, this soberness kept wrestling with exhilaration. Like a boy, he would rush irrepressibly to the window when it rattled. ""Two large tornadoes at once"", he tweeted on May 27th; ""too close--wow!"" And on May 15th: ""Off to KS to chase lightning--with tornadoes on the side...gawd I love my job..."" 
""Stay weather savvy!"" he warned on May 31st. Up to a point, he was: he stayed in his car, seat-belt fastened, as an EF5 touched down that day at El Reno, Oklahoma. But the tornado, heading east, whirled round suddenly to head north, sending his car somersaulting for half a mile. His son Paul and another member of the team, Carl Young, died in the same storm. They were the first chasers to be killed by the tornado they were pursuing. On the ground, though, three Samaras probes remained in place. And they were still recording.","Antonis Samaras , died on May 31st , aged 55

Antonis Samaras's probes , bright orange "" turtles "" 20 inches across and weighing 45 pounds , could lie low under storms and record their static pressure , temperature and humidity , as well as , for the first time , filming them : from video taken near Storm Lake , Iowa , in 2004 , through the driving debris and the rain , Antonis Samaras calculated that a small stick inches from the ground was moving at 72 miles per hour ( 116kph ) , and a maple leaf at 125 . To measure wind speeds higher up Antonis Samaras had Antonis Samaras's mobile mesonet system , tall antennae perched like whirligigs on top of Antonis Samaras's cars , and Antonis Samaras's modified anemometer , which could handle speeds close to those of sound . Antonis Samaras also carried with Antonis Samaras , in Antonis Samaras's mobile lab - trailer , Doppler radar and Antonis Samaras's extra - high - speed camera , a cold - war model converted to digital , which could shoot 1.4 m frames a second -- ideal for lightning . 
 In the bear 's cage 
 With this "" whole garage "" of gear Antonis Samaras roamed across North America , clocking up 35,000 miles in two months in some seasons , in cars pungent with sweat and stale sandwiches . April - May meant Tornado Alley , from the Great Plains southwards ; June - July was the time for Canada ; August took Antonis Samaras to the south - west and its thunderstorms . Antonis Samaras's four - man Twistex team ( for Tactical Weather Instrumental Sampling in Tornadoes Experiment ) included Antonis Samaras's son Paul , who manned the videocamera and could be heard on one clip shouting "" Antonis Samaras , we do n't have time , we do n't have time , seriously . "" But Antonis Samaras's 's mind would be on finding the right spot to plant the probe , in order to catch the moment and to understand more . 
 For all that , Antonis Samaras was known to be cautious . The very reason for Antonis Samaras's work was to give people more time to escape from tornadoes , more knowledge of them and more ways to survive . Tornadoes were unpredictable and erratic , sometimes with multiple vortices , changing direction without warning , and often wrapped in rain , a phenomenon chasers called "" the bear 's cage "" . When inside the cage , observing the bear up close while it whipped and raged , Antonis Samaras tried never to leave Antonis Samaras's car . The team was trained in first aid , in case they came across casualties of the storm , and in 2011 Antonis Samaras helped to rebuild houses in Alabama , where Antonis Samaras had registered 1,000 tornado tracks in a single day . 
 When Antonis Samaras appeared on "" Storm Chasers "" on the Discovery Channel , this soberness kept wrestling with exhilaration . Like a boy , Antonis Samaras would rush irrepressibly to the window when it rattled . "" Two large tornadoes at once "" , Antonis Samaras tweeted on May 27th ; "" too close -- wow ! "" And on May 15th : "" Off to KS to chase lightning -- with tornadoes on the side ... gawd Antonis Samaras love Antonis Samaras's job ... "" 
 "" Stay weather savvy ! "" Antonis Samaras warned on May 31st . Up to a point , Antonis Samaras was : Antonis Samaras stayed in Antonis Samaras's car , seat - belt fastened , as an EF5 touched down that day at El Reno , Oklahoma . But the tornado , heading east , whirled round suddenly to head north , sending Antonis Samaras's car somersaulting for half a mile . Antonis Samaras's Paul and another member of the team , Carl Young , died in the same storm . They were the first chasers to be killed by the tornado they were pursuing . On the ground , though , three Samaras probes remained in place . And they were still recording .",350,Greece,cb-350-2,IN TERM,True,Mr Samaras,54,True

IN AN ugly recent exchange in Greece's parliament, Ilias Kassidiaris, spokesman for the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party, denied that the Holocaust had happened. Vassilis Economou, from the Democratic Left party, said that in Germany the penalty for denying the Holocaust was five years' jail. Democratic Left and the PanHellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok), the two smaller coalition parties, want a new law against hate speech and racism. A draft bill from Antonis Roupakiotis, the justice minister from Democratic Left, aims squarely at Golden Dawn, proposing to ban an association if one of its members is found guilty of a hate crime, including Holocaust denial. 
Since entering parliament a year ago with 18 deputies, Golden Dawn has been a steady third in opinion polls, with about 11% of the vote, behind only the New Democracy party of Antonis Samaras, the prime minister, and the far-left opposition Syriza party. Its anti-immigrant rhetoric, swastika-like party emblem and torch-lit parades led by young men in black T-shirts horrify many Greeks. Golden Dawn supporters are blamed for an upsurge in racist violence. One was arrested in April for shooting at a group of immigrant strawberry-pickers demanding back pay. 
Yet banning Golden Dawn could be counterproductive, insist critics of Mr Roupakiotis's bill. They say it would simply regroup and run under another name. Human Rights Watch, a campaign group, says the proposal ""is hard to reconcile with the right to freedom of association"". New Democracy says the existing anti-racism law needs tweaking, not rewriting. It suggests two amendments: outlawing neo-Nazi groups and making Holocaust denial a crime. A stronger anti-racism law might, it fears, merely win Golden Dawn a sympathy vote from other right-wingers. 
Greece's latest political convulsions may now put off any new law. Delay is unhelpful. Whatever form an anti-racism law takes, it will not now reach parliament until after the summer. Meanwhile Golden Dawn has come up with a bill to ban ""racism against Greeks"". Mr Roupakiotis is not amused.

IT SEEMED a good idea at the time. On June 11th Antonis Samaras, the prime minister, eager to show that his fractious coalition could push through public-sector reform, shut the overstaffed state broadcaster ERT without warning and sacked its 2,650 employees. Few Greeks watch ERT's four television channels; its programmes are dull and its news anchors are political stooges (a leaked list found dozens of employees earning six-figure salaries). And the European Union and the IMF, who oversee Greece's bail-out, were waiting impatiently for the government to come up with the names of 2,000 public-sector workers to be sacked by June 30th. 
Mr Samaras pledged to have a lean new public broadcaster, with only 1,200 employees, up and running by August. But hundreds of protesters camped outside ERT's headquarters. Other European public broadcasters voiced outrage at the closure; ERT employees streamed unofficial news programmes over the internet. The opposition Syriza party talked of ""a coup against democracy."" And Mr Samaras's coalition partners, the PanHellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok), and the Democratic Left, demanded the withdrawal of the decree closing ERT. Then a ruling by Greece's highest court, in response to an appeal by the ERT's trade union, said the broadcaster should reopen, though it backed the government's right to restructure it. 
For a few days, it seemed the government might collapse, but it is still wobbling along. Most Greeks prefer to keep the coalition and avoid a snap election. If one were held, Pasok might not win the 3% needed to enter parliament, according to polls; and Democratic Left's leader might be unseated. A fiery speech by Alexis Tsipras, the Syriza leader, at an open-air rally outside parliament on June 17th drew fewer people than expected. Mr Samaras promises a cabinet reshuffle. 
The ERT affair makes it harder to sell Greece's ""success story"" of reform. In its year in office the coalition has done well on budget targets: there may be a small primary surplus (ie, before interest) this year. But unless the government can restructure the civil service and curb tax evasion, the bail-out will veer off track, fears the ""troika"" of the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF. 
Blips are appearing. The state health service is still overspending, despite the launch of a high-tech electronic prescription system designed to prevent chronic over-prescription by corrupt doctors and procurement staff. An overhaul of the tax administration is moving at snail's pace, partly because young, well-qualified auditors are reluctant to sign up. Tax evasion by the rich continues unabated, according to the troika. 
Privatisation has also fallen behind. Gazprom, the only prospective bidder, failed this month to make a binding offer for Depa, the state natural-gas supplier. Greece will miss this year's target of EUR 2.6 billion ($3.6 billion) from selling state assets, says Taiped, the privatisation agency. Yet one bright spot emerged on June 18th: Socar, Azerbaijan's state gas company, agreed to pay EUR 400m for a stake in Desfa, which runs the gas-pipeline network. The deal could herald investment in new pipelines to Bulgaria and Albania carrying Azeri natural gas to western Europe, says Makis Papageorgiou, the energy minister.","A bid to close the state broadcaster discombobulates the ruling coalition

ONCE again a fragile Greek government has pushed delayed reforms through parliament at the behest of the European Union and the IMF even as angry protesters in the square outside demand its resignation. At stake was a desperately needed EUR 6.8 billion slice of Greece's bail-out. The vote on July 17th to cut 15,000 civil-service jobs and overhaul the tax system was close, mainly because Antonis Samaras, the centre-right prime minister, has seen his majority cut to just five seats after the small Democratic Left party pulled out of his three-party coalition. 
Mr Samaras had to produce a last-minute ace to win over dissidents. Hours before the vote, he announced that an unpopular 23% value-added tax on restaurants, cafes and bars would be temporarily cut to 13% on August 1st. If this produces more revenue, as the finance ministry predicts, it will stay. The EU and IMF are sceptical but ready to try it. The announcement came just before Wolfgang Schauble, the German finance minister, visited Athens to urge the Greeks to stick to reforms and to unveil a German-Greek fund to back small Greek companies. 
Mr Samaras's slimmed-down coalition of his New Democracy party and the PanHellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) under Evangelos Venizelos, who is now deputy prime minister and foreign minister, may prove more forceful than its predecessor. Mr Venizelos is busy preparing for Greece's turn in the EU presidency in the first half of 2014. Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the public administration minister, must sack 4,000 public employees this year and another 11,000 in 2014. First to go will be 2,000 state-television staff, followed by municipal police officers, hospital workers and vocational-training teachers. The old life in the civil service, with higher salaries and fewer hours than in the private sector, is over. ""The game has changed for good,"" says Mr Mitsotakis. 
Yet there are few signs of an economic recovery. IOBE, a think-tank, says GDP will shrink by as much as 5% this year, worse than its earlier forecast of 4.6%. Unemployment is expected to rise from 26.9% today to 30% next year. And privatisation receipts are disappointing: Greece will miss this year's target by a wide margin. 
The picture is only a little better in Portugal, where the costs of two years of unremitting austerity have pulled Pedro Passos Coelho's ruling coalition apart, triggering a political crisis. The latest twist came when President Anibal Cavaco Silva intervened ineptly to ask the two coalition parties and the centre-left Socialists, the main opposition party, to hammer out a ""national salvation"" pact. Yet the gulf between the centre-right ruling parties and the Socialists is so wide that the chances of their meeting a self-imposed deadline of July 21st for an agreement are small. 
The president's aim was to give investors and Portugal's lenders--the ""troika"" of the EU, IMF and European Central Bank--some guarantee that the mainstream parties, supported by about 80% of voters, remained committed to the country's bail-out programme and that future governments will stick to fiscal discipline. Yet the danger is that, after prolonging Lisbon's political crisis for a few more weeks, it could produce nothing at all, leaving the country as it was: ruled by an unstable coalition and facing the threat of a snap election with unpredictable results. 
Portugal's borrowing costs have surged, and the latest central-bank forecasts suggest that the economy will barely recover in 2014 after three years of deep recession. Instead of the promised turnaround, the bank now expects only 0.3% growth next year. The main culprit is bigger-than-expected cuts in public spending that were necessary to keep the bail-out on track. This forecast is hardly likely to strengthen confidence in Portugal, Greece or across the wider euro zone that austerity is working. Nor will it support the fond hopes in Brussels that Portugal was safely pulling away from Greece and would follow Ireland by getting out of its bail-out programme. Just now, neither country looks anywhere near ready for graduation.","Two bailed - out countries still struggle to stick to their programmes

The old life in the civil service , with higher salaries and fewer hours than in the private sector , is over . "" The game has changed for good , "" says Mr Mitsotakis . 
 Yet there are few signs of an economic recovery . IOBE , a think - tank , says GDP will shrink by as much as 5 % this year , worse than its earlier forecast of 4.6 % . Unemployment is expected to rise from 26.9 % today to 30 % next year . And privatisation receipts are disappointing : Greece will miss this year 's target by a wide margin . 
 The picture is only a little better in Portugal , where the costs of two years of unremitting austerity have pulled Pedro Passos Coelho 's ruling coalition apart , triggering a political crisis . The latest twist came when President Anibal Cavaco Silva intervened ineptly to ask the two coalition parties and the centre - left Socialists , the main opposition party , to hammer out a "" national salvation "" pact . Yet the gulf between the centre - right ruling parties and the Socialists is so wide that the chances of their meeting a self - imposed deadline of July 21st for an agreement are small . 
 The president 's aim was to give investors and Portugal 's lenders -- the "" troika "" of the EU , IMF and European Central Bank -- some guarantee that the mainstream parties , supported by about 80 % of voters , remained committed to the country 's bail - out programme and that future governments will stick to fiscal discipline . Yet the danger is that , after prolonging Lisbon 's political crisis for a few more weeks , it could produce nothing at all , leaving the country as it was : ruled by an unstable coalition and facing the threat of a snap election with unpredictable results . 
 Portugal 's borrowing costs have surged , and the latest central - bank forecasts suggest that the economy will barely recover in 2014 after three years of deep recession . Instead of the promised turnaround , the bank now expects only 0.3 % growth next year . The main culprit is bigger - than - expected cuts in public spending that were necessary to keep the bail - out on track . This forecast is hardly likely to strengthen confidence in Portugal , Greece or across the wider euro zone that austerity is working . Nor will it support the fond hopes in Brussels that Portugal was safely pulling away from Greece and would follow Ireland by getting out of its bail - out programme . Just now , neither country looks anywhere near ready for graduation .",350,Greece,cb-350-2,IN TERM,True,"Antonis Samaras , the centre - right prime minister ,",8,True

At this rate, that won't be hard. International creditors' original target of 50 billion in revenues by 2016 was cut to a more realistic 15 billion. Only 5 billion has been raised so far. This year's flagship sale, of the gas utility, Depa, expected to raise close to 1 billion, collapsed when Gazprom, the only shortlisted bidder, pulled out at the last minute amid worries in the European Commission about its market-abusing habits.

All face being laid off in a long-awaited cull of public-sector workers. Riot police resorted to firing the tear gas on September 16th to dissuade a group of school guards from occupying the ministry of public administration.

Mr Mitsotakis had to cast around half a dozen ministries to try to make up the numbers days before the ""troika"" of officials from the European Commission, European Central Bank and IMF arrive to check up on Greece's progress. 
Another 12,500 jobs must be cut by the end of 2013. Workers dumped in the reserve on 75% of their pay will be given eight months to find a new public-sector job. The striking teachers are backed by Alexis Tsipras, leader of the radical Syriza party, the main opposition, who wants to bring down the government. 
The mood is edgy. Middle-class Greeks are struggling to pay three years' worth of property taxes. Rumours are rife of another cut in pensions to help plug a widening deficit at IKA, the biggest social-security fund. Mr Samaras's New Democracy party has fallen a point behind Syriza in some recent polls. 
Greece is on track to achieve a primary budget surplus this year before debt repayments, but will still need an extra EUR 4.4 billion ($5.9 billion) from its creditors next year and EUR 6.5 billion in 2015. Some indicators suggest that this year's recession will be shallower than forecast and that the economy will grow by 0.8% next year. Athens officials hope to begin discussing debt relief, perhaps involving another reduction of interest rates, and an extension of loan maturities, once Eurostat, the EU's statistical arm, confirms the primary surplus in April. 
Despite this encouraging news, Mr Samaras worries about a political ""blind spot"" that extremists can exploit when the economy has begun to improve but ordinary Greeks feel nothing has changed. Opinion poll support for Golden Dawn, the thuggish neo-Nazi party, has jumped from 10% to 15% since June. On September 18th a hip-hop artist was murdered by a man claiming allegiance to Golden Dawn. Violence erupted once again on the streets as demonstrators expressed their outrage. A return of the old strife between left and right now seems all too possible.

THE arrest of both leaders of an elected party is unprecedented for a member of the European Union. On September 28th the Greek government began a crackdown on Golden Dawn, a neo-Nazi party, which has 18 MPs in Greece's 300-strong parliament. Among those put in handcuffs by counter-terrorism officers in bulletproof vests and balaclavas were Nikos Michaloliakos, leader of Golden Dawn, four other MPs and 14 party supporters. Mr Michaloliakos's deputy, Christos Pappas, gave himself up to police a day later. 
Police and intelligence services have been gathering information on Golden Dawn's supposed criminal activities for months. But it was the alleged murder of Pavlos Fyssas, an anti-fascist rapper, by a Golden Dawn supporter on September 18th that prompted the crackdown. Mr Fyssas's killing sparked a national and international outcry and mass rallies against Golden Dawn. As protests against his party intensified, Mr Michaloliakos threatened to pull his lawmakers out of parliament, a move that could have forced a series of by-elections, destabilising Greece's fragile coalition government. 
Under the constitution a party cannot be banned, so the government has had to resort to criminal law to rein in a party it has come to see as a threat to the country's nearly 40-year-old democracy. The legal basis for the arrests is a report by a prosecutor laying out allegations against the Golden Dawn leadership, including murder, attempted murder, carrying out explosions, possessing explosives and robbery. It says Golden Dawn's structure is paralleled by a military-type operational force whose members attack mainly immigrants. The group's strict hierarchical structure, similar to the Nazi Fuhrerprinzip, meant the party leadership knew of every attack and local chapters followed central orders. 
On a visit to New York on September 30th, the Greek prime minister, Antonis Samaras, said his government would do ""whatever it takes"" to eradicate the ""shame"" of Golden Dawn. On the same day his government submitted a draft law to parliament aimed at cutting state money for the party. (Golden Dawn was due to receive more than EUR 873,000, or $1.2m, in 2013.) The law would suspend state funding for a party if any of its leadership or its MPs are being prosecuted for felonies. 
The success of the crackdown will depend on whether the prosecutor has a solid case. If it can be proved that Golden Dawn is a criminal organisation linked to murder and robbery--and there appears to be plenty of evidence--then the arrests will be legitimate and could boost Mr Samaras's government. If not, it may look like a heavy-handed and even anti-democratic effort to put an end to a political movement which, however ugly, enjoys considerable popular support. 
Optimists say that, if he feels his New Democracy party has become more popular, Mr Samaras may be tempted to call new elections next spring in the hope of getting a stronger government than the present, uncomfortable two-party combination. A more stable government would help Mr Samaras in negotiations with Greece's international lenders about a possible third bail-out of the recession-ridden country. Representatives of the ""troika"" of the IMF, the EU and European Central Bank have recently been in Athens and are expected to return soon. The government also needs to finalise next year's budget and meet conditions for the next tranche of EUR 1 billion of its current bail-out, including more public-sector cuts and faster privatisation. At least Mr Samaras has now won brownie points with his unexpectedly firm move against neo-Nazis.

""IT IS the bad-news season,"" says an adviser to Antonis Samaras's struggling coalition government. He means the onset of winter, when cash-strapped Greeks start worrying about the price of heating fuel. A new property tax in next year's budget, due to be presented to parliament on November 21st, is another headache. Farmers are being asked to pay tax on their landholdings for the first time. Squeezed by five years of austerity, one-third of property owners claim they will be unable to pay up, according to a survey by the Athens chamber of commerce. 
Mr Samaras's centre-right New Democracy party and its junior partner, the PanHellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok), narrowly survived a no-confidence vote in the early hours of November 11th. The motion was proposed by Alexis Tsipras, boss of Syriza, a hard-left opposition party, in an attempt to bring a fractious far-left faction of his party on board after he pledged in a speech during a trip to America that, if elected, he would not take Greece out of the euro. The coalition scraped through after a defection by a Pasok lawmaker, the sixth since last year's general election. 
The government can expect little respite. A vote on the new property tax is looming; it is unlikely to be approved by parliament in its present form. Rebel Pasok lawmakers say it should be replaced by a sweeping wealth tax, whereas New Democrats are under pressure from farmers to drop it altogether. 
Greece's creditors are turning up the heat on Mr Samaras. The ""troika"" of officials from the European Union, the European Central Bank and the IMF are pressing for new measures to plug a gap of about EUR 1.5 billion ($2 billion) in the 2014 budget. The government says the shortfall is only EUR 500m-700m and can be covered by cracking down on employers who evade paying social-security contributions. The troika is sceptical, as the finance ministry has missed all its previous targets for collecting unpaid taxes. 
Mr Samaras and Evangelos Venizelos, the deputy prime minister and Pasok leader, plead that Greeks cannot take any more austerity. The timetable for structural reforms is slipping. With 4,000 civil servants due to be sacked next month, the government wants to avert more job cuts. It is fighting to keep open two heavily loss-making defence companies that the troika insists should be shut down. The coalition ""just don't want to fire anyone,"" says Miranda Xafa, a former IMF official. 
Talks on closing the fiscal gap will now drag into next year, say officials in Brussels. By then a new German government will be in place, which will ease decision-making. Assured of a primary budget surplus (ie, before debt repayments) and without any large bond issues to be repaid in the next few months, Greece is not in imminent danger of defaulting. But if the reform programme continues to founder, the markets' new-found belief in a Greek recovery could quickly fade. 
Gloomy Athenians are pondering the possibility of widespread political violence after the killing on November 1st of two members of Golden Dawn, a neo-Nazi party, outside its offices by a gunman who got away on a motorbike. The attack was seen as revenge for the fatal stabbing of Pavlos Fyssas, an anti-fascist rapper, by a self-proclaimed supporter of Golden Dawn. Police believe a local left-wing terrorist group is responsible. No arrests have been made. So far, said a police officer, extremists from left and right are lying low.","A hard winter lies ahead for the Greek government

KALI chronia: happy new year. Greece starts 2014 with an unaccustomed run of good news. Not long ago the country was in a death spiral of missed fiscal targets, panicked markets and threats to force it out of the euro. Now the euro zone's first and most difficult problem child is exceeding expectations. 
Ahead of schedule, Greece has closed its scary deficit and moved into primary budget surplus (ie, before interest payments). Yields on ten-year bonds have fallen below 8%, from a peak of well over 40% at the height of the Grexit panic. The government plans to issue fresh debt later this year. Some foreign investors are testing the waters of the Aegean. Competitiveness is being restored. Greece has enjoyed a bumper tourist season. This year should see the first GDP growth after six years of recession. 
Once-exasperated German officials now hail the Greek prime minister, Antonis Samaras, as the saviour of his country--and, indeed, of the euro. As Greece assumed the half-yearly rotating presidency of the European Union this month, EU dignitaries came to Athens this week to praise it, not to bury it. 
Official rejoicing over the Greek bail-out programme is understandable. And yet Greece remains troubling, economically and politically. It has lost a quarter of economic output since 2007, thanks largely to the errors of its rulers and creditors alike. More than a quarter of its workers are jobless. Soup kitchens are commonplace, as are empty buildings and shops. Unit-labour costs have been reduced by cutting wages, not raising productivity. 
Stripping out the murky trade in fuel, and volatile tourism revenues (up in part because of turmoil in Egypt and Tunisia), Greece's exports are falling. This is alarming. In Spain, Portugal and Ireland lower labour costs have boosted exports. Some Greeks blame a lack of credit. Others note that the country's main export market, the EU, has been in recession. But the real problem is an economy that produces few tradable goods. Cheaper workers make little difference if there are no factories to hire them. If growth picks up, Greece may just suck in imports, restarting the cycle of external imbalances that proved its undoing. 
The economy needs profound structural reforms. But here the record has been far less impressive than on fiscal adjustment. Mr Samaras's lieutenants deny charges of foot-dragging, offering a long list of measures, from improving tax-collection to rationalising health spending to opening up cosseted professions. More will come, they say, including an assault on the myriad regulations that clog up product markets. 
True, Greece has shot up the World Bank's ranks for the ease of starting firms. But in the wider measure of ease of doing business, it ranks 72nd in the world, behind Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Belarus and Kazakhstan. Obtaining planning permits is maddening. And the judicial system remains slow and quixotic. 
Indeed, the country's biggest problem, say many despairing Greeks, is a dysfunctional state. Mr Samaras, more or less untainted by past mismanagement, retains an old-style penchant for clientelism. Yet impunity may be cracking a bit. A former defence minister is in jail for corruption. The cafe talk is of a senior defence official who told investigators he received so many bribes he could not remember them all; and of an ex-minister, a nephew of the venerated Constantine Karamanlis, the pre-and post-junta prime minister, hauled up before the courts for driving a car with fake number-plates. But serving politicians do not feel the heat and prosecution of big tax-dodgers remains a rarity. What to make of a bizarre judicial investigation of the man appointed to reform the unreliable statistics office, now accused of corruption for supposedly exaggerating Greece's fiscal hole? 
Restructuring an economy and reinventing the state take time and determination. But Mr Samaras, even if he were the man for such a task, is running out of both. Syriza, the radical left-wing coalition, is leading the polls for May's European election. Its telegenic and wily leader, Alexis Tsipras, is even a pan-European candidate to become president of the European Commission. 
That will never happen. But a victory by Mr Tsipras in the election could undermine Mr Samaras's fragile coalition, particularly as members of his Socialist allies, Pasok, defect to Syriza. By mid-2015, the EU could conceivably be dealing with Mr Tsipras as prime minister, or at least kingmaker. Scenting power, he has started to take English lessons and to travel. Abroad, Mr Tsipras's message is that he does not want to leave the euro; at home he promises to renege on the memorandum with Greece's creditors. Even Syriza's more level-headed members cannot say precisely how they could ditch the conditions and keep the loans. 
Politics is a Greek word 
Mr Tsipras might yet turn out to be more pragmatic than his rhetoric. Some already liken him to the late Andreas Papandreou, Pasok's founder, or to Mr Samaras himself, who also once opposed the memorandum. Even without the bank runs that some predict would follow a Syriza victory, Mr Tsipras's pledge to undo many reforms and renationalise the few privatised firms would, at the least, kill off any incipient recovery. 
A worried Germany could yet ease demands for structural reforms to take the pressure off Mr Samaras. But a better move would be to make a clear early commitment that the euro zone will honour its semi-promise in 2012 to give Greece additional debt relief, through lower interest rates and longer maturities, now that it has reached a primary surplus. In exchange, creditors should focus not on more austerity, but on the need to reform the economy and the state. The biggest risk in Greece is now political, not financial. Fears of default and Grexit have receded; the worry is rather about the rise of Greek extremists of both neo-Stalinist and neo-Nazi varieties.","Greece 's feat of deficit - cutting masks deeper economic and political failings 
 KALI chronia : happy new year . Greece starts 2014 with an unaccustomed run of good news . Not long ago the country was in a death spiral of missed fiscal targets , panicked markets and threats to force it out of the euro . Now the euro zone 's first and most difficult problem child is exceeding expectations . 
 Ahead of schedule , Greece has closed its scary deficit and moved into primary budget surplus ( ie , before interest payments ) . Yields on ten - year bonds have fallen below 8 % , from a peak of well over 40 % at the height of the Grexit panic . The government plans to issue fresh debt later this year . Some foreign investors are testing the waters of the Aegean . Competitiveness is being restored . Greece has enjoyed a bumper tourist season . This year should see the first GDP growth after six years of recession . 
 Once - exasperated German officials now hail Antonis Samaras as the saviour of Antonis Samaras's country -- and , indeed , of the euro . As Greece assumed the half - yearly rotating presidency of the European Union this month , EU dignitaries came to Athens this week to praise it , not to bury it . 
 Official rejoicing over the Greek bail - out programme is understandable . And yet Greece remains troubling , economically and politically . It has lost a quarter of economic output since 2007 , thanks largely to the errors of its rulers and creditors alike . More than a quarter of its workers are jobless . Soup kitchens are commonplace , as are empty buildings and shops . Unit - labour costs have been reduced by cutting wages , not raising productivity . 
 Stripping out the murky trade in fuel , and volatile tourism revenues ( up in part because of turmoil in Egypt and Tunisia ) , Greece 's exports are falling . This is alarming . In Spain , Portugal and Ireland lower labour costs have boosted exports . Some Greeks blame a lack of credit . Others note that the country 's main export market , the EU , has been in recession . But the real problem is an economy that produces few tradable goods . Cheaper workers make little difference if there are no factories to hire them . If growth picks up , Greece may just suck in imports , restarting the cycle of external imbalances that proved its undoing . 
 The economy needs profound structural reforms . But here the record has been far less impressive than on fiscal adjustment . Antonis Samaras's lieutenants deny charges of foot - dragging , offering a long list of measures , from improving tax - collection to rationalising health spending to opening up cosseted professions . More will come , they say , including an assault on the myriad regulations that clog up product markets . 
 True , Greece has shot up the World Bank 's ranks for the ease of starting firms . But in the wider measure of ease of doing business , it ranks 72nd in the world , behind Azerbaijan , Kyrgyzstan , Belarus and Kazakhstan . Obtaining planning permits is maddening . And the judicial system remains slow and quixotic . 
 Indeed , the country 's biggest problem , say many despairing Greeks , is a dysfunctional state . Antonis Samaras retains an old - style penchant for clientelism . Yet impunity may be cracking a bit . A former defence minister is in jail for corruption . The cafe talk is of a senior defence official who told investigators he received so many bribes he could not remember them all ; and of an ex - minister , a nephew of the venerated Constantine Karamanlis , the pre - and post - junta prime minister , hauled up before the courts for driving a car with fake number - plates . But serving politicians do not feel the heat and prosecution of big tax - dodgers remains a rarity . What to make of a bizarre judicial investigation of the man appointed to reform the unreliable statistics office , now accused of corruption for supposedly exaggerating Greece 's fiscal hole ? 
 Restructuring an economy and reinventing the state take time and determination . But Antonis Samaras , even if Antonis Samaras were the man for such a task , is running out of both . Syriza , the radical left - wing coalition , is leading the polls for May 's European election . Its telegenic and wily leader , Alexis Tsipras , is even a pan - European candidate to become president of the European Commission . 
 That will never happen . But a victory by Mr Tsipras in the election could undermine Antonis Samaras's fragile coalition , particularly as members of Antonis Samaras's Socialist allies , Pasok , defect to Syriza . By mid-2015 , the EU could conceivably be dealing with Mr Tsipras as prime minister , or at least kingmaker . Scenting power , he has started to take English lessons and to travel . Abroad , Mr Tsipras 's message is that he does not want to leave the euro ; at home he promises to renege on the memorandum with Greece 's creditors . Even Syriza 's more level - headed members can not say precisely how they could ditch the conditions and keep the loans . 
 Politics is a Greek word 
 Mr Tsipras might yet turn out to be more pragmatic than his rhetoric . Some already liken him to the late Andreas Papandreou , Pasok 's founder , or to Antonis Samaras . Even without the bank runs that some predict would follow a Syriza victory , Mr Tsipras 's pledge to undo many reforms and renationalise the few privatised firms would , at the least , kill off any incipient recovery . 
 A worried Germany could yet ease demands for structural reforms to take the pressure off Antonis Samaras . But a better move would be to make a clear early commitment that the euro zone will honour its semi - promise in 2012 to give Greece additional debt relief , through lower interest rates and longer maturities , now that it has reached a primary surplus . In exchange , creditors should focus not on more austerity , but on the need to reform the economy and the state . The biggest risk in Greece is now political , not financial .

IN GREEK mythology, Cerberus is the three-headed dog guarding the gates to Hades. In modern Greek politics, the troika is the three-headed monster that traps the country in an economic underworld. At the finance ministry in Athens, even the cleaning ladies shout ""murderers"" at visiting members of the troika. In Lisbon protest banners declare ""Fuck the troika"". There is now a popular Portuguese neologism, entroikado, roughly meaning ""economically screwed"". 
As guardian of the creditors, the troika was never going to be loved. The trio of the International Monetary Fund, the European Commission and the European Central Bank was improvised at the time of the first Greek bail-out in May 2010. It has since been at the heart of other rescues, of Ireland, Portugal and, most recently, Cyprus. Increasingly, its role is being questioned. Is the monster ripping too much living flesh from the countries it is supposed to be saving? And who controls the beast anyway? 
The European Parliament has begun an inquiry into the troika's workings. MEPs have been visiting bailed-out countries and have summoned troika officials for a grilling. Socialists accuse the troika of incompetence, even of breaching social rights in the European Union treaties, and want it abolished. Conservatives say the troika was a necessary expedient that has proven its worth, but should be replaced over time. Both sides agree that it rests on a dubious legal base and is alarmingly unaccountable. 
The troika is most bitterly criticised in Greece, and with some reason. Output there has fallen by a quarter since the start of the euro crisis and 27% of the population is out of work. Though Greece has, remarkably, achieved a primary budget surplus (ie, before interest payments) it is once again at odds with its creditors, who are holding back the next tranche of loans. The timing of the dispute is awkward. Greece holds the rotating EU presidency, and its weakened government risks being humiliated in May's European elections by anti-troika parties. Antonis Samaras, the conservative prime minister, claims the problem is caused by a fight between the IMF and the commission; Greece, he says, risks being trampled by ""the two elephants"". 
Indeed, the heads of the troika have often disagreed. The IMF only grudgingly accepted the ECB's insistence that senior bondholders of Irish banks should be spared, increasing the burden on Irish taxpayers. The fund consistently argued, privately at first and then publicly, that the Europeans were pushing austerity too hard. Though it fudged the first Greek bail-out, it has become more hard-nosed in its reckoning of the sustainability of Greece's huge debt. At first this suited Germany, supporting demands that private bondholders take losses to reduce the cost of a second bail-out (the idea horrified the ECB). Now the fund is inconvenient: reducing Greece's debt credibly requires a write-off of official loans. Germany would rather stretch out maturities. But ""extend and pretend"" leaves a large overhang of debt and political uncertainty that deters investors. 
Mr Samaras privately believes the IMF is taking a pessimistic view of its public finances to force Germany's hand. He is telling the troika not to push too hard lest its demands boost the radical left-wing Syriza party, which leads the opinion polls. Germany, and by extension the commission, are sympathetic, even though Greece still has some way to go before running the big surpluses it needs to pay down the debt. For the IMF, the more serious deficit is the long list of unfulfilled structural reforms. If the Europeans really want to keep Syriza out of power, the best answer would be quickly to forgive a big chunk of debt. 
The three heads of the troika have worked more or less amicably, but reform is overdue. To some extent the troika is already fading away. Ireland and Spain (which received a partial rescue for its banks) have ended their bail-out programmes and returned to the markets. Portugal might do the same this spring, perhaps helped by a precautionary line of credit. That leaves the original problem, Greece, and to a lesser extent Cyprus. 
The euro's dog days 
Europhiles hope that a fully fledged European Monetary Fund, built around their rescue fund, the European Stability Mechanism, will one day take over from the IMF, and be subject to scrutiny by the European Parliament. But this would require treaty change to turn the ESM, now an inter-governmental body, into an EU institution. Germany (and other creditors) would have to agree to surrender control of their money. And getting the European Parliament involved in setting macroeconomic conditions is a recipe for paralysis. 
An alternative option might be to leave the problem entirely, or principally, in the hands of the IMF. It has greater expertise and independence than the commission. True, it might not always have had enough money to finance the biggest European bail-outs. But in Greece it would have reduced the bill by cutting the debt sooner and more decisively, while in Ireland it would have bailed in senior bank creditors. The losses would thus have been imposed on those who deserved to bear them: the banks that lent cheap money to reckless borrowers. 
Perhaps co-operation between the Europeans and the IMF will always be needed to deal with the unique problems of highly integrated countries locked in a single-currency zone, with a single interest rate. But the presence of the third head, the ECB, is clearly an anomaly. The central bank's mandate does not stretch to bargaining over budget cuts and reforms to labour markets, or threatening to cut off liquidity if a country does not comply with its wishes. Now that the ECB is becoming the euro zone's main bank supervisor, the conflict of interest is glaring. Its head should surely be the first to be lopped off.","It is time to reform the troika that handles euro zone bail - outs

THE scene is familiar: burly Greek bodyguards hustle a trio of foreign bureaucrats into the finance ministry through a side entrance to avoid a cluster of anti-austerity protesters shouting ""troika go home"". Hours later tight-lipped representatives of the troika--the European Commission, IMF and European Central Bank (ECB)--head back to their hotel while ministry officials spin their version of the talks: heroic Greek resistance to ""excessive"" demands made by the country's international creditors. 
After almost six months of talks the stand-off is still unresolved. Greece has implemented only about half the measures it signed up to last summer, say European Union (EU) officials. The troika returned to Athens on February 24th, intending to reach a deal that could be approved at a meeting of the euro-zone finance ministers on March 10th. That would unlock another sizeable tranche of bail-out funding, enabling Greece to repay EUR 9.3 billion ($12.8 billion) of bonds maturing in May, and start planning a return to international financial markets with a modest bond issue later this year. 
Disputes over liberalising the market for fresh milk and allowing supermarkets to sell non-prescription drugs underline how the fragile coalition government led by Antonis Samaras, the centre-right prime minister, is held hostage by interest groups. Other disagreements grab fewer headlines but could do more harm to Greece's chances of an economic turnaround this year. According to the central bank, stress tests on four big Greek lenders showed they will need about EUR 6 billion in fresh capital to stay solvent. But the IMF has come up with a mind-boggling EUR 20 billion estimate for recapitalising the banks, implying that Greece will be unable to avoid a third international bail-out. (The ECB will perform its own stress tests later this year.) 
Yet the outlook is not all gloomy. The country's recession slowed last year, with the economy shrinking by 3.7% compared with the troika's forecast of 4%. Finance ministry officials seem confident that Eurostat, the European Commission's statistical arm, will confirm an unprecedented primary budget surplus (before interest payments) of EUR 1.5 billion in 2013. 
Another record year for tourism is forecast, driven by a recovery in the EU and more bookings from Russian and Chinese visitors. After months of tough negotiations with the Greek state gas utility, Russia's Gazprom has agreed to cut natural-gas prices by around 15%, backdated to last July. This should result in price cuts of around 12% for hard-pressed Greek consumers. 
Mr Samaras still holds a lead as ""most suitable prime minister"" over Alexis Tsipras, the radical opposition leader, according to opinion polls. Yet his New Democracy party consistently lags a few points behind the Syriza party under Mr Tsipras. The centre-right has lost voters to Golden Dawn, a neo-Nazi party, whose leaders are in jail accused of running a criminal gang. At the same time, Syriza is attracting a steady stream of former supporters of the PanHellenic Socialist Movement, the junior partner in the governing coalition. 
Elections in May for the European Parliament, regional governors and local mayors will show how popular Mr Tsipras is with voters. Syriza officials are already eyeing the presidential vote next March, when Mr Tsipras may have a chance to trigger a general election if parliament fails to elect a new president to replace Karolos Papoulias. With the governing coalition almost 30 votes short of the required three-fifths majority, Syriza's moment may come at that point.","The stand - off between Antonis Samaras and international lenders continues

A North Korean-flagged tanker taking oil from eastern Libya on behalf of a faction opposed to the government in Tripoli was commandeered by a unit of American Navy Seals at the request of the authorities in Tripoli and Cyprus, into whose waters the vessel had sailed. Barack Obama had given the operation his blessing. The tanker's initial unauthorised journey had led to the dismissal of Ali Zidan as Libya's prime minister. 
Syrian government forces dealt a blow to the rebels by retaking the strategic settlement of Yabroud, north of Damascus, the last town in that area in rebel hands. 
An official report said that South Africa's president, Jacob Zuma, had ""benefited unduly"" by spending $20m of state money on a private residence. He was told to repay some of the costs. But while it could be ""legitimately construed"" that Mr Zuma had misled parliament over the renovations, the report also said he may have made a ""bona fide mistake"". 
Friendly rivals 
Bruce Rauner, a wealthy financier from Chicago, won the primary race to be the Republican candidate for governor of Illinois. Infused by the Tea Party, but also a friend of Rahm Emanuel, Chicago's Democratic mayor, Mr Rauner will face Pat Quinn, the incumbent, in November's poll. The state's huge unfunded pension obligations will be a big issue at the election. 
Greasing the diplomatic wheel 
Alfonso Portillo, the president of Guatemala from 2000 to 2004, pleaded guilty in a court in New York to laundering money. Mr Portillo claimed he received a bribe of $2.5m from Taiwan, which he says was in exchange for continued diplomatic recognition of the country during his term in office. The Taiwanese insist everything was above board. 
Air Canada suspended flights to Venezuela, citing security concerns. Around 30 people have died to date in clashes between opposition protesters and security forces. 
Jim Flaherty, Canada's long-serving finance minister, who used stimulus spending to steer Canada through the financial crisis, stepped down. It will be up to his successor, Joe Oliver, to complete the job of balancing the books. 
President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia confirmed the dismissal of Gustavo Petro, the left-wing mayor of Bogota, for mismanagement of waste contracts. The removal of Mr Petro is widely seen as arbitrary and may complicate peace talks with the country's FARC guerrillas. 
Colombia's vice-president said he had turned down an ambassadorship to Brazil because it would have been too warm for his dog (Orion, a German Shepherd). Colombia's foreign minister issued an apology to stop Brazil getting too hot under the collar.",350,Greece,cb-350-2,,False,,0,True

GREECE'S chances of recovery after six years of misery are improving. Its first bond offering in four years, seen as a test of confidence, did much better than expected. Tourists are flocking in for Easter; hoteliers predict a record 19m visitors will come this year. One long-blocked resort project on Crete seems poised to go ahead, raising hopes that foreign investment may flow into other industries such as electricity and ports. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor and often one of Greece's harshest critics, spoke encouragingly to young Greek entrepreneurs during a quick visit to Athens on April 11th. 
Yet the new optimism does not seem to be trickling down to most voters. Unemployment fell slightly in January, but still stood at 26.7%. The social safety-net is stretched so thin that only one in ten of the unemployed gets any benefits. Private-sector workers complain of being paid months in arrears. An estimated 35% of Greeks now live in poverty, according to social workers and charities. 
No wonder Greece's clientelist political system is in tatters. It was once a politician's responsibility to find jobs in the public sector for his (rarely her) constituents. Ambitious MPs extended their patronage to the private sector. ""My application for an assistant supermarket manager's job was picked on merit, but it wasn't approved by the local MP--he wanted someone else,"" says Simos, a 28-year-old economics graduate now working in Germany. 
Angry voters used to shout ""Thieves, traitors"" outside parliament as lawmakers waved through a string of unpopular reforms demanded by Greece's creditors. The centre-right New Democracy (ND) and the PanHellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok), partners in a fractious coalition with only a two-seat majority in parliament, are now widely blamed for the collapse of the patronage system that they built during 30 years of alternating in power. 
Some voters have switched instead to ""anti-systemic"" fringe parties that advocate extreme solutions to Greece's woes. At next month's European elections, being held at the same time as local elections, two new moderate centre-left parties, Elia (Olive tree), led by a group of academics and former ministers, and To Potami (the River), led by Stavros Theodorakis, a television journalist, are trying to plug the gap opened up by Pasok's slump. 
Many on the left now back Syriza, a radical left-wing party led by Alexis Tsipras, a fiery 39-year-old who scares Greece's businessmen with talk of imposing a wealth tax and suspending debt repayments. Evangelos Venizelos, the Pasok leader (and foreign minister), is fighting attempts by George Papandreou, a former prime minister, to reassert authority over the party founded by his father Andreas, Greece's first Socialist prime minister. Mr Venizelos backs Elia, but Mr Papandreou refuses to join him, prompting speculation that he seeks a political comeback to stop his dynastic party disappearing. 
ND has proved Greece's most durable party, surviving several changes of leadership. Yet its voters provide much of the support for the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn, a homophobic, anti-immigrant party whose 18 deputies are accused of running a criminal organisation. Embarrassingly for Antonis Samaras, the prime minister and ND leader, a leaked video showed his chief of staff, Takis Baltakos, telling Ilias Kasidiaris, Golden Dawn's spokesman, that the public prosecutor had found barely a shred of evidence against him. Mr Baltakos quit; and the affair has had little impact on ND's poll rating. Mr Samaras is far ahead of Mr Tsipras as ""most suitable prime minister"". 
Opinion polls nevertheless give a slight edge to Syriza over ND, with both parties consistently on 18-20%. Pasok has sunk to around 3.5%, and could fail to win any European seats. More than three-quarters of Greek voters would like Mr Papandreou to retire from politics. Golden Dawn has fallen from 11% to about 8%, but it could bounce back on a sympathy vote if Mr Kasidiaris, who is running as Golden Dawn's candidate for mayor of Athens, is placed in custody before polling day on May 25th. 
Elia is polling around 5% but is seen by many as a dull and outdated revamp of Pasok. But To Potami has picked up voters at dizzying speed, moving into third place, with 11-15%, within three weeks of its launch. The 50-year-old Mr Theodorakis, wearing a T-shirt and trainers and carrying his trademark backpack, tours the country making low-key speeches about cracking down on tax evasion, promoting meritocracy and creating jobs for young Greeks. These are soothing sounds for voters fed up with traditional politicians. 
Some analysts claim that To Potami is backed by powerful business interests determined to stop Syriza and, perhaps, to force Mr Samaras to call an early general election later this year. Mr Theodorakis insists his party is financed by small donations. Questioned by a Pasok deputy about his party's finances, he snapped back, ""It takes a lot of chutzpah to ask about our campaign when your party has dumped EUR 140m on the Greek taxpayer."" He was referring to unpaid bank loans run up by Pasok when Mr Papandreou was in power. Greece's political landscape is shifting--perhaps for the better.","A new burst of optimism about the economy is not yet luring many voters back to the two mainstream parties

IT COULD have been far worse. As pollsters had predicted, the ruling centre-right New Democracy party of Antonis Samaras, the prime minister, was pushed into second place in the European elections by Syriza, a far-left party led by Alexis Tsipras. His fiery anti-German rhetoric and threats to rip up Greece's bail-out agreement find favour with austerity-battered Greeks. Another ""protest"" party, the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn, captured almost 10% of the vote and came third, even though its leaders are being held in jail on charges of running a criminal organisation. 
Yet Greece looks no more unstable than it did before the elections. Syriza's margin of victory was just under four percentage points, not enough for Karolos Papoulias, the president, to heed Mr Tsipras's demands for a snap general election. Mr Samaras's coalition partner, the PanHellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok), running under a new centre-left umbrella called Elia (Olive Tree), did better than the opinion polls had forecast. Together, New Democracy and Elia finished four points ahead of Syriza. New Democracy also won 11 of 13 regional governor's posts being contested in local elections held at the same time as the European vote. 
A new left-of-centre party, To Potami (The River), took 6.5% of the vote, which would otherwise have gone to Pasok or Syriza. Founded at the start of the year by Stavros Theodorakis, a television journalist, it lost support as the election neared, with voters complaining that its campaign was poorly organised and its platform too vague, but it still got two MEPs. 
Mr Samaras's coalition has only a two-seat majority in parliament, but Evangelos Venizelos, the Pasok leader, is now hopeful of winning back two prominent defectors sitting as independents. With six Golden Dawn lawmakers absent pending trial, it should be easier for Mr Samaras to push through parliament yet another set of structural reforms demanded by the European Union and the IMF. The reforms are a condition for Greece to continue talks with international creditors on reducing the public debt, still unsustainably high at 175% of GDP in 2013. If a debt deal is done this year, and if the economy picks up as expected, Greece's chances of emerging from its bail-out programme would brighten. 
Some observers are puzzled that Syriza has so far been unable to topple Mr Samaras's frail coalition. Six years of recession, an average fall in wages of around 30% and a jobless rate of 26.7%, have left Greeks angry and depressed. Voters made their feelings clear: anti-bail-out parties that won seats in the European Parliament together took more than 40% of the vote. 
Young Greeks are among Syriza's most enthusiastic backers. The party promises to restore the minimum monthly wage to the pre-crisis level of EUR 750 ($1020), hand out cash incentives to revive farming, renationalise companies that have been privatised and patch up the social safety net. 
Yet older voters are wary. Some members of Syriza's radical faction still insist that Greece would do better by defaulting on its huge debt and leaving the euro. Manolis Glezos, a 91-year-old former communist who will be the oldest member of the European Parliament, suggests that the party's welfare programme could be financed through a tax on bank deposits. Business people will keep a close eye on Rena Dourou, the first politician from Syriza to win a big administrative post. She edged out the Pasok incumbent to become governor of the Attica district surrounding Athens--a job with such a large budget, including a EUR 10 billion chunk of EU funding, that the person who holds it is often described as a ""mini-prime minister"".

Three-fifths of Germans are in favour of Angela Merkel, the chancellor, backing a bid by Luxembourg's Jean-Claude Juncker to be the next president of the European Commission despite stiff opposition from Britain, according to a Forsa poll. Only 19% said Mrs Merkel should prioritise good relations with David Cameron, the British prime minister, who is leading the camp opposed to a Juncker presidency.

Greek anti-terrorist police had trailed Nikos Maziotis, one of the country's most wanted fugitives, to a shop selling camping equipment. As he fled, Mr Maziotis opened fire with a handgun. He was arrested after being shot in the shoulder by a police officer. 
Appearing before an investigating judge, Mr Maziotis said his job was ""being a revolutionary"". He is accused of belonging to Revolutionary Struggle, a leftist extremist group that claimed responsibility for staging a rocket attack against the American embassy in Athens in 2007 and for several car-bomb explosions. The most recent, outside the IMF office in Athens in April, came at a time when Greece took another step towards recovery, issuing its first sovereign bond since 2010. 
Athens is enjoying its best year for tourism since it staged the summer Olympics in 2004. Fortunately, the shoot-out in Monastiraki was quickly over. ""If there had been serious casualties, bookings would have been cancelled across the board. It goes to show how fragile the tourist industry is,"" says Panos Asimacopoulos, a travel agent in Athens. 
The Greek recovery is similarly frail. After a record 24 quarters of negative growth, the economy is forecast to grow by almost 1% this year. About 20,000 new jobs will be added over the summer, according to the National Bank of Greece, reversing six years of declining employment. 
Business-confidence indicators are at a six-year high and consumers are again flocking to Athens's shopping malls. The finance ministry says Greece is on track to hit this year's target of a budget surplus, before interest payments, of 1.5% of GDP. 
Even so, dozens of small but significant structural reforms are lagging behind schedule. Greek officials look forward with trepidation to the return in September of the troika, officials from the EU and IMF who supervise the country's EUR 172 billion ($231.5 billion) bail-out. It will be their final joint review of progress: the EU loan programme ends this year although the IMF plans to disburse another EUR 16 billion in 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. 
Negotiations will be tough. The Greeks want to ease the burden on hard-pressed taxpayers by reducing levies on fuel and, perhaps, by fudging an important reform that involves the large-scale dismissal of public-sector workers, which is fiercely opposed by the PanHellenic Socialist Movement, the junior partner in the fractious coalition government led by the centre-right New Democracy party of Antonis Samaras, the prime minister. Another round of painful pension cuts is looming, on top of earlier across-the-board reductions averaging 30%. 
The newish finance minister, Gikas Hardouvelis, an America-trained economist, wants to slash the troika's list of some 700 reforms to be enacted by the end of this year, arguing that such micromanagement is no longer required. With the unpopular ""memorandum"" (as the bail-out programme is called by Greeks) on its way out, it is time, according to Greek officials, for Athens to assume ownership of the next stage of reform. They argue that six years of exacting adjustment are starting to show results, so Greeks are now readier to accept changes that could ensure them a prosperous future. Outsiders are not so sure. They fear that without the troika's rigorous oversight, tax collection will slow, public-sector reform will be dropped and spending controls relaxed. 
Next year's budget will be included in the current EU programme, making slippage less likely for the moment. Debt-relief negotiations, due to start at the end of the year, may also offer an opportunity for Greece's euro-zone partners, the biggest creditors, to set conditions. Greece is seeking longer maturities and fixed rather than floating interest rates on its mountainous debt, set to reach 180% of GDP this year. The troika, much disliked by Greeks, may disappear but tight surveillance of Greek progress will not.","International creditors remain sceptical about Greece's ability to reform without close supervision

ALEXIS TSIPRAS, Greece's radical left-wing opposition leader, believes that by raising his profile abroad he can impress voters at home. His audience last month with Pope Francis, party officials explained, was a ""meeting of minds"". The pontiff, they said, agreed with Mr Tsipras, an atheist, about the unjust suffering caused by harsh austerity policies imposed in the wake of economic collapse, whether in Greece or, in the late 1990s, in the Pope's native Argentina. 
Mr Tsipras's unsuccessful but well-publicised run for president of the European Union's commission as the candidate of the European left also helped boost his credibility back home. His Syriza party finished 3.8% ahead of the governing coalition, led by New Democracy, a centre-right party, in the elections for the EU parliament in May. 
Talk of an early general election is in the air: New Democracy and the PanHellenic Socialist Movement need 180 votes in parliament next February to choose a new president to replace the incumbent, Karolos Papoulias, who is retiring from politics. With only 154 lawmakers between them, it will be a struggle to round up the extra votes from a pool of fractious independents and moderate left-wingers. If they fail, an early general election will be held. Mr Tsipras is in pole position to win. 
Three recent opinion polls showed Syriza's lead over New Democracy widening to up to five percentage points, which, if replicated at a general election, would leave Syriza just ten seats short of a parliamentary majority. One of the latest polls, published on September 27th, shocked the government: it gave Syriza a lead of 11 percentage points over New Democracy. 
Mr Tsipras is no longer pledging to rip up Greece's bail-out agreement, yet many are still suspicious of his new EUR 11 billion ($14 billion) tax-and-spend economic programme. It calls, among other things, for restoring the minimum monthly salary to EUR 750 (about 60% higher than the average salary now being paid by cash-strapped private employers), cracking down on tax evasion, creating 300,000 new jobs and restoring Christmas bonuses for pensioners. ""It's much too good to be true,"" sighed Koula Peristeri, an unemployed factory worker who nonetheless supports Syriza. 
Antonis Samaras, the centre-right prime minister, has riposted with his own promises. Next year's budget will include tax breaks for hard-pressed households, including cuts in levies on property and heating fuel. There is even talk of reducing the corporate tax rate from 26% to 20%. 
Mr Samaras would like to go further but he is constrained by the ""troika"" of bail-out monitors from the EU, the European Central Bank and IMF. Back in Athens for a final review of Greece's progress with reform, they are pressing for yet more austerity measures: another 6,500 dismissals from the civil service this year, further cuts in pensions and a new law permitting mass sackings at larger companies. 
The EU's bail-out programme is due to end in December, leaving the IMF to supervise reforms until March 2016 while disbursing a final EUR 15 billion of loans, an awkward arrangement. Mr Samaras would like to follow the example of Portugal last May and finish the IMF programme early, dispensing with the last round of handouts. ""Greece is ready to stand on its feet again,"" he claimed, signalling that the coalition would prefer to raise its own financing on the international capital markets. 
Ditching the IMF would bring the coalition benefits--a boost in the polls, and perhaps more MPs onside for the presidential vote. But the price of Greek bonds fell sharply after Mr Samaras spoke. It may be too soon to wave the monitors goodbye.","Antonis Samaras's could win the next election

IT WAS just like old times. On October 16th, almost five years to the day after Greece's government triggered the euro crisis by confessing that its budget deficit was twice as big as had previously been reported, yields on Greek ten-year debt rose to 9%, and share prices tumbled. Long-suppressed memories of bail-outs, late-night summits and market meltdowns briefly resurfaced. Perhaps the crisis wasn't over after all? 
The panic soon subsided. Investors' concerns were limited to political uncertainty in Greece, and a plan by the country's embattled prime minister, Antonis Samaras, to exit its IMF bail-out programme early. Greece remains the runt of the euro-zone litter, labouring under a debt pile equivalent to 175% of GDP and a sky-high unemployment rate. But there are slivers of light: after six grinding years of recession, it may grow modestly this year. Elsewhere, too, the champions of austerity have found cause for cheer: unemployment is down and output up (a bit) in Spain and Portugal; Ireland, which had to be bailed out in 2010, seems to be experiencing a mini-boom. Even France and Italy appear finally to have accepted the need to reform. 
The overall picture, though, remains bleak: growth prospects are dismal and unemployment within the euro area stands at 11.5%. What to do? Rather like the quest for peace in the Middle East, everyone knows what to aim for but no one knows how to get there. France and Italy need to cut red tape and ease their labour laws, in exchange for more time to get their budgets in shape. The Germans need to invest at home, and not to stand in the way of the European Central Bank moving towards quantitative easing (printing money to buy sovereign debt). 
But such moves need political and economic co-ordination, and trust is in short supply. The Germans have lost patience with the French, who are wary of being lumped in with the Italians, who think the German obsession with fiscal rigour in a time of recession absurd. Small countries resent big-country stitch-ups (another, on the French budget, looks imminent). Mario Draghi's accommodating stance at the ECB is testing the patience of German politicians and constitutional judges, and inaction at national level will anyway dull the effects of monetary activism. 
The machine is not entirely gummed up. The international chorus urging Germany to loosen up a bit may be getting through; this week the German and French finance ministers said they would present a growth and investment plan by December, though they gave no details. The Poles think they are making headway with a proposed EUR 700 billion ($894 billion) pan-European investment fund, and Jean-Claude Juncker, the incoming president of the European Commission, will soon present his own ideas. But Europe has never lacked for grand investment plans; it is the will to execute them that has been in short supply. 
The smack of firm bond yields 
One way to understand the impasse is to look at the lessons that governments drew from the wrenching years of the euro crisis. Rather than rely on flaky politicians and spendthrift central bankers, Germans and others found the iron rod of the market the most effective means to bring discipline to the wayward. It was spiralling bond yields, not bunga-bunga scandals or legal troubles, that rid them of the troublesome Silvio Berlusconi in 2011. Greece, Ireland and Portugal reformed their economies, and trimmed their budgets, only under the whip of international supervision after being forced into bail-outs. Even in these ""programme"" countries some officials acknowledge, sotto voce, that they would have struggled to make such changes in calmer times. 
For a supposedly slow-moving place, the European Union has shown that in the teeth of crisis it can transform its machinery at great haste. Vast bail-out funds have been engineered, rule books torn up and rewritten, sovereign debt restructured. Many predicted the euro could not survive. In 2012 Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor, and her advisers indeed considered cutting Greece loose, but ultimately determined that the currency must remain intact. Here there has been no lack of political will, of a sort. 
Yet it has evaporated as the crisis has subsided and economies have stagnated. Europe today lacks leadership. Mrs Merkel holds power but does not wield it. Her fellow heads of government are diminished figures, struggling to navigate their own fractured domestic political terrain. The heyday of the installed functionaries in Brussels appears to have been about 20 years ago. Mr Draghi has shown courage but represents no one. And populists are rising to plug the political vacuum, in both creditor and debtor countries. Syriza, a hard-left party that wishes to stiff creditors, may win power in Greece next year. If that happens, the market will probably panic again. 
As with everything in Europe these days, change must come first from Germany. Its (slight) softening on investment is welcome. But more is needed. Officials are wary of an Italian proposal to exclude investment spending from the figures used to calculate budget deficits. But such a change would allow governments to exploit low borrowing costs to earn later returns without falling foul of Brussels's rules. Another idea, proposed by the Lisbon Council, a think-tank, is for the new European Commission to identify reforms needed across euro-zone members, rather than pick on the usual suspects. As a start, it proposes that 11 countries jointly tackle their job-killing labour taxes. 
Europe did well to hold together through the crisis years, but its failures are apparent: a jobless army 25m strong; millions more underemployed. Such numbers do not seem to galvanise politicians the same way bond yields at 7% do. ""We are last-chance Europe,"" Mr Juncker told MEPs this week before they approved his new commission. But not everyone sees it that way.","Europe's leaders need to rediscover the resolve they showed during the euro crisis 
IT WAS just like old times. On October 16th, almost five years to the day after Greece's government triggered the euro crisis by confessing that its budget deficit was twice as big as had previously been reported, yields on Greek ten-year debt rose to 9%, and share prices tumbled. Long-suppressed memories of bail-outs, late-night summits and market meltdowns briefly resurfaced. Perhaps the crisis wasn't over after all? 
The panic soon subsided. Investors' concerns were limited to political uncertainty in Greece, and a plan by the country's embattled prime minister, Antonis Samaras, to exit its IMF bail-out programme early. Greece remains the runt of the euro-zone litter, labouring under a debt pile equivalent to 175% of GDP and a sky-high unemployment rate. But there are slivers of light: after six grinding years of recession, it may grow modestly this year. Elsewhere, too, the champions of austerity have found cause for cheer: unemployment is down and output up (a bit) in Spain and Portugal; Ireland, which had to be bailed out in 2010, seems to be experiencing a mini-boom. Even France and Italy appear finally to have accepted the need to reform. 
The overall picture, though, remains bleak: growth prospects are dismal and unemployment within the euro area stands at 11.5%. What to do? Rather like the quest for peace in the Middle East, everyone knows what to aim for but no one knows how to get there. France and Italy need to cut red tape and ease their labour laws, in exchange for more time to get their budgets in shape. The Germans need to invest at home, and not to stand in the way of the European Central Bank moving towards quantitative easing (printing money to buy sovereign debt).

THE euro area stayed in the doldrums in the third quarter, according to data released on November 14th. Output rose by 0.2% compared to the second quarter, equivalent to just 0.6% on an annualised basis. That was only slightly faster than the meagre 0.1% growth in the second quarter (0.3% annualised). Against this dismal backdrop there was one nice surprise: of the 14 countries in the 18-strong currency union that reported data, Greece fared best, growing by 0.7%. 
It turns out that the Greek recovery started in the first quarter of this year, when it grew even faster, by 0.8%, according to the new figures (for technical reasons quarterly figures had been suspended since 2011); it then slowed to 0.3% in the second quarter. The upturn has meant that the economy is now growing on a yearly basis (see chart). Apart from a blip in early 2010 just before the first of two bail-outs, this is Greece's first spell of annual growth since the start of 2008. Between the pre-crisis peak, in the second quarter of 2007, and the trough at the end of last year, GDP contracted by 27%, a decline rivalling America's in the early 1930s. 
Even though the euro zone as a whole is doing badly, the Greek recovery looks set to continue, at least in the short-term. An economic-sentiment index compiled by the European Commission stood at 102 in October, well above its level a year before, when it was 92, let alone during the worst of the euro crisis, when it sank below 80. Since the indicator tends to track GDP growth this suggests a decent start to the current quarter. 
According to the commission's forecast in early November, the recovery should strengthen next year, when it expects the economy to grow by 2.9%. Growth would come from higher household consumption and investment, as austerity eases, together with a boost from net exports. 
That upbeat outlook may be undermined by political uncertainty, however. The coalition government led by Antonis Samaras, which steered the country away from the abyss after two fraught elections in 2012, could fall next year, possibly as early as February. 
Opinion polls suggest that the next one may be led by Syriza, a left-wing party whose policies would put it on a collision course with the euro zone's creditor countries, especially Germany. Already, ten-year government-bond yields, which had fallen below 6% during the summer, have risen above 8% as investors worry about the country's political prospects.

IT WAS almost exactly five years ago that the euro crisis erupted, starting in Greece. Investors who had complacently let all euro-zone countries borrow at uniformly low levels abruptly woke up to the riskiness of an incompetent government borrowing money in a currency which it could not depreciate. There is thus a dismal symmetry in seeing the euro crisis flare up again in the place where it began. 
The proximate cause of the latest outbreak of nerves was the decision by the Greek government, now headed by the generally competent Antonis Samaras, to advance the presidential election to later this month. The presidency is largely ceremonial, but if Mr Samaras cannot win enough votes in parliament for his candidate, Stavros Dimas, a general election will follow. Polls suggest the winner would be Syriza, a populist party led by Alexis Tsipras. Although Mr Tsipras professes that he does not want to leave the euro, he is making promises to voters on public spending and taxes that may make it hard for Greece to stay. Hence the markets' sudden pessimism. 
As it happens, there is a good chance that Mr Dimas, a former EU commissioner, will win the presidential vote at the end of this month (see page 39). But the latest Aegean tragicomedy is a timely reminder both of how unreformed the euro zone still is and of the dangers lurking in its politics. 
It is true that, ever since the pledge by the European Central Bank's president, Mario Draghi in July 2012 to ""do whatever it takes"" to save the euro, fears that the single currency might break up have dissipated. Much has been done to repair the euro's architecture, ranging from the establishment of a bail-out fund to the start of a banking union. And economic growth across the euro zone is slowly returning, however anaemically, even to Greece and other bailed-out countries. 
But is that good enough? Even if the immediate threat of break-up has receded, the longer-term threat to the single currency has, if anything, increased. The euro zone seems to be trapped in a cycle of slow growth, high unemployment and dangerously low inflation. Mr Draghi would like to respond to this with full-blown quantitative easing, but he is running into fierce opposition from German and other like-minded ECB council members (see page 82). Fiscal expansion is similarly blocked by Germany's unyielding insistence on strict budgetary discipline. And forcing structural reforms through the two sickliest core euro countries, Italy and France, remains an agonisingly slow business. 
Japan is reckoned to have had two ""lost decades""; but in the past 20 years it grew by almost 0.9% a year. The euro zone, whose economy has not grown since the crisis, is showing no sign of dragging itself out of its slump. And Japan's political set-up is far more manageable than Europe's. It is a single political entity with a cohesive society; the euro zone consists of 18 separate countries, each with a different political landscape. It is hard to imagine it living through a decade even more dismal than Japan's without some political upheaval. 
Greece is hardly alone in having angry voters. Portugal and Spain both have elections next year, in which parties that are fiercely against excessive austerity are likely to do well. In Italy three of the four biggest parties, Forza Italia, the Northern League and Beppe Grillo's Five Star movement, are turning against euro membership. France's anti-European National Front continues to climb in the opinion polls. Even Germany has a rising populist party that is against the euro. 
It's the politics, stupid 
Indeed, the political risks to the euro may be greater now than they were at the height of the euro crisis in 2011-12. What was striking then was that large majorities of ordinary voters preferred to stick with the single currency despite the austerity imposed by the conditions of their bail-outs, because they feared that any alternative would be even more painful. Now that the economies of Europe seem a little more stable, the risks of walking away from the single currency may also seem smaller.

A GREEK presidential election is not supposed to make headlines. The ruling party's candidate, typically a low-key retired politician, normally wins the required three-fifths majority after a three-round vote in parliament. In the 40 years since Greece replaced its monarchy with a republic led by a figurehead president, no big political upset has occurred. This time it could be different. 
Antonis Samaras (pictured), the centre-right prime minister, has called a snap presidential election for December 17th, two months before Karolos Papoulias, the 85-year-old incumbent, steps down. This is at best a risky gamble. Sensing that political instability might rekindle the euro crisis, financial markets panicked. Prices on the Athens stockmarket plunged by almost 13% the day after the presidential vote was announced; yields on Greek ten-year bonds soared above 8% (see chart). 
Mr Samaras said he was bringing the presidential vote forward to restore political stability, which he claimed was being undermined by persistent demands from the far-left Syriza party, led by Alexis Tsipras, a radical populist, for an early general election. Since it came first in the European elections in May, Syriza has kept a strong lead over Mr Samaras's New Democracy (ND) party in the opinion polls. Yet if Mr Samaras's candidate for the presidency, Stavros Dimas, a former European environment commissioner, fails to win 180 out of 300 votes in the final round, Mr Tsipras will get his way, as an early general election must then be held. 
Mr Tsipras, a hero of Europe's far left, pledges to restore the minimum wage to its pre-crisis level, to provide free electricity and food to destitute families, and to reduce unemployment by hiring more civil servants. His promises resonate with austerity-hit Greeks, though it is unclear how a Syriza government would finance such expansive policies. Nor is it evident how they can be made compatible with Greece's euro membership. 
Mr Samaras has already lost another bet. His plan to end Greece's four-year EUR 230 billion ($284 billion) bail-out this month and to resume borrowing abroad without a precautionary safety net of credit from the European Union and the IMF collapsed when markets reacted badly, briefly pushing yields on Greek ten-year bonds above 9%. On December 8th Greece accepted a two-month extension of its bail-out to give it time to complete negotiations on more reforms, including pension cuts and tax increases, with the unpopular ""troika"" of monitors from the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF. These would be the conditions for getting a fresh line of credit that would help to allay fears of a default if Syriza were ever to come to power. 
The presidential vote is a bigger gamble. If Mr Dimas is rejected, the opinion polls suggest that New Democracy would lose the subsequent election to Syriza, while its junior partner in the governing coalition, the PanHellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok), might only barely scrape into parliament. Yet Syriza might not win an outright majority, raising the prospect of prolonged political uncertainty that could lead to even more market jitters. 
Mr Samaras, a skilful tactician, has his work cut out. The coalition controls 155 parliamentary votes and can count on another 12 from the 24 independents who have left ND or Pasok in protest against different austerity measures. Another half-dozen independents could probably be persuaded to back the government. Getting the remaining seven votes would mean persuading lawmakers to defect from Independent Greeks (Anel), a fractious right-wing splinter group, or Democratic Left, a moderate leftist party that pulled out of the coalition last year when Mr Samaras high-handedly shut the state broadcaster without any discussion. 
The incentive to break ranks and back the government will be strong: the independents might well lose their seats at the next election, while both Anel and Democratic Left could fall below the 3% threshold for entering parliament. It will be a tense Christmas holiday period: since Mr Dimas has no chance of winning the 200 votes needed in the first and second rounds, the deciding third ballot will take place on December 29th. 
Greece's creditors and allies are watching nervously, from Berlin to Brussels. Some think that by calling an election that his candidate will struggle to win, Mr Samaras has already thrown in the towel. But Pierre Moscovici, the EU's economics commissioner, sounded a note of encouragement, saying he believed that Mr Samaras's gamble meant he was confident that his man would become president.","An early presidential vote could spell trouble for Greece 's government -- and for the future of the euro

EVER since the euro crisis erupted in late 2009 Greece has been at or near its heart. It was the first country to receive a bail-out, in May 2010. It was the subject of repeated debate over a possible departure from the single currency (the so-called Grexit) in 2011 and again in 2012. It is the only country in the euro zone whose official debt has been restructured. On December 29th the Greek parliament failed to elect a president, forcing an early snap election to be called for January 25th. The euro crisis is entering a new, highly dangerous phase, and once again Greece finds itself at the centre. 
Investors promptly swooned, with the Athens stockmarket falling by almost 5% in a single day, bank shares down by even more and Greek ten-year bond yields rising to a new 2014 high of 9.5% (over seven points above those for Italy). The reason for this collective outbreak of nerves is that the polls point to an election win for Syriza, a far-left populist party led by Alexis Tsipras. Although Mr Tsipras says he wants to keep Greece in the euro, he also wants to dump most of the conditions attached to its bail-outs: he would end austerity, reverse cuts in the minimum wage and in public spending, scrap asset sales and seek to repudiate much of the country's debt. Such a programme seems, to put it mildly, to sit uncomfortably with Greece's continuing membership of the single currency. 
The early election is likely therefore to create a political crisis in Greece. What happens beyond that is less clear. Investors seem to be betting that the people of Italy, Spain and France will peek at the chaos in Athens, shudder--and stick to the austerity that Germany's Angela Merkel has prescribed for them. But that seems too sanguine to this newspaper. It is hard to believe that a Greek crisis will not unleash fresh ructions elsewhere in the euro zone--not least because some of Mrs Merkel's medicine is patently doing more harm than good. 
The Greek kalends 
Begin with Greece. For 14 months Syriza has been ahead of the ruling New Democracy party of the outgoing prime minister, Antonis Samaras, in the polls. Although the economy is now growing again, Greek voters remain understandably enraged that GDP should have shrunk by almost 20% since 2010 and that unemployment is still as high as 26%. As it happens, Syriza's poll lead has narrowed in recent weeks, but even if it does not win an outright parliamentary majority, it is likely to be by some margin the biggest party, so Mr Tsipras can expect to lead any coalition government that is formed after the election (see page 21). And this time round Mrs Merkel will struggle to repeat the 2012 trick of asking Greeks to vote again in the hope that they might produce a more sensible government. 
In its policies Syriza represents, at best, uncertainty and contradiction and at worst reckless populism. On the one hand Mr Tsipras has recanted from his one-time hostility to Greece's euro membership and toned down his more extravagant promises. Yet, on the other, he still thinks he can tear up the conditions imposed by Greece's creditors in exchange for two successive bail-outs. His reasoning is partly that the economy is at last recovering and Greece is now running a primary budget surplus (ie, before interest payments); and partly that the rest of the euro zone will simply give in as they have before. On both counts he is being reckless. 
In theory a growing economy and a primary surplus may help a country repudiate its debts because it is no longer dependent on capital inflows. But the Greek economy still has far to go to restore its lost competitiveness, and Mr Tsipras's programme would undo most of the gains of recent years. The notion that EU leaders are so rattled by fears of Grexit that they would pay any price to avoid it was more valid in 2011 and 2012 than it is now. The anti-contagion defences that the euro zone has since built make Grexit easier to contemplate for northern Europeans. Much has been done to improve the euro's architecture, with a new bail-out fund, the European Central Bank's role as lender of last resort and a partial banking union. Moreover, most of the bailed-out and peripheral countries are at last growing again, and unemployment is starting to fall. 
Europe's Lehman moment? 
The result is a game of chicken that neither Greece nor Europe can afford. Even if the Grexit is safer, it is still perilous and unpredictable. There was a worrying echo this week of the Lehman crisis of September 2008. Then the widespread assumption was that the global financial system was robust enough to cope with the failure of a single investment bank. Now investors are putting their trust in the resilience of unemployment-plagued countries like France, whose president has record levels of unpopularity, and Italy, whose economy has shrunk in constant prices in the first 14 years of this century (even Greece's GDP is higher now than it was in 1999). 
That stagnation points to the deeper reason for caution. The continuing dismal economic performance of the euro zone now poses a big political risk to the single currency. In the short run, so long as creditor countries (and that means principally Germany) insist only on budgetary rectitude and reject all proposals for further monetary and fiscal stimulus, that performance seems unlikely to improve. Worse, inflation is now so dangerously low that the euro zone threatens to tip into years of deflation and stagnation worryingly reminiscent of Japan in the 1990s. The continent's leaders have largely failed to push through the structural reforms that could make their economies more competitive. When voters see no hope, they are likely to vote for populists--and not just in Greece. 
As 2015 approached, most of Europe's leaders assumed that the worst of the euro crisis was behind them. The early Greek election shows that hope was premature. Populist parties of left and right that are against the euro, explicitly or not, continue to gain ground in many countries--the leader of Podemos, Spain's highest-polling party, welcomed Mr Tsipras's success in forcing an election this week (see page 22). Ironically, when a country starts to recover is also when popular discontent often boils over. That message needs to be heeded this week in Berlin as much as in Athens.","Politics has returned to haunt the single currency

ANTONIS SAMARAS, the centre-right Greek prime minister, lost one election on December 29th. Now he will have to fight another. His New Democracy party's candidate for president, Stavros Dimas, fell 12 votes short of the required three-fifths majority in a third and final ballot by Greece's 300 MPs. As the constitution demands, a snap general election will now be held on January 25th. ND is trailing the far-left Syriza opposition, according to the opinion polls. Once again, the prime minister's chances of victory look slim. 
Mr Samaras made two television appeals for lawmakers to back Mr Dimas, a former European environment commissioner, for the ceremonial post. His election would have kept the fragile ND-led coalition in power long enough to negotiate an exit from Greece's unpopular austerity programme with the European Union and IMF, including a precautionary credit line from the euro-zone bail-out fund. Many independent and opposition lawmakers who rejected Mr Dimas are unlikely to be re-elected, yet not even self-interest persuaded them to back the government. 
Such stubbornness heralds a bad-tempered election campaign. Alexis Tsipras, Syriza's radical leader, calls Mr Samaras ""finished"". He plans to renegotiate Greece's bail-out. Although he no longer threatens to halt debt repayments unilaterally if his party comes to power, he still wants to secure a big write-off. Greece's creditors would oppose that, and also Mr Tsipras's proposals to reverse other reforms and launch a EUR 11 billion ($13 billion) welfare package, to be financed by better tax collection. With more than EUR 7 billion of lending suspended until Athens reaches agreement with its ""troika"" of creditors on more tax, labour and pension reforms, Greece will soon run into trouble. Hard-pressed taxpayers are already struggling; more than EUR 1 billion of income and property tax goes uncollected every month. Mr Tsipras's promises sound alluring to angry, impoverished Greek voters. 
Yet some left-wingers are suspicious. ""How can Greece dictate terms to the troika when they control the purse-strings?"" asks Lefteris Maniatakis, a former employee of the state electricity company. ""Over the past four years we've seen every government resist their demands at first, but give in eventually."" 
Mr Samaras hopes to shrink and perhaps reverse Syriza's lead over the course of the campaign. He can cite a modest recovery, with GDP growth likely to reach 0.6-0.8% in 2014 thanks to a successful summer tourist season, improved exports and increased EU subsidies for infrastructure projects. Another tactic will be to stress the risks posed by a hawkish but inexperienced left-wing Syriza-led government. Greek shipowners, worried they could be hit by a new wealth tax, are already pulling deposits out of local banks. Small savers could follow their example, fearing a repetition of the 2013 bail-in of depositors in Cyprus. 
Even if Syriza wins on January 25th, it may fall short of an overall majority. Mr Tsipras speaks of a government with Syriza as its ""core"". At least four small parties are likely to win more than 3% of the vote and enter parliament, but only the PanHellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) and To Potami (The River), a new centre-left party led by Stavros Theodorakis, a television journalist, look like possible coalition partners. Mr Tsipras is used to making alliances: he has to keep his own party's disruptive far-left faction on board. Even so, it could be hard for Syriza to work with either Pasok, which has been ND's junior coalition partner for two-and-a-half years, or a cocky newcomer like Mr Theodorakis. 
In 2012 an inconclusive election was followed by another a month later. This time, the deadlines are tighter: a two-month extension to Greece's bail-out expires at the end of February, increasing the pressure on the election winner to form a government fast.

THE far-left Syriza party continues to hold a small but steady lead in the polls ahead of Greece's election on January 25th. After such a long period ahead of the ruling party, this lead seems unlikely to be overturned in just two-and-a-half weeks, say pollsters. 
Yet Alexis Tsipras, the firebrand Syriza leader, has been toning down his anti-European rhetoric. He now says no ""unilateral"" decisions will be taken on Greece's obligations to its creditors, a signal that a Syriza government would not surprise markets with an immediate default. Mr Tsipras's message to voters is simple: a promise to end four bleak years of austerity with a splurge of social spending. 
The cafe debate has shifted, too. It is no longer about whether the centre-right New Democracy party led by Antonis Samaras, the prime minister, can pull off a last-minute victory (Mr Samaras still has a higher personal approval rating than Mr Tsipras), but over which small party would be Syriza's most likely coalition partner. For Syriza officials concede they may well fall short of an outright majority, even with the 50-seat bonus that goes automatically to the party that finishes first. 
The choice could be harder than it looks. At least four small parties are expected to beat the threshold of 3% to get into parliament. The neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party may finish third, even though its leaders are in jail awaiting trial on charges of running a criminal organisation. The perennially Stalinist Greek Communist Party has long rejected Mr Tsipras's overtures favouring co-operation, despite Syriza's own communist roots. 
That leaves To Potami (the River), a new moderate centre-left party founded only in 2014 by Stavros Theodorakis, a popular television journalist, and the PanHellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok), which is tainted by its two-and-a-half-years spent as New Democracy's junior coalition partner. Pasok is already shaping up as the most likely contender to back Syriza: its leader, Evangelos Venizelos, stresses populist measures that he backed while in government, despite opposition from the ""troika"" of Greece's creditors from the European Union and the IMF, such as letting tax debtors stretch repayments out in as many as 100 instalments. Support from disillusioned Pasok voters underpinned Syriza's sudden rise from left-wing outlier into a serious contender for power during Greece's two back-to-back elections in 2012. 
But that was before the intervention of George Papandreou, the prime minister who signed up to the international bail-out in 2010 and a former Pasok leader (and son of its founder). He has unexpectedly launched a new party, the Movement of Democratic Socialists. It could win about 4% of the vote, according to one poll, trading both on the Papandreou political brand and on his appealing vision of a centre-left consensus to rebuild a society exhausted by austerity and polarised politics. If Mr Papandreou splits the Pasok vote, Mr Venizelos's chances of joining a Syriza-led government look slim. 
Meanwhile the messages from Berlin are becoming louder: Greece should in principle stay in the euro, but Mr Tsipras's demands for a debt write-off and spending binge are unacceptable. The spectre of a Grexit, laid to rest while the Samaras government got on with its reforms, has resurfaced. Yet polls show that voters still believe that Greece's place in the euro is secure.

IF THE Syriza party wins Greece's election on January 25th, most think the power to negotiate rests with Angela Merkel, the German chancellor. ""A small minority, centred on the conservative leadership of the German government,"" says Alexis Tsipras, Syriza's leader, ""insists on rehashing old wives' tales and Grexit stories."" 
So it seemed after German officials leaked to Der Spiegel, a weekly, their assessment that Grexit would not only be bearable but might even make the euro stronger. Other problem countries have weathered the crisis (Portugal, Ireland) or are making progress (Spain). The euro zone now has a bail-out fund and a banking union. German banks and insurers have reduced their exposure. 
On January 5th Steffen Seibert, Mrs Merkel's spokesman, insisted that German policy had not changed: it still aimed to hold the euro zone together. Yet all sides are now debating Grexit. Some in Mrs Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) said giving in to Greece would encourage other countries, including France, to rebel against spending cuts and supply-side reforms. Sigmar Gabriel, leader of the Social Democrats, Mrs Merkel's coalition partners, said Germany must not be ""blackmailed"". 
Other Social Democrats recoiled from this tone. So did the CDU's conservative Bavarian sister party. ""We should not behave as a schoolmaster"" to the Greeks, said Horst Seehofer, the Bavarian premier. The whole discussion was ""irresponsible"", warned Simone Peter, a leader of the Greens. Sahra Wagenknecht, a leader of the ex-communist Left party, which sides with Syriza, accused Mrs Merkel's government of ""scare tactics"" to influence the Greek election. 
Carsten Nickel at Teneo Intelligence, a risk consultancy, thinks Mrs Merkel is trying to ""send a strong signal to Athens"" that aid would still be tied to reforms, but that she will be flexible. A deal with Mr Tsipras could include lower interest or longer maturities for Greek debt. But politics limit her room for manoeuvre. One change is the rise of the new anti-euro Alternative for Germany. It did well in state elections last year but is now riven by squabbles. Any softness on Greece will feed its support in Hamburg's election in February. Public opinion remains sceptical. The tabloid Bild says that, if Greece can't play by the rules, Germany should show it the ""red card"". 
This is the tightrope Mrs Merkel must walk after January 25th. Until then, she is likely to keep quiet. Even Austria, usually as strident as Germany on the euro, has struck a note of caution. Its finance minister, Hans Jorg Schelling, told a German newspaper that it was not appropriate to ""meddle in the election campaigns of other countries"". That is the last thing Mrs Merkel can be seen doing.

Sahra Wagenknecht, a leader of the ex-communist Left party, which sides with Syriza, accused Mrs Merkel's government of ""scare tactics"" to influence the Greek election. 
Carsten Nickel at Teneo Intelligence, a risk consultancy, thinks Mrs Merkel is trying to ""send a strong signal to Athens"" that aid would still be tied to reforms, but that she will be flexible. A deal with Mr Tsipras could include lower interest or longer maturities for Greek debt. But politics limit her room for manoeuvre. One change is the rise of the new anti-euro Alternative for Germany. It did well in state elections last year but is now riven by squabbles. Any softness on Greece will feed its support in Hamburg's election in February. Public opinion remains sceptical. The tabloid Bild says that, if Greece can't play by the rules, Germany should show it the ""red card"". 
This is the tightrope Mrs Merkel must walk after January 25th. Until then, she is likely to keep quiet. Even Austria, usually as strident as Germany on the euro, has struck a note of caution. Its finance minister, Hans Jorg Schelling, told a German newspaper that it was not appropriate to ""meddle in the election campaigns of other countries"". That is the last thing Mrs Merkel can be seen doing.

""WE HAVE finally put behind us the vicious cycle of fear and austerity."" So declared Alexis Tsipras, Greece's new prime minister, to crowds cheering his party's election victory on January 25th. Up to then, countries on the edge of the euro zone, forced to embrace harsh budget cuts and pledges of reform as the price for their bail-outs between 2010 and 2013, had--surprisingly--accepted the nasty medicine without a big populist revolt. That changed when Syriza, a radical far-left party led by Mr Tsipras, won power after campaigning to cast aside austerity, backtrack on reforms and insist that Greece's vast debt is slashed. 
These promises may have won votes for Syriza, but they have given investors the jitters. The stockmarket swooned--led by Greek banks, which suffered their biggest one-day drop ever on January 28th--and short-term bond yields jumped. Syriza's pledges are also unacceptable to other European governments, whose already sulky voters resent stumping up any more for Greece. The one that matters most is Germany. The country's chancellor, Angela Merkel, will be wary of any concessions that might encourage insurrectionist parties elsewhere in Europe. 
So will one side give way? Or could the clash lead to the result from which both Greece and its euro-zone partners recoiled in 2012: ""Grexit"" from the euro, with painful consequences all round? Mr Tsipras insists that his country will stay in the euro, a policy backed by three-quarters of the Greek public. He has softened the hostile stance he took in the 2012 election, when Syriza campaigned to tear up the ""memorandum"", the conditions set by Greece's creditors for its two huge bail-outs, amounting to EUR 246 billion ($278 billion) in all and policed by the ""troika"" of the European Commission, the IMF and the European Central Bank (ECB). 
If that calmed nerves in Brussels and Berlin, his first steps as prime minister will have frayed them again. After coming close to winning an outright majority in the Greek Parliament, with 149 seats out of 300 (see chart 1 on next page), Mr Tsipras alarmed creditors by choosing as his coalition partner the Independent Democrats, a far-right party led by Panos Kammenos, which stridently supports Syriza's line on debt relief and an end to austerity. 
His first public act as prime minister was to visit a memorial for 200 Greeks killed by the Nazis in 1944: a gesture wreathed in symbolism for a man who rails against the German-led ""occupation"" of his country. Soon afterwards, he objected loudly to a supposedly unanimous EU statement criticising Russia's renewed aggression in Ukraine. 
A colourful team of ministers hardly suggests that compromise is on the cards. Yanis Varoufakis, appointed as finance minister, is an economist and blogger who has protested against ""the fiscal waterboarding policies that have turned Greece into a debt colony"". Mr Varoufakis honed his skills as an academic, but also once worked as a consultant for a computer-games firm. Panagiotis Lafazanis, a Marxist who heads Syriza's far-left faction, will run a ministry incorporating energy and the environment. At least George Stathakis, the new minister for the economy together with tourism, transport and shipping, the country's biggest industries, is an expert on Greece's first big bail-out, the Marshall plan of 1948. 
Cleaning up Greece 
Mr Tsipras has a mandate from the voters--though Syriza's 36% share of the vote was hardly a landslide--that empowers him to make changes. But how much room for manoeuvre does he have? 
In some respects the country is less vulnerable than it was in the summer of 2012, when it teetered on the brink of falling out of the monetary union. The economy is in better shape. A lingering recession ended last year. Growth of 0.7% in the third quarter of 2014 put Greece among the best performers in the euro zone. The country can now boast a small current-account surplus, a massive turnaround from 2008. The public finances are healthier than in 2012, thanks to the same austerity that Mr Tsipras so abhors. Furthermore, despite Greece's extraordinarily high public debt, worth some 175% of GDP last year, successive concessions have eased its debt-servicing charges to such an extent that annual cash interest payments are now only 3% of GDP. 
Regardless of these improvements, the Greek economy and public finances remain fragile. For the first time since 2012 bank deposits are being run down, by EUR 3 billion in December and reportedly by up to EUR 11 billion this month. The uncertainty is also harming tax revenues, which were much lower than expected in December. It is against this background that Mr Tsipras has pledged to launch a welfare package worth EUR 2 billion to end what he calls Greece's humanitarian crisis; to rehire 12,000 sacked civil servants; and to freeze privatisations. A crackdown on tax evasion by the wealthy and ending the grip on state procurement of Greece's ""oligarchs"", who control media outlets and parts of the judiciary, are unlikely to do enough to pay for Mr Tsipras's largesse. 
Syriza and its supporters may rail against the terms of their bail-outs, but Greece remains dependent on official support. Its debt is rated as junk. Bond yields fell sharply in the first half of 2014; but as political worries came to the fore towards the end of last year, yields jumped back to unaffordable levels (see chart 2). 
Financial health-check 
Even before Syriza's victory, Greece and its creditors were at loggerheads, with the troika wanting more cuts in the 2015 budget and dissatisfied with the government's failure to push through enough reforms. That caused a suspension of payments until the latest review of Greek performance in complying with the bail-out terms was completed. As a result, the European bail-out, which was due to end last year, has been extended until the end of February. The IMF's portion of the rescue is scheduled to run until early 2016. 
Without a successful conclusion of the review, Greece will be denied the final tranche of European loans of EUR 1.8 billion, as well as a further EUR 1.7 billion that this would trigger through another form of help, in which profits on the ECB's holdings of Greek bonds are routed back to Greece. A successful deal would also release a further EUR 3.5 billion from the IMF. In all, Greece could lose EUR 7 billion, together with commitments of an additional EUR 13 billion from the IMF by early 2016. 
That would be disastrous, since Greece has some substantial payments to make over the next few months. To avoid default, Greece must honour repayments of its first bail-out loans from the IMF, together with redemptions of other bonds that are due. The IMF is due to get EUR 2.5 billion in the first quarter of 2015 and the same again in the second quarter. The Greek government must also repay to the ECB EUR 6.7 billion in July and August for sovereign bonds that the central bank bought when trying to quell market panic after Greece's first bail-out, in May 2010. Although the government apparently has EUR 10 billion stashed away in public-sector reserves, getting at these quickly will be difficult. And even if it is possible, making the payments to the IMF and the ECB could push Greece to the limit--especially if the tax take continues to fall short. 
This puts Mr Tsipras under a lot of pressure to agree upon an extension of the current EU bail-out programme. The EU would have no objection to that. Having to ask--a condition set by Brussels--would mean an embarrassing about-turn for the new prime minister; yet he does not have much choice. Germany and the IMF have made it clear that debt relief cannot be discussed unless Greece completes the review, stays on track with fiscal targets and carries out more structural reforms. 
Even if the bail-out programme were extended, that would not resolve the dispute between Mr Tsipras and the rest of Europe. The quarrel might mean that the ECB takes a tougher line with Greek banks. At present it is prepared to lend to them on the same terms as other euro-zone banks. But if Mr Tsipras is too provocative, the ECB will insist that funding is ""emergency liquidity assistance"" at the Bank of Greece's risk rather than that of all euro-area central banks. Besides sending a message to the Greek government, it would raise the cost of the banks' borrowing. The ECB could take such a decision in the next few days if Mr Tsipras sends it the wrong signals. 
Just days after the celebrations among Syriza supporters in the wake of their election triumph, the mood in Athens is edgy. If depositors panic and banks wobble, that could lead to a crisis that might end either with Grexit or in a humiliating climb-down that spells an early end for the new government--as well as political chaos. 
Avoiding a collapse of the banks is merely the first task for Mr Tsipras. If he gives in to the demands of the troika, Syriza's fractious far-left wing, the Left Platform, is bound to rebel. This group of Maoists, Marxists and supporters of Che Guevara controls about a third of the party. Hungry for power, the Left Platform dropped its ideological objections to co-operating with Mr Kammenos's party in return for Mr Lafazanis getting his cabinet post. An angry or disappointed Mr Lafazanis could split the party and bring down Mr Tsipras's government. 
Writing off a write-off 
Even if Mr Tsipras wants to make peace with Greece's creditors, an accident may happen along the way. His government is frighteningly inexperienced for the size of the task it must undertake. The dangers of sounding unnecessarily aggressive or acting hastily are magnified by the delicate negotiations it faces. Only one cabinet member, Giannis Dragasakis, a former central-committee member of the Greek communist party, has ever served in government before. 
European creditors can make a few limited concessions. Debt forgiveness--writing off some official debt--has been ruled out. But it would be possible to relieve the debt burden by further extending the maturities on the loans, although these have already been stretched to an average of 30 or so years. On the other hand, the German government will object to any let-up in Greece's own effort to bring down the debt burden, which involves running a sustained primary (ie, before interest) budget surplus of more than 4% of GDP from 2016. And it is just as concerned to prevent Mr Tsipras rowing back on reforms that are seen as indispensable if Greece is to pay its way and not rely on more transfers. 
If Mr Tsipras pushes his luck, creditors are likely to push back equally firmly, insisting that failure to abide by their terms would mean Greece being expelled from the monetary union. The German government came close to taking this decision in 2012, but pulled back; Mrs Merkel was worried about the wider consequences for the euro zone. However, officials in Berlin reckon that the risk of financial and economic contagion is now lower. 
The euro area now has a permanent rescue fund. And with the ECB launching its big programme of quantitative easing in March, creating money to buy sovereign bonds and other assets, a flare-up in the bond markets of other peripheral countries seems less likely. There has so far been little sign of contagion from Greece to the rest of southern Europe. The political risks for Mrs Merkel are also lower, because it would be Mr Tsipras who would be blamed rather than her. 
That calculation may yet be proved wrong. Grexit would breach the principle that euro membership is irrevocable, making investors worry about other countries that might be forced out. But whatever the wider impact, the consequences for Greece would be traumatic. Overnight, euros would become a foreign currency as the government converted domestic assets and liabilities into drachmas. A new Greek currency would immediately plummet in value. The IMF reckoned nearly three years ago that it would fall by 50%; some economists thought it would fall by even more. 
Such a depreciation would restore Greek competitiveness with a bang, helping to lure tourists and boost exports. But it would also trigger inflation, as prices of imports shot up. More important, currency depreciation would make Greece's foreign debts, which would remain in euros, unsustainable. That would cause the country to default, which could lock it out of global capital markets for years. 
The shock of Grexit would hit the economy hard. The IMF estimated in early 2012 that, in the first year, it could depress GDP (which was already falling sharply) by an additional eight percentage points. The impact now might be less severe, but Greece would still lurch from its recovery into a renewed and sharp recession. The longer-term benefits from regained competitiveness might also be lost if it were forced to leave the EU and the single market as well as the euro, as a widely cited legal paper from the ECB maintains. 
Even if Grexit is only halfway as ruinous as these projections suggest, Mr Tsipras should be wary about provoking such an outcome, especially as Greeks want to remain in the euro. This suggests that, despite a bigger-than-expected election victory, his bargaining position is weak. The task for European governments is to find a way for him to retreat from his demands without losing face altogether. 
His war-memorial visit and complaint about the official statement on Russia are dismissed by officials in Brussels as gestures for domestic consumption. A meeting of EU heads of government on February 12th, Mr Tsipras's first, may be more revealing. What can he achieve? On paper he has little leverage. And he has aroused high expectations among voters and his fractious party. 
Discussions with Brussels are only part of the story. Any bail-out extension must be approved by parliaments in Germany, Finland, the Netherlands and Estonia: four countries not renowned for their forbearance towards fiscal sinners. The attitudes of such hardline governments will matter at least as much as those of EU institutions. 
The Finnish government, which in 2011 refused to back Greece's second bail-out until it was offered collateral, has every reason to be tough: it faces a difficult election in April, and there are few votes to be won by being nice to Greeks. Similarly, the Dutch government must contend with the threat of Geert Wilders's populist Party for Freedom, which has lately been leading the opinion polls. 
Yet the crucial country is Germany. Politicians in Mrs Merkel's ruling coalition have couched their intransigence in appeals to the sanctity of rules. Steffen Seibert, her spokesman, insists that the new Greek government must meet the commitments made by the outgoing one. Wolfgang Schauble, Germany's finance minister and a stern advocate of fiscal probity, declared both that he respected the outcome of Greece's election and that the new government must respect the ""obligations"" to which its predecessor had signed up. 
The talk is tough at the centre of German politics. Any hint of softness towards Greece might increase the appeal of the political fringes. The Left, a party that descends from the Communists who once ruled East Germany and that sees Syriza as an ideological ally, cheered what it hoped was the start of an uprising against Mrs Merkel's policies. On the populist right the Alternative for Germany, a party founded in 2013 with a call to dissolve the euro, also celebrated, believing that the Greek election would bring its goal closer. Its leader, Bernd Lucke, suggested that Greece should leave the single currency at once. 
Heading for the Grexit? 
Earlier this month, Mrs Merkel's government let it be known that it now sees Grexit as ""bearable"" for the rest of the euro. She prefers to keep Greece in the single currency, and may be willing to yield to Mr Tsipras just enough to let him declare victory at home--for instance, by extending the maturities of existing Greek debt. But she is unlikely to go further. The prospects of cutting Greek debt by up to half, as Mr Tsipras has demanded, appear remote. Giving handouts to governments that throw tantrums, runs the argument, makes it harder to maintain pressure on larger countries in need of reform, such as France and Italy. 
As ever, the looming Greek crisis is about far more than Greece. Going soft on Greece may also embolden Syriza-like parties in other countries (see Charlemagne). In Spain Podemos, a party that emerged from nowhere to lead the polls, has closely allied itself with Syriza. Its leader, Pablo Iglesias, singles out Mrs Merkel, with her ruthless demands for austerity, as the foe of Europe's downtrodden. It is perhaps no coincidence that ministers from Spain and Portugal, both run by centre-right governments facing anti-austerity challenges in elections this year, were among the first to warn of the dangers of dancing to Syriza's tune after the election. 
In this context, German lawmakers are unlikely to look upon Greek demands with sympathy. But many Europeans want to change the conversation: under its new president, Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission has, for example, been battling to win support for an ingeniously engineered pan-European investment package. The French and Italian governments, in danger of incurring the EU's wrath over their fiscal stances, are similarly keen to leave the austerity years behind. 
Until now, Europe's fiscal squabbles have rarely amounted to more than a phoney war. Politicians such as Antonis Samaras, the man Mr Tsipras replaces, who denounced austerity as opposition leaders, found themselves signing up to it once they were in office. The election of Francois Hollande as France's president in 2012 was supposed to tilt Europe in a more growth-friendly direction, but the country's structural weaknesses and his own missteps have weakened his hand. Germany was never short of noisy critics, but none of them held office. With Mr Tsipras's election, that is no longer the case.","Syriza 's success increases the risk of "" Grexit "" and will embolden anti - austerity parties across Europe

The Left , a party that descends from the Communists who once ruled East Germany and that sees Syriza as an ideological ally , cheered what it hoped was the start of an uprising against Mrs Merkel 's policies . On the populist right the Alternative for Germany , a party founded in 2013 with a call to dissolve the euro , also celebrated , believing that the Greek election would bring its goal closer . Its leader , Bernd Lucke , suggested that Greece should leave the single currency at once . 
 Heading for the Grexit ? 
 Earlier this month , Mrs Merkel 's government let it be known that it now sees Grexit as "" bearable "" for the rest of the euro . She prefers to keep Greece in the single currency , and may be willing to yield to Mr Tsipras just enough to let him declare victory at home -- for instance , by extending the maturities of existing Greek debt . But she is unlikely to go further . The prospects of cutting Greek debt by up to half , as Mr Tsipras has demanded , appear remote . Giving handouts to governments that throw tantrums , runs the argument , makes it harder to maintain pressure on larger countries in need of reform , such as France and Italy . 
 As ever , the looming Greek crisis is about far more than Greece . Going soft on Greece may also embolden Syriza - like parties in other countries ( see Charlemagne ) . In Spain Podemos , a party that emerged from nowhere to lead the polls , has closely allied itself with Syriza . Its leader , Pablo Iglesias , singles out Mrs Merkel , with her ruthless demands for austerity , as the foe of Europe 's downtrodden . It is perhaps no coincidence that ministers from Spain and Portugal , both run by centre - right governments facing anti - austerity challenges in elections this year , were among the first to warn of the dangers of dancing to Syriza 's tune after the election . 
 In this context , German lawmakers are unlikely to look upon Greek demands with sympathy . But many Europeans want to change the conversation : under its new president , Jean - Claude Juncker , the European Commission has , for example , been battling to win support for an ingeniously engineered pan - European investment package . The French and Italian governments , in danger of incurring the EU 's wrath over their fiscal stances , are similarly keen to leave the austerity years behind . 
 Until now , Europe 's fiscal squabbles have rarely amounted to more than a phoney war . Politicians such as Antonis Samaras , the man Mr Tsipras replaces , who denounced austerity as opposition leaders , found themselves signing up to it once they were in office . The election of Francois Hollande as France 's president in 2012 was supposed to tilt Europe in a more growth - friendly direction , but the country 's structural weaknesses and his own missteps have weakened his hand . Germany was never short of noisy critics , but none of them held office . With Mr Tsipras 's election , that is no longer the case .",350,Greece,cb-350-2,POST TERM,True,prime minister,2,True

RATINGS for the evening news soared this week as Greeks tuned into a new show: of Alexis Tsipras, their new prime minister, and his colourful finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, sharing the spotlight as they separately toured European Union capitals. For Greeks worn down by five years of austerity, it was cheering to see their new leaders ""standing up to the euro-zone bosses"", as an official from PAME, the communist trade union, put it. 
Mr Tsipras's Syriza party has lost no time getting its anti-austerity message across since defeating Antonis Samaras's New Democracy government on January 25th. Syriza fell two seats short of a majority in parliament, so Mr Tsipras signed up the Independent Greeks, a right-wing anti-austerity party, whose leader, Panos Kammenos, became defence minister. 
True to Syriza's promises, Mr Tsipras and Mr Varoufakis challenged their first visitors, Martin Schulz, president of the European Parliament, and Jeroen Dijsselbloem, chairman of the eurogroup of finance ministers, demanding an end to austerity, the dismantling of the ""troika"" of the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF, and an international conference to restructure Greece's debt of 175% of GDP. In return, the Syriza government would crack down on tax evasion and corruption, which previous administrations ignored, and produce a programme of structural reforms in June. 
To the delight of many Greeks, other cabinet members also announced measures to reverse many earlier reforms: pension increases, a 45% rise in the minimum wage, a return to collective bargaining and a freeze on privatisations. Poor households will get food stamps and free electricity. Mr Kammenos said that the armed forces would have their pay restored to pre-crisis levels, plus compensation for four years of pay cuts. Mr Varoufakis has not spelt out the budget cost of all this, though he promises still to run a small primary surplus (ie, before debt interest). 
The reversal of reforms and the tough stance toward Greece's creditors have increased the new government's popularity. Opposition by the new foreign minister to more sanctions against Russia, albeit short-lived, was also welcomed by many who want the government to defend Greek interests, even against NATO and the EU. One opinion poll gave Mr Tsipras a 68% approval rating after his first week, better than any other recent Greek leader. 
Yet the exhilaration could evaporate if Mr Tsipras and Mr Varoufakis fall out with the EU. They have watered down their demands: instead of a debt write-off, Mr Varoufakis now proposes a limited repayment via special bond issues. Greece's creditors insist it must stick to the terms of its bail-outs. Greeks are still removing cash from their bank accounts, though the pace of withdrawal has slowed since the election. On February 4th the ECB said it would no longer accept Greek government bonds as collateral. Earlier the same day an issue of six-month bonds was only just covered, because foreign investors failed to buy.

NEVER imagine that the euro zone is the only club in which Greece is a maverick player. The Hellenic relationship with NATO, and bilateral defence ties with the United States, have long been important (although many would say diminishing) and contested. 
Whatever the strains, America has often put discreet pressure on its European allies to avoid a rift with Greece, as much because of geopolitics as economics. In recent days, that pressure has been felt once more. It is not just linked to the services that Greece now delivers to NATO, which are modest; it also reflects the perils that would arise if Greece cut loose from all western clubs. 
In many ways, the odd thing about Greek-NATO relations is not the history of tension but the fact that they exist at all. On the Hellenic left, it is axiomatic that Greece suffers from being a pawn in western strategic games which connived at military rule from 1967 to 1974. 
Greece quit NATO's military wing for six years in 1974 after Turkey overran northern Cyprus; in 1981 leftists took power, pledging to expel American bases and ultimately take Greece out of NATO. In the 1990s Greek opinion was pro-Serbia and loathed NATO bombing that country. Study the wishlist of the ruling Syriza party today, and you will see ""leaving NATO"" somewhere at the end. 
Yet the relationship trundles on and seems unlikely to stop. Greece hosts an air and sea facility on Crete, and American early-warning aircraft use a base near Albania. Greek ships and aircraft are listed among NATO assets, although austerity has affected their readiness. Despite Greek-Turkish rows over Aegean airspace, relations between those countries, which are both allies and historical rivals, seems just about manageable, and underpinned by strong economic ties. 
Like every other small NATO member, Greece horse-trades to boost its role in the alliance structure; and as is noted by Jonathan Eyal of the Royal United Services Institute, a think-tank in London, its bargaining strength has ebbed as other southeast Europeans have joined NATO. 
Quitting NATO would be a gift to regional rivals, and the new defence minister, Panos Kammenos, vows that Greece will stay for the foreseeable future. A member of a small nationalist party in coalition with Syriza, Mr Kammenos backs co-operation with America as well as Greece's warming ties with Israel, even if he feels cultural bonds with Russia as a devout Orthodox Christian. 
Such details interest an American administration which knows Greece's new rulers less well than previous ones. (Two recent prime ministers, George Papandreou and Antonis Samaras, were room-mates in an American college.) American fear of ""losing"" Greece is palpable but has less to do with its military value and more to do with general fear of defences unravelling, says Wayne Merry, a fellow of the American Foreign Policy Council. Any breach in the dyke would bode ill, especially as Islamist fighters in Libya are just a speed-boat ride away. 
America will also watch to see whether the sympathy some of Greece's new rulers feel for Russia (and reluctance to impose sanctions over Ukraine) leads to real strategic change. So far it has not.","America, much more than Europe, sees strategic stakes in the Aegean

IN SYNTAGMA Square, outside Greece's parliament, the No vote in the July 5th referendum was a cause for celebration--a moment of in-your-face triumph for voters fed up with five years of joblessness and powerlessness. ""Tsipras, we love you,"" they sang. ""We voted for a revolution for all the people of Europe,"" said an unemployed 24-year-old; ""We voted against broken dreams,"" said a fresh-faced student. 
The exhilaration was due, in part, to the unexpected size of the No majority, which at 61.3% was far higher than any poll had suggested. The margin differed according to age and political inclination (see chart) but the No campaign won in every region, including the conservative borderlands adjoining Bulgaria and Turkey. Only a handful of Athens's wealthiest enclaves, along with the shipowning island of Andros, fielded a majority for Yes. The defeat was so resounding that Antonis Samaras, one of a number of former prime ministers who urged a Yes vote, immediately resigned from his position as leader of the main opposition New Democracy party. 
This all added up to a personal triumph for Alexis Tsipras, prime minister and head of the left-wing Syriza group in parliament. But it was hardly one to savour. Mr Tsipras had promised the voters that a No would strengthen his hand in last-ditch negotiations with the European Union and IMF and that it would not entail the departure from the euro that more than 75% of Greeks wish to avoid. Without help he cannot honour either promise. 
Careful to avoid sounding triumphant, Mr Tsipras immediately made the conciliatory gesture of sacking Yanis Varoufakis, the finance minister whose hectoring tone and heightened rhetoric--he referred to the creditors as ""terrorists""--vexed and offended the euro-zone politicians who had to deal with him. Euclid Tsakalotos, a soft-spoken Oxford-trained economist who had earlier replaced Mr Varoufakis as negotiator with the EU and IMF, replaced him as finance minister, too. 
Hoping to rally the country's other political parties behind him Mr Tsipras called their leaders together. The meeting was sour in its mood; it took almost seven hours to hammer out a statement calling for a deal that would be socially fair, limit austerity to the minimum, include generous funding for growth and address the country's debt. ""We backed him not because we think the premier will necessarily pull off a deal but because if the worst happens we'd all go down together,"" said an MP from To Potami (The River), a centre-left party. 
If Mr Tsipras does get an agreement, though, it will not be one which meets the aspirations of that all-party statement. The rest of the euro zone is in no mood for compromise (see previous story); it wants a harsher deal than previously offered. The 40-year-old premier would have to acquiesce to tax increases and cuts in wages, pensions and spending he has long fought. 
Backing from the centrist opposition means that a new bail-out agreement would be able to pass a vote of approval in parliament, but it would probably split Syriza; the ensuing turmoil could force Mr Tsipras to resign and call an election. ""We're about to find out whether Tsipras has grown up enough to put country before party,"" said a former centre-left politician who helped steer Greece into the euro a decade and a half ago. 
If, instead, there is no bail-out and Grexit ensues, some analysts fear a level of social unrest that would drive Mr Tsipras to adopt authoritarian measures. Panos Kammenos, the defence minister, and leader of the small right-wing Independent Greeks party, Syriza's coalition partner, caused uproar last week when he said the army can always ""guarantee the country's internal security."" Others imagine Grexit would bring with it a government of national unity led by a non-political public figure. 
Meanwhile Greeks line up to withdraw the daily EUR 60, which is all their ATMs have allowed them since capital controls were imposed at the end of June and the banks partially closed. In practice, apparently due to a shortage of EUR 20 notes, many only get EUR 50. Old people wait outside the handful of banks allowed to open to pay pensions in temperatures well over 30[degrees]C. ""For a government that promises to protect pensioners, it's very disappointing,"" says Dimitris, a 76-year-old post-office worker who voted for Syriza in January but, having failed to get his full pension last week, voted Yes on the 5th. 
Despite the withdrawal limits, queues at ATMs stay long, and not just because they are hotbeds of gossip; Greeks recognise that a banknote has more lasting value than a line in a bank statement which can be redenominated into a new currency, or subjected to a ""haircut"", at any time. ""Everyone I know has a stash of cash under the bed,"" says Stamatia, a call-centre worker. One of the only businesses to have boomed in past months has been home-security and safe installation. 
One unexpected consequence of the desire to keep bank balances low enough to avoid any haircut is an uptick in electronic income-tax payments; although businesses prefer cash, the government can hardly be seen to do so. Dimitris Mardas, the deputy finance minister, says that this means the government may be able to pay civil servants their mid-month salary on July 13th, something which had previously seemed very unlikely. It is, though, the smallest and most temporary of silver linings. With liquidity assistance to the banks capped (see box) the ATMs will soon start running dry. A senior banker in Athens says debit cards and online banking cannot outlast the cash system by more than a few days, or a week at the outside.","The landslide for No felt good at the time

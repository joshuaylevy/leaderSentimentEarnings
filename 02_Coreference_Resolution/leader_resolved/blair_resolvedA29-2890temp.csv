The death of Barry Porter, the convivial MP for Wirral South, on November 3rd reduced Mr Major's Commons majority to one. Uncertainty surrounds Sir Nicholas Scott, the equally convivial Tory MP for ultra-Tory Chelsea, who was refused a vote of confidence by his local party executive on November 4th after being found lying on the pavement by police at his party's conference in October. Sir Nicholas denies he might quit, and will appeal to a vote of local members next month. But even if he stays on, Mr Major's majority will fall to nil when Labour wins, as it is bound to, a byelection which is due in Leeds Central. 
Conservative Central Office faces a test of timing over the Wirral by-election. The party that held a vacated seat decides when it should be fought; but by convention it normally has to be held within three months of the vacancy arising. The seat would fall on a swing to Labour of 8.2%. Tory optimists argue for leaving it as long as possible in the hope of holding it. In 1991, a better-than-expected performance in the Langbaurgh by-election launched John Major on his re-election campaign. Pessimists argue that the seat could easily be lost even in February, taking the wind out of Tory sails; they want to get it over fast. But if it is lost, Mr Major would enter the new year heading a minority government. 
This would be uncomfortable. Mr Major's closest advisers reckon his best chance lies in a long election campaign. The prime minister has said that he will not try to hang on until the last legal date of May 22nd 1997. The country might not think well of a government that clung on beyond a five-year term, argue the advisers; and, in any case, the county council elections on May tst would cost them several days' campaigning. So they would prefer that Mr Major declared on January ist that the date will be May ist. 
This assumes that he is not voted out in the meantime. On November 4th, buoyed by a 95% vote by party members in favour of his party's outline manifesto, Tony Blair, Labour's leader, promised six months of ""guerrilla warfare"" to try to force an early election. However, success is likely to depend less on the ability of Labour's leader to imitate the late Mao Zedong than on the tactical calculations of the Ulster Unionists. So far, they have tended to back Mr Major. But they voted against him this year over the Scott report on arms to Iraq, and David Trimble, their leader, said last month that he would be prepared to bring down Mr Major's government ""at the fag end of its life"". Number lo is certainly not taking him for granted. ",200,United Kingdom,"INTIMATIONS of mortality start to crowd in on John Major's government.

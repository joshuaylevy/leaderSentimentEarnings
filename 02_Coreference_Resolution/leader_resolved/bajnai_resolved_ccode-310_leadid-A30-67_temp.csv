HUNGARY'S ruling Socialists are desperately seeking a new prime minister. Ferenc Gyurcsany resigned dramatically on March 23rd, telling his party congress that, ""I hear that I am the obstacle to the co-operation required for changes, for a stable governing majority and the responsible behaviour of the opposition...I am eliminating this obstacle now. I propose that we form a new government, under a new prime minister.""
Years of mismanagement and the Socialists' failure to trim public spending enough, or to reduce a huge pension burden, have left Hungary's economy on the edge of meltdown. Gordon Bajnai, the economy minister, told a leftist daily, Nepszabadsag, that Hungary faced ""a currency crisis that could trigger social and economic collapse. We must take determined steps to stop this from happening."" 
The Socialists are likely to choose Mr Gyurcsany's successor early next month. He may not even be a party member. Two men often mentioned are Gyorgy Suranyi, a former governor of the central bank who introduced an austerity package in the 1990s, and Ferenc Glatz, a former president of the Hungarian Academy of Science. Lajos Bokros, a reforming finance minister in the 1990s, may also be a contender.
Mr Gyurcsany, once hailed as a young moderniser, never really recovered from the riots that erupted in autumn 2006 after his confession that his government had lied repeatedly about the state of the economy. His timid attempts to cut Hungary's stifling tax burden have had little impact. This month the forint hit a record low, despite a $25 billion rescue package led by the International Monetary Fund. The unemployment rate has risen to 8.4%. The government forecasts that GDP will shrink by 3.5% this year; Capital Economics, a think-tank, predicts a fall of 7.5%.
Hungary remains hobbled by corruption (a cosy cartel, especially in local government, slices up European Union funds), a heavy burden of debt and a black economy that may account for one-fifth of GDP. Despite the crisis, a sense of unreality prevails. Nationalist intellectuals use the language of the 1930s to rail against foreign capital and ""cosmopolitan"" influences. Viktor Orban, leader of the opposition Fidesz party, laments that more than 80% of the financial system is ""in foreigners' hands"". Social tensions are rising, after a string of attacks on Hungary's Roma gypsies that followed two highly publicised murders allegedly perpetrated by Roma.
It is no surprise that Mr Gyurcsany's approval rating is barely 18%. Two-thirds of voters now back Fidesz, against 23% for the Socialists. Mr Orban has demanded an early election, calling the Socialists ""Hungary's disgrace"". Yet there may be less to Mr Gyurcsany's departure than meets the eye. A former communist youth leader turned multimillionaire, he is a wily operator. His resignation was choreographed, and he was swiftly re-elected as party chairman. The minority government depends on support from the liberal Free Democrats and pro-business Democratic Forum, neither of which wants an early poll. A new prime minister might let the Socialists say they were forced into unpopular spending cuts, leaving a rejuvenated Mr Gyurcsany to pull the strings behind the scenes.

THANKS to a mix of luck and good decisions, the economic apocalypse that loomed over central and eastern Europe seems to have been averted. But dizzy current-account deficits, wild foreign-currency borrowing and reckless fiscal policy are leaving a horrible hangover for some. The IMF forecasts a 4.9% average fall in GDP, with far bigger falls for some. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) reckons on a 5.2% drop. The downturn is certainly nasty; but some changes have staved off the worst.
One change is that outsiders now assess risk more calmly and rationally. All the former planned economies remain capital-thirsty. But otherwise they are all different. Indeed, a rare common factor among 20-odd countries in the region with the ""ex-communist"" tag is that they dispute its relevance. Tarring all with the mistakes of overheated Latvia, chaotic Ukraine or debt-sodden Hungary makes no sense. Nor does lumping together rich and poor countries, or those in the European Union and those outside. Exchange-rate regimes vary: two countries are in the euro; five countries have pegged their currencies to it; others float. 
So far at least, speculators who counted on contagion toppling countries like dominoes have little to show for it, while those who bet the other way have juicy gains. Poland's stockmarket is up by nearly 40% since its low in February, Hungary's has risen by half and Russia's by nearly 90%.
Outside help is also now better co-ordinated. The previously standoffish IMF co-operates with the European Commission, national governments and the banks. Once seen as a lender of last resort, it now acts pre-emptively. In May it gave a $21 billion credit line to Poland, the biggest and strongest economy in the region. That is quite different, officials stress, from the emergency rescues of Belarus, Latvia, Hungary, Romania, Serbia and Ukraine.
The IMF is also behaving more gently. Ukraine was originally told to balance its budget this year. Now the IMF says a deficit of 4% of GDP is realistic; this month it released its latest $2.8 billion tranche. Officials are uneasy about insisting on fiscal tightening that may aggravate recession. Latvia is likely to be allowed to run a 7% deficit for this year--in return for promising, really and truly, to reach 4% in 2010.
A third change is that more aid has been given to western banks that face souring loans, typically to clients in Hungary and the Baltic states who borrowed in euros or Swiss francs. As outsiders cut back, a credit squeeze is threatening even healthy borrowers. A joint initiative by the EBRD, the World Bank and the European Investment Bank (which used to lend only to state-backed infrastructure projects) has raised $24.5 billion for banks and other firms across the region. The EBRD is putting EUR 432m ($590m) into UniCredit, an Italian bank heavily exposed in eastern Europe. It is thinking of investing in 12 other west European banks. Countries such as Sweden have national schemes too. 
In a new report, the IMF argues that European banks still need a lot more help. But the cash and guarantees given already have eased the greatest threat to the region: that western banks might pull out or sink under the weight of their eastern loan books. Meanwhile central Europe, home of many big car factories, has gained from rich-country governments' efforts to help their car industries. Neil Shearing of Capital Economics, a consultancy, reckons that German and other scrapping schemes to boost car sales will add fully 1% to GDP in Slovakia, and 0.5% in the Czech Republic and Hungary. 
The biggest worry now is the Baltic three, which are seeing the sharpest falls in GDP. Estonia's first-quarter figures showed a year-on-year decline of 15.6%. The fall in Latvia was a stunning 18% and in Lithuania 12.6%. Monetary policy cannot counteract this, since all three are pegged to the euro. And fiscal policy offers no respite. Politicians are pushing through spending cuts, not only to reassure external lenders, but also to meet the Maastricht deficit target of 3% of GDP so as to adopt the euro soon (by 2011, Estonia hopes).
""The crisis is even good if it makes the state more efficient,"" says Andrus Ansip, the Estonian prime minister, who is cutting overall public spending by nearly 12%. He has slashed a fifth of the posts in his own chancellery, he says proudly. ""Inefficient"" spending will be cut; budgets vital for future growth will be preserved, he insists.
Devaluation is still largely taboo in the Baltics. The national currencies are not just economic symbols of solidity, but political ones too. Instead, they hope to regain competitiveness through wage cuts and greater efficiency. Such an ""internal devaluation"" is possible in theory, but it is unusual (and painful) in practice. It may work: Latvia now has a current-account surplus as its exports rise. Outsiders are awed by the Balts' determination, though sceptical that the sacrifice will pay off. 
Still, while industries such as construction collapse, others, such as alternative energy, are growing. Mr Ansip cites Estonia's niche in windpower technology. In Latvia a firm called Carbon Neutral Biofuels has raised money for a $10m plant to turn low-grade wood into fuel pellets for Dutch power stations. Adrian Riley, the boss, says the crunch is ""a return to reality after a period of acute silliness"" when high costs threatened his project's viability. 
The Baltics may be a special case: small, relatively well run, with flexible economies and friendly Nordic neighbours. The broader worry across the region is political. Street protests have been muted so far, and some anger against the smug, corrupt and incompetent politicians who squandered the chances of the past decade is anyway healthy. But the European elections in early June may show how voters are reacting to hard times.
Government crises have not brought big changes. The Czech Republic's centre-right coalition lost its majority in March amid a row with the headstrong president, Vaclav Klaus. But the result has not been chaos. Until elections in October, a competent-looking caretaker government will run the country, headed by the chief statistician, Jan Fischer. In Hungary a discredited Socialist prime minister, Ferenc Gyurcsany, resigned, nominating an economist, Gordon Bajnai, to run the government until an election next spring. He is pushing through tough spending cuts, with GDP likely to fall 6% this year. 
Ivan Krastev, a Bulgarian-based analyst of the region's politics, says the fear of unemployment will disillusion middle-class voters and stoke protest voting. A bigger problem may be the fear among political elites, some of whom will stick at nothing to stay in power and out of jail. ""The model is Berlusconi,"" he says glumly.","The region as a whole may have avoided economic meltdown , but several countries still face a painful slump 
 THANKS to a mix of luck and good decisions , the economic apocalypse that loomed over central and eastern Europe seems to have been averted . But dizzy current - account deficits , wild foreign - currency borrowing and reckless fiscal policy are leaving a horrible hangover for some . The IMF forecasts a 4.9 % average fall in GDP , with far bigger falls for some . The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( EBRD ) reckons on a 5.2 % drop . The downturn is certainly nasty ; but some changes have staved off the worst . 
 One change is that outsiders now assess risk more calmly and rationally . All the former planned economies remain capital - thirsty . But otherwise they are all different . Indeed , a rare common factor among 20 - odd countries in the region with the "" ex - communist "" tag is that they dispute its relevance . Tarring all with the mistakes of overheated Latvia , chaotic Ukraine or debt - sodden Hungary makes no sense . Nor does lumping together rich and poor countries , or those in the European Union and those outside . Exchange - rate regimes vary : two countries are in the euro ; five countries have pegged their currencies to it ; others float . 
 So far at least , speculators who counted on contagion toppling countries like dominoes have little to show for it , while those who bet the other way have juicy gains . Poland 's stockmarket is up by nearly 40 % since its low in February , Hungary 's has risen by half and Russia 's by nearly 90 % . 
 Outside help is also now better co - ordinated . The previously standoffish IMF co - operates with the European Commission , national governments and the banks . Once seen as a lender of last resort , it now acts pre - emptively . In May it gave a $ 21 billion credit line to Poland , the biggest and strongest economy in the region . That is quite different , officials stress , from the emergency rescues of Belarus , Latvia , Hungary , Romania , Serbia and Ukraine . 
 The IMF is also behaving more gently . Ukraine was originally told to balance its budget this year . Now the IMF says a deficit of 4 % of GDP is realistic ; this month it released its latest $ 2.8 billion tranche . Officials are uneasy about insisting on fiscal tightening that may aggravate recession . Latvia is likely to be allowed to run a 7 % deficit for this year -- in return for promising , really and truly , to reach 4 % in 2010 . 
 A third change is that more aid has been given to western banks that face souring loans , typically to clients in Hungary and the Baltic states who borrowed in euros or Swiss francs . As outsiders cut back , a credit squeeze is threatening even healthy borrowers . A joint initiative by the EBRD , the World Bank and the European Investment Bank ( which used to lend only to state - backed infrastructure projects ) has raised $ 24.5 billion for banks and other firms across the region . The EBRD is putting EUR 432 m ( $ 590 m ) into UniCredit , an Italian bank heavily exposed in eastern Europe . It is thinking of investing in 12 other west European banks . Countries such as Sweden have national schemes too . 
 In a new report , the IMF argues that European banks still need a lot more help . But the cash and guarantees given already have eased the greatest threat to the region : that western banks might pull out or sink under the weight of their eastern loan books . Meanwhile central Europe , home of many big car factories , has gained from rich - country governments ' efforts to help their car industries . Neil Shearing of Capital Economics , a consultancy , reckons that German and other scrapping schemes to boost car sales will add fully 1 % to GDP in Slovakia , and 0.5 % in the Czech Republic and Hungary . 
 The biggest worry now is the Baltic three , which are seeing the sharpest falls in GDP . Estonia 's first - quarter figures showed a year - on - year decline of 15.6 % . The fall in Latvia was a stunning 18 % and in Lithuania 12.6 % . Monetary policy can not counteract this , since all three are pegged to the euro . And fiscal policy offers no respite . Politicians are pushing through spending cuts , not only to reassure external lenders , but also to meet the Maastricht deficit target of 3 % of GDP so as to adopt the euro soon ( by 2011 , Estonia hopes ) .

AFTER years of crisis, Hungarians are used to belt-tightening. Although Hungary was among the European Union members that suffered most in the recession--GDP will shrink by 7% this year, just behind Romania and the Baltics--the outlook is now better, thanks partly to recent austerity measures.
The government has trimmed public spending by fully 3.8% of GDP this year, with most cuts falling on social spending and public-sector pay. These cuts came on top of earlier ones that reduced the budget deficit from 9.2% of GDP in 2006 to just 3.4% in 2008. More are on the way. The Socialist government, led by Gordon Bajnai, wants to chop an extra 1.7% next year to keep the deficit within the IMF-approved limit of 3.8% of GDP. It has also set up an independent fiscal council to monitor compliance with budget-balance targets.
The combination of these cuts and a big IMF loan is having a marked effect. The threat of a run on the currency has receded. The banks, mostly foreign-owned, have not collapsed, as many had feared. The forint is not quite back to where it was before the financial crisis but the central bank has felt able to start cutting interest rates. Ordinary mortgage-holders, many of whom borrowed in Swiss francs, still face a heavy burden. Even so, Peter Oszko, the finance minister, points out that, with the IMF loan extended until next October, the government can again raise money from the market.
The Socialists are likely to lose next year's election, so Mr Bajnai has little time left to reform public services. He wants to shift some of the tax burden from employers to consumers and the rich. He has already cut social-security contributions in hopes of raising Hungary's employment rate, which at 55% of the population is one of the lowest in the EU. The government is also gradually raising the retirement age to 65.
What Hungary really needs is a review of all areas of public spending. A slimmer state requires big reforms. Yet the likely election winner, the centre-right Fidesz party, has spent the past seven years zealously denouncing even tiny reforms as sell-outs to fat cats or as disasters that would condemn the country to poverty. As elsewhere, Hungary's underlying problems arose from wage rises unmatched by productivity growth and social spending that is too generous. It may be optimistic to think that, like the rest of Europe, Hungary has now learnt its lesson.","Austerity has helped Hungary to survive the recession -- so far

FOREIGN investment helped catapult central Europe to prosperity over the past 20 years. To escape the current recession it will need more of it. But a populist response to the economic crisis is pulling in the opposite direction, as several recent incidents in Hungary illustrate. 
The body that administers Hungary's airwaves, ORTT, has taken the two nationwide radio licences away from foreign-owned stations and given them to two local firms, one of which has links to Fidesz, the right-wing opposition party. The body's chairman, Laszlo Majtenyi, has resigned, complaining that the decision--by delegates from Fidesz and the ruling Socialist party--broke the law. A parliamentary investigation has been blocked, prompting speculation about a political stitch-up.
The foreigners are appealing against the decision. American diplomats in Budapest, who have lobbied for one of the dispossessed stations, owned by Emmis Communications, an American media firm, are seething. Accession Mezzanine Capital, an investment fund based in Vienna that is the owner of Radio Danubius, the other loser, notes that Hungary should treat outsiders better, given that it is surviving thanks to an ""IMF lifeline"".
Similar worries surround a case from September, when the local government of Pecs, a town in southern Hungary, unilaterally terminated its contract with Suez Environnement, a French company that was running the local waterworks. Having accused the firm of corruption, money-laundering, improper management of funds and, on top of everything else, unreasonably high prices, the local government sent security guards to occupy the waterworks and locked the management out. (Suez's local subsidiary plans to sue for breach of contract.) President Nicolas Sarkozy of France complained to Gordon Bajnai, Hungary's prime minister, who in turn attracted fire from opposition politicians for ""protecting the foreign capitalists and not the people"" after he spoke up for Suez. 
Whatever the merits of the case, it is clear that Fidesz, which is likely to return to government next year after eight years in opposition, has stoked discontent with privatisation, foreign investors and, to an extent, free-market capitalism in general. An obscure Fidesz MP, Oszkar Molnar, complained last month about ""Jewish capital wanting to devour Hungary"". Fidesz leaders merely called his words ""embarrassing"". He retains his seat in parliament.
In 2008 Fidesz helped stop Apollo, an Indian company, from building a tyre factory in the town of Gyongyos. It would have created 900 jobs but Fidesz argued (wrongly) that it involved technology banned in the European Union. Fidesz also backed a referendum to block private investment in the failing national health service. Viktor Orban, the party's leader, opposes further privatisation and has promised to review some recent deals once in office. The right-wing press brims with conspiracy theories about foreign financiers and global capitalism. 
Fidesz denies that it is anti-business. It has enthusiastically backed a big new Mercedes plant in eastern Hungary. Krisztian Orban, managing partner at Oriens, a merchant bank in Budapest, thinks foreign investors worry more about frequent regulatory changes than Fidesz's populism. The party's own record is spotty: it ran a steady ship when in office until it splurged to try to win an election in 2002. It has vehemently attacked the government's recent efforts to stabilise the budget, bloated by years of fiscal profligacy, but says little about its own economic plans. Outsiders must hope that Fidesz can contain the genies it has so casually unbottled.

POWER is a politician's sweetest birthday present. Viktor Orban, who founded Fidesz, Hungary's centre-right opposition party, 22 years ago in March 1988, hopes for a double celebration after this weekend's election. Analysts predict a landslide victory for Fidesz against the ruling Socialists. A poll of voters who say they will turn out gives Fidesz 62%, the Socialists 20% and the far-right Jobbik party 13%. The Socialists have been in power for eight years, during which the economy has done badly, poverty has soared, corruption has flourished and the dire situation of the country's Roma minority has worsened.
Foreign investors, once seen as Hungary's saviours, now spark sour resentment. Angry young nationalists wear T-shirts proclaiming ""Magyar Vagyok: Nem Turista"" (""I am a Hungarian, not a tourist""). Cars are emblazoned with maps of Greater Hungary before it was truncated by the 1920 Treaty of Trianon. Gordon Bajnai, Hungary's caretaker prime minister, has won plaudits abroad for his careful fiscal management (the budget deficit is now 4% of GDP, down from 9% in 2006). But with unemployment above 11% and inflation almost 6%, the Socialists remain unpopular.
Mr Orban, who was prime minister between 1998 and 2002, promises to create a million jobs over the next decade and to bring corrupt officials to justice. Everybody will have to take responsibility for what they have done, says Peter Szijjarto, Fidesz's chief of staff. Mr Orban plans a radical overhaul of Hungary's complex tax system, an attack on the black economy, a simplification of the bureaucracy and new laws bringing openness to public procurement.
As for Jobbik, Fidesz will have nothing to do with it, promises Mr Szijjarto. A stream of lurid stories about the party have appeared in the Hungarian media recently. A party spokesman, Andras Kiraly, resigned after pictures of him at a Gay Pride parade in Toronto appeared on the internet. A member of the now illegal Magyar Garda, Jobbik's uniformed wing, was found to have starred in a lesbian pornographic film. Smears and slanders, say Jobbik officials.
Yet Jobbik's dark side is plain enough. A recent issue of Barikad, a magazine edited by one of the party's leaders, showed St Gellert above Budapest with a seven-branched menorah-like candelabra and the strapline ""Wake Up Budapest: Is This What You Want?"". An article inside spoke of ""Judapest"". Party officials deny that Jobbik is anti-Semitic and say the magazine was just responding to a 2007 speech by Shimon Peres, Israel's president, proclaiming that Israel was buying up Hungary, Manhattan and Poland. But Jobbik's ascent has coincided with rising anti-Semitism. Election posters have been defaced with Stars of David. The windows of a rabbi's apartment in Budapest's Jewish quarter were shattered during Passover. Even some Socialist and liberal voters hope for an Orban landslide to stop Jobbik's rise.

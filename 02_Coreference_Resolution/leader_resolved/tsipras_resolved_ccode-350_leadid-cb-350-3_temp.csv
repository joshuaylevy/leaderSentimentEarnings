ALEXIS TSIPRAS, Greece's radical left-wing opposition leader, believes that by raising his profile abroad he can impress voters at home. His audience last month with Pope Francis, party officials explained, was a ""meeting of minds"". The pontiff, they said, agreed with Mr Tsipras, an atheist, about the unjust suffering caused by harsh austerity policies imposed in the wake of economic collapse, whether in Greece or, in the late 1990s, in the Pope's native Argentina. 
Mr Tsipras's unsuccessful but well-publicised run for president of the European Union's commission as the candidate of the European left also helped boost his credibility back home. His Syriza party finished 3.8% ahead of the governing coalition, led by New Democracy, a centre-right party, in the elections for the EU parliament in May. 
Talk of an early general election is in the air: New Democracy and the PanHellenic Socialist Movement need 180 votes in parliament next February to choose a new president to replace the incumbent, Karolos Papoulias, who is retiring from politics. With only 154 lawmakers between them, it will be a struggle to round up the extra votes from a pool of fractious independents and moderate left-wingers. If they fail, an early general election will be held. Mr Tsipras is in pole position to win. 
Three recent opinion polls showed Syriza's lead over New Democracy widening to up to five percentage points, which, if replicated at a general election, would leave Syriza just ten seats short of a parliamentary majority. One of the latest polls, published on September 27th, shocked the government: it gave Syriza a lead of 11 percentage points over New Democracy. 
Mr Tsipras is no longer pledging to rip up Greece's bail-out agreement, yet many are still suspicious of his new EUR 11 billion ($14 billion) tax-and-spend economic programme. It calls, among other things, for restoring the minimum monthly salary to EUR 750 (about 60% higher than the average salary now being paid by cash-strapped private employers), cracking down on tax evasion, creating 300,000 new jobs and restoring Christmas bonuses for pensioners. ""It's much too good to be true,"" sighed Koula Peristeri, an unemployed factory worker who nonetheless supports Syriza. 
Antonis Samaras, the centre-right prime minister, has riposted with his own promises. Next year's budget will include tax breaks for hard-pressed households, including cuts in levies on property and heating fuel. There is even talk of reducing the corporate tax rate from 26% to 20%. 
Mr Samaras would like to go further but he is constrained by the ""troika"" of bail-out monitors from the EU, the European Central Bank and IMF. Back in Athens for a final review of Greece's progress with reform, they are pressing for yet more austerity measures: another 6,500 dismissals from the civil service this year, further cuts in pensions and a new law permitting mass sackings at larger companies. 
The EU's bail-out programme is due to end in December, leaving the IMF to supervise reforms until March 2016 while disbursing a final EUR 15 billion of loans, an awkward arrangement. Mr Samaras would like to follow the example of Portugal last May and finish the IMF programme early, dispensing with the last round of handouts. ""Greece is ready to stand on its feet again,"" he claimed, signalling that the coalition would prefer to raise its own financing on the international capital markets. 
Ditching the IMF would bring the coalition benefits--a boost in the polls, and perhaps more MPs onside for the presidential vote. But the price of Greek bonds fell sharply after Mr Samaras spoke. It may be too soon to wave the monitors goodbye.","Alexis Tsipras's could win the next election

GREECE'S plans for a clean exit from its international bail-out are in disarray. A sharp rise in bond yields has stymied the government's plan to borrow about EUR 9 billion ($11 billion) abroad in 2015 to meet debt repayments and ease the impact of austerity measures, which have left more than 35% of Greeks at risk of poverty. Instead, the prime minister, Antonis Samaras, will have to negotiate a new credit line with the European Union or, worse, accept 15 more months of tough supervision by the IMF, in return for EUR 12 billion. 
Mr Samaras still insists the ""era of the memorandum"" (as Greeks call the bail-out) is ending, and talks up renewed foreign investment. Following a record summer tourism season, international hotel chains are eager to snap up properties on popular Aegean Islands. The Greek privatisation agency, Taiped, is considering three bids from international groups seeking to manage 14 regional airports. China's Cosco group is spending EUR 230m to enlarge its container-handling terminal at Piraeus. According to the EU and the IMF, Greece's economy will grow by 0.6% this year and 2.9% in 2015. 
Others argue that Greece's prospects are clouded by political instability. Mr Samaras and his centre-right New Democracy (ND) party need a three-fifths majority in Greece's 300-member parliament to elect a new president in February, or elections will be called. He is still 26 votes short. Moreover, some independents and even a handful of lawmakers from the PanHellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok), his party's coalition partner, may decide to switch their allegiance to Syriza, the far-left opposition party. The latest opinion polls give Syriza a lead of between 4% and 8% over ND, and even government supporters are beginning to accept that Syriza will win the next election. The question that is hotly debated in Athens cafes is whether the opposition will secure an outright majority or be forced to form a coalition with other left-wing parties. Those could include Pasok or Potami, a new centre-left party founded by Stavros Theodorakis, a television journalist. 
Meanwhile, Alexis Tsipras, the 40-year-old Syriza leader, has been building bridges with EU leaders in Brussels and the German government in Berlin. He is still pressing for Greece's creditors to write off at least half the country's swollen public debt, now almost 175% of GDP. But European officials say he is no longer the intransigent firebrand who promised in 2012 to tear up the ""barbarous memorandum"" if he came to power. Mr Tsipras has quietly tried to reassure potential investors bringing in money from abroad that Greece would be a business-friendly member of the euro zone under a Syriza government. The hedge funds that led the recent stampede out of Greek bonds have yet to be entirely convinced.

THEY chanted and sang and promised happiness. But after Spain's radical Podemos (""We Can"") party chose its leaders on November 15th it remained remarkably thin on policy. ""There is still much to do,"" admitted the party leader, Pablo Iglesias, after 89% of the party's 107,000 internet voters had ticked his name. 
The rise of Podemos is a triumph for Mr Iglesias and the technologically astute university lecturers and activists who designed, launched and kept control of the party in its first ten months. It also marks the resurgence of the indignados, protesters who peacefully took over city squares in May 2011, two-and-a-half years after Spain first plunged into the economic dumps. 
It has taken years of chronic unemployment, a banking bail-out, a second dip into recession (now over) and a flood of corruption cases to see the amorphous indignados take shape in party politics. In opinion polls support for Podemos has surged as high as 28%. But turning this into real votes may yet prove difficult. 
Podemos stood for its first elections, to the European Parliament, in May and took 8% of the vote. Just six months later it is neck-and-neck in the polls with both the Popular Party (PP) led by Mariano Rajoy, Spain's less-than popular prime minister, and the stuttering opposition Socialists. Along the way it has sunk Spain's communist-led United Left (IU) coalition. 
Mr Iglesias promises a new politics, beyond the left-right paradigm. Yet many are sceptical. Some senior party members come from groups with names like Youth with No Future or the Anti-Capitalist Left. Others have worked with Venezuela's Bolivarian left. On November 15th Mr Iglesias railed against Spain's ""regime"" and ""oligarchies"". He was greeted with cries of ""Yes, we can!"" and ""Let's get them!"" The guest speaker was Alexis Tsipras, leader of Greece's radical Syriza party. 
Mr Iglesias's main demand is for a rewrite of Spain's constitution to scrap the ""regime of 1978"" and get rid of a casta of supposedly self-serving, corrupt politicians. Podemos would solve the Catalan problem by allowing an independence vote. On the economy, Mr Iglesias wants a restructuring of Spain's public debt, government intervention and tax rises (especially for the rich) to pay for better public services. He also wants Spaniards to work fewer hours, as a way of reducing unemployment that is still running at 24%. Economists whom he cites include such well-known names as Joseph Stiglitz, Paul Krugman and Kenneth Rogoff. 
IU and the Socialists are watching Podemos closely. The head of IU, Cayo Lara, announced on November 16th that he would not lead the party into elections next November. Mr Lara is likely to be replaced by a 29-year-old economist, Alberto Garzon, who is another star from the ranks of the indignados. Mr Garzon is even younger than the most visible Podemos leaders, who are mostly in their 30s. Like the pony-tailed Mr Iglesias, he is popular on television talk shows. The two could yet work together. The Socialists have their own newish leader, Pedro Sanchez. They may have to decide whether to ally with Podemos or, if it takes enough of their votes, to join a grand coalition with the PP. 
The PP sees Podemos as a radical party that weakens its main Socialist rival. But the government also frets that it may scare off investors. Mr Rajoy is a dogged devotee of the constitution and a system that has seen the PP and the Socialists take it in turns to rule Spain for 32 years. He accuses Podemos of seeking to destroy progress made since Spain shed dictatorship. ""If someone wants to undo all that and chuck it overboard, I suppose it is through ignorance, but it makes no sense,"" he says.

IT WAS almost exactly five years ago that the euro crisis erupted, starting in Greece. Investors who had complacently let all euro-zone countries borrow at uniformly low levels abruptly woke up to the riskiness of an incompetent government borrowing money in a currency which it could not depreciate. There is thus a dismal symmetry in seeing the euro crisis flare up again in the place where it began. 
The proximate cause of the latest outbreak of nerves was the decision by the Greek government, now headed by the generally competent Antonis Samaras, to advance the presidential election to later this month. The presidency is largely ceremonial, but if Mr Samaras cannot win enough votes in parliament for his candidate, Stavros Dimas, a general election will follow. Polls suggest the winner would be Syriza, a populist party led by Alexis Tsipras. Although Mr Tsipras professes that he does not want to leave the euro, he is making promises to voters on public spending and taxes that may make it hard for Greece to stay. Hence the markets' sudden pessimism. 
As it happens, there is a good chance that Mr Dimas, a former EU commissioner, will win the presidential vote at the end of this month (see page 39). But the latest Aegean tragicomedy is a timely reminder both of how unreformed the euro zone still is and of the dangers lurking in its politics. 
It is true that, ever since the pledge by the European Central Bank's president, Mario Draghi in July 2012 to ""do whatever it takes"" to save the euro, fears that the single currency might break up have dissipated. Much has been done to repair the euro's architecture, ranging from the establishment of a bail-out fund to the start of a banking union. And economic growth across the euro zone is slowly returning, however anaemically, even to Greece and other bailed-out countries. 
But is that good enough? Even if the immediate threat of break-up has receded, the longer-term threat to the single currency has, if anything, increased. The euro zone seems to be trapped in a cycle of slow growth, high unemployment and dangerously low inflation. Mr Draghi would like to respond to this with full-blown quantitative easing, but he is running into fierce opposition from German and other like-minded ECB council members (see page 82). Fiscal expansion is similarly blocked by Germany's unyielding insistence on strict budgetary discipline. And forcing structural reforms through the two sickliest core euro countries, Italy and France, remains an agonisingly slow business. 
Japan is reckoned to have had two ""lost decades""; but in the past 20 years it grew by almost 0.9% a year. The euro zone, whose economy has not grown since the crisis, is showing no sign of dragging itself out of its slump. And Japan's political set-up is far more manageable than Europe's. It is a single political entity with a cohesive society; the euro zone consists of 18 separate countries, each with a different political landscape. It is hard to imagine it living through a decade even more dismal than Japan's without some political upheaval. 
Greece is hardly alone in having angry voters. Portugal and Spain both have elections next year, in which parties that are fiercely against excessive austerity are likely to do well. In Italy three of the four biggest parties, Forza Italia, the Northern League and Beppe Grillo's Five Star movement, are turning against euro membership. France's anti-European National Front continues to climb in the opinion polls. Even Germany has a rising populist party that is against the euro. 
It's the politics, stupid 
Indeed, the political risks to the euro may be greater now than they were at the height of the euro crisis in 2011-12. What was striking then was that large majorities of ordinary voters preferred to stick with the single currency despite the austerity imposed by the conditions of their bail-outs, because they feared that any alternative would be even more painful. Now that the economies of Europe seem a little more stable, the risks of walking away from the single currency may also seem smaller.

A GREEK presidential election is not supposed to make headlines. The ruling party's candidate, typically a low-key retired politician, normally wins the required three-fifths majority after a three-round vote in parliament. In the 40 years since Greece replaced its monarchy with a republic led by a figurehead president, no big political upset has occurred. This time it could be different. 
Antonis Samaras (pictured), the centre-right prime minister, has called a snap presidential election for December 17th, two months before Karolos Papoulias, the 85-year-old incumbent, steps down. This is at best a risky gamble. Sensing that political instability might rekindle the euro crisis, financial markets panicked. Prices on the Athens stockmarket plunged by almost 13% the day after the presidential vote was announced; yields on Greek ten-year bonds soared above 8% (see chart). 
Mr Samaras said he was bringing the presidential vote forward to restore political stability, which he claimed was being undermined by persistent demands from the far-left Syriza party, led by Alexis Tsipras, a radical populist, for an early general election. Since it came first in the European elections in May, Syriza has kept a strong lead over Mr Samaras's New Democracy (ND) party in the opinion polls. Yet if Mr Samaras's candidate for the presidency, Stavros Dimas, a former European environment commissioner, fails to win 180 out of 300 votes in the final round, Mr Tsipras will get his way, as an early general election must then be held. 
Mr Tsipras, a hero of Europe's far left, pledges to restore the minimum wage to its pre-crisis level, to provide free electricity and food to destitute families, and to reduce unemployment by hiring more civil servants. His promises resonate with austerity-hit Greeks, though it is unclear how a Syriza government would finance such expansive policies. Nor is it evident how they can be made compatible with Greece's euro membership. 
Mr Samaras has already lost another bet. His plan to end Greece's four-year EUR 230 billion ($284 billion) bail-out this month and to resume borrowing abroad without a precautionary safety net of credit from the European Union and the IMF collapsed when markets reacted badly, briefly pushing yields on Greek ten-year bonds above 9%. On December 8th Greece accepted a two-month extension of its bail-out to give it time to complete negotiations on more reforms, including pension cuts and tax increases, with the unpopular ""troika"" of monitors from the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF. These would be the conditions for getting a fresh line of credit that would help to allay fears of a default if Syriza were ever to come to power. 
The presidential vote is a bigger gamble. If Mr Dimas is rejected, the opinion polls suggest that New Democracy would lose the subsequent election to Syriza, while its junior partner in the governing coalition, the PanHellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok), might only barely scrape into parliament. Yet Syriza might not win an outright majority, raising the prospect of prolonged political uncertainty that could lead to even more market jitters. 
Mr Samaras, a skilful tactician, has his work cut out. The coalition controls 155 parliamentary votes and can count on another 12 from the 24 independents who have left ND or Pasok in protest against different austerity measures. Another half-dozen independents could probably be persuaded to back the government. Getting the remaining seven votes would mean persuading lawmakers to defect from Independent Greeks (Anel), a fractious right-wing splinter group, or Democratic Left, a moderate leftist party that pulled out of the coalition last year when Mr Samaras high-handedly shut the state broadcaster without any discussion. 
The incentive to break ranks and back the government will be strong: the independents might well lose their seats at the next election, while both Anel and Democratic Left could fall below the 3% threshold for entering parliament. It will be a tense Christmas holiday period: since Mr Dimas has no chance of winning the 200 votes needed in the first and second rounds, the deciding third ballot will take place on December 29th. 
Greece's creditors and allies are watching nervously, from Berlin to Brussels. Some think that by calling an election that his candidate will struggle to win, Mr Samaras has already thrown in the towel. But Pierre Moscovici, the EU's economics commissioner, sounded a note of encouragement, saying he believed that Mr Samaras's gamble meant he was confident that his man would become president.","An early presidential vote could spell trouble for Greece 's government -- and for the future of the euro 
 A GREEK presidential election is not supposed to make headlines . The ruling party 's candidate , typically a low - key retired politician , normally wins the required three - fifths majority after a three - round vote in parliament . In the 40 years since Greece replaced its monarchy with a republic led by a figurehead president , no big political upset has occurred . This time it could be different . 
 Antonis Samaras ( pictured ) , the centre - right prime minister , has called a snap presidential election for December 17th , two months before Karolos Papoulias , the 85 - year - old incumbent , steps down . This is at best a risky gamble . Sensing that political instability might rekindle the euro crisis , financial markets panicked . Prices on the Athens stockmarket plunged by almost 13 % the day after the presidential vote was announced ; yields on Greek ten - year bonds soared above 8 % ( see chart ) . 
 Mr Samaras said he was bringing the presidential vote forward to restore political stability , which he claimed was being undermined by persistent demands from Alexis Tsipras for an early general election . Since Alexis Tsipras came first in the European elections in May , Alexis Tsipras has kept a strong lead over Mr Samaras 's New Democracy ( ND ) party in the opinion polls . Yet if Mr Samaras 's candidate for the presidency , Stavros Dimas , a former European environment commissioner , fails to win 180 out of 300 votes in the final round , Mr Tsipras will get his way , as an early general election must then be held . 
 Mr Tsipras , a hero of Europe 's far left , pledges to restore the minimum wage to its pre - crisis level , to provide free electricity and food to destitute families , and to reduce unemployment by hiring more civil servants . His promises resonate with austerity - hit Greeks , though it is unclear how a Syriza government would finance such expansive policies . Nor is it evident how they can be made compatible with Greece 's euro membership . 
 Mr Samaras has already lost another bet . His plan to end Greece 's four - year EUR 230 billion ( $ 284 billion ) bail - out this month and to resume borrowing abroad without a precautionary safety net of credit from the European Union and the IMF collapsed when markets reacted badly , briefly pushing yields on Greek ten - year bonds above 9 % . On December 8th Greece accepted a two - month extension of its bail - out to give it time to complete negotiations on more reforms , including pension cuts and tax increases , with the unpopular "" troika "" of monitors from the European Commission , the European Central Bank and the IMF .

EVER since the euro crisis erupted in late 2009 Greece has been at or near its heart. It was the first country to receive a bail-out, in May 2010. It was the subject of repeated debate over a possible departure from the single currency (the so-called Grexit) in 2011 and again in 2012. It is the only country in the euro zone whose official debt has been restructured. On December 29th the Greek parliament failed to elect a president, forcing an early snap election to be called for January 25th. The euro crisis is entering a new, highly dangerous phase, and once again Greece finds itself at the centre. 
Investors promptly swooned, with the Athens stockmarket falling by almost 5% in a single day, bank shares down by even more and Greek ten-year bond yields rising to a new 2014 high of 9.5% (over seven points above those for Italy). The reason for this collective outbreak of nerves is that the polls point to an election win for Syriza, a far-left populist party led by Alexis Tsipras. Although Mr Tsipras says he wants to keep Greece in the euro, he also wants to dump most of the conditions attached to its bail-outs: he would end austerity, reverse cuts in the minimum wage and in public spending, scrap asset sales and seek to repudiate much of the country's debt. Such a programme seems, to put it mildly, to sit uncomfortably with Greece's continuing membership of the single currency. 
The early election is likely therefore to create a political crisis in Greece. What happens beyond that is less clear. Investors seem to be betting that the people of Italy, Spain and France will peek at the chaos in Athens, shudder--and stick to the austerity that Germany's Angela Merkel has prescribed for them. But that seems too sanguine to this newspaper. It is hard to believe that a Greek crisis will not unleash fresh ructions elsewhere in the euro zone--not least because some of Mrs Merkel's medicine is patently doing more harm than good. 
The Greek kalends 
Begin with Greece. For 14 months Syriza has been ahead of the ruling New Democracy party of the outgoing prime minister, Antonis Samaras, in the polls. Although the economy is now growing again, Greek voters remain understandably enraged that GDP should have shrunk by almost 20% since 2010 and that unemployment is still as high as 26%. As it happens, Syriza's poll lead has narrowed in recent weeks, but even if it does not win an outright parliamentary majority, it is likely to be by some margin the biggest party, so Mr Tsipras can expect to lead any coalition government that is formed after the election (see page 21). And this time round Mrs Merkel will struggle to repeat the 2012 trick of asking Greeks to vote again in the hope that they might produce a more sensible government. 
In its policies Syriza represents, at best, uncertainty and contradiction and at worst reckless populism. On the one hand Mr Tsipras has recanted from his one-time hostility to Greece's euro membership and toned down his more extravagant promises. Yet, on the other, he still thinks he can tear up the conditions imposed by Greece's creditors in exchange for two successive bail-outs. His reasoning is partly that the economy is at last recovering and Greece is now running a primary budget surplus (ie, before interest payments); and partly that the rest of the euro zone will simply give in as they have before. On both counts he is being reckless. 
In theory a growing economy and a primary surplus may help a country repudiate its debts because it is no longer dependent on capital inflows. But the Greek economy still has far to go to restore its lost competitiveness, and Mr Tsipras's programme would undo most of the gains of recent years. The notion that EU leaders are so rattled by fears of Grexit that they would pay any price to avoid it was more valid in 2011 and 2012 than it is now. The anti-contagion defences that the euro zone has since built make Grexit easier to contemplate for northern Europeans. Much has been done to improve the euro's architecture, with a new bail-out fund, the European Central Bank's role as lender of last resort and a partial banking union. Moreover, most of the bailed-out and peripheral countries are at last growing again, and unemployment is starting to fall. 
Europe's Lehman moment? 
The result is a game of chicken that neither Greece nor Europe can afford. Even if the Grexit is safer, it is still perilous and unpredictable. There was a worrying echo this week of the Lehman crisis of September 2008. Then the widespread assumption was that the global financial system was robust enough to cope with the failure of a single investment bank. Now investors are putting their trust in the resilience of unemployment-plagued countries like France, whose president has record levels of unpopularity, and Italy, whose economy has shrunk in constant prices in the first 14 years of this century (even Greece's GDP is higher now than it was in 1999). 
That stagnation points to the deeper reason for caution. The continuing dismal economic performance of the euro zone now poses a big political risk to the single currency. In the short run, so long as creditor countries (and that means principally Germany) insist only on budgetary rectitude and reject all proposals for further monetary and fiscal stimulus, that performance seems unlikely to improve. Worse, inflation is now so dangerously low that the euro zone threatens to tip into years of deflation and stagnation worryingly reminiscent of Japan in the 1990s. The continent's leaders have largely failed to push through the structural reforms that could make their economies more competitive. When voters see no hope, they are likely to vote for populists--and not just in Greece. 
As 2015 approached, most of Europe's leaders assumed that the worst of the euro crisis was behind them. The early Greek election shows that hope was premature. Populist parties of left and right that are against the euro, explicitly or not, continue to gain ground in many countries--the leader of Podemos, Spain's highest-polling party, welcomed Mr Tsipras's success in forcing an election this week (see page 22). Ironically, when a country starts to recover is also when popular discontent often boils over. That message needs to be heeded this week in Berlin as much as in Athens.","Politics has returned to haunt the single currency

ANTONIS SAMARAS, the centre-right Greek prime minister, lost one election on December 29th. Now he will have to fight another. His New Democracy party's candidate for president, Stavros Dimas, fell 12 votes short of the required three-fifths majority in a third and final ballot by Greece's 300 MPs. As the constitution demands, a snap general election will now be held on January 25th. ND is trailing the far-left Syriza opposition, according to the opinion polls. Once again, the prime minister's chances of victory look slim. 
Mr Samaras made two television appeals for lawmakers to back Mr Dimas, a former European environment commissioner, for the ceremonial post. His election would have kept the fragile ND-led coalition in power long enough to negotiate an exit from Greece's unpopular austerity programme with the European Union and IMF, including a precautionary credit line from the euro-zone bail-out fund. Many independent and opposition lawmakers who rejected Mr Dimas are unlikely to be re-elected, yet not even self-interest persuaded them to back the government. 
Such stubbornness heralds a bad-tempered election campaign. Alexis Tsipras, Syriza's radical leader, calls Mr Samaras ""finished"". He plans to renegotiate Greece's bail-out. Although he no longer threatens to halt debt repayments unilaterally if his party comes to power, he still wants to secure a big write-off. Greece's creditors would oppose that, and also Mr Tsipras's proposals to reverse other reforms and launch a EUR 11 billion ($13 billion) welfare package, to be financed by better tax collection. With more than EUR 7 billion of lending suspended until Athens reaches agreement with its ""troika"" of creditors on more tax, labour and pension reforms, Greece will soon run into trouble. Hard-pressed taxpayers are already struggling; more than EUR 1 billion of income and property tax goes uncollected every month. Mr Tsipras's promises sound alluring to angry, impoverished Greek voters. 
Yet some left-wingers are suspicious. ""How can Greece dictate terms to the troika when they control the purse-strings?"" asks Lefteris Maniatakis, a former employee of the state electricity company. ""Over the past four years we've seen every government resist their demands at first, but give in eventually."" 
Mr Samaras hopes to shrink and perhaps reverse Syriza's lead over the course of the campaign. He can cite a modest recovery, with GDP growth likely to reach 0.6-0.8% in 2014 thanks to a successful summer tourist season, improved exports and increased EU subsidies for infrastructure projects. Another tactic will be to stress the risks posed by a hawkish but inexperienced left-wing Syriza-led government. Greek shipowners, worried they could be hit by a new wealth tax, are already pulling deposits out of local banks. Small savers could follow their example, fearing a repetition of the 2013 bail-in of depositors in Cyprus. 
Even if Syriza wins on January 25th, it may fall short of an overall majority. Mr Tsipras speaks of a government with Syriza as its ""core"". At least four small parties are likely to win more than 3% of the vote and enter parliament, but only the PanHellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) and To Potami (The River), a new centre-left party led by Stavros Theodorakis, a television journalist, look like possible coalition partners. Mr Tsipras is used to making alliances: he has to keep his own party's disruptive far-left faction on board. Even so, it could be hard for Syriza to work with either Pasok, which has been ND's junior coalition partner for two-and-a-half years, or a cocky newcomer like Mr Theodorakis. 
In 2012 an inconclusive election was followed by another a month later. This time, the deadlines are tighter: a two-month extension to Greece's bail-out expires at the end of February, increasing the pressure on the election winner to form a government fast.

THE far-left Syriza party continues to hold a small but steady lead in the polls ahead of Greece's election on January 25th. After such a long period ahead of the ruling party, this lead seems unlikely to be overturned in just two-and-a-half weeks, say pollsters. 
Yet Alexis Tsipras, the firebrand Syriza leader, has been toning down his anti-European rhetoric. He now says no ""unilateral"" decisions will be taken on Greece's obligations to its creditors, a signal that a Syriza government would not surprise markets with an immediate default. Mr Tsipras's message to voters is simple: a promise to end four bleak years of austerity with a splurge of social spending. 
The cafe debate has shifted, too. It is no longer about whether the centre-right New Democracy party led by Antonis Samaras, the prime minister, can pull off a last-minute victory (Mr Samaras still has a higher personal approval rating than Mr Tsipras), but over which small party would be Syriza's most likely coalition partner. For Syriza officials concede they may well fall short of an outright majority, even with the 50-seat bonus that goes automatically to the party that finishes first. 
The choice could be harder than it looks. At least four small parties are expected to beat the threshold of 3% to get into parliament. The neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party may finish third, even though its leaders are in jail awaiting trial on charges of running a criminal organisation. The perennially Stalinist Greek Communist Party has long rejected Mr Tsipras's overtures favouring co-operation, despite Syriza's own communist roots. 
That leaves To Potami (the River), a new moderate centre-left party founded only in 2014 by Stavros Theodorakis, a popular television journalist, and the PanHellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok), which is tainted by its two-and-a-half-years spent as New Democracy's junior coalition partner. Pasok is already shaping up as the most likely contender to back Syriza: its leader, Evangelos Venizelos, stresses populist measures that he backed while in government, despite opposition from the ""troika"" of Greece's creditors from the European Union and the IMF, such as letting tax debtors stretch repayments out in as many as 100 instalments. Support from disillusioned Pasok voters underpinned Syriza's sudden rise from left-wing outlier into a serious contender for power during Greece's two back-to-back elections in 2012. 
But that was before the intervention of George Papandreou, the prime minister who signed up to the international bail-out in 2010 and a former Pasok leader (and son of its founder). He has unexpectedly launched a new party, the Movement of Democratic Socialists. It could win about 4% of the vote, according to one poll, trading both on the Papandreou political brand and on his appealing vision of a centre-left consensus to rebuild a society exhausted by austerity and polarised politics. If Mr Papandreou splits the Pasok vote, Mr Venizelos's chances of joining a Syriza-led government look slim. 
Meanwhile the messages from Berlin are becoming louder: Greece should in principle stay in the euro, but Mr Tsipras's demands for a debt write-off and spending binge are unacceptable. The spectre of a Grexit, laid to rest while the Samaras government got on with its reforms, has resurfaced. Yet polls show that voters still believe that Greece's place in the euro is secure. ""The current view is that Germany is bluffing and the euro zone would collapse if we were forced out,"" says one pollster.

The neo - Nazi Golden Dawn party may finish third , even though its leaders are in jail awaiting trial on charges of running a criminal organisation . The perennially Stalinist Greek Communist Party has long rejected Alexis Tsipras's overtures favouring co - operation , despite Syriza 's own communist roots . 
 That leaves To Potami ( the River ) , a new moderate centre - left party founded only in 2014 by Stavros Theodorakis , a popular television journalist , and the PanHellenic Socialist Movement ( Pasok ) , which is tainted by its two - and - a - half - years spent as New Democracy 's junior coalition partner . Pasok is already shaping up as the most likely contender to back Syriza : its leader , Evangelos Venizelos , stresses populist measures that he backed while in government , despite opposition from the "" troika "" of Greece 's creditors from the European Union and the IMF , such as letting tax debtors stretch repayments out in as many as 100 instalments . Support from disillusioned Pasok voters underpinned Syriza 's sudden rise from left - wing outlier into a serious contender for power during Greece 's two back - to - back elections in 2012 . 
 But that was before the intervention of George Papandreou , the prime minister who signed up to the international bail - out in 2010 and a former Pasok leader ( and son of its founder ) . He has unexpectedly launched a new party , the Movement of Democratic Socialists . It could win about 4 % of the vote , according to one poll , trading both on the Papandreou political brand and on his appealing vision of a centre - left consensus to rebuild a society exhausted by austerity and polarised politics . If Mr Papandreou splits the Pasok vote , Mr Venizelos 's chances of joining a Syriza - led government look slim . 
 Meanwhile the messages from Berlin are becoming louder : Greece should in principle stay in the euro , but Alexis Tsipras's demands for a debt write - off and spending binge are unacceptable . The spectre of a Grexit , laid to rest while the Samaras government got on with its reforms , has resurfaced . Yet polls show that voters still believe that Greece 's place in the euro is secure . "" The current view is that Germany is bluffing and the euro zone would collapse if we were forced out , "" says one pollster . "" But that could change as polling day comes closer .

THIS week marked a milestone in the history of Europe's single currency. On January 14th the value of the euro slipped to $1.17, the rate at which it was introduced on January 1st 1999. Back then, the fledgling currency weakened fast, hitting parity with the dollar in early 2000 and plunging to $0.83 by October of the same year. The slump in the euro's value suited no one: the European Central Bank (ECB) worried about inflation from rising import prices; other countries fretted about declining competitiveness. So the world's big central banks undertook a programme of co-ordinated intervention to stem the euro's fall. 
This time round the euro's slide has been more gradual, but it is likely to prove more persistent. Parity with the dollar is quite plausible this year. Both politics and economics are undermining the currency. 
The immediate threat is from the political side--and uncertainty about the consequences of the Greek elections on January 25th. The damage of Grexit, though lower than in 2012, would still be huge (see page 75). At the moment, such an event seems unlikely. Syriza, the far-left party that looks like winning the largest number of seats, insists it wants to stay in the currency (as do the vast majority of Greeks). Germany's government, too, is full of soothing noises about the inviolability of the euro. Nonetheless, the risks of an accidental exit are uncomfortably real. From a higher minimum wage to a halt to privatisation, the policies that Alexis Tsipras, Syriza's leader, is proposing will worsen Greece's public finances--and require more sleights of hand to keep Greece in conformity with the rescue packages that determine its ability to stay in the euro (see page 40). Even if Greece stays in, wary investors may decide to ditch their euro exposure, pushing the single currency down further. 
More important are the economic fundamentals and the plausible European policy responses. Deflation has set in (prices across the single-currency area fell by 0.2% in the year to December) and, with Germany's economy wobbling, the region's growth prospects look ever feebler. Yet despite the darkening picture there is no sign of boldness from politicians. There are no big ideas to kickstart the single market or to boost investment. Instead, all eyes are on the ECB and its willingness to create money to buy sovereign bonds. 
On January 14th a preliminary decision by the European Court of Justice declared the buying of sovereign bonds by the ECB to be legal. This should make it easier for the central bank to begin a programme of large-scale bond purchases. Such quantitative easing (QE) could start before the end of the month. In America QE helped boost share prices and drove down borrowing costs for companies. Given the underdeveloped state of Europe's capital markets, the main way QE is likely to banish deflation is through a weaker euro. Imports will cost more while exporters--and the economy--will get a boost. 
Parable of weakness past 
QE would be better than no QE, both for Europe and the rest of the world. Everyone would gain if the euro area avoids a renewed descent into crisis. But if the euro falls even further, Europe will most likely come to rely ever more on exports for its growth. The region already saves a lot more than it invests: thanks to Germany's insistence on austerity in peripheral economies and its refusal to boost investment at home, the euro area's current-account surplus has surged to 2.5% of its GDP. That is a huge shift: for most of the single currency's 16-year history, the region was in balance. If the euro falls to parity with the dollar even as domestic spending stays weak, that surplus is likely to grow larger still. At some point the currency's weakness will cause tensions with others, particularly the Americans. 
The euro's rise and fall is a sorry parable, whose lesson is the cost of avoiding hard choices. When times were good, Europe's leaders avoided structural reform. In the crisis, they always did just enough to stave off disaster, but not enough to avert deflation and stagnation. A weaker currency will help, but is far less good than a balanced European recovery based on healthy investment and spending at home.","A tumbling currency reflects Europe's dismal prospects; it is a second-best route to curing them

EUROPE'S leaders are often accused of having learned nothing from the euro crisis. But if the run-up to Greece's election on January 25th has proved anything, it is that politicians have become masters in the dark arts of expectation management. Syriza, a far-left party which polls suggest is likely to win, tells voters it will end the era of austerity, while assuring German taxpayers that it seeks no quarrel with them. German officials quietly tell reporters they are prepared to see Greece leave the euro, while professing the opposite in public. Any vaguely relevant remark by a European Union politician is multiply parsed for subtext or double meaning. Greeks may be forgiven for thinking they need a degree in game theory to decide how to vote. 
After six years of recession, five under the tutelage of the hated ""troika"" (the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF), Greece's future in the euro is again in question. Alexis Tsipras, Syriza's fiery young leader, promises a panoply of feel-good policies, including tax cuts and a public-sector hiring spree, and a slashing of Greece's debt load, which stands at over 170% of GDP. But such pledges seem at odds with those made by Greek governments in exchange for the bail-outs that have kept Greece in the single currency. Greek bond yields have spiked, and there are worrying signs of deposit outflows from banks. 
Nobody really wants ""Grexit"", least of all Greeks: 74% say they want to stick with the euro. An exit would be painful and costly (see Free Exchange). But unlike in 2012, when Syriza narrowly lost an election to the centre-right New Democracy party, the Germans and others hint that this time the euro zone is reasonably well placed to cope with a Greek departure. A bail-out mechanism is in place, Europe's banks are in better shape and, after most private bondholders accepted a whopping haircut in 2011, over three-quarters of Greek debt is in ""official"" hands, reducing fears of contagion. Foreign investors are better able to distinguish among euro members. Bond yields outside Greece have remained flat throughout the latest turmoil. 
Does this mean the risk posed by Greece is now commensurate with its tiny share (2%) of euro-zone GDP? Sadly not. Grexit would still shatter the illusion that membership of the currency is irreversible. In the medium to long term that would make the euro a riskier proposition, opening the door to speculative attacks on other euro members. Make no mistake, says a senior EU official: Grexit ""would be a disaster"". But for it to be avoided, there will need to be compromise on both sides--perhaps more on Greece's. European officials insist they will countenance no reversal of Greece's main fiscal and structural reforms, partly for fear of emboldening anti-austerians elsewhere. Nor will they accept another debt write-off. At best Mr Tsipras might win more lenient terms for its repayment, notably a further extension of maturities--which already stretch far into the future. 
There are solid grounds for thinking a deal is possible. Since 2012 Mr Tsipras has become more sensible and his Syriza more professional. He has tightened party discipline. And polls suggest Syriza may have to rely on the support of a more moderate party to govern; that could help Mr Tsipras reach agreement. For their part, troika officials are mulling an extension of the bail-out to provide time for talks. Mr Tsipras has clambered to the top of Greek politics by promising a rupture with the old ways, but in the end may sign up to a classic European fudge. 
European officials had hoped to avoid a Syriza-led government. But it should be no surprise if a country that has seen a 25% fall in output, unemployment at 26% and over one-third of the population at risk of poverty rejected those who have overseen such misery. The Germans and others have often displayed a tin ear to the suffering caused by the austerity-first policies they have pushed (Mr Tsipras refers to ""fiscal waterboarding""). The surprise is that a radical alternative has not emerged before. 
What took you so long? 
Still, Europe's establishment is right to worry. The chances of an accident are real. Mr Tsipras must sell a deal to the more militant members of his party, some of whom were never convinced by the euro. Syriza's leaders are inexperienced negotiators, and their pre-election contacts with some creditors have been slim to non-existent. Worse, the latest phase of Greece's euro-zone bail-out expires at the end of February, and various bond repayments are due soon afterwards. That leaves little time for Mr Tsipras and his merry band of neophytes to reach an accommodation. 
Just as Greece's treatment within the euro zone was never about Greece alone, today its politics resonates well beyond its borders. Podemos, an anti-austerity outfit that has emerged from nowhere to top the polls in Spain, explicitly allies itself with Syriza; its leader, Pablo Iglesias, frames the Greek election as a tussle between Mr Tsipras and Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor. Podemos's platform is barmy and its leaders, a ragtag of anti-capitalists and Hugo Chavez fans, are not, to put it mildly, ready to govern. But by shaking up a creaky two-party system they may have already performed a valuable service for Spaniards. 
One sorry legacy of the euro crisis has been a weakening of the bonds of democratic legitimacy between rulers and ruled. The euro zone has only just begun to grapple with the tensions of a monetary union not backed by a political one. And Mr Tsipras looks more likely to fall back on socialist shibboleths than to tackle Greece's pernicious clientelism and corruption. But if a Syriza victory gives Greeks the sense that they have at least a small influence on their own destiny, that could go some way to repairing the damage of the past few years. For their part, Europeans might consider themselves lucky that their first serious joust with populism has a chance of avoiding disaster.","A populist election win need not spell disaster for Greece -- or for the euro zone

Mr Tsipras, who is fiercely against both austerity and economic reforms, formed a coalition government with a small far-right anti-austerity party and appointed a number of radical leftists to his cabinet. Greek markets sank on fears that the country might be pushed out of the euro. 
Creditors of Greece, led by Germany, insisted that they would not offer the new Greek government any debt relief or other concessions. Instead they called on Greece to stick to its bail-out programme. But Syriza retorted that the ""humiliation and suffering"" of austerity were over. 
Fierce fighting resumed in eastern Ukraine, with rebel forces shelling the port city of Mariupol and continuing to lay siege to areas around Donetsk airport. Russia's Vladimir Putin declared that the Ukrainian army was a ""foreign legion"" for NATO. 
America and some European countries called for new sanctions to be imposed on Russia for stepping up its military intervention in eastern Ukraine. But some European governments, including the new Greek one, said that they would instead prefer to relax sanctions.

A tangled web 
Argentina's president, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, announced a shake-up of the country's intelligence service following the unexplained death of the prosecutor who was investigating the bombing in 1994 of a Jewish centre in Buenos Aires. The prosecutor, Alberto Nisman, who died from a gunshot, had accused the president of trying to thwart the investigation. Ms Fernandez suggested that he had been fed false information by the intelligence service. The journalist who broke the news of Mr Nisman's death, Damian Pachter, left the country claiming he feared for his safety. 
Venezuela's left-wing regime barred former presidents of Colombia and Chile from visiting Leopoldo Lopez, an opposition leader, in jail. Mr Lopez was arrested during protests in 2014. Andres Pastrana of Colombia and Sebastian Pinera of Chile were in Venezuela to attend a meeting on democracy organised by the opposition. 
Marching orders 
Chinese media reported that China is planning to stage a large military parade in September to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of the second world war. It would be the first such show under the leadership of Xi Jinping, and a rare event. Previous ones have been held on China's National Day, usually ten years apart. The last was in 2009. The parade would be seen as a gesture aimed at Japan; China accuses its politicians of whitewashing the war. 
Dozens of police were killed in fighting with Islamist rebels in the southern province of Maguindanao in the Philippines. Several rebels were also reportedly killed when police, searching for terror suspects, entered a village held by the Moro Islamic Liberation Front. It was the bloodiest clash since the government and the rebels agreed last year to end decades of fighting. 
Barack Obama became the first American president to attend India's Republic Day parade. He watched the military spectacle in Delhi seated next to the prime minister, Narendra Modi, who went out of his way to display friendship, greeting Mr Obama at the airport and referring to him as ""Barack"". The two men reached an agreement that could allow American companies to build nuclear reactors in India. Worries about China's rise and the spread of jihadist terrorism have brought the two countries closer together.

A jury found a former CIA officer guilty under the Espionage Act of passing classified information to a journalist from the New York Times.

IT WAS in Greece that the infernal euro crisis began just over five years ago. So it is classically fitting that Greece should now be where the denouement may be played out--thanks to the big election win on January 25th for the far-left populist Syriza party led by Alexis Tsipras (see pages 19-22). By demanding a big cut in Greece's debt and promising a public-spending spree, Mr Tsipras has thrown down the greatest challenge so far to Europe's single currency--and thus to Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor, who has set the austere path for the continent. 
The stakes are high. Although everybody, including Mr Tsipras, insists they want Greece to stay in the euro, there is now a clear threat of Grexit. In 2011-12 Mrs Merkel wavered, but then decided to support the Greeks to keep them in the single currency. She did not want Germany to be blamed for another European disaster, and both northern creditors and southern debtors were nervous about the consequences of a chaotic Greek exit for Europe's banks and their economies. 
This time the odds have changed. Grexit would look more like the Greeks' fault, Europe's economy is stronger and 80% of Greece's debt is in the hands of other governments or official bodies. Above all the politics are different. The Finns and the Dutch, like the Germans, want Greece to stick to promises it made when they twice bailed it out. And in southern Europe centrist governments fear that a successful Greek blackmail would push voters towards their own populist opposition parties, like Spain's Podemos (see Charlemagne). 
A good answer to a bad question 
It could all get very messy. But there are broadly three possible outcomes: the good, the disastrous, and a compromise to kick the can down the road. The history of the euro has always been to defer the pain, but now the battle is about politics not economics--and compromise may be much harder. 
Tantalisingly, there is a good solution to be grabbed for both Greece and Europe. Mr Tsipras has got two big things right, and one completely wrong. He is right that Europe's austerity has been excessive. Mrs Merkel's policies have been throttling the continent's economy and have ushered in deflation. The belated launch of quantitative easing (QE) by the European Central Bank admits as much. Mr Tsipras is also right that Greece's debt, which has risen from 109% to a colossal 175% of GDP over the past six years despite tax rises and spending cuts, is unpayable. Greece should be put into a forgiveness programme just like a bankrupt African country. But Mr Tsipras is wrong to abandon reform at home. His plans to rehire 12,000 public-sector workers, abandon privatisation and introduce a big rise in the minimum wage would all undo Greece's hard-won gains in competitiveness. 
Hence this newspaper's solution: get Mr Tsipras to junk his crazy socialism and to stick to structural reforms in exchange for debt forgiveness--either by pushing the maturity of Greek debt out even further or, better still, by reducing its face value. Mr Tspiras could vent his leftist urges by breaking up Greece's cosy protected oligopolies and tackling corruption. The combination of macroeconomic easing with microeconomic structural reform might even provide a model for other countries, like Italy and even France. 
A very logical dream--until you wake up and remember that Mr Tsipras probably is a crazy leftwinger and Mrs Merkel can barely accept the existing plans for QE. Hence the second, disastrous outcome: Grexit. Optimists are right that it would now be less painful than in 2012, but it would still hurt. 
In Greece it would lead to bust banks, onerous capital controls, more loss of income, unemployment even higher than today's 25% rate--and the country's likely exit from the European Union. The knock-on effects of Grexit on the rest of Europe would also be tough. It would immediately trigger doubts over whether Portugal, Spain and even Italy should or could stay in the euro. The euro's new protections, the banking union and a bail-out fund, are, to put it mildly, untested. 
So the most likely answer is a temporary fudge--but it is one that is unlikely to last long. If Mr Tsipras gets no debt relief, then he will lose all credibility with Greek voters. But even if he wins only marginal improvements in Greece's position, other countries are bound to resist. Any changes in the bail-out terms will have to be voted on in some national parliaments, including Finland's. If they passed, voters in countries like Spain and Portugal would demand an end to their own austerity. Worse still, populists from the right and left in France and Italy, who are not just against austerity but against their countries' membership of the euro, would be strengthened. 
And there are technical problems with any fudge. The ECB is adamant that it cannot provide emergency liquidity to Greece's banks or buy up its bonds unless Mr Tsipras's government is in an agreed programme with creditors, so any impasse is likely to trigger a run on Greek banks. By stretching out maturities, some of this could be avoided--but that may be too little for Mr Tsipras and too much for Mrs Merkel. 
Hello to Berlin 
So in the end, Greece will probably force Europe to make some hard choices. With luck it will be towards the good outcome outlined above. Greek voters may be living in a fool's paradise if they think Mr Tsipras can deliver what he says, but the Germans too have to look at the consequences of their obstinacy. Five years after the onset of the euro crisis, southern euro-zone countries remain stuck with near-zero growth and blisteringly high unemployment. Deflation is setting in, so debt burdens rise despite fiscal austerity. When policies are delivering such bad outcomes, a revolt by Greek voters was both predictable and understandable. 
If Mrs Merkel continues to oppose all efforts to kick-start growth and banish deflation in the euro zone, she will condemn Europe to a lost decade even more debilitating than Japan's in the 1990s. That would surely trigger a bigger populist backlash than Greece's, right across Europe. It is hard to see how the single currency could survive in such circumstances. And the biggest loser if it did not would be Germany itself.","Alexis Tsipras's could lead to Grexit , but Alexis Tsipras should lead to a better future for the euro

2015-01-31,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/1650583580/fulltext/1D3F91CBD9874E26PQ/9?accountid=14657,"Syriza's success increases the risk of ""Grexit"" and will embolden anti-austerity parties across Europe 
""WE HAVE finally put behind us the vicious cycle of fear and austerity."" So declared Alexis Tsipras, Greece's new prime minister, to crowds cheering his party's election victory on January 25th. Up to then, countries on the edge of the euro zone, forced to embrace harsh budget cuts and pledges of reform as the price for their bail-outs between 2010 and 2013, had--surprisingly--accepted the nasty medicine without a big populist revolt. That changed when Syriza, a radical far-left party led by Mr Tsipras, won power after campaigning to cast aside austerity, backtrack on reforms and insist that Greece's vast debt is slashed. 
These promises may have won votes for Syriza, but they have given investors the jitters. The stockmarket swooned--led by Greek banks, which suffered their biggest one-day drop ever on January 28th--and short-term bond yields jumped. Syriza's pledges are also unacceptable to other European governments, whose already sulky voters resent stumping up any more for Greece. The one that matters most is Germany. The country's chancellor, Angela Merkel, will be wary of any concessions that might encourage insurrectionist parties elsewhere in Europe. 
So will one side give way? Or could the clash lead to the result from which both Greece and its euro-zone partners recoiled in 2012: ""Grexit"" from the euro, with painful consequences all round? Mr Tsipras insists that his country will stay in the euro, a policy backed by three-quarters of the Greek public. He has softened the hostile stance he took in the 2012 election, when Syriza campaigned to tear up the ""memorandum"", the conditions set by Greece's creditors for its two huge bail-outs, amounting to EUR 246 billion ($278 billion) in all and policed by the ""troika"" of the European Commission, the IMF and the European Central Bank (ECB). 
If that calmed nerves in Brussels and Berlin, his first steps as prime minister will have frayed them again. After coming close to winning an outright majority in the Greek Parliament, with 149 seats out of 300 (see chart 1 on next page), Mr Tsipras alarmed creditors by choosing as his coalition partner the Independent Democrats, a far-right party led by Panos Kammenos, which stridently supports Syriza's line on debt relief and an end to austerity. 
His first public act as prime minister was to visit a memorial for 200 Greeks killed by the Nazis in 1944: a gesture wreathed in symbolism for a man who rails against the German-led ""occupation"" of his country. Soon afterwards, he objected loudly to a supposedly unanimous EU statement criticising Russia's renewed aggression in Ukraine. 
A colourful team of ministers hardly suggests that compromise is on the cards. Yanis Varoufakis, appointed as finance minister, is an economist and blogger who has protested against ""the fiscal waterboarding policies that have turned Greece into a debt colony"". Mr Varoufakis honed his skills as an academic, but also once worked as a consultant for a computer-games firm. Panagiotis Lafazanis, a Marxist who heads Syriza's far-left faction, will run a ministry incorporating energy and the environment. At least George Stathakis, the new minister for the economy together with tourism, transport and shipping, the country's biggest industries, is an expert on Greece's first big bail-out, the Marshall plan of 1948. 
Cleaning up Greece 
Mr Tsipras has a mandate from the voters--though Syriza's 36% share of the vote was hardly a landslide--that empowers him to make changes. But how much room for manoeuvre does he have? 
In some respects the country is less vulnerable than it was in the summer of 2012, when it teetered on the brink of falling out of the monetary union. The economy is in better shape. A lingering recession ended last year. Growth of 0.7% in the third quarter of 2014 put Greece among the best performers in the euro zone. The country can now boast a small current-account surplus, a massive turnaround from 2008. The public finances are healthier than in 2012, thanks to the same austerity that Mr Tsipras so abhors. Furthermore, despite Greece's extraordinarily high public debt, worth some 175% of GDP last year, successive concessions have eased its debt-servicing charges to such an extent that annual cash interest payments are now only 3% of GDP. 
Regardless of these improvements, the Greek economy and public finances remain fragile. For the first time since 2012 bank deposits are being run down, by EUR 3 billion in December and reportedly by up to EUR 11 billion this month. The uncertainty is also harming tax revenues, which were much lower than expected in December. It is against this background that Mr Tsipras has pledged to launch a welfare package worth EUR 2 billion to end what he calls Greece's humanitarian crisis; to rehire 12,000 sacked civil servants; and to freeze privatisations. A crackdown on tax evasion by the wealthy and ending the grip on state procurement of Greece's ""oligarchs"", who control media outlets and parts of the judiciary, are unlikely to do enough to pay for Mr Tsipras's largesse. 
Syriza and its supporters may rail against the terms of their bail-outs, but Greece remains dependent on official support. Its debt is rated as junk. Bond yields fell sharply in the first half of 2014; but as political worries came to the fore towards the end of last year, yields jumped back to unaffordable levels (see chart 2). 
Financial health-check 
Even before Syriza's victory, Greece and its creditors were at loggerheads, with the troika wanting more cuts in the 2015 budget and dissatisfied with the government's failure to push through enough reforms. That caused a suspension of payments until the latest review of Greek performance in complying with the bail-out terms was completed. As a result, the European bail-out, which was due to end last year, has been extended until the end of February. The IMF's portion of the rescue is scheduled to run until early 2016. 
Without a successful conclusion of the review, Greece will be denied the final tranche of European loans of EUR 1.8 billion, as well as a further EUR 1.7 billion that this would trigger through another form of help, in which profits on the ECB's holdings of Greek bonds are routed back to Greece. A successful deal would also release a further EUR 3.5 billion from the IMF. In all, Greece could lose EUR 7 billion, together with commitments of an additional EUR 13 billion from the IMF by early 2016. 
That would be disastrous, since Greece has some substantial payments to make over the next few months. To avoid default, Greece must honour repayments of its first bail-out loans from the IMF, together with redemptions of other bonds that are due. The IMF is due to get EUR 2.5 billion in the first quarter of 2015 and the same again in the second quarter. The Greek government must also repay to the ECB EUR 6.7 billion in July and August for sovereign bonds that the central bank bought when trying to quell market panic after Greece's first bail-out, in May 2010. Although the government apparently has EUR 10 billion stashed away in public-sector reserves, getting at these quickly will be difficult. And even if it is possible, making the payments to the IMF and the ECB could push Greece to the limit--especially if the tax take continues to fall short. 
This puts Mr Tsipras under a lot of pressure to agree upon an extension of the current EU bail-out programme. The EU would have no objection to that. Having to ask--a condition set by Brussels--would mean an embarrassing about-turn for the new prime minister; yet he does not have much choice. Germany and the IMF have made it clear that debt relief cannot be discussed unless Greece completes the review, stays on track with fiscal targets and carries out more structural reforms. 
Even if the bail-out programme were extended, that would not resolve the dispute between Mr Tsipras and the rest of Europe. The quarrel might mean that the ECB takes a tougher line with Greek banks. At present it is prepared to lend to them on the same terms as other euro-zone banks. But if Mr Tsipras is too provocative, the ECB will insist that funding is ""emergency liquidity assistance"" at the Bank of Greece's risk rather than that of all euro-area central banks. Besides sending a message to the Greek government, it would raise the cost of the banks' borrowing. The ECB could take such a decision in the next few days if Mr Tsipras sends it the wrong signals. 
Just days after the celebrations among Syriza supporters in the wake of their election triumph, the mood in Athens is edgy. If depositors panic and banks wobble, that could lead to a crisis that might end either with Grexit or in a humiliating climb-down that spells an early end for the new government--as well as political chaos. 
Avoiding a collapse of the banks is merely the first task for Mr Tsipras. If he gives in to the demands of the troika, Syriza's fractious far-left wing, the Left Platform, is bound to rebel. This group of Maoists, Marxists and supporters of Che Guevara controls about a third of the party. Hungry for power, the Left Platform dropped its ideological objections to co-operating with Mr Kammenos's party in return for Mr Lafazanis getting his cabinet post. An angry or disappointed Mr Lafazanis could split the party and bring down Mr Tsipras's government. 
Writing off a write-off 
Even if Mr Tsipras wants to make peace with Greece's creditors, an accident may happen along the way. His government is frighteningly inexperienced for the size of the task it must undertake. The dangers of sounding unnecessarily aggressive or acting hastily are magnified by the delicate negotiations it faces. Only one cabinet member, Giannis Dragasakis, a former central-committee member of the Greek communist party, has ever served in government before. 
European creditors can make a few limited concessions. Debt forgiveness--writing off some official debt--has been ruled out. But it would be possible to relieve the debt burden by further extending the maturities on the loans, although these have already been stretched to an average of 30 or so years. On the other hand, the German government will object to any let-up in Greece's own effort to bring down the debt burden, which involves running a sustained primary (ie, before interest) budget surplus of more than 4% of GDP from 2016. And it is just as concerned to prevent Mr Tsipras rowing back on reforms that are seen as indispensable if Greece is to pay its way and not rely on more transfers. 
If Mr Tsipras pushes his luck, creditors are likely to push back equally firmly, insisting that failure to abide by their terms would mean Greece being expelled from the monetary union. The German government came close to taking this decision in 2012, but pulled back; Mrs Merkel was worried about the wider consequences for the euro zone. However, officials in Berlin reckon that the risk of financial and economic contagion is now lower. 
The euro area now has a permanent rescue fund. And with the ECB launching its big programme of quantitative easing in March, creating money to buy sovereign bonds and other assets, a flare-up in the bond markets of other peripheral countries seems less likely. There has so far been little sign of contagion from Greece to the rest of southern Europe. The political risks for Mrs Merkel are also lower, because it would be Mr Tsipras who would be blamed rather than her. 
That calculation may yet be proved wrong. Grexit would breach the principle that euro membership is irrevocable, making investors worry about other countries that might be forced out. But whatever the wider impact, the consequences for Greece would be traumatic. Overnight, euros would become a foreign currency as the government converted domestic assets and liabilities into drachmas. A new Greek currency would immediately plummet in value. The IMF reckoned nearly three years ago that it would fall by 50%; some economists thought it would fall by even more. 
Such a depreciation would restore Greek competitiveness with a bang, helping to lure tourists and boost exports. But it would also trigger inflation, as prices of imports shot up. More important, currency depreciation would make Greece's foreign debts, which would remain in euros, unsustainable. That would cause the country to default, which could lock it out of global capital markets for years. 
The shock of Grexit would hit the economy hard. The IMF estimated in early 2012 that, in the first year, it could depress GDP (which was already falling sharply) by an additional eight percentage points. The impact now might be less severe, but Greece would still lurch from its recovery into a renewed and sharp recession. The longer-term benefits from regained competitiveness might also be lost if it were forced to leave the EU and the single market as well as the euro, as a widely cited legal paper from the ECB maintains. 
Even if Grexit is only halfway as ruinous as these projections suggest, Mr Tsipras should be wary about provoking such an outcome, especially as Greeks want to remain in the euro. This suggests that, despite a bigger-than-expected election victory, his bargaining position is weak. The task for European governments is to find a way for him to retreat from his demands without losing face altogether. 
His war-memorial visit and complaint about the official statement on Russia are dismissed by officials in Brussels as gestures for domestic consumption. A meeting of EU heads of government on February 12th, Mr Tsipras's first, may be more revealing. What can he achieve? On paper he has little leverage. And he has aroused high expectations among voters and his fractious party. 
Discussions with Brussels are only part of the story. Any bail-out extension must be approved by parliaments in Germany, Finland, the Netherlands and Estonia: four countries not renowned for their forbearance towards fiscal sinners. The attitudes of such hardline governments will matter at least as much as those of EU institutions. 
The Finnish government, which in 2011 refused to back Greece's second bail-out until it was offered collateral, has every reason to be tough: it faces a difficult election in April, and there are few votes to be won by being nice to Greeks. Similarly, the Dutch government must contend with the threat of Geert Wilders's populist Party for Freedom, which has lately been leading the opinion polls. 
Yet the crucial country is Germany. Politicians in Mrs Merkel's ruling coalition have couched their intransigence in appeals to the sanctity of rules. Steffen Seibert, her spokesman, insists that the new Greek government must meet the commitments made by the outgoing one. Wolfgang Schauble, Germany's finance minister and a stern advocate of fiscal probity, declared both that he respected the outcome of Greece's election and that the new government must respect the ""obligations"" to which its predecessor had signed up. 
The talk is tough at the centre of German politics. Any hint of softness towards Greece might increase the appeal of the political fringes. The Left, a party that descends from the Communists who once ruled East Germany and that sees Syriza as an ideological ally, cheered what it hoped was the start of an uprising against Mrs Merkel's policies. On the populist right the Alternative for Germany, a party founded in 2013 with a call to dissolve the euro, also celebrated, believing that the Greek election would bring its goal closer. Its leader, Bernd Lucke, suggested that Greece should leave the single currency at once. 
Heading for the Grexit? 
Earlier this month, Mrs Merkel's government let it be known that it now sees Grexit as ""bearable"" for the rest of the euro. She prefers to keep Greece in the single currency, and may be willing to yield to Mr Tsipras just enough to let him declare victory at home--for instance, by extending the maturities of existing Greek debt. But she is unlikely to go further. The prospects of cutting Greek debt by up to half, as Mr Tsipras has demanded, appear remote. Giving handouts to governments that throw tantrums, runs the argument, makes it harder to maintain pressure on larger countries in need of reform, such as France and Italy. 
As ever, the looming Greek crisis is about far more than Greece. Going soft on Greece may also embolden Syriza-like parties in other countries (see Charlemagne). In Spain Podemos, a party that emerged from nowhere to lead the polls, has closely allied itself with Syriza. Its leader, Pablo Iglesias, singles out Mrs Merkel, with her ruthless demands for austerity, as the foe of Europe's downtrodden. It is perhaps no coincidence that ministers from Spain and Portugal, both run by centre-right governments facing anti-austerity challenges in elections this year, were among the first to warn of the dangers of dancing to Syriza's tune after the election. 
In this context, German lawmakers are unlikely to look upon Greek demands with sympathy. But many Europeans want to change the conversation: under its new president, Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission has, for example, been battling to win support for an ingeniously engineered pan-European investment package. The French and Italian governments, in danger of incurring the EU's wrath over their fiscal stances, are similarly keen to leave the austerity years behind. 
Until now, Europe's fiscal squabbles have rarely amounted to more than a phoney war. Politicians such as Antonis Samaras, the man Mr Tsipras replaces, who denounced austerity as opposition leaders, found themselves signing up to it once they were in office. The election of Francois Hollande as France's president in 2012 was supposed to tilt Europe in a more growth-friendly direction, but the country's structural weaknesses and his own missteps have weakened his hand. Germany was never short of noisy critics, but none of them held office. With Mr Tsipras's election, that is no longer the case.","Syriza 's success increases the risk of "" Grexit "" and will embolden anti - austerity parties across Europe 
 "" Alexis Tsipras HAVE finally put behind Alexis Tsipras the vicious cycle of fear and austerity . "" So declared Alexis Tsipras , Alexis Tsipras's new prime minister , to crowds cheering his party 's election victory on January 25th . Up to then , countries on the edge of the euro zone , forced to embrace harsh budget cuts and pledges of reform as the price for their bail - outs between 2010 and 2013 , had -- surprisingly -- accepted the nasty medicine without a big populist revolt . That changed when Syriza , a radical far - left party led by Mr Tsipras , won power after campaigning to cast aside austerity , backtrack on reforms and insist that Alexis Tsipras's vast debt is slashed . 
 These promises may have won votes for Syriza , but they have given investors the jitters . The stockmarket swooned -- led by Greek banks , which suffered their biggest one - day drop ever on January 28th -- and short - term bond yields jumped . Syriza 's pledges are also unacceptable to other European governments , whose already sulky voters resent stumping up any more for Alexis Tsipras . The one that matters most is Germany . The country 's chancellor , Angela Merkel , will be wary of any concessions that might encourage insurrectionist parties elsewhere in Europe . 
 So will one side give way ? Or could the clash lead to the result from which both Alexis Tsipras and Alexis Tsipras's euro - zone partners recoiled in 2012 : "" Grexit "" from the euro , with painful consequences all round ? Mr Tsipras insists that Alexis Tsipras's will stay in the euro , a policy backed by three - quarters of the Greek public . He has softened the hostile stance he took in the 2012 election , when Syriza campaigned to tear up the "" memorandum "" , the conditions set by Alexis Tsipras's creditors for Alexis Tsipras's two huge bail - outs , amounting to EUR 246 billion ( $ 278 billion ) in all and policed by the "" troika "" of the European Commission , the IMF and the European Central Bank ( ECB ) . 
 If that calmed nerves in Brussels and Berlin , his first steps as prime minister will have frayed them again . After coming close to winning an outright majority in the Greek Parliament , with 149 seats out of 300 ( see chart 1 on next page ) , Mr Tsipras alarmed creditors by choosing as his coalition partner the Independent Democrats , a far - right party led by Panos Kammenos , which stridently supports Syriza 's line on debt relief and an end to austerity . 
 His first public act as prime minister was to visit a memorial for 200 Greeks killed by the Nazis in 1944 : a gesture wreathed in symbolism for a man who rails against the German - led "" occupation "" of Alexis Tsipras's . Soon afterwards , he objected loudly to a supposedly unanimous EU statement criticising Russia 's renewed aggression in Ukraine . 
 A colourful team of ministers hardly suggests that compromise is on the cards . Yanis Varoufakis , appointed as finance minister , is an economist and blogger who has protested against "" the fiscal waterboarding policies that have turned Alexis Tsipras into a debt colony "" . Mr Varoufakis honed his skills as an academic , but also once worked as a consultant for a computer - games firm . Panagiotis Lafazanis , a Marxist who heads Syriza 's far - left faction , will run a ministry incorporating energy and the environment . At least George Stathakis , the new minister for the economy together with tourism , transport and shipping , Alexis Tsipras's biggest industries , is an expert on Alexis Tsipras's first big bail - out , the Marshall plan of 1948 . 
 Cleaning up Alexis Tsipras 
 Mr Tsipras has a mandate from the voters -- though Syriza 's 36 % share of the vote was hardly a landslide -- that empowers him to make changes . But how much room for manoeuvre does he have ? 
 In some respects Alexis Tsipras is less vulnerable than Alexis Tsipras was in the summer of 2012 , when Alexis Tsipras teetered on the brink of falling out of the monetary union . The economy is in better shape . A lingering recession ended last year . Growth of 0.7 % in the third quarter of 2014 put Alexis Tsipras among the best performers in the euro zone . Alexis Tsipras can now boast a small current - account surplus , a massive turnaround from 2008 . The public finances are healthier than in 2012 , thanks to the same austerity that Mr Tsipras so abhors . Furthermore , despite Alexis Tsipras's extraordinarily high public debt , worth some 175 % of GDP last year , successive concessions have eased Alexis Tsipras's debt - servicing charges to such an extent that annual cash interest payments are now only 3 % of GDP . 
 Regardless of these improvements , the Alexis Tsipras economy and public finances remain fragile . For the first time since 2012 bank deposits are being run down , by EUR 3 billion in December and reportedly by up to EUR 11 billion this month . The uncertainty is also harming tax revenues , which were much lower than expected in December . It is against this background that Mr Tsipras has pledged to launch a welfare package worth EUR 2 billion to end what he calls Alexis Tsipras's humanitarian crisis ; to rehire 12,000 sacked civil servants ; and to freeze privatisations . A crackdown on tax evasion by the wealthy and ending the grip on state procurement of Alexis Tsipras's "" oligarchs "" , who control media outlets and parts of the judiciary , are unlikely to do enough to pay for Mr Tsipras 's largesse . 
 Syriza and its supporters may rail against the terms of their bail - outs , but Alexis Tsipras remains dependent on official support . Alexis Tsipras's debt is rated as junk . Bond yields fell sharply in the first half of 2014 ; but as political worries came to the fore towards the end of last year , yields jumped back to unaffordable levels ( see chart 2 ) . 
 Financial health - check 
 Even before Syriza 's victory , Alexis Tsipras and Alexis Tsipras's creditors were at loggerheads , with the troika wanting more cuts in the 2015 budget and dissatisfied with Alexis Tsipras's failure to push through enough reforms . That caused a suspension of payments until the latest review of Alexis Tsipras performance in complying with the bail - out terms was completed . As a result , the European bail - out , which was due to end last year , has been extended until the end of February . The IMF 's portion of the rescue is scheduled to run until early 2016 . 
 Without a successful conclusion of the review , Alexis Tsipras will be denied the final tranche of European loans of EUR 1.8 billion , as well as a further EUR 1.7 billion that this would trigger through another form of help , in which profits on the ECB 's holdings of Alexis Tsipras bonds are routed back to Alexis Tsipras . A successful deal would also release a further EUR 3.5 billion from the IMF . In all , Alexis Tsipras could lose EUR 7 billion , together with commitments of an additional EUR 13 billion from the IMF by early 2016 . 
 That would be disastrous , since Alexis Tsipras has some substantial payments to make over the next few months . To avoid default , Alexis Tsipras must honour repayments of Alexis Tsipras's first bail - out loans from the IMF , together with redemptions of other bonds that are due . The IMF is due to get EUR 2.5 billion in the first quarter of 2015 and the same again in the second quarter . Alexis Tsipras must also repay to the ECB EUR 6.7 billion in July and August for sovereign bonds that the central bank bought when trying to quell market panic after Alexis Tsipras's first bail - out , in May 2010 . Although Alexis Tsipras apparently has EUR 10 billion stashed away in public - sector reserves , getting at these quickly will be difficult . And even if it is possible , making the payments to the IMF and the ECB could push Alexis Tsipras to the limit -- especially if the tax take continues to fall short . 
 This puts Mr Tsipras under a lot of pressure to agree upon an extension of the current EU bail - out programme . The EU would have no objection to that . Having to ask -- a condition set by Brussels -- would mean an embarrassing about - turn for the new prime minister ; yet he does not have much choice . Germany and the IMF have made it clear that debt relief can not be discussed unless Alexis Tsipras completes the review , stays on track with fiscal targets and carries out more structural reforms . 
 Even if the bail - out programme were extended , that would not resolve the dispute between Mr Tsipras and the rest of Europe . The quarrel might mean that the ECB takes a tougher line with Greek banks . At present it is prepared to lend to them on the same terms as other euro - zone banks . But if Mr Tsipras is too provocative , the ECB will insist that funding is "" emergency liquidity assistance "" at the Bank of Greece 's risk rather than that of all euro - area central banks . Besides sending a message to Alexis Tsipras , it would raise the cost of the banks ' borrowing . The ECB could take such a decision in the next few days if Mr Tsipras sends it the wrong signals . 
 Just days after the celebrations among Syriza supporters in the wake of their election triumph , the mood in Athens is edgy . If depositors panic and banks wobble , that could lead to a crisis that might end either with Grexit or in a humiliating climb - down that spells an early end for Alexis Tsipras -- as well as political chaos . 
 Avoiding a collapse of the banks is merely the first task for Mr Tsipras . If he gives in to the demands of the troika , Syriza 's fractious far - left wing , the Left Platform , is bound to rebel . This group of Maoists , Marxists and supporters of Che Guevara controls about a third of the party . Hungry for power , the Left Platform dropped its ideological objections to co - operating with Mr Kammenos 's party in return for Mr Lafazanis getting his cabinet post . An angry or disappointed Mr Lafazanis could split the party and bring down Alexis Tsipras's . 
 Writing off a write - off 
 Even if Mr Tsipras wants to make peace with Alexis Tsipras's creditors , an accident may happen along the way . Alexis Tsipras's is frighteningly inexperienced for the size of the task Alexis Tsipras must undertake . The dangers of sounding unnecessarily aggressive or acting hastily are magnified by the delicate negotiations Alexis Tsipras faces . Only one cabinet member , Giannis Dragasakis , a former central - committee member of the Greek communist party , has ever served in government before . 
 European creditors can make a few limited concessions . Debt forgiveness -- writing off some official debt -- has been ruled out . But it would be possible to relieve the debt burden by further extending the maturities on the loans , although these have already been stretched to an average of 30 or so years . On the other hand , the German government will object to any let - up in Alexis Tsipras's own effort to bring down the debt burden , which involves running a sustained primary ( ie , before interest ) budget surplus of more than 4 % of GDP from 2016 . And it is just as concerned to prevent Mr Tsipras rowing back on reforms that are seen as indispensable if Alexis Tsipras is to pay Alexis Tsipras's way and not rely on more transfers . 
 If Mr Tsipras pushes his luck , creditors are likely to push back equally firmly , insisting that failure to abide by their terms would mean Alexis Tsipras being expelled from the monetary union . The German government came close to taking this decision in 2012 , but pulled back ; Mrs Merkel was worried about the wider consequences for the euro zone . However , officials in Berlin reckon that the risk of financial and economic contagion is now lower . 
 The euro area now has a permanent rescue fund . And with the ECB launching its big programme of quantitative easing in March , creating money to buy sovereign bonds and other assets , a flare - up in the bond markets of other peripheral countries seems less likely . There has so far been little sign of contagion from Alexis Tsipras to the rest of southern Europe . The political risks for Mrs Merkel are also lower , because it would be Mr Tsipras who would be blamed rather than her . 
 That calculation may yet be proved wrong . Grexit would breach the principle that euro membership is irrevocable , making investors worry about other countries that might be forced out . But whatever the wider impact , the consequences for Alexis Tsipras would be traumatic . Overnight , euros would become a foreign currency as the government converted domestic assets and liabilities into drachmas . A new Greek currency would immediately plummet in value . The IMF reckoned nearly three years ago that it would fall by 50 % ; some economists thought it would fall by even more . 
 Such a depreciation would restore Alexis Tsipras competitiveness with a bang , helping to lure tourists and boost exports . But it would also trigger inflation , as prices of imports shot up . More important , currency depreciation would make Alexis Tsipras's foreign debts , which would remain in euros , unsustainable . That would cause Alexis Tsipras to default , which could lock Alexis Tsipras out of global capital markets for years . 
 The shock of Grexit would hit the economy hard . The IMF estimated in early 2012 that , in the first year , it could depress GDP ( which was already falling sharply ) by an additional eight percentage points . The impact now might be less severe , but Alexis Tsipras would still lurch from Alexis Tsipras's recovery into a renewed and sharp recession . The longer - term benefits from regained competitiveness might also be lost if Alexis Tsipras were forced to leave the EU and the single market as well as the euro , as a widely cited legal paper from the ECB maintains . 
 Even if Grexit is only halfway as ruinous as these projections suggest , Mr Tsipras should be wary about provoking such an outcome , especially as Greeks want to remain in the euro . This suggests that , despite a bigger - than - expected election victory , his bargaining position is weak . The task for European governments is to find a way for him to retreat from his demands without losing face altogether . 
 His war - memorial visit and complaint about the official statement on Russia are dismissed by officials in Brussels as gestures for domestic consumption . A meeting of EU heads of government on February 12th , Mr Tsipras 's first , may be more revealing . What can he achieve ? On paper he has little leverage . And he has aroused high expectations among voters and his fractious party . 
 Discussions with Brussels are only part of the story . Any bail - out extension must be approved by parliaments in Germany , Finland , the Netherlands and Estonia : four countries not renowned for their forbearance towards fiscal sinners . The attitudes of such hardline governments will matter at least as much as those of EU institutions . 
 The Finnish government , which in 2011 refused to back Alexis Tsipras's second bail - out until it was offered collateral , has every reason to be tough : it faces a difficult election in April , and there are few votes to be won by being nice to Greeks . Similarly , the Dutch government must contend with the threat of Geert Wilders 's populist Party for Freedom , which has lately been leading the opinion polls .

EVERYTHING that exists, taught Aristotle, is the same as itself, and is different from everything else. During the hot years of the euro crisis, leaders of the most troubled economies sought desperately to remind investors of this eternal truth. Portugal, insisted its politicians, was not Greece. Nor was Spain Portugal, Italy Spain or France Italy. In short, the problems of one country were distinct from those of others. Yet the bond markets, disinclined to follow ancient wisdom, saw things differently. The contagion caused by spiralling borrowing costs leaping from one country to the next was one of the most alarming features of the crisis--and it explained how problems in tiny Greece could threaten the single currency as a whole. For a time, whenever a finance minister assured investors that his country was different, one could bet that it would suffer the same treatment. 
Lately the euro zone has appeared better protected. In June 2012, with Greece in political turmoil, yields on Spanish ten-year bonds topped 7%. This week they were near record lows, despite the election of an explicitly anti-austerity government in Greece. The early antics of Alexis Tsipras, the new Greek prime minister, spooked markets and again raised fears of Grexit. But the channels of contagion have narrowed, thanks to a partial banking union, a permanent bail-out fund and a restructuring of Greek debt, most of which is now in official hands. Investors at last seem to agree that Spain is Spain, not Greece. 
Yet voters may be drawing a different conclusion. Over the past year the growth of Syriza in Greece has been mirrored by the rise of Podemos (""We Can"") in Spain, a radical far-left party that considers itself to be waging a similar war on German-sponsored austerity. Leftists from across Europe flocked to Greece on election night to savour the sweet taste of Syriza's victory. Sympathetic pundits declared an end to the politics of austerity. Mr Tsipras's decision to form a coalition with an unsavoury bunch of nationalists soured the mood somewhat. But overall, the message seems clear: if financial contagion is now less of a worry, the political sort may just be starting. 
The ascendancy of Syriza is spreading political fears in two related ways. The first, much fretted over in Berlin and Brussels, is that Greece's euro-zone partners may feel obliged to offer Mr Tsipras goodies as a ""reward"" for his victory, weakening the hand of reformers in other countries. Such concerns may indeed mean that Mr Tsipras finds it harder than his predecessors to win concessions. The second is that his victory will embolden Podemos and similar parties elsewhere. Spain and Portugal hold elections later this year; Ireland no later than April 2016. Today, polls suggest that anti-austerity parties will do well in all three. 
Spain has a much larger economy than Greece and a more or less functioning public administration. It has not had to endure years of outsourced governance by the detested ""troika""--the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF, which together have enforced the rules of Greece's bail-outs since 2010. Mr Tsipras owes his election largely to public resentment at the austerity imposed by the troika, which he vows to send packing. Barring a bail-out of its banks in 2012, Spain has remained master of its own destiny. 
And yet the parallels remain striking. In Spain and Greece, both the centre-left and centre-right parties have held office during recent periods of hardship; many voters have therefore concluded that salvation lies in radical alternatives. In both countries public anger has had clear targets: in Spain, the banks, big business and corrupt politicians; in Greece, the architects of austerity and the executors of their policies. Spain and Greece have started to create jobs and growth, but unemployment in both stands at around 25%. For voters, politics-as-usual simply isn't working. 
Mr Tsipras's rise to power represents a new threat to Europe's German-led economic order, from both the far left and the far right. It is telling that Syriza, which has communist roots, has chosen to link up with the right-wing Independent Greeks: the two parties share little beyond hostility to Greece's treatment at the hands of its creditors. Anti-austerity leftists across Europe cheered Syriza's victory, but so did parties often described as ""far-right"": Marine Le Pen, leader of France's National Front, called it a ""monstrous democratic slap to the EU"", and Matteo Salvini, the boss of Italy's resurgent Northern League, said the Greeks had given the EU an ""electric shock"". 
Shocked and stirred 
What populist parties really seek to do, argues Jose Ignacio Torreblanca, a Madrid-based analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations, a think-tank, is to change the ""axis of competition"" in European politics from left v right to insider v outsider. Both Podemos and the National Front meet this description, even if they agree on little else. The weakening of traditional political loyalties opens a door for the populists. Economic stagnation helps their anti-elite case. The EU--plus, in some cases, immigrants--makes a convenient punchbag. And Syriza's victory demonstrates that the old order can be toppled. 
But it also throws up another test. Mr Tsipras has articulated well the rage of the outsider; now he must display the statesmanship of the insider. If he stumbles and Greece goes up in flames, voters elsewhere may be tempted to shuffle back to the safety of traditional parties. As for mainstream politicians, the lessons are not obvious. It is hard to do politics when an anti-politics mood is abroad. Something will have to give, but most of the old guard still cling to the arguments they know best. A day after Mr Tsipras's win, senior figures from both of Spain's mainstream parties found themselves repeating a mantra that some may have found wearily familiar: that Spain is not Greece.","Alexis Tsipras's will inspire other populists to challenge Europe 's political order

True to Syriza's promises, Mr Tsipras and Mr Varoufakis challenged their first visitors, Martin Schulz, president of the European Parliament, and Jeroen Dijsselbloem, chairman of the eurogroup of finance ministers, demanding an end to austerity, the dismantling of the ""troika"" of the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF, and an international conference to restructure Greece's debt of 175% of GDP. In return, the Syriza government would crack down on tax evasion and corruption, which previous administrations ignored, and produce a programme of structural reforms in June. 
To the delight of many Greeks, other cabinet members also announced measures to reverse many earlier reforms: pension increases, a 45% rise in the minimum wage, a return to collective bargaining and a freeze on privatisations. Poor households will get food stamps and free electricity. Mr Kammenos said that the armed forces would have their pay restored to pre-crisis levels, plus compensation for four years of pay cuts.

WHEN the far-left Syriza party won the Greek election last month, the hope was that the new prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, would moderate his demands so as to compromise with his country's creditors. After all, he (like the vast majority of Greeks) wants to stay in the single currency. But even as he prepared to meet fellow European Union leaders for the first time this week, he was making a Greek exit from the euro ever more likely. 
Mr Tsipras has put forward some good arguments against the austerity that has been imposed on Greece as the price of its bail-outs. He has sound ideas on attacking corruption, fighting tax evasion and shaking up Greece's cosy business elite. His ministers now talk of keeping 70% of the old government's reforms (see page 67). But his first moves in office included promises to raise the minimum wage to pre-crisis levels, reverse labour-market reforms, restore pension increases, rehire thousands of public servants and scrap privatisation projects. These would not just breach Greece's bail-out terms, but also wreck the country's economic prospects. 
To reverse course in this way when Greece's economy is at last growing and unemployment is falling is perverse. Greece needs more, not fewer reforms: despite progress in regaining lost competitiveness, its exports remain weak. In its business climate it lags behind neighbouring Bulgaria, the poorest EU country, in areas such as enforcing contracts, registering property and providing credit. 
Keeping Greece in the euro will require compromises. Greece's creditors need to decide what to trade, and when. Mr Tsipras foolishly refuses to prolong Greece's bail-out programme when it expires at the end of the month, talking instead of a bridging loan that would create time for negotiations to take place without monitoring by the hated ""troika"" of the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF. There is a case for removing the ECB, which is politicised by its involvement in the troika. But Mr Tsipras cannot expect more loans without conditions, as the bad-tempered break-up of this week's Eurogroup meeting demonstrated. Instead, he needs to extend the bail-out fast, and then enter talks. 
A doable debt deal 
In those talks there is scope for a deal. Greece's total debt stock stands at an unpayable 175% of GDP (up from 109% before the euro crisis). Mr Tsipras has dropped his demands for an immediate debt write-down. The maturity and interest cost of the debt, two-thirds of which is owed to official European creditors, are so generous that Greece pays a smaller share of GDP in debt service than Portugal and Italy. These terms could be made more generous still. And the creditors should be prepared to adopt a version of the IMF's old highly indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative for Africa: a promise to write down debt in stages at indeterminate future dates, but only in return for defined progress on reforms. 
It should also be possible to give Greece more fiscal breathing-space. The government is now required to run a primary (ie, pre-interest) budget surplus of 3% of GDP this year, rising to 4.5% from 2016 onwards. Mr Tsipras wants to cut that to no more than 1.5%. A compromise of around 2.5% would allow him to spend more on social programmes. 
Here, then, is a simple message for European leaders to give Mr Tsipras. They will negotiate, but only once the bail-out is extended. They will help him on debt and the budget, but only if he is prepared to make his economy more competitive. If an athlete insists on running backwards, even the most patient trainer cannot help him.","Unless Syriza changes course , Greece is inexorably heading out of the euro

ALEXIS TSIPRAS and his radical left Syriza party worked for more than a year while in opposition to prepare their policy platform. Over 80 committees were charged with producing specific proposals for overhauling different sectors of the Greek economy. Planning for power is one thing; exercising it quite another, especially when a country is in a hole as deep as Greece's. 
Syriza's programme, if fully implemented, will result in a sharp fall in revenues and a large increase in social spending. Yet many Greeks stopped paying taxes before last month's elections, anticipating cuts and forbearance. Government revenues fell by more than 20% in January on an annual basis; the 2015 budget is now likely to be derailed by the end of March, says a former finance minister. 
None of which plays well with Greece's creditors, whose EUR 245 billion ($277 billion) bail-out envisages austerity and reform, not splurges and backtracking. Wolfgang Schauble, Germany's finance minister, said on February 10th that if Greece did not seek an extension of its bail-out, which expires on February 28th, ""Then it's over."" As The Economist went to press, Mr Tsipras, now prime minister, was about to meet Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor, in what promised to be a fraught exchange. Unless some sort of agreement is found soon, another Greek default looms when IMF debts mature in March. 
At its root, the problem is simple: Greece does not have enough income to pay its bills. Since the financial crisis began, its economy has shrunk by more than any other rich country's. Between 2008 and 2014 nominal GDP, a rough proxy for an economy's capacity to repay debts, fell by 22%, much more than any other European invalid. The pain at an individual level has been just as sharp. House prices are down by around 40% since 2008. Median incomes fell by 22% between 2008 and 2013; for 18- to 24-year-old Greeks they were down by 38%. The economic collapse is comparable to one on the other side of the Mediterranean, in war-torn Libya. 
The bail-outs Greece received in 2010 and 2012 shifted its debts to new creditors but, despite losses imposed on some private-sector lenders, did little to lower them. At the end of 2009 Greece owed EUR 301 billion, then around 127% of GDP, mainly to the private sector. Today it owes around EUR 315 billion (175% of GDP), all but EUR 70 billion of which comes from public lenders. The country's new creditors are the IMF (EUR 25 billion), the ECB (EUR 27 billion) and European governments (EUR 195 billion). 
Greece's new creditors are both generous and demanding. The country's interest rates have been slashed: its total interest payments in 2014 were just 2.6% of GDP, according to Zsolt Darvas of Bruegel, a think-tank. That is lower than several less indebted European countries (see chart). 
But the money comes with conditions aimed at stabilising Greece's finances. These include cuts to Greece's minimum wage and pensions, lay-offs of civil servants and the privatisation of various assets, including ports and state-owned buildings. Creditors like Mr Schauble hope the package will make Greece more competitive and thus spur economic growth, as well as generating a budget surplus to be used to pay down debt. The bail-out plan foresees Greek debt falling to 120% of GDP by 2020. 
The crunch has come because Greece wants to keep the low rates but not the conditions. Nadia Valavani, a deputy finance minister, plans to scrap a hated property tax, enfia, a popular move that will cost the state EUR 2 billion in revenues. Ms Valavani also says a tax on businesses offering services to tourists will stay at 13% and not be hiked to the standard 23% as planned. The Aegean islands, Greece's most prosperous region, will continue to enjoy lower rates of value-added tax than the rest of the country. The threshold at which income tax bites will be restored this year to EUR 12,000, leaving around 3m low-income Greeks paying no tax. The privatisation programme, due to raise a total of EUR 25 billion, including EUR 3.5 billion this year, has been halted. Altogether these giveaways could cost around EUR 8 billion. 
To balance the books Mr Tsipras is pinning his hopes, optimistically, on a tax crackdown. Smuggling cigarettes and fuel costs the government around EUR 1.5 billion a year. Tax-dodging tycoons could furnish some extra income too. Panayotis Nikoloudis, a former anti-money-laundering tsar who heads a new anti-corruption ministry, says there are 3,500 cases of large-scale tax evasion amounting to EUR 7 billion; they could yield EUR 2.5 billion in 2015. But in the unlikely event that all this money were collected, Greece would still be EUR 4 billion short. 
Many governments' plans do not add up, of course, and Mr Tsipras has already signalled a willingness to compromise. On February 9th he outlined a four-part plan. First, Greece would keep ""70%"" of previously agreed reforms; those ditched would be replaced by ten new measures agreed with the OECD, rather than the despised ""troika"" of the ECB, the IMF and European Commission. Second, it would reduce its primary (ie, excluding interest payments) budget surplus to 1.5% of GDP, from a target of 3% this year and 4.5% in 2016. Third, it would swap much of its existing debt for two exotic types of bond: a ""perpetual"", meaning that the principal would never be repaid, and a ""GDP-linked"" bond, with payments tied to the health of Greece's economy. Finally, the government would spend an extra EUR 1.9 billion on ""humanitarian assistance"" for struggling Greeks. 
Greece's creditors can give some ground. Despite the low interest rates the country is being charged, the loans are profitable, since most European governments can borrow at even lower rates. Cutting them to a profit-neutral level and further extending the duration of Greece's debts could generate savings worth 17% of GDP, according to Mr Darvas. In the spirit of not profiting from Greece's depression, euro-zone officials could also release EUR 1.9 billion in profits from an earlier ECB bond-buying programme. 
But Greece's government will have to offer much more in return, and Mr Tsipras will have two constituencies in mind if he reverses course. One is the extreme left of Syriza. On privatisation, for example, both the finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, and the development minister, George Stathakis, have voiced support for completing the sale of the state's 67% stake in Piraeus Port Authority. China's Cosco, which already runs a profitable container terminal at the port, and Denmark's Maersk were frontrunners among the shortlisted bidders. But one of the left's stalwarts, Theodore Dritsas, is shipping minister and has vowed to block the deal. Panayotis Lafazanis, who heads a new ministry for ""productive reconstruction"", environment and energy, has blocked two other deals aimed at bringing Greece fully in line with EU energy directives. 
The other group Mr Tsipras will have to keep happy is an electorate buoyed by the government's feisty dealings with the rest of Europe. ""Whatever happens next, Syriza has given us back our dignity,"" said Roula Zlatani, a 68-year-old Athenian pensioner. ""The government's finally standing up to the foreign powers that have made our lives so difficult.""","Can Greece 's new government satisfy voters and compromise with its creditors ? 
 Alexis Tsipras and Alexis Tsipras's radical left Syriza party worked for more than a year while in opposition to prepare their policy platform . Over 80 committees were charged with producing specific proposals for overhauling different sectors of the Greek economy . Planning for power is one thing ; exercising it quite another , especially when a country is in a hole as deep as Greece 's . 
 Syriza 's programme , if fully implemented , will result in a sharp fall in revenues and a large increase in social spending . Yet many Greeks stopped paying taxes before last month 's elections , anticipating cuts and forbearance . Government revenues fell by more than 20 % in January on an annual basis ; the 2015 budget is now likely to be derailed by the end of March , says a former finance minister . 
 None of which plays well with Greece 's creditors , whose EUR 245 billion ( $ 277 billion ) bail - out envisages austerity and reform , not splurges and backtracking . Wolfgang Schauble , Germany 's finance minister , said on February 10th that if Greece did not seek an extension of its bail - out , which expires on February 28th , "" Then it 's over . "" As The Economist went to press , Alexis Tsipras was about to meet Angela Merkel , Germany 's chancellor , in what promised to be a fraught exchange . Unless some sort of agreement is found soon , another Greek default looms when IMF debts mature in March . 
 At its root , the problem is simple : Greece does not have enough income to pay its bills . Since the financial crisis began , its economy has shrunk by more than any other rich country 's . Between 2008 and 2014 nominal GDP , a rough proxy for an economy 's capacity to repay debts , fell by 22 % , much more than any other European invalid . The pain at an individual level has been just as sharp . House prices are down by around 40 % since 2008 . Median incomes fell by 22 % between 2008 and 2013 ; for 18- to 24 - year - old Greeks they were down by 38 % . The economic collapse is comparable to one on the other side of the Mediterranean , in war - torn Libya . 
 The bail - outs Greece received in 2010 and 2012 shifted its debts to new creditors but , despite losses imposed on some private - sector lenders , did little to lower them . At the end of 2009 Greece owed EUR 301 billion , then around 127 % of GDP , mainly to the private sector . Today it owes around EUR 315 billion ( 175 % of GDP ) , all but EUR 70 billion of which comes from public lenders . The country 's new creditors are the IMF ( EUR 25 billion ) , the ECB ( EUR 27 billion ) and European governments ( EUR 195 billion ) . 
 Greece 's new creditors are both generous and demanding . The country 's interest rates have been slashed : its total interest payments in 2014 were just 2.6 % of GDP , according to Zsolt Darvas of Bruegel , a think - tank . That is lower than several less indebted European countries ( see chart ) . 
 But the money comes with conditions aimed at stabilising Greece 's finances . These include cuts to Greece 's minimum wage and pensions , lay - offs of civil servants and the privatisation of various assets , including ports and state - owned buildings . Creditors like Mr Schauble hope the package will make Greece more competitive and thus spur economic growth , as well as generating a budget surplus to be used to pay down debt . The bail - out plan foresees Greek debt falling to 120 % of GDP by 2020 . 
 The crunch has come because Greece wants to keep the low rates but not the conditions . Nadia Valavani , a deputy finance minister , plans to scrap a hated property tax , enfia , a popular move that will cost the state EUR 2 billion in revenues . Ms Valavani also says a tax on businesses offering services to tourists will stay at 13 % and not be hiked to the standard 23 % as planned . The Aegean islands , Greece 's most prosperous region , will continue to enjoy lower rates of value - added tax than the rest of the country . The threshold at which income tax bites will be restored this year to EUR 12,000 , leaving around 3 m low - income Greeks paying no tax . The privatisation programme , due to raise a total of EUR 25 billion , including EUR 3.5 billion this year , has been halted . Altogether these giveaways could cost around EUR 8 billion . 
 To balance the books Alexis Tsipras is pinning Alexis Tsipras's hopes , optimistically , on a tax crackdown . Smuggling cigarettes and fuel costs the government around EUR 1.5 billion a year . Tax - dodging tycoons could furnish some extra income too . Panayotis Nikoloudis , a former anti - money - laundering tsar who heads a new anti - corruption ministry , says there are 3,500 cases of large - scale tax evasion amounting to EUR 7 billion ; they could yield EUR 2.5 billion in 2015 . But in the unlikely event that all this money were collected , Greece would still be EUR 4 billion short . 
 Many governments ' plans do not add up , of course , and Alexis Tsipras has already signalled a willingness to compromise . On February 9th Alexis Tsipras outlined a four - part plan . First , Greece would keep "" 70 % "" of previously agreed reforms ; those ditched would be replaced by ten new measures agreed with the OECD , rather than the despised "" troika "" of the ECB , the IMF and European Commission . Second , it would reduce its primary ( ie , excluding interest payments ) budget surplus to 1.5 % of GDP , from a target of 3 % this year and 4.5 % in 2016 . Third , it would swap much of its existing debt for two exotic types of bond : a "" perpetual "" , meaning that the principal would never be repaid , and a "" GDP - linked "" bond , with payments tied to the health of Greece 's economy . Finally , the government would spend an extra EUR 1.9 billion on "" humanitarian assistance "" for struggling Greeks . 
 Greece 's creditors can give some ground . Despite the low interest rates the country is being charged , the loans are profitable , since most European governments can borrow at even lower rates . Cutting them to a profit - neutral level and further extending the duration of Greece 's debts could generate savings worth 17 % of GDP , according to Mr Darvas . In the spirit of not profiting from Greece 's depression , euro - zone officials could also release EUR 1.9 billion in profits from an earlier ECB bond - buying programme . 
 But Greece 's government will have to offer much more in return , and Alexis Tsipras will have two constituencies in mind if Alexis Tsipras reverses course . One is the extreme left of Syriza . On privatisation , for example , both the finance minister , Yanis Varoufakis , and the development minister , George Stathakis , have voiced support for completing the sale of the state 's 67 % stake in Piraeus Port Authority . China 's Cosco , which already runs a profitable container terminal at the port , and Denmark 's Maersk were frontrunners among the shortlisted bidders . But one of the left 's stalwarts , Theodore Dritsas , is shipping minister and has vowed to block the deal . Panayotis Lafazanis , who heads a new ministry for "" productive reconstruction "" , environment and energy , has blocked two other deals aimed at bringing Greece fully in line with EU energy directives .

CLIP-CLOPPING around Europe over the past few weeks, Yanis Varoufakis, Greece's dashing finance minister, has urged the euro zone to chart a new course. Endlessly forcing new loans upon indebted countries like Greece in the pretence that they will one day be repaid, he argued, was a strategy for depression and deflation. ""The disease that we're facing in Greece,"" he told the BBC, ""is that a problem of insolvency for five years has been treated as a problem of liquidity."" 
This view would not seem outlandish in the academic world that Mr Varoufakis recently quit. Few believe that Greece's debts, worth over 175% of GDP, will ever be repaid in full. But saying so betrayed a woeful misunderstanding of the euro zone's rules. If the European Central Bank shared Mr Varoufakis's view, it would have to cut off Greek banks, potentially driving Greece out of the euro. Indeed, earlier this month, when the minister visited the ECB in Frankfurt, Mario Draghi, its president, snippily told him to keep his opinion to himself. He has not repeated it since. 
Mr Varoufakis's gaffe is a mere footnote in a list of mishaps that have characterised Greece's miserable experience in the euro. But it is depressingly typical for a government that, for all its high popularity at home, has squandered every opportunity to improve its lot, and ultimately that of the euro zone. Even as Mr Varoufakis and his colleagues in Greece's ruling Syriza party have loftily declared that the changes they seek would benefit all Europeans, not just Greeks, their negotiating strategy has been small-minded, self-defeating and naive. 
Some of this may be put down to inexperience. A few Europeans were guilty of assuming that Alexis Tsipras, the prime minister, would perform what Greeks call a kolotoumba (""somersault"") the instant he took office. But Syriza has no excuse for making idle references to the Nazi occupation of Greece. Nor has it helped by playing games with its partners in the Eurogroup of finance ministers. European officials have been incensed by a Hellenic habit of leaking supposedly private discussion papers. 
The wrangling over whether to extend Greece's second bail-out, which expires on February 28th, has shown Mr Tsipras's government at its worst. Admittedly Syriza was dealt a bad hand by its predecessor, which before Christmas accepted an extension of only two months. But rather than accept an extension, Mr Tsipras and Mr Varoufakis have dug in their heels, robotically insisting on a ""bridging"" deal that would unlock euro-zone funding while allowing the government to slow or reverse reforms. Greece's creditors, unsurprisingly, were unimpressed. On February 19th Greece put forward a more conciliatory proposal to extend its loan. But this was almost immediately rebuffed by Germany. Trust has seemingly been so grievously eroded that Greek promises of discipline are not worth much in Berlin. 
These spats matter far beyond the hurt feelings of a few politicians. Greece's survival in the euro depends on two factors largely outside its control: the willingness of the ECB to keep its banks on life support, and that of the Eurogroup to strike a long-term financing deal (Mr Varoufakis avoids the term ""bail-out"") to keep the country afloat. It has weakened its hand on both fronts. 
The ECB's reasoning will rest in part on its assessment of the health of Greek banks. Depositors are withdrawing around EUR 2 billion ($2.3 billion) a week. Syriza's stubbornness has hardened attitudes on the ECB's council. On February 18th, it offered only a small increase in liquidity support; and the support will end entirely if two-thirds of its members say so. Some are reported to favour capital controls as a better option. Greece will be on perilous terrain if it enters March without a deal in place. 
As for a long-term deal, Germany and others have dangled sweeteners before Greece, including an easing of debt terms and a lower primary-surplus target. But these are prizes to be won at the end of talks, not the beginning. Syriza has already started to reverse some reforms, including privatisations and collective-bargaining rules, antagonising its creditors further. The Eurogroup will probably not withdraw its fiscal offers but, with trust in the Greeks at zero, the reform conditions that it will attach to a third bail-out will surely be tougher than ever. 
Time is short, particularly if the Eurogroup fails to agree with Greece on the terms for a bail-out extension. Thanks to a collapse in tax revenues, the government could run out of cash before an IMF bond falls due in March. By squeezing suppliers and raiding funds, Greece may be able to finance itself for a few months, but without further help it will certainly be unable to meet debt repayments to the ECB in July and August. 
Isolation is rarely splendid 
Yet an essential formula remains unchanged: that neither Greece nor its partners want to see it forced out of the euro (although the odds of an accidental ""Grexit"" have shortened). So at some point Mr Tsipras will have to perform his kolotoumba, potentially at high cost. At home, having raised expectations of a big win (75% of Greeks support his tough line) he might face calls for a referendum or a new election. 
The real Greek tragedy is that, with a bit more statesmanship, Mr Tsipras could have nudged Europe on to a happier path. The euro zone desperately needs a counter-narrative to its failed German-inspired policy of austerity. As leader of the hardest-hit economy, armed with a strong democratic mandate, Mr Tsipras was well placed to offer one. He could have sought allies against excessive austerity and for looser fiscal and monetary policy in places like Italy and France--and even inside the ECB. Yet by quibbling over his debt extension and backtracking so ostentatiously on sensible reform he has alienated more or less everyone. That is quite some achievement.","Greece had a chance to make the euro zone work better . It blew it

ALEXIS TSIPRAS, Greece's new left-wing prime minister, was always going to face a near-impossible task as he tried to balance the demands of the country's creditors with those of his bitterly aggrieved and hugely expectant voters. 
A month after his heady election triumph on January 25th, his political skills were being tested to the limit. Finance ministers from the eurogroup had grudgingly accepted as a ""valid starting-point"" the reform plan submitted by the Greek government in the hope of keeping its monetary lifeline intact. 
But Mr Tsipras could hardly hide from his own radical supporters the fact that he had made a series of painful climbdowns to get to that point. First he had abandoned his Syriza party's pre-election pledge to write off a big chunk of Greece's sovereign debt (amounting to 175% of national output at the end of last year) and hence draw a line under five years of harsh austerity imposed by the hated ""troika"" of bailout monitors from the European Commission, International Monetary Fund and European Central Bank (ECB). 
Yanis Varoufakis, the finance minister, capitulated at a meeting of finance ministers on February 20th. He asked for a four-month extension of the current EUR 172 billion ($196 billion) bailout in return for more economic reforms. Mr Varoufakis blinked only just in time, given that Greece's European Union loan programme was due to expire at the end of the month: without an extension Greek banks might have lost the financial backstop of ECB funding, triggering financial meltdown. 
Athens bankers were already worried by a steady outflow of deposits: close to EUR 20 billion has been withdrawn this year. If a deal had fallen through, capital controls would have been imposed, bringing a renewed threat of ""Grexit"" from the euro. 
That prospect has receded for the moment but Greece is still on a knife-edge. Despite Mr Varoufakis's insistence that Syriza's programme was still on track, the list of tax, revenue and structural measures he proposed after several days of fraught exchanges with the troika (renamed ""the institutions"" to soothe voters) looked familiar. It resembled demands which the country's guardians had made of the previous centre-right government. 
Manolis Glezos, a 92-year-old hero of Greek leftist resistance to the Nazis, was one of the first to cry foul; he begged pardon from the Greek people for having campaigned for Syriza and contributed to the illusion of change. Mikis Theodorakis, a famous composer and another veteran of the Greek left, joined in the public grumbles. Even if those irascible nonagenarians can be satisfied, a lot of ifs and buts have to be negotiated. Details of the latest plan have to hammered out, the agreement must be approved by legislators and a start must be made to implementing promised changes. If all that happens, Greece is in line to receive a much-delayed EUR 7.2 billion loan instalment from May, in time to meet EUR 6.7 billion of repayments due in July and August and avert a default. 
There are plenty of obstacles along the way, however. Syriza has promised its creditors not to roll back reforms already in place. But sticking to that would mean abandoning plans which are cherished by its voters, such as relaunching collective wage bargaining and raising the minimum monthly wage to EUR 750, the pre-crisis level. 
Privatisation is another thorny issue. Mr Varoufakis has said completed sales will not be reversed and those already under way will move ahead. Two important deals are in the pipeline: a EUR 1.2 billion concession to run 14 regional airports, awarded last year to Frankfurt Airport in partnership with a Greek contractor, and the sale of 67% of Piraeus Port Authority, which pits Cosco, the Chinese state shipping company, against Maersk of Denmark. If these disposals go ahead as planned, other foreign investors will be encouraged to look for deals in Greece. 
But Syriza's second-ranking politician, Panagiotis Lafazanis, is likely to object. He is leader of the hard-line Left Platform faction, which is said to have the backing of 30% of the party, and strongly opposes selling off state assets. 
Mr Lafazanis is also minister of ""productive recovery"" (ie, industry), energy and environment, with five big privatisations under his control. As Syriza's 149 lawmakers met to discuss Mr Varoufakis's list of reforms, Mr Lafazanis repeated threats to stop state property being sold.

 Alexis Tsipras's was always going to face a near - impossible task as Alexis Tsipras tried to balance the demands of the country 's creditors with those of Alexis Tsipras's bitterly aggrieved and hugely expectant voters . 
 A month after Alexis Tsipras's heady election triumph on January 25th , Alexis Tsipras's political skills were being tested to the limit . Finance ministers from the eurogroup had grudgingly accepted as a "" valid starting - point "" the reform plan submitted by the Greek government in the hope of keeping its monetary lifeline intact . 
 But Alexis Tsipras could hardly hide from Alexis Tsipras's own radical supporters the fact that Alexis Tsipras had made a series of painful climbdowns to get to that point . First Alexis Tsipras had abandoned Alexis Tsipras's Syriza party 's pre - election pledge to write off a big chunk of Greece 's sovereign debt ( amounting to 175 % of national output at the end of last year ) and hence draw a line under five years of harsh austerity imposed by the hated "" troika "" of bailout monitors from the European Commission , International Monetary Fund and European Central Bank ( ECB ) . 
 Yanis Varoufakis , the finance minister , capitulated at a meeting of finance ministers on February 20th . He asked for a four - month extension of the current EUR 172 billion ( $ 196 billion ) bailout in return for more economic reforms .

GREAT political debates in Spain can generate a powerful sense of occasion as legislators flock to a parliament building which is guarded by two large bronze lions as well as lots of police. 
But when deputies gathered for a solemn state-of-the-nation deliberation on February 24th, two of the four most important parties were missing. Chief among them was Podemos (We Can), the upstart left-wing group that leads some polls and has drawn comparisons, albeit imperfect ones, with the Syriza movement that has upended Greek politics. 
In recent weeks, however, a new player has arrived. Ciudadanos (Citizens), a centrist party, is scoring up to 13% in polling and it looks well placed to hurt the Popular Party (PP) led by Mariano Rajoy, the prime minister, and also to put a lid on the meteoric growth of Podemos. 
With parliament closed to newcomers until a general election late this year, these insurgent parties have found a home just around the corner at the Circulo de Bellas Artes, a cultural centre. That is where Pablo Iglesias, the Podemos leader, delivered his alternative state-of-the-nation address on February 25th, blaming PP for corruption, inequality and austerity. 
Like Alexis Tsipras, the new Greek prime minister, the pony-tailed Mr Iglesias is a crowd-puller. However he now has a rival in the Ciudadanos leader, Albert Rivera, who managed to fill two large rooms and left fans queuing outside when he came to Madrid from his native Barcelona on February 17th. 
Aged 35, Mr Rivera is slightly younger than Mr Iglesias and equally capable of presenting himself as a breath of fresh air in a stale scene. On arrival in the capital, he presented supporters with a new recruit whose academic credentials will impress some voters: Luis Garicano, a professor of ""economics and strategy"" at the London School of Economics. 
Mr Garicano took a swipe at Podemos's ""lack of sense"" before outlining a programme of pragmatic, workable economic ideas. They included labour reform to restrict the abuse of short-term contracts (massively favoured by employers as a way of avoiding the potential firing costs that permanent staff bring). Instead he would introduce a single contract in which those costs rise slowly and progressively over time. Temporary contracts currently account for 24% of jobs. He also wants American- or British-style tax credits to help the large number of Spanish workers who fail to earn the annual minimum salary of EUR 9,080 ($10,300). 
Another bright, but harder to implement, idea would encourage mobility by letting Spanish workers take incremental unemployment insurance with them from job to job. Some of these proposals may provide fast-working fixes to entrenched problems. Possibly the most vital reform was, however, one that would take many years to have an impact: modernising Spain's education system to teach skills beyond the ability to memorise swathes of facts, which the present system emphasises far too much. 
Mr Rivera set up Ciudadanos nine years ago to counter nationalism in his native Catalonia, where it won 8% of the vote in 2012 regional elections. Big expectations were triggered very quickly when he decided to go nationwide. That, along with the sudden burgeoning of Podemos, is a sign of how desperate Spanish voters are for something new.

IN LATE February, as Greece's new prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, reversed a crucial campaign pledge and infuriated his left-leaning Syriza party by asking for a four-month extension of the country's hated bail-out, there was little sense of crisis in central Athens. Cafes were busy; streets were clogged with traffic. 
The impression of business as usual was illusory. The new government may have stepped back from the impending rift with its creditors, but its readiness to go so close to the edge has hurt the economy and brought the state close to bankruptcy. Worse, there is scope for more damage to be done this spring, since nothing has been settled between the Greek government and the IMF, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Commission (the institutions that speak for Greece's creditors). Fleshing out the thin list of reforms the government has presented so far is bound to be an agonising process. 
The Greek economy had at last begun to grow again in 2014, after six years of recession had lopped more than a quarter off GDP. Output started to increase in the first three months of last year (compared with the final three of 2013) and growth continued into the third quarter, when GDP rose by 0.7%, one of the best performances in the euro area. 
That seems like a distant memory now. In the final three months of 2014, as elections loomed, output fell by 0.2%. The political turbulence has buffeted the economy and public finances in three main ways. First, anxieties about a possible ""Grexit"" from the euro and the forced conversion of bank accounts into less valuable drachmas caused a massive drain of deposits (see chart). In December and January Greek households and businesses pulled EUR 17 billion ($19 billion) out of banks; astonishingly, the outflows over these two months were bigger than those in May and June 2012, when two elections were held and fears of a Grexit also loomed large. The withdrawals continued in the first three weeks of February, reportedly at a weekly rate of between EUR 2 billion and EUR 3 billion. 
The loss of deposits, which brought Greece alarmingly close to imposing capital controls, has undermined the banks. They have had to turn to the Greek central bank to tap ""emergency liquidity assistance"". Since such support is kept on the shortest-possible rein by the ECB in Frankfurt, this means that the banks are still acutely vulnerable. With their funding in disarray they are in no position to help businesses by making new loans, so the shortage of money at the banks is now affecting the wider economy. 
Second, the political upheaval has created fresh uncertainty. With Greece's place in the euro once again in question, domestic investors have put projects on hold and foreign investors have been scared away. This paralysis will not abate until a lasting deal with creditors is struck that rebuilds confidence in Greece's long-term future within the euro area. Syriza's climbdown in late February has bought time but it has not brought any money from Greece's creditors. None will be available until the government shows that it is sincere in its promise to complete the reforms that creditors still insist upon and that are supposed to steady both the economy and the public finances. On the campaign trail Syriza denounced many of them as intolerable. 
Third, the political storm has induced a crisis in the public finances. Cut off from the bond markets again and without help from official lenders, the Greek government is struggling to pay its bills. This month is particularly tough as it has to find EUR 1.5 billion to repay a portion of its debt to the IMF, as well as EUR 4.5 billion to redeem maturing Treasury bills. Even if the bills can be refinanced, money is tight because tax revenues are down by EUR 2 billion in January and February compared with the same two months in 2014. Many taxpayers have simply stopped paying taxes in the hope that the new government will be more lenient. 
The worse the economy does, the more the public finances will deteriorate. The government had won permission from its creditors to run a smaller primary budget surplus (ie, excluding interest payments) than previously planned, but that concession may now be meaningless. And if the government responds by allowing arrears on purchases it has made to build up, as has happened in the past, that will hurt the businesses that go unpaid. 
Amid the gloom, there is one piece of good news. The turmoil does not appear to have harmed tourism bookings. The hope is that 2015 will be another good year, after the number of tourists reached a record of 22m in 2014. But for Greece to resume its economic recovery a lot of things will have to go right. In particular, Mr Tsipras will have to break more election promises. Even if he climbs down completely, however, there is no way to undo the damage already done to the economy by the events of the past few months.

With their funding in disarray they are in no position to help businesses by making new loans , so the shortage of money at the banks is now affecting the wider economy . 
 Second , the political upheaval has created fresh uncertainty . With Greece 's place in the euro once again in question , domestic investors have put projects on hold and foreign investors have been scared away . This paralysis will not abate until a lasting deal with creditors is struck that rebuilds confidence in Greece 's long - term future within the euro area . Syriza 's climbdown in late February has bought time but it has not brought any money from Greece 's creditors . None will be available until the government shows that it is sincere in its promise to complete the reforms that creditors still insist upon and that are supposed to steady both the economy and the public finances . On the campaign trail Syriza denounced many of them as intolerable . 
 Third , the political storm has induced a crisis in the public finances . Cut off from the bond markets again and without help from official lenders , the Greek government is struggling to pay its bills . This month is particularly tough as it has to find EUR 1.5 billion to repay a portion of its debt to the IMF , as well as EUR 4.5 billion to redeem maturing Treasury bills . Even if the bills can be refinanced , money is tight because tax revenues are down by EUR 2 billion in January and February compared with the same two months in 2014 . Many taxpayers have simply stopped paying taxes in the hope that the new government will be more lenient . 
 The worse the economy does , the more the public finances will deteriorate . The government had won permission from its creditors to run a smaller primary budget surplus ( ie , excluding interest payments ) than previously planned , but that concession may now be meaningless . And if the government responds by allowing arrears on purchases it has made to build up , as has happened in the past , that will hurt the businesses that go unpaid . 
 Amid the gloom , there is one piece of good news . The turmoil does not appear to have harmed tourism bookings . The hope is that 2015 will be another good year , after the number of tourists reached a record of 22 m in 2014 . But for Greece to resume its economic recovery a lot of things will have to go right . In particular , Alexis Tsipras will have to break more election promises . Even if Alexis Tsipras climbs down completely , however , there is no way to undo the damage already done to the economy by the events of the past few months .

THE Greek crisis is not just an economic mess. Increasingly, it is becoming a geopolitical mess too. Alexis Tsipras, the country's prime minister, whose radical-left Syriza party swept into government after January's general election, has taken to tugging at crude political levers--from cosying up to Vladimir Putin to demanding war reparations from Germany--in the belief that this will somehow prompt concessions from the rest of the euro zone. 
The whiff of blackmail has incensed Europe's politicians. Mr Tsipras has a chance to calm things down in two meetings with Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor--the first this week on the fringes of a European summit in Brussels, and the second in Berlin on March 23rd for what should be some hard talking between the European Union's most powerful leader and its biggest troublemaker. Instead of stirring up resentment, Mr Tsipras should focus on the urgent task at hand: forging a deal. 
Just now the Greek government seems to prefer lobbing incendiary political gibes instead. The defence minister has threatened to flood Europe with migrants, including jihadists. The justice minister has demanded that Germany pay EUR 160 billion ($170 billion) in war reparations and warned Greece might seize the buildings of the Goethe Institute and even German holiday homes if the money is not handed over (see page 27). And Mr Tsipras has brought forward to early April a trip to Moscow to see Russia's president, Vladimir Putin. His hoped-for message is as clear as it is crude: Mr Putin might be only too happy to help a fellow Orthodox country that dislikes sanctions on Russia. 
Clearly, Greece believes that it can use threats like Russia to his advantage. History provides a precedent: it was to fend off Soviet encroachment that America, under President Truman, provided aid to Greece in the aftermath of the second world war. Today, too, for Greece to fall under Russia's spell is the last thing that NATO and the EU wants. 
Mr Tsipras is playing a dangerous game. By feeding Greeks' well-developed sense of victimhood (and the historical claims against Germany have some legitimacy), he is fanning flames that could soon burn out of control. Although opinion polls consistently show that a majority of Greeks want to remain in the euro, there is no better way to change their minds than to tell them that their EU partners treat them with injustice and contempt. 
Likewise, by taking on Germany, the Greeks are alienating their biggest creditor--and the very country whose backing they most need to win a reprieve from the euro zone. Already, according to a poll published last week, most Germans want Greece to leave the euro. Even if Mrs Merkel wants to save Greece, she will not be able to resist the overriding wishes of her voters. 
Under Mr Tsipras, Greece has had a knack for alienating countries such as France and Italy, which would naturally lean against Teutonic austerity. That hardly inspires confidence that he knows what he is doing today. By far the best outcome, for both sides, would still be to keep Greece in the euro. And, for most of the past few weeks, that has seemed the most likely. Although Mr Tsipras came to power promising to end austerity, he backed down last month, as money poured out of Greek banks at a weekly rate of some EUR 2 billion and the prospect of capital controls loomed. The fiery rhetoric was briefly replaced with pragmatism--a reform programme in exchange for a four-month extension of Greece's bail-out. 
Don't make a drachma out of a crisis 
With Greece in imminent danger of running out of cash, a similar shift must urgently occur once again. The meetings in Brussels and Berlin will be crucial. The Greek leader has charm, and could get along fine with Mrs Merkel--provided he is prepared to eschew the blackmail and shows that his European partners can trust him. 
He could make a good start by replacing his loquacious finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, with somebody more pragmatic. He would be well advised also to dump his nationalist coalition partner, the right-wing Independent Greeks, for the more moderate To Potami. At home, rather than allowing his ministers to rail about reparations, he needs to get behind reform, and explain to his voters why Syriza's extravagant election promises cannot be kept. 
Under Mr Tsipras Greece has been squandering opportunities to make a deal with the rest of the euro zone. If he does not yield soon, he may discover that his chances have run out.","References to reparations and threats to seize German assets will not solve Greece 's economic woes

THE level of debate between Germany and Greece, protagonists in a drama that could make or break the euro zone, could hardly be called edifying. Take, for example, the YouTube video from 2013 which shows Yanis Varoufakis, then a left-leaning economics professor, arguing that Greece should simply default on its debts and ""stick the finger to Germany"", and making an appropriate hand gesture for emphasis. When Mr Varoufakis, now Greece's finance minister, was confronted with the clip on March 15th during a talk show on German television, he claimed the footage was doctored. The ensuing ""Fingergate"" lasted days, as the German media proved that the video was genuine, albeit taken out of context. Germany's pundits spluttered with rage: the Greeks were mendacious as well as impertinent. 
This week marked a nadir in relations between Greece and its largest creditor. The tone has been deteriorating ever since January when Alexis Tsipras, leader of the far-left Syriza party, took over as Greek prime minister. It is clear that Wolfgang Schauble, Germany's finance minister, and Mr Varoufakis no longer trust each other as partners in negotiations to extend Greece's bail-out. When Mr Schauble called his counterpart ""foolishly naive"", Greece's ambassador in Berlin filed a diplomatic protest.  
Greece's defence minister has threatened to let masses of Syrian refugees, possibly including terrorists, pass through to Germany. Europe has only itself to blame if that happens, he said. The Greek justice minister suggested that, as part of his country's ongoing claims against its old oppressor, he might even seize the Athens property of the Goethe Institute, Germany's cultural agency. 
Arguments over a tactless hand gesture might be called a childish spat. But historically based threats to seize German assets carry a heavier payload because they recall some dark spectres that have never ceased to haunt both countries. Between 1941 and 1944 the Nazis occupied Greece with a brutality exceeded only in Slavic countries. Greece has never formally dropped claims on Germany which date from that time. Now, in the midst of a debate about recently incurred Greek debts, the government in Athens suddenly wants Germany to settle some much older obligations, both financial and moral, as well. 
Germans don't like being reminded of the past by others, because they have their own very formal rituals of recollection. Remembering and drawing lessons from the past is baked into the German approach to politics, psychologically and even physically. When legislators walk to debates in Berlin's Reichstag building, they see walls covered in Cyrillic graffiti. These were scribbled by Red Army soldiers after they stormed to victory in 1945, and meticulously preserved as silent exhortations to responsible governance. Germany's politicians generally go out of their way to be sensitive to countries which the Nazis invaded or occupied. 
Had it not been for Russia's aggression in Ukraine, Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, would now be preparing to attend the 70th-anniversary celebrations of the Soviet Union's victory over Germany on May 9th. As it is, she will instead go to Moscow the following day, May 10th, to visit the grave of an unknown soldier. Meanwhile, the need for unequivocal contrition over the Holocaust is the main reason why Mrs Merkel still calls her country Israel's strongest ally in Europe. 
But for all Germany's impressive atonement and sensitivity, there are limits. This becomes clear when one looks in detail at the cluster of historical issues that have been raised by Greece, and how they have been handled. The Greek demands can be broken into three categories. First, there are general reparations which Germany was expected to pay to the governments of countries that were the victims of its aggression. Second, there are moral or legal debts Germany may owe to individual victims. And third, there is the specific matter of a loan that Greece was forced to extend to Germany during the occupation; it was used to finance the war in Africa. 
At a big London conference in 1953, Germany's creditor countries, including Greece, forgave much of West Germany's foreign debt, thus helping to make possible its ""economic miracle"". But reparations were deferred to a future peace treaty. That treaty was, in effect, signed in 1990, when the two Germanies and the four victors (America, Britain, France and the Soviet Union) accepted reunification. Helmut Kohl, the chancellor, and Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the foreign minister, deliberately avoided calling this ""2+4 agreement"" a peace accord. This helped deflect suggestions that the matter of reparations should have been dealt with explicitly at the same time. But it was widely assumed that the issue had simply expired. 
Greece did not speak up at the time. But it later argued that a treaty to which it was not a signatory could not have wiped out its claims. As Greeks sometimes put it, they were told before 1990 that it was too early to deal with the issue of reparations. Then they were told it was too late. This month Mr Tsipras declared in parliament that Germany had used ""tricks"" to get out of reparations. This view was firmly rejected in Berlin. Germany considers this case ""closed, legally and politically"", as Mrs Merkel's spokesman repeated this week. 
Germany takes a similar view about its possible debts to individual victims and their families. West Germany made many payments of atonement in the post-war years, totalling EUR 71 billion ($75 billion), according to government data. As part of a 1960 agreement with west European countries, it paid DM115m (or EUR 57.5m) to Greek victims of Nazi crimes, which amounts to EUR 2.50 ""for each day at Auschwitz,"" says Eberhard Rondholz, a historian. To victims and their descendants that seems laughable. Starting in 1997 victims of one German massacre, in the village of Distomo in 1944, sued Germany privately. 
In 2012, however, the International Court of Justice in The Hague sided with Germany, invoking the notion that governments have immunity from lawsuits by individuals in foreign courts. Germany was not the only country relieved by that decision; the world is full of governments that have done wrong to foreigners in the past. 
The forced loan by Greece to Germany in 1942 is different. It amounted to 476m Reichsmarks or, according to Greek estimates, EUR 11 billion today. (That is about 17% of the EUR 65 billion that Greece today owes Germany as part of its bail-out.) In the 1960s Ludwig Erhard, the then chancellor, said that Germany would repay the loan once it reunified. He may have assumed this would never happen. 
There are many in Germany who are open to repaying the forced loan. ""When if not now?"" asks Mr Rondholz. To avoid setting precedents Germany could put the money into a trust or foundation, he adds. Several politicians from the centre-left Social Democrats and Greens are also calling for repayment, in keeping with Germany's post-war tradition of assuming responsibility and showing goodwill. 
Other Germans see the timing of renewed Greek impatience to talk about the war as suspicious. Since roughly 2000, German identity has shifted, says Hans Kundnani, author of a new book, ""The Paradox of German Power"". Germans no longer see themselves only as perpetrators but also as victims of the war, as heirs not only of Auschwitz but also of Dresden, a city incinerated by British bombs. 
In today's narrative, reasonable or not, the Germans see themselves as victims in the euro crisis. They think they are being asked to pay for the errors of others, who are using the past as a ""pretext for extortion, a way to get German money"", Mr Kundnani thinks. Indeed Bild, the largest German tabloid, has described the talk of reparations as ""blackmail"". 
This worsening climate inevitably affects the tone of debate about the future of the euro zone. According to a new poll, 82% of Germans doubt that Greece will carry through the reforms it has promised, and 52% want it to exit from the single currency. In a sign of her concern, Mrs Merkel has invited Mr Tsipras to Berlin on March 23rd. It will take all her vaunted skill to save Europe from an unintended disaster.","With the euro zone on the brink again , neither childish squabbles nor historical arguments are helpful to Germany or Greece

He had previously been held by the rebels under house arrest in the capital, Sana'a. Saudi Arabia launched military operations in Yemen, supported by other Arab countries, to halt the advance of the Iranian-backed Houthi militias. Adding to the chaos, an affiliate of Islamic State (IS) said it carried out the bombing of two mosques in Sana'a that killed at least 137 people. 
Relations between the White House and the government of Israel grew frostier. Senior officials leaked claims that Israel has spied on talks with Iran over a nuclear deal; and Barack Obama spoke of a ""policy difference"" with Israel regarding the establishment of a Palestinian state. 
Reports emerged from Nigeria that as many as 500 children have been abducted by jihadists from Boko Haram in areas they had overrun and which have recently been liberated by Nigerian or allied forces. 
Taking the fight to IS 
Canada's prime minister, Stephen Harper, announced that he would extend a campaign of air strikes against IS from Iraq into Syria. He said the campaign would go on for another year, beyond October's election in which security is expected to be a theme. 
In the latest sign of a thaw with the West, Cuba hosted a visit by the European Union's foreign minister, Federica Mogherini. On the agenda were trade, democracy and investment, all currently in short supply on the island. 
Ten people were killed in Mexico when gangsters ambushed a police convoy outside the city of Guadalajara. At least ten vehicles took part in the attack, in which five policemen, two bystanders and three suspected mobsters died. The police were members of a new gendarmerie, launched by President Enrique Pena Nieto in an attempt to pacify drug-trafficking gangs. 
Floods in the Atacama Desert in Chile, one of the world's driest regions, killed at least two people and left thousands without electricity and running water. In the country's south, forest fires, caused in part by severe drought, raged in three national parks. 
Less than 600 days to go! 
The race to be America's next president semi-officially got under way when Ted Cruz became the first candidate to announce formally that he is running. A Republican senator from Texas, Mr Cruz is a darling of the Tea Party. It will be a crowded field on the Republican side, with a dozen candidates throwing their hats in the ring. Less so on the Democratic side, where few seem willing to challenge Hillary Clinton's expected campaign. 
At a meeting at the White House with the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, Barack Obama announced that he would keep nearly 10,000 American troops in Afghanistan until the end of the year, rather than reduce their number by half. They will provide training and support drone strikes in anticipation of another offensive by the Taliban. 
The founding father 
Singapore observed a weeklong period of mourning after the death of its former leader, Lee Kuan Yew. Tens of thousands of people queued to see his body lying in state at the city-state's parliament. One of the visitors was the Taiwanese president, Ma Ying-jeou. 
In Myanmar 65 people were charged with involvement in student-led protests. They could be jailed for several years if convicted. The demonstrations included calls for less central-government control over universities and the right to form student unions. Earlier this month police stopped participants from marching on Yangon, the largest city. 
The foreign ministers of China, Japan and South Korea met in Seoul for their first trilateral talks at such a level in three years. Ties have been strained because of a territorial dispute between China and Japan in the East China Sea and objections in both China and South Korea to Japan's stance on its occupation of the two countries during the second world war. 
Three men were executed in China for mass stabbings at a railway station in the south-western city of Kunming in March last year, which left 31 people dead and which China's media have described as the country's ""9/11"". Officials accused the men of being militant separatists from the western province of Xinjiang. 
Tragedy in the mountains 
An Airbus A320 operated by Germanwings, a budget airline, crashed in the French Alps, killing all 150 people on board. The plane had been on its way from Barcelona to Dusseldorf, and most of the passengers were either German or Spanish. 
Petro Poroshenko, the president of Ukraine, dismissed Ihor Kolomoisky, a billionaire oligarch, as governor of Dnipropetrovsk. Mr Kolomoisky recently sent armed men into the headquarters of a state-owned oil company in which he owns shares, after parliament passed a law that would have ended his effective control over it. His confrontation with Mr Poroshenko is seen as a crucial test of the president's power. 
Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor, and Alexis Tsipras, the prime minister of Greece, held a cordial meeting in Berlin and vowed to work on keeping Greece in the euro zone. Mr Tsipras's far-left government has been slow to implement reforms promised in exchange for receiving bail-out funds from Europe and the IMF. Greece could run out of money to pay its creditors as early as mid-April. 
France's National Front came second in departmental elections with 25% of the vote, a modest setback for the party, which had been widely expected to finish first. The centre-right UMP, led by Nicolas Sarkozy, took first place. The Socialists came third. Analysts think the vote shows that France is moving from a two-party political system to a three-party one. 
David Cameron said that he would not seek a third term as Britain's prime minister, just weeks ahead of going to the polls in an election at which voters will decide whether to give him a second term. His comments, in a television interview, baffled Conservative Party strategists, who fear attention may turn away from the party's stewardship of the economy to speculation about potential successors.","In Yemen President Abd Rabbo Mansour Hadi was rumoured to have fled from the port of Aden to escape Houthi rebels . He had previously been held by the rebels under house arrest in the capital , Sana'a . Saudi Arabia launched military operations in Yemen , supported by other Arab countries , to halt the advance of the Iranian - backed Houthi militias . Adding to the chaos , an affiliate of Islamic State ( IS ) said it carried out the bombing of two mosques in Sana'a that killed at least 137 people . 
 Relations between the White House and the government of Israel grew frostier . Senior officials leaked claims that Israel has spied on talks with Iran over a nuclear deal ; and Barack Obama spoke of a "" policy difference "" with Israel regarding the establishment of a Palestinian state . 
 Reports emerged from Nigeria that as many as 500 children have been abducted by jihadists from Boko Haram in areas they had overrun and which have recently been liberated by Nigerian or allied forces . 
 Taking the fight to IS 
 Canada 's prime minister , Stephen Harper , announced that he would extend a campaign of air strikes against IS from Iraq into Syria . He said the campaign would go on for another year , beyond October 's election in which security is expected to be a theme . 
 In the latest sign of a thaw with the West , Cuba hosted a visit by the European Union 's foreign minister , Federica Mogherini . On the agenda were trade , democracy and investment , all currently in short supply on the island . 
 Ten people were killed in Mexico when gangsters ambushed a police convoy outside the city of Guadalajara . At least ten vehicles took part in the attack , in which five policemen , two bystanders and three suspected mobsters died . The police were members of a new gendarmerie , launched by President Enrique Pena Nieto in an attempt to pacify drug - trafficking gangs . 
 Floods in the Atacama Desert in Chile , one of the world 's driest regions , killed at least two people and left thousands without electricity and running water . In the country 's south , forest fires , caused in part by severe drought , raged in three national parks . 
 Less than 600 days to go ! 
 The race to be America 's next president semi - officially got under way when Ted Cruz became the first candidate to announce formally that he is running . A Republican senator from Texas , Mr Cruz is a darling of the Tea Party . It will be a crowded field on the Republican side , with a dozen candidates throwing their hats in the ring . Less so on the Democratic side , where few seem willing to challenge Hillary Clinton 's expected campaign . 
 At a meeting at the White House with the Afghan president , Ashraf Ghani , Barack Obama announced that he would keep nearly 10,000 American troops in Afghanistan until the end of the year , rather than reduce their number by half . They will provide training and support drone strikes in anticipation of another offensive by the Taliban . 
 The founding father 
 Singapore observed a weeklong period of mourning after the death of its former leader , Lee Kuan Yew . Tens of thousands of people queued to see his body lying in state at the city - state 's parliament . One of the visitors was the Taiwanese president , Ma Ying - jeou . 
 In Myanmar 65 people were charged with involvement in student - led protests . They could be jailed for several years if convicted . The demonstrations included calls for less central - government control over universities and the right to form student unions . Earlier this month police stopped participants from marching on Yangon , the largest city . 
 The foreign ministers of China , Japan and South Korea met in Seoul for their first trilateral talks at such a level in three years . Ties have been strained because of a territorial dispute between China and Japan in the East China Sea and objections in both China and South Korea to Japan 's stance on its occupation of the two countries during the second world war . 
 Three men were executed in China for mass stabbings at a railway station in the south - western city of Kunming in March last year , which left 31 people dead and which China 's media have described as the country 's "" 9/11 "" . Officials accused the men of being militant separatists from the western province of Xinjiang . 
 Tragedy in the mountains 
 An Airbus A320 operated by Germanwings , a budget airline , crashed in the French Alps , killing all 150 people on board . The plane had been on its way from Barcelona to Dusseldorf , and most of the passengers were either German or Spanish . 
 Petro Poroshenko , the president of Ukraine , dismissed Ihor Kolomoisky , a billionaire oligarch , as governor of Dnipropetrovsk . Mr Kolomoisky recently sent armed men into the headquarters of a state - owned oil company in which he owns shares , after parliament passed a law that would have ended his effective control over it . His confrontation with Mr Poroshenko is seen as a crucial test of the president 's power . 
 Angela Merkel , Germany 's chancellor , and Alexis Tsipras held a cordial meeting in Berlin and vowed to work on keeping Greece in the euro zone .

IN HARD and uncertain times, a tax amnesty can be a fillip to the popular mood. Stelios Alivizakis, an engineering consultant struggling to survive in Greece's depressed property market, was overjoyed when the radical left-wing Syriza government announced a one-week ""special offer"" for tax debtors. Anyone willing to pay some or all of their overdue taxes by March 27th would have the accumulated interest written off. ""I'll have a breathing space to get my affairs in order,"" says Mr Alivizakis, who owes thousands of euros in unpaid income, property and value-added tax. 
Many hard-pressed Greek businesspeople reacted in similar fashion. The finance ministry's tax website attracted over 100,000 hits within minutes of the offer being posted. Nadia Valavani, the deputy finance minister charged with trying to fill Greece's depleted coffers, said EUR 50m ($55m) was raised within the first 24 hours. She hopes another EUR 200m will flow in by the end of the week. That would cheer government officials fighting to pay pensions and civil servants' salaries at the end of the month. It could also avert a possible default on April 9th, when Greece is due to repay a EUR 450m loan instalment to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). 
But solving Greece's deeper financial woes won't be that simple, and the euphoria that swept the country after Syriza's election victory in January has subsided. Greece's creditors are tightening the squeeze on the brash, inexperienced government of Alexis Tsipras. The prime minister has been unsuccessful in his efforts to unlock part of a EUR 7.2 billion chunk of bail-out funding, needed to keep Greece afloat while it negotiates a new deal with the European Union and IMF. Yanis Varoufakis, his wayward finance minister, has annoyed EU officials and his peers, including Germany's Wolfgang Schauble. (Mr Varoufakis has been told to stay put in Athens and help bail-out technocrats draft an emergency reform package.) 
Some in Athens were hopeful that a visit by Mr Tsipras to Berlin on March 23rd for talks with Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, would lighten the mood. Greek officials were upbeat afterwards, saying a ""dialogue"" had begun. But gloom returned the next day, when senior finance ministry officials from the euro zone rejected a Greek request to return EUR 1.2 billion which Athens claimed it had paid by mistake to the European Financial Stability Facility, the EU's own bail-out fund. 
""We've been on a roller-coaster ride for two months now and there is no end in sight,"" says Alkis Stamatopoulos, an olive-oil exporter. ""It's become impossible to plan ahead."" 
Greece has fallen back into recession following last year's modest recovery, according to central bank officials. This year's growth projection has been unofficially cut from 2.9% to about 1.5% of GDP. After declining in 2014, the unemployment rate has edged up again. For the moment tourist bookings are still buoyant, but that could quickly change if the deadlock with Greece's creditors continues. 
Greek banks now rely on a drip-feed of emergency funding approved on a weekly basis by the ECB. Credit for importers has dried up; Athens-based firms complain of having to pay suppliers in full before goods can be shipped. Bigger groups have sent cash to accounts in other euro-zone countries. Greek shipowners bring in just enough to pay their employees. 
One top Greek banker estimates that ordinary citizens have stashed EUR 10 billion under their mattresses since Syriza came to power. They fear that Greece might follow the example of Cyprus in 2013 and be forced to impose capital controls. Another EUR 15 billion of deposits has been moved out of the country. There is certainly anxiety in the air, especially among those with something to lose. Yet the sense of panic that swept Athens in 2012 when a ""Grexit"" seemed imminent is less acute today. ""I don't think the Europeans will abandon us after everything Greece has been through in the past five years,"" says Maria Ifantidou, a pensioner. 
Mr Tsipras is still riding fairly high in public esteem, though his approval rating has fallen from over 80% following the election in January to around 60% now. Syriza leads the centre-right New Democracy party by more than 20 points, despite the clouds on the financial horizon. 
Many Greeks admired the tough stance that Mr Tsipras took towards the country's creditors after his election, even if they are not sure whether it will have the desired result. As people start to worry about unpaid salaries and empty cash machines, his popularity is likely to fall further.

THE timing was certainly awkward. Talks between Greece and the euro zone were on a knife-edge. Beset by rumours that Greece was running out of money, Alexis Tsipras, the prime minister, had agreed to propose reforms to unlock bail-out funds. Then, just before Mr Tsipras was to visit Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor, a news magazine ran a cover of Mrs Merkel overlaid on an image of occupying Nazi forces at the Parthenon. ""The German Ubermacht ('Dominance')"", read the headline. 
Insinuations that Germany's tough line on debtor countries carries a whiff of the Third Reich have been common throughout the euro crisis, usually in Greece. But this time it was Der Spiegel, a respected German weekly, that made the comparison (depicting European perceptions, it insists). At a press conference with Mrs Merkel, Mr Tsipras condemned the cover (before repeating his call for war reparations). But as Greece again throws the euro zone into turmoil, Germany is facing awkward questions. 
During the euro crisis, power shifted from European institutions to capitals, Berlin chief among them. On the urgent question of foreign policy, French weakness and British drift have shrunk Europe's ""big three"" to one-and-a-half--if you are feeling generous towards France. In contrast to the apocryphal story of Henry Kissinger wondering what number one calls to speak to Europe, Barack Obama knows exactly whom to consult on Europe's Russia policy--and she does not sit in Brussels. 
German dominance is in part a consequence of others' retreat. That may be why complaints have been muted. ""If the Italians don't bring pasta and the French don't bring pate,"" says a diplomat, ""you can't complain about Mrs Merkel's cabbage soup."" Meanwhile, outside Greece, the worst of the budget-cutting that bred European resentment of Germany is over. The recent solid economic performance of most bailed-out countries has strengthened Germans' conviction that they were right all along. 
That helps explain why Germans continue to crave well-defined rules in Europe. The fiscal process is established, if shaky, and at some point Germany may resume its call for greater co-ordination of economic policies, such as labour-market regulations and tax bases. Such proposals make some European countries squeal but seem eminently sensible to Germany: in the absence of political union, how else is a common currency to work? 
But because the world does not always bend to its will, Germany has had to accept political compromises. It was intensely irritated when the European Commission appeared to relax its fiscal rules in January. It has had to swallow the European Central Bank's decision to begin quantitative easing. And Germany grudgingly accepted the commission's decision last month to grant France more time to reduce its budget deficit. At last seemingly serious about economic reform, the French government insisted that this was not the time to close off its fiscal space. This political argument found a surprisingly receptive ear in Berlin (which has itself broken EU deficit rules in the past). 
Indeed, after several rocky years Franco-German relations are warming. Francois Hollande was by Mrs Merkel's side as she negotiated a peace deal with Vladimir Putin in Minsk last month, and listened to Mr Tsipras's entreaties in Brussels last week. This matters to Germany; although it will act alone if necessary, it still fears the appearance of imposing its will unilaterally. During last month's jousting matches with Greece, Wolfgang Schauble, Germany's combative finance minister, never tired of telling reporters that Germany was not alone in its tough stance. 
Mrs Merkel has been well served by her adversaries. On Russia, countries like Cyprus and Italy may grumble about sanctions. But thanks to Mr Putin's alarming behaviour none has broken ranks when it matters. (This proposition will be tested in June, when all 28 EU members must agree to renew the toughest measures.) The boneheaded negotiating approach of Mr Tsipras's government has destroyed any chance of a split in the euro zone: Greece has made anti-austerity a toxic brand, at least for now. Similarly, should a re-elected David Cameron pursue his promised renegotiation of Britain's EU membership, he will find few allies if he seeks to alter the EU's basic rules. 
All this suits Mrs Merkel's style. She exercises patience, waiting for Greece to see sense on economic reform and Britain to resolve its domestic problems. She took a risk in pursuing the Minsk peace deal with Russia because the situation in eastern Ukraine had become desperate. Yet she has eschewed calls from American senators to send arms, instead comparing the situation to the long wait for the Berlin Wall to come down. This appears to mean she is prepared to see the conflict ""frozen"". If Mr Obama was once accused of leading from behind, Mrs Merkel sometimes leads from a direction no one else can understand. 
France matters more than Britain 
A united Europe, governed by strict fiscal rules, harmonious and at peace with its neighbours: such is the stuff of German dreams. Reality is messier, but Germany is not rigid. During the euro crisis Mrs Merkel always found the political will to keep the currency together, even if her solutions often involved sticking plasters. 
But the future will test Germany's priorities. Keeping Greece in the euro and Britain in the EU are important, but not at any cost. (Some officials think the euro zone will weather a Grexit without too much difficulty.) Nor will Mrs Merkel expend much political capital to save TTIP, a proposed transatlantic trade deal that many Germans distrust. But on existential matters such as saving the euro or keeping France strong enough to remain a meaningful partner, Mrs Merkel will not hesitate to exercise her power, even if it means breaking pledges or undermining rules. That would be a sign of true leadership, and Europe should welcome it.","Germany is coming to terms with a messy world

In their spree, the gunmen targeted Christians, separating them from their Muslim classmates, before they themselves were killed fighting Kenyan security forces. Kenyan military jets bombed two camps in Somalia used by the Shabab. 
Iran and six world powers (America, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany) agreed on the ""parameters"" of a deal to limit the Iranian nuclear programme in return for the lifting of sanctions. Iran's ""breakout capability""--the time needed to make the fissile material for an atomic bomb--would be extended to about a year, a condition that would hold for a decade. There would also be a tougher inspection regime. But several crucial issues still need to be settled and much hard bargaining lies ahead if a final deal is to be reached by the June 30th deadline. Critics in America's Congress are pushing for fresh sanctions. 
Rahm home to victory 
Rahm Emanuel won the run-off in Chicago's mayoral election, handily beating his opponent, Jesus (Chuy) Garcia, by 56% to 44%. An exit poll showed that those Chicagoans who fretted most about the perilous state of the city's finances voted for Mr Emanuel by a margin of more than two-to-one. 
California brought in the state's first-ever mandatory restrictions on water use following four years of drought. The restrictions will fall mostly on urbanites, who use 10% of the water. Farms, who use 40%, will be relatively unscathed. (The rest is reserved for environmental purposes.) 
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found guilty of bombing the Boston marathon in 2013, an attack that killed three people and wounded more than 250 others. Mr Tsarnaev carried out the attack with his brother, who was killed when police tried to apprehend him. 
A police officer was charged with the murder of an unarmed black man in a suburb of Charleston, South Carolina, soon after a video emerged of the officer apparently shooting the man as he was running away. The officer claims the man had taken his stun gun. The swift decision to prosecute for murder comes amid a national debate on the policing of black communities, prompted by the fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, last August. 
Rand Paul threw his hat into America's presidential race, the second Republican officially to announce that he is running. Meanwhile, the clock started ticking for Hillary Clinton to declare formally after she rented offices in Brooklyn for her national campaign headquarters. 
The holiday's over 
The United States deported to El Salvador a former general who has been held responsible for torture and killings during the country's civil war in the 1980s. Eugenio Vides Casanova, who was head of El Salvador's national guard, had lived in Florida since 1989. Under an amnesty law he will not be tried at home. 
Consumer prices in Brazil rose at their fastest rate since 2003. Inflation in the year to March was 8.1%, mainly because of higher prices for food and energy. Part of the increase comes from a decision to reduce subsidies for electricity prices, which the government had kept artificially low for political reasons. 
At least 25 people died in floods in and near Chile's Atacama Desert, normally one of the driest areas on Earth. Emergency workers recorded another 125 people missing and 2,700 homeless. The president, Michelle Bachelet, reckons the government will have to spend at least $1.5 billion to repair the damage. 
Any friend will do 
Alexis Tsipras, the prime minister of Greece, visited Moscow to discuss economic co-operation with Vladimir Putin. European countries worried that Mr Tsipras might offer to obstruct sanctions against Russia in exchange for aid to repay Greece's colossal debts; he said no such deal was on the table. But Greece's cash crunch is becoming ever tighter, and the country could run out of money to repay its debts as early as next month. 
A Polish radio station released transcripts from recordings made in the cockpit of the plane that crashed in 2010, killing Poland's president, Lech Kaczynski, and 95 others. The transcripts provide evidence that officials on board the plane pressured pilots to attempt to land despite dangerous conditions. The emergence of the recordings has intruded on campaigning in Poland's presidential election, scheduled for May 10th. 
Marine Le Pen, the leader of the National Front in France, withdrew the party's support from her 86-year-old father Jean-Marie Le Pen, who founded it. Mr Le Pen had made controversial statements downplaying the significance of the Holocaust and called Manuel Valls, the French prime minister, an ""immigrant"" (he was born in Spain). Ms Le Pen decried her father's statements as ""political suicide"". 
Turning to Asia 
America's secretary of defence, Ashton Carter, began a tour of Asia in an attempt to breathe new life into America's ""pivot"" towards the continent. He started his tour in Japan, where he warned countries about the risks of conflict over claims to disputed islands in the East and South China Seas. 
In India 20 people were shot dead by police for allegedly cutting down red sandalwood trees, whose wood is highly sought after in East Asia by furniture-makers and other trades. Smuggling red sandalwood is a lucrative business, but confrontations between loggers and the authorities are not usually deadly. 
An explosion tore through a factory that produces paraxylene (PX), a chemical used in plastics among other things, in the Chinese city of Zhangzhou. Last year violent protests erupted in a city in Guangdong province against the construction of a new PX plant. 
In Beijing a group of 30 taxi drivers took their protest against new restrictive laws on renewing licences to the extreme by poisoning themselves with chemicals in an apparent mass-suicide attempt on a busy shopping street. The men had travelled to the capital from the north, near the border with Russia.

In their spree , the gunmen targeted Christians , separating them from their Muslim classmates , before they themselves were killed fighting Kenyan security forces . Kenyan military jets bombed two camps in Somalia used by the Shabab . 
 Iran and six world powers ( America , Russia , China , Britain , France and Germany ) agreed on the "" parameters "" of a deal to limit the Iranian nuclear programme in return for the lifting of sanctions . Iran 's "" breakout capability""--the time needed to make the fissile material for an atomic bomb -- would be extended to about a year , a condition that would hold for a decade . There would also be a tougher inspection regime . But several crucial issues still need to be settled and much hard bargaining lies ahead if a final deal is to be reached by the June 30th deadline . Critics in America 's Congress are pushing for fresh sanctions . 
 Rahm home to victory 
 Rahm Emanuel won the run - off in Chicago 's mayoral election , handily beating his opponent , Jesus ( Chuy ) Garcia , by 56 % to 44 % . An exit poll showed that those Chicagoans who fretted most about the perilous state of the city 's finances voted for Mr Emanuel by a margin of more than two - to - one . 
 California brought in the state 's first - ever mandatory restrictions on water use following four years of drought . The restrictions will fall mostly on urbanites , who use 10 % of the water . Farms , who use 40 % , will be relatively unscathed . ( The rest is reserved for environmental purposes . ) 
 Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found guilty of bombing the Boston marathon in 2013 , an attack that killed three people and wounded more than 250 others . Mr Tsarnaev carried out the attack with his brother , who was killed when police tried to apprehend him . 
 A police officer was charged with the murder of an unarmed black man in a suburb of Charleston , South Carolina , soon after a video emerged of the officer apparently shooting the man as he was running away . The officer claims the man had taken his stun gun . The swift decision to prosecute for murder comes amid a national debate on the policing of black communities , prompted by the fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson , Missouri , last August . 
 Rand Paul threw his hat into America 's presidential race , the second Republican officially to announce that he is running . Meanwhile , the clock started ticking for Hillary Clinton to declare formally after she rented offices in Brooklyn for her national campaign headquarters .

 The United States deported to El Salvador a former general who has been held responsible for torture and killings during the country 's civil war in the 1980s . Eugenio Vides Casanova , who was head of El Salvador 's national guard , had lived in Florida since 1989 . Under an amnesty law he will not be tried at home . 
 Consumer prices in Brazil rose at their fastest rate since 2003 . Inflation in the year to March was 8.1 % , mainly because of higher prices for food and energy . Part of the increase comes from a decision to reduce subsidies for electricity prices , which the government had kept artificially low for political reasons . 
 At least 25 people died in floods in and near Chile 's Atacama Desert , normally one of the driest areas on Earth . Emergency workers recorded another 125 people missing and 2,700 homeless . The president , Michelle Bachelet , reckons the government will have to spend at least $ 1.5 billion to repair the damage .

 Alexis Tsipras visited Moscow to discuss economic co - operation with Vladimir Putin . European countries worried that Alexis Tsipras might offer to obstruct sanctions against Russia in exchange for aid to repay Greece 's colossal debts ; Alexis Tsipras said no such deal was on the table . But Greece 's cash crunch is becoming ever tighter , and the country could run out of money to repay its debts as early as next month . 
 A Polish radio station released transcripts from recordings made in the cockpit of the plane that crashed in 2010 , killing Poland 's president , Lech Kaczynski , and 95 others . The transcripts provide evidence that officials on board the plane pressured pilots to attempt to land despite dangerous conditions . The emergence of the recordings has intruded on campaigning in Poland 's presidential election , scheduled for May 10th . 
 Marine Le Pen , the leader of the National Front in France , withdrew the party 's support from her 86 - year - old father Jean - Marie Le Pen , who founded it . Mr Le Pen had made controversial statements downplaying the significance of the Holocaust and called Manuel Valls , the French prime minister , an "" immigrant "" ( he was born in Spain ) .

RECOVERY (noun): restoration to a former or better condition. The euro zone is at last enjoying an upturn. Economists are savouring the unaccustomed pleasure of revising their growth forecasts up, rather than down. Surveys of business activity have reached a four-year high and euro-area consumers are feeling a lot more confident. Investors are excited, too. Money is rushing into the region's stockmarkets. In March European equity funds notched up record inflows. 
Alas, the euro zone is still a long way from meeting the dictionary definition of a recovery. Indeed, investors' swing from gloom to europhoria appears already to have gone too far. 
To start with, the recovery remains remarkably weak. The euro area has actually been growing for two years since an extended double-dip recession ended in early 2013. Yet the expansion has been so desultory that it barely deserved the name. The excitement generated by growth of just 0.3%, an annualised rate of little more than 1%, in the fourth quarter of 2014 tells its own story of shrunken expectations. So feeble has the recovery been that euro-zone GDP in late 2014 was still 2% below its previous pre-crisis peak in early 2008. By contrast, America's output is higher by almost 9%. 
Having lost so much ground, the euro area clearly has enormous scope to catch up. Yet its recent improved showing depends on two engines that are likely to run out of steam. The first is the oil-price collapse in the second half of 2014, which has acted like a tax cut for consumers and businesses. That stimulus will fade towards the end of this year, and will go into reverse if oil prices move up again. 
The second engine is the fall in the euro, by 12% on a trade-weighted basis over the past year. Many European firms have done a good job of expanding their foreign sales in recent years (see page 67); they will do well from a weaker currency. But the euro has stopped falling (at least for the time being) and, in the long run, what matters more for exporters is growth in their trading markets. With China slowing and the American economy causing concern (see page 71), the outlook is less favourable. Ideally, recovery would also be based on strong demand within the euro area--especially in Germany, which is running a current-account surplus of over 7% of GDP. 
True, investors will continue to benefit from the European Central Bank's generous programme of quantitative easing (QE), which began in early March. QE has boosted equity and bond markets--Germany's DAX index is up by more than 20% since the start of the year, for example. But banks play a bigger role than capital markets in providing funds to euro-zone companies and households. And although lending to the private sector is beginning to edge up, loans to firms are still falling. 
Moreover, one of the main achievements in improving euro-zone governance, the creation of a single banking supervisor under the auspices of the ECB, is a double-edged sword. Compared with complaisant national regulators, it is more insistent that banks are strong: witness an incipient clampdown on the use of deferred tax assets (a kind of credit to offset past losses) to bolster the capital bases of banks in Europe's weaker economies. Welcome though that is, credit will not take wing while banks are still repairing their balance-sheets. 
Grexcruciating 
And don't forget Greece. Markets have been insouciant about the tensions between the radical-left government of Alexis Tsipras and the rest of the euro zone. Greece is running too short of cash to be confident of avoiding a ""Grexit"". The fraught negotiations between Greece and its European creditors highlight how hard it is to reconcile the interests of the currency union's disparate members. 
After years of bad news it may seem churlish to belittle signs of brighter prospects. Countries like Italy (see page 31) have made welcome efforts at reform; the QE programme is useful in bolstering inflation expectations. But neither France, the second-biggest economy in the currency bloc, nor Italy, the third-biggest, is expected to muster growth above 1% this year. And the longer-term prospects for the euro area remain weighed down by excessive debt and low productivity growth, as well as the threat of deflation and disadvantageous demography (Germany's working-age population will be shrinking as fast as Japan's by 2020). According to the IMF, the euro area's potential rate of growth has deteriorated since before the financial crisis of 2007-08 by more than that of other advanced economies. However welcome, an upturn should not be mistaken for a renaissance.","Investors are becoming excited about Europe again--too excited

IT HAS been five years since a Greek prime minister last visited Moscow in search of a handout. On that occasion, Dmitry Medvedev, then Russia's president, bluntly told George Papandreou to go to the International Monetary Fund for help (which he did). Before setting out from Athens on April 8th, Alexis Tsipras swore that he would not be asking Vladimir Putin, the current president, for cash, even though his country's finances are in a more parlous state now than they were in 2010. 
In the end, the two leaders' meeting produced little beyond a warm atmosphere and pledges to ""restart and revive"" relations. Mr Tsipras welcomed a proposed Russian gas pipeline across Greece's territory and criticised European Union sanctions, as he has before. Mr Putin pledged (not entirely credibly) to refrain from using relations with Greece to divide the EU. 
To observers in Athens, Mr Tsipras's trip to Moscow was the most striking example to date of the gesture politics that the Greek government, led by the far-left Syriza party, has used to keep its approval ratings high as unemployment edges back up, banks freeze lending and Greece slips back into recession. It came as both Greeks and Russians were celebrating Holy Week ahead of Orthodox Easter, a moment when religious and cultural affinities resonate. They will be officially strengthened in 2016 with a year-long cycle of festivities promoted by Russian and Greek cultural organisations. 
For Mr Putin, rapprochement with Greece is mostly about gas. ""Nothing has really changed since the mid-2000s,"" says a former Greek energy minister, recalling the Russian leader's pledge to turn Greece into a natural-gas hub if it signed up to the South Stream pipeline project then being touted by Russia's state-owned energy giant, Gazprom. That pipeline would have shipped gas across the Black Sea and through the Balkans to central Europe. South Stream was abandoned last year following EU pressure on Bulgaria. Now Greece has an opportunity to join Turkish Stream, its successor, which would cross western Turkey before passing through Greece, Macedonia, Serbia and Hungary. 
Russian state-owned transport companies want to acquire the Greek state railway and the northern port of Thessaloniki as a package deal. But their proposal was rejected by Taiped, the Greek agency for privatising state assets, during the previous administration. Chinese firms are also interested. Cosco, a Chinese shipping giant, already controls a container terminal at Piraeus, Greece's largest port, and is transporting goods from it by special train to central Europe. 
Mr Tsipras's trip may soothe his party's hard-left faction, which includes former Communist Party members who are critical of new bail-out talks with the EU and the IMF. But his government's priority is to reach a deal with creditors to unlock EUR 7.2 billion ($7.8 billion) of loans and avoid default. Greece managed to scrape together its EUR 458m repayment to the IMF on April 9th, but another EUR 950m comes due in May. For the second month in a row the finance ministry is scrambling for cash to pay pensions and salaries. It is raiding unspent EU funds, to the dismay of Greek firms working on motorway projects they fear could soon be stalled.

EVENTUALLY every long-running drama, from ""Downton Abbey"" to ""Dr Who"", feels formulaic. So it is with Greece's debt saga. For five years it has followed a wearily familiar script of unpayable debts, aborted reforms and 11th-hour compromises that let the country stagger on inside the single currency. That history has lulled many into expecting the usual denouement in the latest wrangling between Greece's Syriza government and its European creditors. But this is looking ever less likely. Unless Syriza suddenly capitulates--and a meeting of euro-zone finance ministers on April 24th is one of its last chances to do so--Greece will fail to pay its creditors. If that happens, its exit from the euro will be just a step away. 
Greece has already restructured its debts once, in 2012. It now owes money mainly to other European governments, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the IMF. These official creditors have slashed interest rates and stretched out maturities, but not enough. With a debt stock of 175% of GDP, Greece will need more relief. Most European politicians quietly accept this. The danger lies in a chaotic default born of brinkmanship. The Greek government has bills to pay and no money to pay them. It is resorting to desperate measures. This week Alexis Tsipras, the prime minister, ordered local-government bodies to move spare cash to the central bank (see page 71). That might buy a few weeks. But in the end Greece will not be able to pay its pensioners, let alone its creditors, without a deal with its European paymasters that unlocks new loans. 
That seems increasingly unlikely, for three reasons. The first is a deep loss of trust on the part of Greece's creditors. The euro zone has always had only a faint version of the solidarity that characterises a true union. But since Syriza came to power that has been ripped apart. The stunts and stumbles of Greece's inexperienced government are a factor. But the bigger problem has been Syriza's unwillingness, or inability, to name, let alone implement, the reforms that it will undertake in return for its next tranche of money. Once Greece's creditors might have taken general promises; now they want specifics. 
Second, Europeans worry less today about the market consequences of Grexit. Thanks to the 2012 restructuring, the direct effects of another Greek default would be easier to handle because Europe's banks, the weak link in any panic, are now more insulated. As fears of financial contagion have dwindled, so has European creditors' appetite for compromise. 
And third, political constraints on both sides make bargaining hard. Syriza was elected on a promise to halt the endless austerity required by its bail-outs. The government has its own factions to control, among them hard-left MPs unprepared to make concessions on privatisations or pensions. Mr Tsipras might need a referendum or another election to win a mandate to backtrack even if he wanted to. Voters in creditor countries are tired of paying for Greece; politicians in places like Spain that have also been through austerity are hawkish. 
Repayments to euro-zone lenders are not due until the 2020s. But if you add all these elements together, it is hard to see how the Greeks can reach a deal that will let them honour their more immediate debts to the IMF and the ECB. 
Outward bound 
Less clear is whether such a default must lead to euro exit. The two need not go together: Greece defaulted on private-sector creditors in 2012. But stiffing private investors with the support of the euro zone is quite different from unilateral non-payment to official creditors. The decisions of the ECB, which keeps Greece's banks afloat, would be critical. The ECB does not want to be the actor that precipitates Grexit by withdrawing support; and ratings agencies have helpfully said that a missed payment to an official creditor would not constitute a default. But if the ECB itself were not being paid, that would be a hard line to hold. And non-payment would depress the value of Greek banks' holdings of short-term government debt and encourage deposit flight. That would leave the banks needing more liquidity support from the ECB just when doubts about their solvency crystallised. The ECB is unlikely to help then. 
There are ways for Greece to defer disaster. It could save hard currency by issuing scrip, a type of IOU, in lieu of payments to its citizens (see Free exchange, page 76). But that would be an open invitation to Greeks to take their remaining euros out of the banks. So the government could impose capital controls. Cyprus has had these for two years without leaving the euro, but that was done in concert with its partners. If Greece ever got to this stage--a parallel currency in circulation, capital controls in place and bail-out cash withheld--the gap between default and exit would be paper-thin.","A Greek exit from the euro may soon become inevitable

AGED 72 and confined to a wheelchair since an assassination attempt 25 years ago, Wolfgang Schauble, Germany's finance minister, has the political energy of a younger man. In Washington this month for the IMF/World Bank meetings, he rushed from one podium to another. Everywhere the question was whether Greece will have to leave the euro. That is not up to him but to Athens, he notes, with a well-rehearsed shrug. But the omens are not good, he reckons, because the new far-left Greek government refuses to commit to the reforms previously promised in return for bail-outs. Nobody wants ""Grexit"", he says. But if it comes, so be it. 
Since late 2009 he has managed the euro crisis alongside his boss, Chancellor Angela Merkel. Mr Schauble, who is impatient of foreign criticism, is convinced that his prescribed medicine for crisis countries--structural reforms and fiscal austerity--is working. Everywhere, that is, except in Greece since January, when Alexis Tsipras took over as prime minister and Yanis Varoufakis as finance minister (see box). Mr Schauble seems at his wits' end with the Greek duo, feeling they have been evasive and manipulative in negotiations. A more delicate line was crossed when the newspaper of Mr Tsipras's party depicted Mr Schauble as a Nazi threatening, in Greek, to ""make soap out of your fat"".

In his characteristic south-western dialect, where every ""s"" becomes ""sh"", Mr Schauble has always spoken plain truth. ""A cripple as chancellor? One must ask this question,"" he said in 1997. Today he watches Germany's purse and has become the first finance minister since 1969 to balance the federal budget. And he wants the Greeks also to obey the rules.

 AGED 72 and confined to a wheelchair since an assassination attempt 25 years ago , Wolfgang Schauble , Germany 's finance minister , has the political energy of a younger man . In Washington this month for the IMF / World Bank meetings , he rushed from one podium to another . Everywhere the question was whether Greece will have to leave the euro . That is not up to him but to Athens , he notes , with a well - rehearsed shrug . But the omens are not good , he reckons , because the new far - left Greek government refuses to commit to the reforms previously promised in return for bail - outs . Nobody wants "" Grexit "" , he says . But if it comes , so be it . 
 Since late 2009 he has managed the euro crisis alongside his boss , Chancellor Angela Merkel . Mr Schauble , who is impatient of foreign criticism , is convinced that his prescribed medicine for crisis countries -- structural reforms and fiscal austerity -- is working . Everywhere , that is , except in Greece since January , when Alexis Tsipras took over as prime minister and Yanis Varoufakis as finance minister ( see box ) . Mr Schauble seems at his wits ' end with the Greek duo , feeling they have been evasive and manipulative in negotiations . A more delicate line was crossed when the newspaper of Alexis Tsipras's party depicted Mr Schauble as a Nazi threatening , in Greek , to "" make soap out of your fat "" .

ALMOST every recent Greek finance minister has been an Athens university economics professor moonlighting as a politician. Yanis Varoufakis is no exception. But unlike his predecessors, Mr Varoufakis has become a global celebrity, to the annoyance of many in Syriza, the leftist party in power. To his critics, Mr Varoufakis's lifestyle--riding a powerful motorbike, spending evenings in chic bars and weekends at a smart island villa belonging to his wife--is embarrassingly close to that of the rich Greeks he castigates for avoiding taxes by stashing cash abroad. 
The leather-jacketed Mr Varoufakis is not much liked by his euro-zone colleagues either. He lectures them and shows little interest in the details of reforms demanded by Greece's creditors. The pace of negotiations has picked up as Greece's cash crunch gets more acute. But Mr Varoufakis continues to raise obstacles, say officials in Brussels and Frankfurt. He is deeply reluctant to cross any of Syriza's ""red lines"": no more cuts in pensions, no more labour reforms, no increases in value-added tax and no privatisations beyond the handful that are already under way. 
Divisions within Syriza's economic team do not help. Amazingly, Mr Varoufakis is often away on the international conference circuit. In his absence Yannis Dragasakis, the deputy prime minister, who is close to Mr Tsipras but not to Mr Varoufakis, takes over. His messages to the ""institutions"", as the IMF, European Central Bank and European Commission are now known (in place of the hated ""troika""), are more conciliatory than those of Mr Varoufakis.

IN RECENT months the walls of the B. & M. Theocharakis Foundation in Athens have been lined with mementoes of European support for Greece's freedom. ""Philhellenism"", an exhibition, tells the story of the material and moral backing that Romantics like the English poet Byron gave Greece during its independence fight against the Ottomans. The contemporary resonances are obvious. Showing some children around, Dimitra Varkarakis, who with her husband, Michael, owns the works on display, pointed to a German painting. One girl stopped short. ""Aren't we in a fight with Germany?"" she asked. ""No,"" replied Mrs Varkarakis. ""We are all friends."" After recounting this tale she casts Charlemagne an earnest look. ""Europeans,"" she says, ""must love each other."" 
That is a noble aim, for some Europeans have lately struggled even to speak to each other. Two weeks ago, after a particularly disastrous meeting, Yanis Varoufakis, Greece's finance minister, declared that he welcomed the hatred directed against him in the euro zone. After more than three months of fruitless negotiations with Mr Varoufakis, the reserves of Philhellenism among Greece's partners have run utterly dry. ""They are living in cloud-cuckoo land,"" says one Brussels official. 
Perhaps it was naive to expect anything else. A few years ago many of the men now in charge spent their time discussing the contradictions of capitalism over coffee and cigarettes. Few had ever run anything, let alone a government. Their European contacts were limited. Syriza, their party, typically won only 3-4% of the vote. But Greece's economic calamity transformed its prospects. In 2012 it came within a whisker of power. And after January's election it went one better, forming a governing coalition. 
Syriza, under the leadership of the new prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, offered an attractive promise to a country battered by recession and humiliated by years of tutelage at the hands of foreign bureaucrats. Mr Tsipras promised to tear up the bail-outs, restore Greek dignity and keep the euro (as the vast majority of Greeks want). Greece might also, ministers mused, change the rules of euro-zone governance, to the benefit of all Europeans. 
Three months on, the first two of these pledges are in tatters, the third looks shaky and the fourth is a bad joke. Less than a month after the election, Greece agreed to extend its second bail-out until the end of June, in the hope of securing the EUR 7.2 billion ($8.1 billion) left in the kitty. The abrasive approach of Mr Tsipras and Mr Varoufakis since then may have played well at home, but abroad it has won Greece nothing but mistrust and scorn. 
This has had two results. First, the conditions attached to any further loans Greece needs will be even more onerous. Second, the architects of the bail-outs, who were wrong in insisting on forcing austerity on depressed economies, seem more secure in their arguments than ever. ""Syriza has done a terrible disservice to all of us who have been trying to change the debate in Europe,"" says Loukas Tsoukalis, president of Eliamep, a Greek think-tank. 
A Grexit is still unlikely. But it is little wonder people are now planning for one. Having received no bail-out money since August 2014, the government has raided municipal funds and delayed payments to suppliers to keep its head above water. But it cannot go on inducing palpitations with the approach of every IMF and pension-payment deadline. Officials in Brussels and Athens agree that Greece cannot get beyond May without help. After that, it faces huge repayments to the European Central Bank in July and August, for which a third bail-out may be needed. 
That has concentrated minds. Mr Varoufakis, whose hectoring style infuriated the Eurogroup of finance ministers, has been sidelined. Talks in Brussels are getting down to detail. Some hope for a deal soon (if not before the Eurogroup meeting on May 11th). But Syriza insists it will not cross two red lines: on pension cuts and the rules governing lay-offs (on the latter, it has half a point). 
All of Mr Tsipras's options look bad. He could delay a payment to the IMF to buy time. He could continue a game of chicken, perhaps slapping capital controls on Greek banks. Or he could do a kolotoumba (somersault), conceding creditors' demands for the sake of Greece's euro membership. That might require a referendum. It could also split Mr Tsipras's party. There is a plethora of possibilities, but one way or another a reckoning is imminent. 
Dreaming that Greece might still be free 
What explains Syriza's intransigence? Greek observers offer a range of answers: incompetence, ideological blinkers, satisfying domestic demands for toughness. It may also have overestimated its hand. Whatever the reason, the uncertainty has cost Greece dear. Last year it returned to growth; this week the European Commission cut its forecast for 2015 to just 0.5%, and that assumes a deal will be done. The government is skint, foreign investment has dried up and a small primary fiscal surplus has been wiped out, raising the prospect of yet more hated austerity. 
On top of this, there is no longer much hope that Syriza will tackle the chronic pathologies of the Greek state. The government has failed to defang the country's oligarchs and is reversing some valuable reforms from recent years. An old Greek disease, clientelism, seems as pervasive as ever. To Potami, a liberal party, discovered that 11 of the 13 regional directors of education appointed by the government were Syriza members. (One of the others belonged to its coalition partner.) 
In almost every way, Syriza has brought the opposite of what it promised. It vowed an end to depression in Greece. Instead, growth has slumped. It pledged to end austerity politics in Europe, but has done more to embolden its advocates than any German could have hoped. It promised to jettison the bad habits of old parties, and seems instead to have acquired them. Back at the Athens museum, perusing a catalogue of his Philhellenic collection, Mr Varkarakis is downbeat. ""Two hundred years ago, everyone loved Greece,"" he says. ""Now...""

THE latest episode in Greece's long-running economic drama is coming to a head. Since the victory of the radical-left Syriza party in the election of late January, Greece's creditors and the new government headed by Alexis Tsipras have been exchanging threats. A resolution of some kind must occur in June, and sooner rather than later in the month. 
It could still be a disastrous falling-out that leads to Greece defaulting on official loans, imposing capital controls, freezing deposits and tumbling out of the euro. But as time and money run out, the concentrating of minds on both sides seems likely to bring a deal. 
Mr Tsipras is the one under most pressure. A recent payment to the IMF of EUR 750m ($825m) was made only by drawing down a special account Greece held at the fund. Next month the government is due to pay the IMF double that amount, starting with EUR 300m on June 5th. It may not be able to: a government minister said on May 24th that the money wasn't there. Even if the first instalment can be rustled together, the government will be hard-pressed to find the EUR 300m due on June 12th and the EUR 600m due on the 16th; a further EUR 300m is due on the 19th. Redemptions of EUR 6.7 billion of bonds held by the European Central Bank (ECB) loom in July and August--an impossibility without more help from the country's creditors. 
The government has been able to pay the IMF, as well as wages and pensions, only through a series of increasingly desperate manoeuvres. Local authorities have been ordered to provide the central government with their reserves. Other public-sector organisations are being raided for whatever cash they hold. Arrears are piling up as firms that have provided services to the state go unpaid and exporters wait in vain for VAT refunds. 
These tactics can be deployed for only a limited time. They are also counter-productive, since they harm the private sector and thus depress tax receipts. Greece has already fallen back into recession, aborting the recovery that got under way in the first nine months of 2014. The economy shrank by 0.4% in the final quarter of 2014 and a further 0.2% in the first quarter of 2015. The European Commission forecast in May that the economy would grow by just 0.5% this year; it had forecast growth of 2.9% in November. A broad measure of economic sentiment, which had improved in line with the GDP data last year, has plunged this spring, suggesting that the recession will deepen (see chart on next page). 
The position of Greek banks is almost as untenable as the government's; it is a moot point which will buckle first. The banks have been able to cope with capital flight and cash hoarding only by borrowing from the ECB, mostly through a massive amount of ""emergency liquidity assistance"", which can be cut off at any point if a two-thirds majority of the ECB's governing council objects to it. 
The mounting pressure on Greece is causing the government to negotiate meaningfully after months of stalled talks. The decision in late April to sideline Yanis Varoufakis, who had alienated his fellow euro-zone finance ministers through an abrasive and confrontational approach, helped. Mr Tsipras, who is now heavily engaged in the process and has struck a broadly conciliatory tone, rallied his party behind his negotiating stance on May 24th, which includes some ""red lines"" that he insists must not be crossed. 
Greece's plight is also goading its creditors. They are torn between two imperatives: demonstrating that club rules must apply to all members and trying to prevent ""Grexit"". Although the wider risks arising from Greece leaving the euro area appear less grave than in 2012, when Grexit was last feared, the impact of such a traumatic event is incalculable. Even if the short-term injuries could be treated (under the anaesthetising effects of the ECB's purchases of sovereign bonds through its quantitative-easing programme), it would weaken the monetary union in the long run. Henceforth membership of the euro would be regarded as just another transient system of fixed exchange rates. 
Though there are still difficult compromises to be made, the outlines of a deal are coming into focus (even if claims by the Greek government that one was being drafted this week were promptly denied by European officials). The dire condition of the economy means that the previous objective for a primary budget surplus (ie, excluding interest payments) of 3% of GDP this year is no longer attainable. Planned future surpluses of over 4% will also have to be reduced. 
Greece's negotiators, for their part, have accepted the need to simplify its VAT system, which could yield extra revenue of up to 1% of GDP. That should help offset the damage from the downturn. The government has toned down its anti-privatisation rhetoric and is pressing ahead with the sale of its stake in Greece's biggest port. It will have to accept more privatisations, not least since they yield revenue. Even Mr Tsipras's ""red lines""--no further cuts in pensions or public wages--are smudgeable. Creditors are not calling for cuts in public wages and pension spending can be reduced in a variety of indirect ways, such as reducing the scope for early retirement. 
With so much to lose on both sides and little to gain (other than painful assertions of principle), a deal still appears the most likely outcome despite the fraught nature of the negotiations. An agreement will not immediately unlock new money since disbursements will require parliamentary approval in creditor countries such as Germany. But it would enable the ECB to help overcome the immediate cash crisis by temporarily raising the amount of short-term debt the Greek government can issue. That, however, will only pave the way for the next episode in the drama: negotiating a whole new bail-out agreement.","Despite the foreboding , a deal still appears the most likely outcome

A broad measure of economic sentiment , which had improved in line with the GDP data last year , has plunged this spring , suggesting that the recession will deepen ( see chart on next page ) . 
 The position of Greek banks is almost as untenable as the government 's ; it is a moot point which will buckle first . The banks have been able to cope with capital flight and cash hoarding only by borrowing from the ECB , mostly through a massive amount of "" emergency liquidity assistance "" , which can be cut off at any point if a two - thirds majority of the ECB 's governing council objects to it . 
 The mounting pressure on Greece is causing the government to negotiate meaningfully after months of stalled talks . The decision in late April to sideline Yanis Varoufakis , who had alienated his fellow euro - zone finance ministers through an abrasive and confrontational approach , helped . Alexis Tsipras , rallied Alexis Tsipras's party behind Alexis Tsipras's negotiating stance on May 24th , which includes some "" red lines "" that Alexis Tsipras insists must not be crossed . 
 Greece 's plight is also goading its creditors . They are torn between two imperatives : demonstrating that club rules must apply to all members and trying to prevent "" Grexit "" . Although the wider risks arising from Greece leaving the euro area appear less grave than in 2012 , when Grexit was last feared , the impact of such a traumatic event is incalculable . Even if the short - term injuries could be treated ( under the anaesthetising effects of the ECB 's purchases of sovereign bonds through its quantitative - easing programme ) , it would weaken the monetary union in the long run . Henceforth membership of the euro would be regarded as just another transient system of fixed exchange rates . 
 Though there are still difficult compromises to be made , the outlines of a deal are coming into focus ( even if claims by the Greek government that one was being drafted this week were promptly denied by European officials ) . The dire condition of the economy means that the previous objective for a primary budget surplus ( ie , excluding interest payments ) of 3 % of GDP this year is no longer attainable . Planned future surpluses of over 4 % will also have to be reduced . 
 Greece 's negotiators , for their part , have accepted the need to simplify its VAT system , which could yield extra revenue of up to 1 % of GDP . That should help offset the damage from the downturn . The government has toned down its anti - privatisation rhetoric and is pressing ahead with the sale of its stake in Greece 's biggest port . It will have to accept more privatisations , not least since they yield revenue . Even Alexis Tsipras's "" red lines""--no further cuts in pensions or public wages -- are smudgeable . Creditors are not calling for cuts in public wages and pension spending can be reduced in a variety of indirect ways , such as reducing the scope for early retirement . 
 With so much to lose on both sides and little to gain ( other than painful assertions of principle ) , a deal still appears the most likely outcome despite the fraught nature of the negotiations . An agreement will not immediately unlock new money since disbursements will require parliamentary approval in creditor countries such as Germany . But it would enable the ECB to help overcome the immediate cash crisis by temporarily raising the amount of short - term debt the Greek government can issue . That , however , will only pave the way for the next episode in the drama : negotiating a whole new bail - out agreement .",350,Greece,cb-350-3,IN TERM,True,Alexis Tsipras,8,True

A few days after Muhammadu Buhari was sworn in as Nigeria's president, Amnesty International accused the Nigerian army of responsibility for the death of 8,000-plus men and boys by extrajudicial execution and through ill-treatment in detention camps. The alleged atrocities took place in the country's north-east, where Boko Haram, a jihadist group, stepped up its rebellion four years ago. 
Saudi Arabia offered a reward of $1.3m for information leading to the arrest of 16 people it said were involved in two bombings at Shia mosques, killing 26 people, for which Islamic State has claimed responsibility. 
It was revealed that American diplomats have secretly met representatives of Yemen's Houthi rebels in neighbouring Oman to discuss a political solution to the country's conflict. Since March, Saudi Arabia has been launching air strikes against the rebels, who have seized much of Yemen and sent the internationally recognised government fleeing. More than 2,000 people have died. Some hope that a political deal may be in the offing.

SINCE taking office in January Greece's radical-left government has been a model of inconstancy and incoherence. Yet one of its messages has been admirably consistent: that Greece's problems belong to the entire euro zone. Over the past four months Greece's creditors have become wearily accustomed to batting away grandiose proclamations by Alexis Tsipras's band of merry men. But as their talks with the Greeks approach a crunch, this is a proposition they should take seriously. 
Excluded from capital markets, Greece needs bail-out money to stay afloat. In exchange its creditors demand reforms and budget cuts designed, as they see it, to put Greece's finances on an even keel. Elected to reject such austerity, the Syriza government began negotiations with smiles and good cheer. Yanis Varoufakis, the finance minister, toured Europe to explain that the euro zone would work for the benefit of all if only its leaders would abandon their self-defeating obsession with austerity. But as the mood has soured and talks have gone nowhere, the message has taken on a darker tone. In an opinion piece for Le Monde this week Mr Tsipras declared that the strategy adopted by Greece's creditors risked ""the split and division of the euro zone, and consequently of the EU"". Those who wish to maintain this approach, he suggested, should re-read Hemingway's ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"", a brutal account of the Spanish civil war. 
It is understandable that the leader of a country staring into the abyss might be drawn to apocalyptic imagery. But Hemingway's clipped sentences do not quite capture the absurdity that has marked the latest episode of the Greek saga. A better guide is surely Kafka. For the Greeks, the impenetrable ""institutions"" they have encountered, seemingly impervious to reason and answering only to their own mysterious laws, resemble the bureaucracy that breaks the spirit of Josef K in ""The Trial"". Euclid Tsakalotos, a senior Greek negotiator who has a Marxist background, likens the creditors' robotic insistence on demand-killing labour reform to the intransigence of Soviet pen-pushers. 
For Greece's euro-zone partners, by contrast, the experience of dealing with Mr Tsipras and Mr Varoufakis after years of more-or-less pliant Greek governments recalls the shock delivered to the family of Gregor Samsa in Kafka's ""Metamorphosis"". One day they wake up to find their hard-working son inexplicably transformed into a hideous insect, whose attempts at communication reach their ears as incomprehensible screeches and squeals. No efforts to accommodate the creature succeed; ultimately only its expulsion or death will do. 
With luck, Greece can avoid that fate. On June 3rd, with Greece's reserves running perilously dry ahead of some hefty debt repayments, Mr Tsipras flew to Brussels, where he was presented with detailed reforms drawn up by the three institutions that monitor Greece's bail-out: the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF. Mr Tsipras's agreement, and the Greeks' implementation of the measures, would unlock the funds Greece needs to stay afloat. But that would require painful Greek concessions, particularly on pensions, which Syriza has vowed to protect. The meeting ended without a deal; talks will continue. 
Outright rejection could spell disaster for Greece, as deposits flee banks (see page 65) and the ECB reduces liquidity support. That in turn might mean capital controls, the first step on a road that could lead back to the drachma. It has become fashionable among some euro-zone politicians to suggest that a Greek exit from the euro would be manageable. But this complacency is not shared by the OECD, a rich-country think-tank, which has warned that failure to resolve Greece's problems could hurt growth and imperil the public finances of other euro-zone members. The Americans have also started to voice concerns. An initial deal within the next week now looks quite likely, although plenty of hurdles would remain, such as ratification in difficult parliaments like the Bundestag. Mr Tsipras would also face resistance at home if Syriza backbenchers sniff capitulation. 
But the arguments over resolving Greece's liquidity crisis have made it harder to focus on larger challenges such as the sustainability of its debt pile, which at 180% of GDP is far bigger than it was ever meant to be. A third bail-out may nod towards this by, for example, further extending debt maturities. But there is no real vision for Greece's economic future. The large primary surpluses demanded of the country--creditors have asked for 3.5% of GDP from 2018 in perpetuity--bear witness to intellectual exhaustion in the euro zone. 
Wanted: a vision 
The Greeks must shoulder much of the responsibility for their predicament. Mr Tsipras's strategy has been back-to-front: to find an audience for his views on European democracy, he needed first to earn the trust of his creditors rather than shatter it. Unlike every other country that has received a bail-out, no Greek government seems fully to have accepted the need for reform. 
But the Europeans are hardly blameless. Presented with the first authentic democratic challenge to their rules, they pettifogged on detail and fretted about moral hazard. One problem has been the presence of the IMF, which is more concerned to ensure its sums add up than to paper over the political troubles of the euro zone. It is running out of patience with the Europeans. But the Germans insist on keeping it involved to counter what they perceive as softheadedness in the commission. This is what passes for strategy inside the euro zone these days. 
Kafka's tales often follow their own spirals of logic towards grisly, even tragic conclusions. The final chapters of Greece's story remain to be written. An author is desperately needed.","Agonising over a short - term fix for Greece must not hide longer - term problems

A GLANCE at the crowds climbing the Acropolis suggests a normal Athenian summer, despite ominous noises coming from Brussels. Alexis Tsipras, the prime minister, still claims he can cut a deal with Greece's creditors this month to unlock much-needed bail-out money while avoiding more austerity that could create another deep recession. Yet his optimism is not shared by many. Even supporters of Mr Tsipras's radical-left Syriza party know that reforms to pensions and labour markets, which he has called ""red lines"", may be needed to remain in the euro (a recent poll finds 79% of Greeks in favour of staying). ""We'll have to make concessions in the end, but at least Alexis is putting up a fight,"" says Vassilis Stangos, a retired builder. 
The bail-out monitors--the European Commission, the IMF and the European Central Bank (ECB)--are frustrated by Greece's repeated failure to produce credible plans for reforms. Meanwhile, Mr Tsipras calls repeatedly for a ""political"" solution. ""Roughly translated, it means Athens wants cash with as few conditions as possible,"" says one weary Eurocrat (see Charlemagne, page 00). This week the commission rejected the latest Greek ideas, which included an extra EUR 500m ($570m) from value-added tax but no plan for raising another EUR 500m for pension cuts. 
It did not help when Athens reneged on a repayment of EUR 300m to the IMF on June 5th. Its new plan is to bundle up four instalments that are due in June into a single payment of EUR 1.5 billion at the end of the month, taking advantage of a loophole used by Zambia in the 1980s. The creditors' mood soured again when Mr Tsipras called their latest reform ideas ""absurd"". Jean-Claude Juncker, the commission's president and previously Greece's best friend, was annoyed when Mr Tsipras dismissed the list as ""Juncker's proposals"". 
Mr Tsipras met his French and German counterparts at an EU-Latin American summit in Brussels on June 11th; the three agreed to ""intensify"" the talks. But the next move is up to the Greeks. After almost four months of snail-paced talks, it looks as if the creditors may now call Greece's bluff. Yet Syriza has already furiously rejected their demands. The party is even incensed by Mr Tsipras's own modest plans. Before heading to Brussels he appealed to party bosses to back a deal, insisting he would not call an early election. Yet 22 Syriza MPs are rebelling, which could be enough to bring the government down. 
More deadlines loom. Greece's bail-out expires on June 30th; there is talk of extending it to next March, and disbursing some EUR 10 billion left from an earlier bank-recapitalisation fund to ensure that Athens can make repayments for the rest of 2015. But that will require fence-mending with the commission and the goodwill of Germany and other countries whose parliaments would have to approve an extension. Greece must repay EUR 6.5 billion to the ECB in July and August. Bank deposits are shrinking as Greeks fret over the uncomfortable prospect of capital controls. The government is running out of cash to pay wages and pensions, let alone the IMF. Without new help, it will surely default. Mr Tsipras urgently needs to quell opposition in his party and come up with a more convincing set of reforms.

IT IS never pleasant to watch a relationship founder. Greece's prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, has charged its creditors with trying to humiliate the country; he has accused the IMF of ""criminal responsibility"" for Greece's suffering. Prominent euro-zone politicians are saying openly that, without a deal to release rescue funds in the next few days, default and ""Grexit"" loom. 
The urgency is because of a repayment of EUR 1.5 billion ($1.7 billion), which Greece seemingly cannot afford, to the IMF on June 30th and because Greece's European bail-out expires that day. Cue the last-ditch negotiations that have become a Euro-speciality: just after The Economist went to press, finance ministers were to assemble in Luxembourg; leaders may meet over the weekend; a European Union summit is scheduled at the end of next week. It may come down to a head-to-head between Mr Tsipras and Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor. A deal is still possible, but the sides have come to loathe each other. If this were a marriage, the lawyers would be circling. 
Divorce would be a disaster--for everyone. The trouble is that, unless Greece and the euro zone change the terms of their relationship, staying together would not be a great deal better. 
Exit Greece, stage far-left 
To see why, start with the results of a default and Grexit. After arguing on and off for five infuriating years, some have begun to welcome the prospect. They are making a mistake. 
For Greece the gains from defaulting would be slight, and the costs potentially vast. True, the country could walk away from debts of EUR 317 billion, or almost 180% of GDP. But that is worth less to Greeks than it sounds. Although the debt is huge, it is at bargain-basement interest rates and repayable over decades. Interest payments until the early 2020s are just 3% of GDP a year. Even for Greece, that is manageable. Nor would leaving the euro do much good. In theory, with a new drachma and its own central bank, Greece could devalue and gain competitiveness. But Greece's trade is modest. And it has already lowered nominal wages by 16% without a boom in exports. 
By contrast, the cost of Grexit would be exorbitant: bust banks, slashed savings, broken contracts and shattered confidence (see page 71). Politics could be devastated. Syriza, Mr Tsipras's hard-left party, is anti-market and anti-enterprise. Neo-fascist Golden Dawn and the Communists, with a combined 12% of the vote, would thrive. Most of the parties in the middle, already discredited, would struggle. This week Mr Tsipras was due to play footsie with Vladimir Putin in Russia. Ejected from the euro, and possibly the EU, a country with a history of coups would risk becoming violent and even more corrupt. 
That is one reason for the euro zone to think twice before ditching Greece. A failing state on the Aegean would be the EU's problem regardless of whether its politicians accepted bribes in euros or drachmas--indeed, it would be a greater and less tractable problem than Greece is today. In addition, monetary union was supposed to be irrevocable. If, in fact, its members risk ejection, then contagion will be more likely to spread to other vulnerable economies, such as Portugal and Cyprus--if not in this crisis, then in the next. 
Some people, including possibly Mr Tsipras, have concluded that the price of Grexit is so high that Greece can count on the euro zone giving ground at the last minute. But that is reckless. If the euro is to endure, its rules must be enforceable. So long as the monetary union is forged between sovereign states the principles of irrevocability and enforceability are contradictory. Yet you can be sure there is a limit to what the euro zone will tolerate--even if nobody knows where it lies. 
Till debt do them part 
The upshot is that Grexit is a process, not an event. Even if talks fail, even if Greece defaults, even if it introduces capital controls and the government starts to issue paper IOUs because no more euros are left--even then, a referendum or a new government could still offer Greece a way back. 
But a deal is a process, too. Though it would doubtless be hailed as a triumph, it would mark only a step towards the eventual restructuring of Greek debt. Trust is so low and Greece's reluctance to honour its pledges so evident, that each slug of new rescue money will depend on Greece showing that it has kept its side of the bargain. Such conditionality is necessary and economically desirable (see Free exchange), but in today's poisoned environment comes at a high cost. Relations between the euro zone and Greece are defined in terms of the ""concessions"" each has screwed out of the other. The marriage may endure, but even more unhappily than before. 
A change of mindset is needed. Both sides have bungled the Greek crisis. Especially at the outset, the creditors put too much weight on rapid fiscal adjustment, in a doomed attempt to limit the size of Greek debt. As well as needlessly impoverishing Greece (GDP has shrunk 21% since 2010), this was a distraction from the real task, which is to sort out the structural impediments to growth--rampant clientelism, hopeless public administration, comically bad regulations, a lethargic and unreliable justice system, nationalised assets and oligopolies, and inflexible markets for goods and services and labour. 
But Mr Tsipras has made a bad situation worse. In 2014 the Greek economy grew. Now it is shrinking again, partly because Syriza has proved incompetent and even more clientelist than its predecessors. But also because posturing in negotiations has absorbed all Syriza's attention and set the country back years. The need for a crisis to bring the talks to a head and to wring concessions from the other side has wrecked market confidence. Capital has flooded out of the banking system. Investors have kept away. Every reform has become a bargaining chip that must not be traded away before a deal and will not be exceeded once a deal has been struck. The idea that reform is actually good for Greece has been lost. 
Most Greeks want to stay in the euro. But their politicians still look to Berlin for salvation, rather than to reform at home. Greece must understand that, if this does not change, the creditors will lose patience. Avoiding divorce would be better for everyone. But this marriage is not worth saving at any price.","Greece and the euro zone are stuck in an abusive relationship

SINCE the euro crisis erupted five years ago, the possibility of ""Grexit"" has been a recurring nightmare. It is looming again, as large as it did in 2012, when Greece was ultimately kept in the fold by a second big bail-out from the IMF and other euro-zone governments. Negotiations over the release of the remaining rescue funds have virtually broken down, as a new Greek government dominated by the radical-left Syriza party continues to balk at the reforms its creditors are demanding. The chances of a deal when euro-zone finance ministers met on June 18th (after The Economist had gone to press) looked slim. Yet Grexit looks no better an option now than it did three years ago. 
The Greek population overwhelmingly wants to stay in the euro and the government led by Alexis Tsipras says it does too. This is understandable, since leaving the monetary union would be a bloody business rather than a surgical operation--or so the IMF predicted in 2012. The reintroduction of the drachma would entail the forcible conversion of all domestic assets and liabilities to the new currency, which would immediately plunge by 50% against the euro, the IMF estimated, gutting bank deposits and other savings. As the drachma fell, pushing up import prices, inflation would surge to 35%, it reckoned, while the toll on GDP would be a decline of around 8%. Even the smallest of transactions would become difficult, it pointed out: after the short-lived Czech-Slovak monetary union broke up in 1993 it took six months to introduce new banknotes. 
Is the likely outcome still as grim? Unlike the situation in 2012, advocates of Grexit point out, the euro area's economy is growing, which should help it withstand the turmoil Grexit would bring. Before this year's setbacks Greece was running both a primary budget surplus (ie, before interest payments) and a current-account surplus, enabling it to cope without new loans. The default on foreign debts that would precipitate Grexit (or would become unavoidable since the burden of the euro-denominated liabilities would soar in devalued drachma terms) could also be seen as an advantage, resolving once and for all the seemingly oppressive burden of public debt, which is now close to 180% of GDP. Once the initial shock had been absorbed, Greece could benefit from the boost to competitiveness devaluation would bring. 
This scenario, however, underestimates the damage Grexit would do to the Greek economy. Confidence would be shattered in the long term as well as the short, since Greece would struggle to regain any semblance of trust. There would be endless wrangles with the IMF and other euro-zone governments, which would be nursing big losses on their loans to Greece. That would unsettle private investors, who would also worry that without pressure from official creditors, the Greek government would revert to the bad policies and poor governance that lie at the root of the country's misfortunes. 
The relief achieved through defaulting on government debt would be minimal. Even though public debt is high as a share of GDP, the interest that Greece is paying is very low, at 3% of GDP this year, helped by a deferral of payments on most of its loans from the euro zone's rescue fund until 2022. In all its borrowing from European creditors, Greece is already benefiting from debt relief in the form both of maturity extensions (some loans stretch out until the 2050s) and ultra-low interest rates. Indeed if Greece left the euro it could find itself paying more interest on its debt, even though its remaining loans would have become far smaller as a share of GDP. 
A cheaper currency would boost exports and tourism, but the benefits could easily be frittered away in higher inflation, especially as the central bank would be unlikely to enjoy genuine independence. In any case, Greece no longer needs to enhance its competitiveness with a devaluation since it has already achieved an ""internal devaluation"" through a sharp fall in wages. What is more, because exports make up an unusually small share of the economy, the gain from a devaluation would be limited. 
Grexit would still be troubling for the rest of the euro area too. The direct cost to euro-zone governments of a Greek default would be higher than in 2012, because they have since lent the country more money. Arguably, this would simply be recognising reality and would at least stop them throwing good money after bad. However, they could well find themselves having to provide large amounts of aid to Greece, if Grexit led to a humanitarian disaster. 
A particular worry in 2012 was that Grexit would unleash a domino effect whereby panic in the bond markets pushed one country after another into default. This scenario, which has informed the Greek government's bargaining strategy, is now less convincing. Although the difference in yield between safe German Bunds and the bonds of other vulnerable countries in southern Europe has recently widened slightly, this year's Greek drama has largely been confined to Greece (see chart on previous page). It helps that just days before the Greek election in January, the European Central Bank (ECB) announced a programme of quantitative easing, which involves buying lots of euro-zone government debt. Moreover, the European Court of Justice affirmed this week the ECB's (unused) policy of throwing a lifeline to governments under siege in the markets through unlimited purchases of their bonds. 
That has prompted some to argue that removing the perpetual troublemaker would make the euro zone stronger. By demonstrating that those who do not abide by the rules can be shown the door, the theory runs, Grexit would spur fiscal prudence and structural reform among the remaining members. In contrast, if Mr Tsipras faced down Greece's creditors, anti-austerity movements such as Podemos in Spain would take heart. 
The euro area may therefore seem to have good reason to countenance the upheaval of Grexit, but it would still be a risky move. Crucially, it would debunk the idea that membership of the euro was irrevocable. That would turn the single-currency club into just another fixed-exchange-rate system that might be vulnerable to speculative attack. 
On balance, then, the costs of Grexit still outweigh the benefits for the euro area as well as Greece. There are sound economic grounds for both sides to compromise and strike a deal. Whether strident politics in Greece and the creditor countries will allow that to happen remains an open--and pressing--question.","The costs of Grexit still outweigh the benefits for both Greece and the euro area

Indeed if Greece left the euro it could find itself paying more interest on its debt , even though its remaining loans would have become far smaller as a share of GDP . 
 A cheaper currency would boost exports and tourism , but the benefits could easily be frittered away in higher inflation , especially as the central bank would be unlikely to enjoy genuine independence . In any case , Greece no longer needs to enhance its competitiveness with a devaluation since it has already achieved an "" internal devaluation "" through a sharp fall in wages . What is more , because exports make up an unusually small share of the economy , the gain from a devaluation would be limited . 
 Grexit would still be troubling for the rest of the euro area too . The direct cost to euro - zone governments of a Greek default would be higher than in 2012 , because they have since lent the country more money . Arguably , this would simply be recognising reality and would at least stop them throwing good money after bad . However , they could well find themselves having to provide large amounts of aid to Greece , if Grexit led to a humanitarian disaster . 
 A particular worry in 2012 was that Grexit would unleash a domino effect whereby panic in the bond markets pushed one country after another into default . This scenario , which has informed the Greek government 's bargaining strategy , is now less convincing . Although the difference in yield between safe German Bunds and the bonds of other vulnerable countries in southern Europe has recently widened slightly , this year 's Greek drama has largely been confined to Greece ( see chart on previous page ) . It helps that just days before the Greek election in January , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) announced a programme of quantitative easing , which involves buying lots of euro - zone government debt . Moreover , the European Court of Justice affirmed this week the ECB 's ( unused ) policy of throwing a lifeline to governments under siege in the markets through unlimited purchases of their bonds . 
 That has prompted some to argue that removing the perpetual troublemaker would make the euro zone stronger . By demonstrating that those who do not abide by the rules can be shown the door , the theory runs , Grexit would spur fiscal prudence and structural reform among the remaining members . In contrast , if Mr Tsipras faced down Greece 's creditors , anti - austerity movements such as Podemos in Spain would take heart . 
 The euro area may therefore seem to have good reason to countenance the upheaval of Grexit , but it would still be a risky move . Crucially , it would debunk the idea that membership of the euro was irrevocable . That would turn the single - currency club into just another fixed - exchange - rate system that might be vulnerable to speculative attack . 
 On balance , then , the costs of Grexit still outweigh the benefits for the euro area as well as Greece . There are sound economic grounds for both sides to compromise and strike a deal . Whether strident politics in Greece and the creditor countries will allow that to happen remains an open -- and pressing -- question .",350,Greece,cb-350-3,IN TERM,True,the government led by Alexis Tsipras,4,True

In a further sign that the sector is hotting up, Google launched a free version of its music-streaming service, Google Play Music. Unlike the firm's subscription option, it will broadcast adverts and will not be available offline.

Bouygues, a French telecoms firm, rejected a reported EUR 10 billion ($11.2 billion) takeover offer from Altice, a competitor. A successful bid would have created France's largest mobile operator. The country's Socialist government decried the attempted takeover as bad news for consumers and jobs. Bouygues said a deal would have been difficult to get past regulators, but denied it had bowed to political pressure. A deal could have calmed a mobile-phone price war that has been raging in the country since Iliad, a low-cost-operator, disrupted the market three years ago. 
Financial regulators in Britain announced plans to police bankers' bonuses. Under new rules, banks will be able to claw back bonuses up to seven years after they were paid. This will rise to ten years for senior managers. Additionally, bonuses may be deferred for seven years for those bankers involved in risky trading. Non-executive directors, as well as managers at banks which have taxpayer support, will now be barred from receiving such incentives. 
British regulators also opened an investigation into KPMG's audit of Bank of New York Mellon. In April the Financial Conduct Authority fined BNY Mellon's London branch 26m ($198m) for breaching rules on keeping clients' money safe between 2007 and 2011.

WHILE Alexis Tsipras, the hard-pressed Greek prime minister, was struggling in Brussels to win concessions on a new bail-out deal, Alekos Flambouraris, his state minister, stayed in Athens to soothe angry members of his Syriza party. Its far-left faction feared that Mr Tsipras was about to cross his ""red lines"" and accept a tough austerity package, just as his predecessors had done in 2010 and 2012. 
Greece desperately needs a deal: its terms were being fought over as The Economist went to press. Without one, it cannot pay pensions on June 30th, the day the current bail-out expires, and will also default on a EUR 1.5 billion ($1.7 billion) debt to the IMF. If the bail-out is not renewed, Greek banks may lose the ""emergency liquidity assistance"" they have been getting from the European Central Bank. This has enabled the banks to survive six months of accelerating withdrawals by frightened depositors. By one recent estimate, EUR 45 billion is now stashed under Greek mattresses. Without the ECB, capital controls would have been imposed, stifling an economy weakened by six years of recession. 
Yet the terms of any new bail-out are going to be tough. Greece's latest proposals to release the rest of its EUR 7.2 billion bail-out, greeted as ""positive"" by its European creditors, were quickly unpicked by the IMF. A leaked list of ""prior actions"" (which must be legislated by Athens before any new aid is disbursed) drew various red lines through plans to avoid spending cuts by increasing taxes. A one-off tax of 12% on corporate profits above EUR 500,000, the biggest single revenue-raiser, was struck out altogether. The creditors argued that putting such heavy emphasis on higher taxes would drive the country deeper into recession, pushing unemployment past 30%. 
Mr Tsipras fought hard to avert more cuts in pensions, which he had promised to protect. Many of Greece's 2.9m retirees have seen their pensions slashed by 45% since 2010. But the IMF wanted a new cut of EUR 1.8 billion in pension spending by reducing incentives for early retirement and abolishing a top-up scheme for low-income pensioners. Mr Tsipras gave way to IMF demands on value-added tax, agreeing that most goods should come under the highest 23% rate, and scrapping the 30% discount enjoyed by Aegean islanders. 
Getting even this close to a deal has been a bruising experience. It will also be hard to sell. Mr Tsipras came to power in January pledging to end austerity but at the same time to ensure Greece stayed in the euro. He claimed he could extract billions from the country's European partners to rebuild the economy and persuade the IMF to reduce Greece's mountainous debt, equivalent to 180% of GDP. In return, Greece would crack down on tax evaders and curb the influence of ""oligarchs"" who dominate economic activity. Unemployed young Greeks rushed to vote for Syriza and its charismatic 40-year-old leader. Older voters were reassured that veteran leftists like Mr Flambouraris were allies of the inexperienced Mr Tsipras. 
Syriza still has a big lead in the polls over its closest rival, the centre-right New Democracy party, even though Greeks have become more critical of Mr Tsipras's handling of the bail-out negotiations. Some of the prime minister's toughest opponents come from his own party. Extremists in its far-left faction now say Greece should abandon the euro and readopt the drachma. But the party mainstream, representing about 60% of members, has remained loyal to Mr Tsipras. In the parliamentary group, some 20-30 of his 149 deputies could vote against the government when a new deal is put to a vote. 
That could in theory scupper the deal even if, as expected, all 12 deputies from Independent Greeks, Syriza's right-wing coalition partner, back it. But pro-European parties in New Democracy and the small centre-left To Potami (The River) party will vote in favour to ensure Greece stays in the euro. That would be humiliating for Mr Tsipras, and it could also undermine his position as Syriza's leader. One challenger might be Yanis Varoufakis, the outspoken finance minister, who may refuse to put his signature to a new bail-out deal. Another might be Zoi Konstantopoulou, the authoritarian parliamentary speaker. 
Mr Flambouraris has told his ten-member political committee that they must work fast to rally dissident lawmakers. Any new deal, including the prior actions, has to be rushed through parliament under emergency procedures by midnight on June 28th. The ECB may then find a way for the Greek government to raise enough money to pay pensions and the IMF. Weary Greeks would breathe a huge sigh of relief--but only until the next crisis.","Even if Greece 's government manages to strike a last - minute deal with its creditors , it will be hard to get it approved back at home

AFTER a week of manic summitry the euro zone once again finds itself in the wearily familiar position of trying to stop Greece from going bust. Finance ministers once again convened in Brussels on June 25th in their latest attempt to do a deal before Greece's current bail-out expires on June 30th. As The Economist went to press, the outcome was hard to predict. But it could not have been clearer that any agreement will cover only Greece's immediately pressing needs. Despite very different ideologies, Greece and its creditors are locked together in the deathly embrace of their shared currency. And all this over a country with debts representing about 3% of the euro zone's GDP. 
The endless twists of the bail-out talks are confusing, but it does not take close study to see that the results are bad. After five years, two bail-outs and a debt haircut, Greece's economy is 25% smaller than at its peak in 2008, unemployment stands at 26% and the public debt is nearly 180% of GDP. The public administration is broken, the old diseases of corruption and clientelism more rampant than ever. To obtain the money Greece needs to pay back earlier loans, Alexis Tsipras, the prime minister, is being urged to sign up to austerity measures prescribed by outsiders, just like the governments that he denounced with such vigour from the opposition benches. The big difference this time is that, after five months of stonewalling and rancour, any vestiges of trust between Greece and its creditors have evaporated. 
That has left Greece, and the euro zone, a lot worse off. Most Germans now want Greece out of the euro. The Bundestag and other creditor parliaments will struggle to approve yet another bail-out for Greece, especially if, as seems possible, it involves a promise to lighten its debt burden. As for the long-suffering Greeks, the only lesson they can draw from the sorry story is that they were imprudent to elect the wrong sort of government when they were still in hock to their creditors. 
How can all this have happened? Wind the clock back to May 2010. Greece's first bail-out was born of a constellation of fears. European Union leaders worried that a write-off of Greek debt would unleash Lehman-style contagion. Germany fretted that, without the imprimatur of the IMF, any bail-out would be insufficiently rigorous. Creditor countries doubted they could get vast rescue loans approved by their parliaments. Thus emerged a programme that bound together a troika of ill-fitting institutions--the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF--as monitors of an ill-designed rescue of a country that should never have joined the euro in the first place. 
After five years of this menage a trois, every member of the troika is, like the families in ""Anna Karenina"", unhappy in its own way. The ECB is divided over the support it has lent Greece's tottering banks, and frustrated with do-nothing politicians who rely on it to keep the euro zone afloat with such unconventional tools as quantitative easing. The commission now talks more about austerity than about the jobs and growth promised by Jean-Claude Juncker when he took over as president last November. And the IMF has been sucked into a European political vortex that infuriates its non-European shareholders. It has feuded with the commission over Greece's debt, which it wants restructured to make the sums add up. Having been ""socialised"" into the peculiar ways of the euro zone over the past five years, says Mujtaba Rahman of the Eurasia Group, a consultancy, the IMF is no longer prepared to sacrifice its credibility for European solidarity. 
It is easy to see why. Greece has always struggled to implement previous agreements and has missed most of the fiscal targets set by them, not least because of the recessionary impact of austerity. A government ideologically opposed to bail-outs is hardly likely to make a success of one that has been forced on it. Meanwhile, uncertainty has plunged Greece back into recession and again priced it out of capital markets. It will find itself holding out the begging bowl again before too long. 
In Greece's case, hope has replaced judgment and the outcome of the drama is hard to know. But the difficulties over doing a deal will not have persuaded Germany that the euro zone is ready to tackle its problems without the IMF to stiffen its sinews. In the longer term some hope the European Stability Mechanism, the EUR 500 billion permanent bail-out fund, can become a European Monetary Fund that could oversee future rescues, freeing the IMF from its European burden. And now that it is the supervisor of the biggest European banks, the ECB should reconsider whether it should be part of the troika, even if its role in averting bank runs requires at least some involvement in bail-out talks. 
In search of presidentialism 
As ever, there are bigger ideas floating around. A new report on euro-zone governance, written by the presidents of five European institutions, will be discussed at this week's EU summit. It contains some good ideas, says Guntram Wolff of Bruegel, a think-tank, such as ""competitiveness authorities"" that might help to restrain the wage divergences that have plagued the euro zone in the past. But many previous reports are gathering dust in the far reaches of back offices. And with Greece on the edge, Britain renegotiating its EU relationship and Russia menacing Europe's east, there is little appetite for grand new plans for deep economic integration--and certainly not for ambitious treaty change (which the five presidents themselves want to avoid). 
Sceptics at the euro's launch, including the German Bundesbank, uttered many warnings that monetary union could not work without political union. The euro zone has spent five years desperately scrambling to prove them wrong, inflicting immense damage in Greece and elsewhere. It will keep trying, and Charlemagne can only hope that it succeeds. Otherwise, if you want a vision of the future, imagine frustrated euro-zone leaders arriving in Brussels for ""last-ditch"" bail-out summits--forever.","Greece and the euro zone can not go on like this -- but they probably will

THE European Union has never seen the like of the past eight days in Greece: barred banks, capital controls, the first IMF default by a developed country, the collapse of a multi-billion-euro bail-out, plans for a referendum that may hasten Greece's ejection from the single currency, and the beggary of the people. Were the stakes not so high, all those emergency summits and last-minute demands would count as farce. 
Instead it is a tragedy, where an outcome that all sides say they do not want--Greece's exit from the euro--seems increasingly likely. The chaos is evidence that leaving the euro would be disastrous for Greece, not least because modest gains from default and devaluation would be overwhelmed by political and economic instability. For the rest of Europe, too, ""Grexit"" has well-rehearsed risks, notably that of a failing state on the continent's south-eastern flank. But as the drama has become more desperate, so Europeans seem less worried. They take comfort from the fact that Greece is uniquely dysfunctional. Game-playing and repeated miscalculation have poisoned the negotiations (see page 16). Without Greece, many now conclude, the euro zone might actually be more stable. 
Sadly, that is wrong. Look beyond Greece, and the threat of further conflict within the euro is all but inevitable. Although Greece's departure would prove the euro is not irrevocable, nobody would know what rule-breaking would lead to expulsion. Nor would it resolve the inevitable polarisation of debtor and creditor governments in bail-outs. If the single currency does not face up to the need for reform, then this crisis or the next will witness more Greeces, more blunders and more dismal weeks. In time, that will wreck the euro and the EU itself. 
Don't chuck it away 
Just now this argument is obscured by Greece's hard-left Syriza government and its absurd referendum. Assuming it happens, Sunday's vote will ask Greeks to assess the creditors' restructuring plan (which is no longer on offer) and their debt-sustainability analysis (which requires a degree in economics). The prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, says a No will strengthen his hand with creditors and so help keep Greece in the euro. European leaders retort that a No is in fact a vote to leave. After a Yes, Mr Tsipras might cling on or, if he goes, Greece might re-elect Syriza, but both have campaigned for a No. It is not a high point for the country of Plato. 
Back in the real world, Greece is running out of money. The European Central Bank (ECB) refuses to give the banks more liquidity and they are tottering. If Greece defaults on EUR 3.5 billion-worth ($3.9 billion) of bond payments to the ECB on July 20th, pressure will build to withdraw even today's backing. The government will soon start paying its bills with IOUs that, in time, will become a parallel currency. Each step makes Grexit more likely. Moreover, for Greece to return to normality will require ever more nous and skill--and a lack of both in Mr Tsipras is part of the reason why his country is so lost. 
Mr Tsipras's uselessness is his own fault. But neither the election of Syriza's ragbag of leftists in January nor their brinkmanship was an accident. Greek GDP shrank by a quarter over five years, unemployment is over 25% and youth unemployment over 50%. Partly to blame is austerity imposed by creditors who, especially in the early years, sought to bring down Greece's budget deficit too far too fast. Greece eventually started to grow again, but the slump discredited the establishment. Syriza came to power on the fantasy that Greeks could both end their hardship and also be welcome within the euro. Mr Tsipras thought he had bargaining power and as it has drained away he has looked increasingly erratic. 
Omega hour 
His miscalculation is prompted by tension at the heart of the euro project. Mr Tsipras believed that a cave-in by the creditors was inevitable because they are determined that the euro should stick together. But the creditors would not be blackmailed into subsidising endless delinquency, because they are adamant that the system must have discipline. Mr Tsipras negotiated as a sovereign leader with a democratic mandate; but northern European leaders represent voters, too, and they never signed up to a system of large unconditional transfers. 
Brinkmanship and crisis are inevitable in such a system. And they are aggravated by the euro zone's reliance on ad hoc bail-outs, which politicise every decision. They set one side against another, breeding contempt among the creditors and resentment among the debtors. They turn wise policies into concessions that should not be given up to the other side until the last minute. No wonder the process has failed: at crunch time more than 20 negotiating parties, all with vetoes, were working to different agendas and haggling under pressure. The same downward spiral is all too plausible in a future crisis: the ruination of politics and the economy as demands for forgiveness from debtor nations like Italy or Portugal, say, founder on demands for austerity from Germany and Finland. 
Right now Greeks need a new prime minister. Relations with the devious Mr Tsipras are shattered: with him in charge, they will struggle to stay in the euro. In the longer run, the euro zone needs shoring up. A stable currency is a trade off with fiscal sovereignty. To protect against downturns, euro-zone members must create automatic mechanisms, such as collective unemployment insurance, that channel extra funds to countries in recession. Instead of bail-outs, the single-currency area needs more joint pooling of risk and responsibility--some form of ""Eurobonds"" or jointly guaranteed sovereign debt--governed by fiscal rules more binding than today's. 
The bloc knows that it needs to change. It has moved towards banking union; five of its leaders have issued a paper on how to strengthen the euro, including, among other ideas, a deposit-insurance scheme. But their proposals are modest because governments are harried by anti-EU populists and their citizens did not sign up to the euro expecting to give up a lot more sovereignty. The moral of Greece's disaster is that Europeans must face up to the euro's contradictions now--or suffer the consequences in more ruinous circumstances.","Whatever its outcome , the Greek crisis will change the EU for ever

FEW countries put sufficient store in rejecting things to have a national ""No"" day. But every October 28th Greece's Oxi Day holiday commemorates the No with which it replied to a humiliating Italian ultimatum in 1940, a refusal to acquiesce that led to invasion. 
The snap referendum that Alexis Tsipras called on June 26th after walking out of negotiations with the country's creditors looks like the Greek prime minister's attempt to stage another defiant rejection. He has urged Greeks to use the vote on July 5th to say Oxi to austerity and the ""blackmail"" of Greece's creditors. The leaders of the European Union, for their part, are hoping for a resounding Nai: Yes to remaining within the euro and the wider European family. 
On the face of it Greece and its creditors were not far apart on the substance of how to extend the bail-out that the country needs to keep paying its bills. But trust between the two sides has broken down almost entirely, and room for manoeuvre has run out. On June 30th Greece failed to make a EUR 1.55 billion ($1.72 billion) payment to the IMF, the biggest default in the fund's history. Five years into the debt crisis, the country has suffered a loss of 25% of its GDP and a debilitating rise in immiseration and the unemployment rate--which now stands at over 50% among young people. Its soup kitchens are open but its banks are closed; the country is close to collapse. The default on its IMF loan does not have immediate consequences, but that would not be the case if it failed to make the payment of EUR 3.5 billion due to the European Central Bank (ECB) on July 20th. Greece is likely to leave the euro, and possibly the EU, if it does not vote Yes on Sunday. 
The miserable banality 
For something so pivotal, the referendum itself is wonky to the verge of obfuscation. Its 72-word question makes no explicit mention of the euro; it asks whether the voters will accept a reform and fiscal-adjustment programme drawn up by the European Commission, the ECB and the IMF, comprising two documents submitted on June 25th. To muddy things further the measures it refers to were superseded by a later proposal which in turn lapsed when the bail-out deal expired on June 30th. On July 1st Mr Tsipras said a No vote would strengthen Greece's negotiating hand, not push it out of the euro. But he has twisted and turned so much that Greeks find it hard to know how to take what he says. Some wonder whether he will hold the vote at all--his leftist Syriza party is split on the matter. 
European leaders hope that, faced with a hard choice, the Greeks will stick with the European project. They take reversals earlier in the crisis as cheering precedents. In late 2011 the Socialist prime minister, George Papandreou, announced a referendum on a bail-out, changed its terms, cancelled it and promptly lost power. In 2012 the voters strengthened anti-austerity parties in a first round of voting but, spooked by the real prospect of ""Grexit"", swung back to more EU-amenable parties in the second. 
The same dynamic may be at work this time. The Yes camp is fragmented, but some polling suggests it is pulling ahead. Capital controls and limits on ATM withdrawals--EUR 60 a day, far less than Cypriots were entitled to at the height of their banking crisis in 2013--concentrate the mind. Pensioners without cash cards are hit badly; some banks have opened for pensioners alone, under police guard and with withdrawals limited to EUR 120 a week. There have been queues at petrol stations and hoarding at supermarkets. Sheltering from the rain under a Greek flag at a Yes rally in Syntagma Square, one voter said he turned out ""because voting yes is the only way to get rid of this catastrophic government and to stay in Europe...We belong in Europe and we do not want to become third-world citizens."" 
Many have had a hand in creating this mess. The founding fathers of the euro launched a single currency so flawed as to risk becoming, in the words of the British Conservative leader of the time, William Hague, ""a burning building with no exits"". European leaders allowed a woefully unprepared Greece to join the currency in 2001; France and Germany broke and rewrote the budget rules in 2003, weakening their authority. Until the global financial crisis made its deficit impossible to hide Greece's leaders misled the rest of the euro zone about their country's finances. 
As rising bond yields threatened to push Greece to default, creditors botched the first bail-out in 2010 (see chart 1) by imposing too much austerity too quickly. For all of their railing against austerity, Greek leaders mostly cut deficits instead of promoting growth. For too long, the ECB resisted any notion of imposing losses on private bondholders even when it was obvious that Greece was bust. When haircuts for bondholders, known as ""private sector involvement"", were agreed on in 2011 they were too late to do the trick. 
In 2012 European leaders promised in the future to look again at the sustainability of Greek debt, but never wrote any of it off. It now stands at 177% of GDP. The failure by the creditors to face reality helped Mr Tsipras to a resounding election victory in January on the contradictory promise both to end ""barbarous"" austerity and to keep the euro. 
Time has gone by quickly 
For a while, it looked as if Mr Tsipras might eventually yield. On February 20th Yanis Varoufakis, the finance minister, agreed to an extension of the bail-out agreement then in place and to negotiations on further reforms, saying reassuringly that he was in favour of 70% of them. Then things went downhill. Mr Varoufakis's penchant for lecturing his fellow finance ministers got him sidelined. A new Greek negotiating team resisted VAT increases and pension cuts--both ""red lines"" for the government--while producing budget figures reliant on unlikely improvements in tax-collection. The government rehired sacked workers and declared a new tax amnesty. 
On June 21st, only nine days before the bail-out's extension was due to expire, the Greeks at last produced a plan that European leaders thought worth serious discussion. But the IMF disliked its emphasis on tax rises, and European officials crossed out several sections with red lines, rewriting them to their taste like teachers dissatisfied with a pupil's shoddy homework. Negotiations continued; at one point only EUR 2 billion seemed to separate the two sides. But just when it seemed a deal was in the offing, Mr Tsipras walked out of the negotiations and called his referendum. A slow bank-run in Greece accelerated (see chart 2) and the ECB froze the level of emergency liquidity it was prepared to offer Greek banks, leading the government to close them for a week. Mr Tsipras made several eleventh-hour offers. In one plea, he again asked for an extension, and the start of negotiations on a third bail-out, lasting two years. In another, he said he accepted almost all of the creditors' conditions. But the creditors said there would be no more games, and no more negotiations, until the Greek people had spoken. 
If this hard line does bring about a Yes Mr Tsipras and his ministers will probably prefer to resign than to submit to a deal they have so roundly denounced. That could lead either to the formation of a new government of national unity from the current parliament, or to fresh elections. If those elections were to give Syriza a fresh mandate there is no telling what might happen--something which would also be true if Mr Tsipras were to stay on in spite of a Yes. But if, as seems more likely, Greece ends up with a non-Syriza government it will be able to expect some political goodwill from its creditors during the negotiation of a third bail-out, and to get some sort of promise on restructuring Greece's vast debts. The goals of such a deal might not differ substantially from those of the creditors' previous offer, but reaching them could be significantly more painful. The economic damage of recent months may mean more tax rises and spending cuts. 
There is no way that such a bail-out can be put into operation before the July payment to the ECB comes due. But if the negotiations are going well, the ECB could tide the country over by temporarily raising the amount of money that Greece can raise through issuing short-term debt and the amount of that debt that Greek banks can purchase. One way or another, something could be worked out: ""It's an open door to be creative,"" says a senior Eurocrat. 
Nervous about the oracle 
The ECB would also have to attend to the role it took on in late 2014 as the ultimate supervisor of Greek banks. When Greece's financial sector emerges from its current induced coma it will be in even worse shape than before; given the economic shock of the past week, non-performing loans are likely to soar from an already high 34%. Fresh capital may once again have to be provided by the government (and thus by loans from the creditors). 
A No vote would see the same milestones reached, but without the goodwill. Some observers think that the ECB--which could, by removing support after a July default, let Greek banks fail in a way that makes Grexit certain--might instead keep them on life-support so as to let the politicians take the final decision. But having told the Greeks that a No vote would be a vote to leave the euro, many leaders would see no benefit in stopping the process. In recent weeks Angela Merkel's much-used motto--""If the euro fails, Europe fails""--has been respun to distinguish defending the euro from keeping Greece in the euro zone. A YouGov poll shows 58% of Germans now favour Grexit; less than half as many want to keep Greece in the club. 
Conceived as an ""irrevocable"" monetary union, the euro has no official exit routes. But two are plausible in practice. If it chose not to keep the country on life support for a political coup de grace, the ECB would cut Greece out of the TARGET2 payments system, which would separate it from the euro area. It might also be obliged to stop providing liquidity to Greek banks. With no euros available, Greece would have to fund its banks in a new currency. 
Even without a banking crisis, an unsupported Greek government would have to start using scrip--in effect new IOUs--to pay bills, and maybe pensions. If the Greek government decided to make this parallel currency legal tender then once again the ECB would almost certainly have to act. 
On the face of it, there is nothing to prevent Greece from remaining in the EU if it stops using the euro. Nine other countries have national currencies. But because the euro was meant to be a one-way street there is as yet no legal path by which Greece can bring that number up to ten. And it is possible that, in the turmoil of Grexit, the country would be unable or unwilling to abide by the rules of the single market, or that other countries would start to impose controls on the movement of goods and people from Greece. 
The financial consequences of Greece leaving the euro can now be considered with much more equanimity than previously because the risk of contagion looks much smaller than it used to. When the earlier bail-outs were agreed to, it was feared that Grexit would cause so much panic in the markets that other vulnerable countries might also be pushed into default. But since then the ECB has put in place a programme of quantitative easing that has kept bond yields low, and has indicated it will take further action if renewed contagion from Greece starts driving up yields elsewhere. Markets believe that Mr Draghi will carry through on his promise, made in 2012, to do ""whatever it takes"" to save the euro. 
That does not mean no pain. News of the referendum and the subsequent capital controls caused a sell-off in world markets on June 29th, with the DAX index of German stocks falling by 3.6%, France's CAC 40 falling by 3.7% and the S&P 500 in New York falling by 2.1%. But things might have been a lot worse. On June 29th Portuguese government-bond yields rose by a third of a percentage point, but the spread (or excess rate) over German yields is still only a sixth of its level in June 2012. This does not just reflect the ECB's new powers. Portugal, Ireland and Spain, once grouped in with Greece as the PIGS, are doing better than they were--as indeed was Greece, before Syriza. Whereas in 2012 capital fled other southern European countries when Greece was ailing, there is no such exodus happening at the moment. 
Europe's banking system, a likely vector for contagion in any financial crisis, is in better shape than at the outset of the crisis. Euro-zone banks have raised some EUR 250 billion in capital since 2008, bolstering once-shaky balance sheets. And banks once heavily exposed to Greece have had ample time to reorder their affairs. European lenders' claims on Greece, which once topped EUR 300 billion, now stand at just EUR 54 billion, according to Deutsche Bank. Most of the outstanding Greek debt is now owed to governments and international institutions, which could handle the cost of default, rather than to banks, which would struggle to do so. The overall cost of Grexit might be EUR 230 billion, according to Alberto Gallo of RBS, another bank: hefty, but only about 2% of euro-zone GDP. 
They'll do the legislating 
But if the short-term consequences of Grexit seem manageable, the long-term effect of an irrevocable union being partially revoked is unpredictable. A crisis over Grexit may yet spur the euro zone to take another step towards integration. The currency's weaknesses--a lack of risk-sharing mechanisms, of a common safe asset, of a central budget and other means to help absorb economic shocks in one or other country--are well rehearsed. Common deposit insurance, more integrated capital markets and common Eurobonds would tie things together better. But as sensible as economists may deem them, and as ardently as integrationist Europeans may wish for them, they will be difficult to enact. Mutualising liabilities touches the core of national sovereignty. Populist anti-EU parties make any move towards ""more Europe"" risky for mainstream politicians. Yet even if financial contagion is limited, there will be spillovers elsewhere. 
There are Eurocrats who fear that Grexit might compound Europe's migration problem. Over 63,000 migrants (mainly Syrians) have arrived in Greece this year; the EU relies on ""frontline"" states like Greece to fingerprint and register as many such people as possible. This co-operation, never solid, could break down entirely. 
Geopolitical concerns loom large, too. For months some Europeans have feared that a Syriza-led government might seek to strengthen Greece's long-standing ties with Russia. So far those fears have proved unfounded; Greece has not, for example, attempted to block the EU's sanctions over Ukraine. But its calculus may change if it finds itself bankrupt and isolated. Mrs Merkel is one of those who fear the consequences of the EU abandoning a country with a history of coups in a part of Europe with a particularly unstable history. Some European institutions are already drawing up plans for humanitarian assistance packages for a post-Grexit Greece. 
And there could also be knock-on effects on Britain's position in the EU. The more time and effort Europe's leaders invested in the Greek crisis, however it develops, the less they will have available to deal with the renegotiation that is to preface Britain's forthcoming referendum on EU membership. A chaotic Grexit would also strengthen the hand of British Eurosceptics by reflecting poorly on all involved; and if it accelerated fiscal integration among the 18 remaining members of the euro zone it would deepen British concerns about the gap between euro-zone ""ins"" and ""outs"". 
To lose one EU member might look like misfortune; to lose two would look like carelessness. A Greek departure would surely make much of Europe more determined to keep Britain in. The problem is that, as Greece's botched and blame-filled story shows, Europe is not adept at getting the results that it wants. And for now, what it gets next depends on Sunday's voters. Some of them, as they make their decision, will doubtless recall the words of the poet Konstantinos Cavafy: 
For some among us there comes up a dayWhen either the great Yea or the great NayMust needs be spoken... 
For many the heart will say Nay and the head command Yea. Which wins will determine the course of their country, and perhaps of much else besides.","A nation decides its fate . Again

ANDREAS PAPANDREOU, a proud Greek socialist who stood up to his country's coup-mongering generals in the 1960s, won an election in October 1981 by fulminating against the European Economic Community (as it was then known) and vowing to lead Greece out of NATO. But in office he executed a graceful kolotoumba (somersault), discovering a taste for European subsidies that could be used to expand his crony state and turning himself into an engaged, if awkward, NATO partner. Greece's interests, Papandreou determined, were best served by exploiting the rules of the clubs it belonged to, not by tearing them up. 
The ties that bind Europe's political elites have often turned out to be extraordinarily strong. Sometimes they oblige weak leaders to jettison election pledges. Take Francois Hollande, who took office in 2012 promising to end European austerity but instead finds himself battling to please Germany by reforming France's sclerotic economy. When referendums go the ""wrong"" way, as with Ireland's rejection of the Lisbon treaty in 2009, leaders tweak the text and ask citizens to vote again. The serial bail-outs of the past five years may have empowered populists in creditor and debtor nations, but they have not led to irreparable ruptures. Indeed, these days many politicians in Portugal, Ireland and Cyprus speak warmly, if sotto voce, of the reforms and cuts they had to undertake to stay in the euro zone. 
Small wonder Greece's European creditors thought the radical leftists of Syriza too would fall into line, despite having won power in January on a promise to end austerity. Soon after Greece's election Charlemagne was told by a senior official in the European Commission, one of the institutions that monitors bail-outs, that Alexis Tsipras, Syriza's leader and the new prime minister, would turn out to be another Papandreou: a fire-breather on the campaign trail who would soon learn the responsibility that comes with membership of the European family. 
It is not the official's fault that this prediction turned out to be spectacularly wrong. Bar a few lonely Greeks who warned that Syriza was not a party Europe could do business with, almost everyone thought the mysterious forces that keep Europe together would drive Mr Tsipras to accept a cash-for-reforms deal. Early signs of trouble, such as the preening lectures on macroeconomics delivered by Yanis Varoufakis, Greece's finance minister, to his euro-zone peers in the Eurogroup, were written off first as amusing, and then irritating. Mr Tsipras, who oozes charm and good cheer, seemed like the sort of man with whom European leaders could strike an agreement. Some thought he might ditch his infuriating finance minister. Almost all believed he would, eventually, perform his own kolotoumba. Yet despite the endless summits, conference calls and late-night negotiations, it never happened. 
The moment of truth came on June 26th, when Mr Tsipras called a shock referendum on the creditors' latest bail-out offer. Officials had thought a deal was close; the negotiations were ongoing when Mr Tsipras made his announcement. The surprise was apparent everywhere: from the face of the commission official with whom Charlemagne was sharing a drink when the news broke, to an emotional speech on June 29th by Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the commission, who declared himself ""deeply distressed and saddened"" by the Greek move. 
Now Mr Tsipras has come to the end of the road. This week he continued to seek a deal, even as Greece defaulted on an IMF payment and its bail-out expired. But at the same time he was denouncing his partners on television and urging Greeks to vote ""no"" to the agreement he sought. No one has been more infuriated than the Germans. On July 1st Angela Merkel, the chancellor, dismissed the latest Greek proposal with uncharacteristic haste. Her government now seems determined to see the back of Mr Tsipras. What many saw as a poker game has turned out to be an unequal bout of Ultimate Smackdown. 
This is an extremely unhappy affair for the EU, which thought it had found an unusually effective way of resolving differences between democracies. Now that the rupture with the Greeks is clear, officials in Brussels do not know what to make of it all. ""I've never in my life seen such people,"" says one senior figure involved in the talks. ""They are irresponsible! Irresponsible!"" 
Something had to give 
Perhaps the creditors deserve a share of the blame. Their own tactics could have been more sensitive: their response to a Greek proposal last week, which featured paragraphs struck out with red lines and entirely rewritten, infuriated Greeks who are no fans of Syriza. They could have offered some accommodating words on debt relief. Yet that would have been a stretch for many creditor countries. Greece's government, despite Mr Tsipras's protestations, is not the only one to enjoy a democratic mandate. 
A better argument is that the creditors should have had the foresight to know what the austerity they brought upon Greece might wreak. Few democracies could withstand a 25% contraction in GDP over five years, a calamitous growth in unemployment and the humiliation of having endless budgets written by unelected outsiders. Greece's pre-2008 boom may have been unsustainable and its politicians venal, but that is of no comfort to retirees whose pensions have been slashed or graduates forced abroad to find work. Syriza appealed to voters who had lost all hope. It offered a false prospectus, perhaps a deceitful one. But it was, in part, the creation of the euro zone's failed policies. 
One still hears European officials lament that Syriza began its reign of calamity just as Greece was starting to recover, as if voters should have merely exercised more patience. Mr Tsipras's amateurishness has, lamentably, given Europeans an excuse not to examine their own culpability. If Greece does fall out of the euro, its leaders must bear the blame. But Europeans might consider what they can do to ensure a return to the glorious days of fudge.","The euro zone thought it could muddle through with Syriza . It was wrong

ANY investor who fell asleep on January 1st and woke up on June 30th might feel they had not missed anything. The S&P 500 index ended the first half pretty much where it started; the same is true of London's FTSE 100 index. The ten-year Treasury-bond yield edged up by around a fifth of a percentage point (see chart). Nor would a reawakened investor be particularly surprised to find that Europe was still engulfed in a Greek crisis. 
But a lot did change in the first half of the year and recent events have emphasised three lessons. The first is that political risk is very real. Over the past decade or so, investors seem to have decided that such risks are overblown. Middle East crises have come and gone without the straits of Hormuz being blocked and oil supplies impeded. Congress has repeatedly threatened to shut down the government and drive America into technical default by refusing to raise the limit on its debts--but at the last minute, deals get done. Scotland did not vote to leave the United Kingdom. Russia and the West may be at loggerheads over Ukraine, but that has affected Russian markets, not those in Europe or America. 
For much of this year, investors have accordingly assumed that politics would proceed as usual: a Greek deal would be done, albeit at the last minute. Hedge-fund managers who would shun the socialist views of the Syriza leadership piled into Greek shares and bonds. Some apparently hired body-language experts to assess the gestures of Alexis Tsipras and Yanis Varoufakis so as to anticipate their actions. But Syriza was elected on a promise to break with the past; ideological opposition to austerity has pushed the Greeks all the way to capital controls and bank closures. Even if a deal is agreed in the end, a lot of damage has been done. 
There are other insurgent parties in Europe that reject the old politics. Although none has yet had the same electoral success as Syriza, they are still having an effect on the mainstream parties. Britain's frantic attempts to renegotiate the terms of its EU membership are a response in part to the rise of the UK Independence Party. 
In a world where growth has been hard to achieve, politicians do not have a bigger pie to divide up and dish out. A concession made to one group must be at the cost of another. The temptation then is blame outsiders (foreigners) for the mess and to seek to gain at their expense. This makes it harder to achieve compromise in international negotiations, as the Greek saga and the refugee crisis in the Mediterranean have amply illustrated. 
The second lesson is that investors are still dependent on the largesse of central banks. There was a sell-off in equities on June 29th when fears of a Greek exit from the euro zone resurfaced. But it was not as big as it would have been in 2011. Crucially, the bonds of euro-zone members such as Portugal and Italy suffered only minor losses. That is because the European Central Bank has the monetary firepower to buy those countries' bonds and ward off contagion. 
But what central banks give, they can take away. The big guessing game for investors in the first half of the year was when the Federal Reserve would increase rates--the first rise since 2006. It is clearly a tricky decision: the American economy was weak in the first quarter and core inflation is below target. A big Greek shock may have an impact. On June 29th, as Greece imposed capital controls, the futures market indicated that investors were less sure rates would rise in September. If Greece strikes a deal, the Fed will have more freedom to act. 
The third lesson is that, because of reduced liquidity, markets can move very rapidly indeed. In the government-bond market, German ten-year yields went from 0.5% to almost zero in April, before shooting back up to nearly 1% and then falling back again. These are huge moves for a ""risk-free"" asset. 
Illiquidity makes the markets vulnerable to a truly unforeseen shock. Greece's epic woes, which have been dragging on for five years, do not really count. Asia, where economic data have been mixed, could be the source of a nasty surprise: the latest South Korean and Taiwanese purchasing managers' indices for the manufacturing sector are well below 50, indicating declining activity. According to Markit, a data firm, the global purchasing managers' index dropped to 51 in June from 51.3 in the previous month. 
The consensus has been that both the global economy and corporate profits will strengthen in the second half. If that doesn't turn out to be the case, equity markets could be vulnerable.

IN A crisis studded with missed deadlines, Sunday July 12th really could mark the denouement of the Greek debt drama. The leaders of the euro zone along with those of all the EU's 28 member countries will gather for a set of meetings in Brussels. If Alexis Tsipras, Greece's prime minister, can strike a deal with his creditors that day, his country will stay afloat inside the euro. If there is no such deal, Greece is heading inexorably towards the whirlpool of Grexit. Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council--a Pole not prone to hyperbole--calls it ""the most critical moment in the history of the EU"". 
All sides insist that their aim is not to eject Greece from the euro, but rather to find a way to keep it in. But the more honest European politicians admit that the likelihood of Grexit has never been higher. Betting now puts it at around 50%. Shockingly, for something so imminent, probable and with such dramatic consequences, there has been remarkably little public debate about how Greece would leave the euro. The best outcome for Europe would still be a deal on July 12th that keeps Greece in. But it is also time to make contingency plans for the sort of Grexit that does the least harm. 
Tsipras rows, again 
In principle, a deal between Greece and its creditors should not be hard. The reforms Mr Tsipras promises are tantalisingly close to those demanded by the other euro-zone countries and the IMF. No one, from Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor, to Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank (ECB), wants to be held responsible for pushing the Greeks out. The need for debt relief, the totemic issue for Mr Tsipras, is underscored by the IMF, and--privately, at least--acknowledged by most European politicians who can count. Rational self-interest should also push both sides towards a deal. Grexit will hit Greece's economy harder than staying in and it will cost the creditors a lot more money. If it leaves the euro, Greece will not just default on its loans from European governments but also its liabilities to the ECB. The total--EUR 340 billion ($375 billion) or more than 3% of euro-zone GDP--is far more than the relief needed to make Greece's debt burden sustainable. 
But rational actors would never have got this far. The Greek government's erratic behaviour--it arrived at a last-ditch meeting this week with old, handwritten proposals--and its inflammatory statements have generated the sort of ill-will that can make small obstacles insurmountable. Germany's attitude towards debt repayment has its roots in moralising sermons and an obsession with rules rather than economic self-interest. Political constraints bind, too. Mr Tsipras cannot shout defiance in Athens one week, and roll over in Brussels the next. If northern European taxpayers voted on whether to hand money to Greece without conditions, they would vote No, too. For all these reasons, the meeting on July 12th could well fail. 
What then? Greece will probably drift towards Grexit by default. Banks will stay closed. One member of the ECB governing council has said emergency liquidity will be cut off on July 13th. Without cash to pay wages and pensions, the Greek government will have to issue IOUs, which will quickly become an informal parallel currency, trading at a huge discount. From essential medicines to energy, there will be shortages of vital imports. A new currency will be introduced amid chaos. 
Some of that chaos can be avoided, but doing so will demand forward planning and generosity from the creditors, two virtues that have been in short supply. One task is to clarify the legal uncertainties. (Is Greece permanently out of the euro or just temporarily issuing IOUs? Can it remain in the EU if it is not in the euro?) The second is to ensure that an exiting Greece has both the policies to stabilise its economy and avoid high inflation and the cash to pay for critical imports. 
Pulled by the current 
Some Europeans suggest the legal tangles of Grexit can be avoided by pretending that Greece is not actually leaving. Wolfgang Schauble, Germany's finance minister, has spoken of a ""temporary"" Grexit. If the Europeans allowed the Greeks to issue scrip or temporarily to introduce an emergency parallel ""currency"", Greece might in effect suspend its membership of the single currency without technically leaving (see page 24). Such a non-Grexit exit would allow European politicians to put off pesky problems such as how to deal with the losses on the ECB's balance-sheet. Technically, it could also be reversed if Greece struck a deal with its creditors at a later date. 
This halfway house might buy time, but it cannot be a permanent solution. And the longer Greece lives with such a dual currency, the less likely it is to return to the euro. But even if the door to the euro zone closes, other doors need not. Greece should be allowed to stay in the EU. Domestic support for Mr Tsipras since his election in January has been animated above all by a sense that Greece's dignity has been trampled upon. The humiliation of Grexit would be compounded if Greece found itself cast out of the wider union as well. EU law is woolly on the subject, but preserving easy access to European markets for Greek exporters and visa-free access to Greece for European holidaymakers would be a huge boost to the post-lapsarian Greek economy. It would also enable EU funds for poorer regions to keep flowing and help prevent Greece from becoming a failed state on the EU's flank. 
To maximise its chances, Greece would need to match a euro exit with budget discipline and an independent central bank credibly targeting low inflation. Europe should provide humanitarian aid and balance-of-payments support for the fledgling drachma. This could either be direct (just as the EU helps Ukraine) or more creative--for instance, euro-zone states could put themselves at the back of the queue of Greece's creditors, helping the country tap private markets again. 
The irony is that the new lending and debt-forbearance by Europe needed to prevent Grexit from causing a catastrophe are the elements needed to keep Greece in the euro. Equally, a sundered Greece would have to resort to much the same austerity it is resisting. That is all the more reason for both sides to cut a deal. But it is no excuse to put off planning for the worst.","A deal between Greece and its creditors would be best . But if there has to be a Grexit , here is how to do it

LIKE most things deemed unthinkable, Greece's departure from the euro zone has been thought about a lot. Its open discussion at the highest levels of the European Union, though, has long remained taboo. The two weeks since June 26th, when Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister, abandoned talks with the EU and IMF on a further bail-out and called a referendum on their terms, have put paid to that. Most euro-zone leaders now believe Greece has no place in the euro. Even those genuinely supportive concede that things may not go their way; Francois Hollande, the French president, openly discussed Grexit at the euro-zone summit which took place in Brussels on July 7th. On the same day Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, announced that the commission has a fully realised plan for Grexit. 
Whether that plan will be put to use depends on discussions set for Sunday July 12th. Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, describes this as Greece's ""final deadline"". The leaders of the 19 euro-zone countries will discuss a list of reforms and cuts that Greece was due to present after The Economist went to press. That list is intended to convince Greece's euro-zone partners to begin negotiations on a new three-year bail-out. The same day will see a summit of all 28 European Union leaders at which preparations for Grexit will be discussed in earnest. The leaders will discuss post-Grexit humanitarian aid to be paid for out of the EU budget (it was as a net contributor to that budget that Britain insisted on all 28 being involved in the discussion). Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank (ECB), will explain measures for seeing off speculators looking to attack other weak links in the euro zone. Legal niceties aimed at allowing Greece to leave the euro zone without quitting the EU--an eventuality for which there is neither precedent nor protocol--may be discussed, too. 
During the brief referendum campaign Mr Tsipras urged Greek voters to reject the earlier bail-out terms, assuring them that a strong No vote would strengthen his bargaining position in Brussels. They duly gave him the No he wanted (see next story); but the creditors he had walked out on, and insulted during the campaign, were quietly planning to greet him on his return with a tougher line--and his rhetoric gave them a new stomach for Grexit if he did not toe it. 
At the July 7th meeting they made their position abundantly clear to Mr Tsipras on four counts. First, the short-term loans his government had sought would not be forthcoming in the absence of a full bail-out. Second, there could be no backtracking on commitments the Greeks had already made on issues such as pension reform and value-added tax. Third, reforms must come before any discussion on restructuring Greece's debt, which is now almost 180% of its GDP (the issue could be revisited in October, mused Mr Juncker). And finally, the third bail-out would involve fresh conditions in areas like product-market reform and collective-bargaining rules. 
To agree to this would cut against everything Mr Tsipras's government has done this year. But as the rest of the euro zone has been arguing repeatedly over the past weeks, Greek democracy does not enjoy priority over everyone else's, and the voters in many other countries are fed up with bailing Greece out. 
Should Mr Tsipras somehow find the stomach to submit reform proposals that the Europeans find credible, plenty more hurdles remain before any funds can be disbursed. A sum must be agreed on: one senior commission official puts it at up to EUR 100 billion ($111 billion), and notes that the figure rises every day as capital controls eat into Greece's economy. Greece would have to begin implementing some of its reforms. And several euro-zone parliaments would have to assent to a third bail-out. 
Greece's most vocal foes in recent weeks have been the euro zone's poorer members, such as Slovakia and Lithuania, who compare the Greek record on reform unfavourably with their own. Germany has been more restrained, exercising its responsibility as the euro zone's de facto leader. But a new deal would be highly unpopular there, both with the people and the politicians. 
The Bundestag would have to vote twice to pass a new bail-out: once, to authorise Angela Merkel, the chancellor, to negotiate it; again to ratify it. The Social Democrats, the junior partners in her government, would probably be willing to back her. The party has historically been supportive of Greece although its boss, Sigmar Gabriel, is one of those to have taken a much more hawkish line since Mr Tsipras called his referendum. Mrs Merkel's bigger problem is her own parliamentary group, consisting of the Christian Democratic Union and its more conservative Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union. Many in the CDU resented being cajoled into backing an extension to Greece's second bail-out in February. In recent weeks the chorus of CDU and CSU members calling for a Grexit has grown. Mrs Merkel will prevail in the votes, but she will be weakened and embarrassed in the process. Much depends on how enthusiastically her finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, helps her sell a deal in parliament. Mr Schauble sees the Greeks as an impediment to his dream of deepening integration among the other euro-zone members; in Athens he is the personification of German cruelty. 
The fundamental flaws 
However it ends, the Greek crisis has raised a number of awkward questions. The role of the ECB, which has been keeping Greece's banks alive, is one. Nicolas Veron, a senior fellow at the Bruegel think-tank, notes that the way in which the euro zone is governed puts the ECB in an ""impossible position"". The bank is the closest thing to a federal agency in the euro zone, and therefore carries much of the decision-making burden, particularly in times of crisis. But because there is no central political authority, every government wants a say. That exposes the ECB to political pressure, not least via its own governing council, which includes the central-bank governors of all 19 euro-zone countries. One day it faces accusations of meekly doing the creditors' bidding by turning the screws on the Greeks by limiting the banks' liquidity, causing them to close. The next it is accused of a leniency that comes close to violating its own prohibitions on monetary financing of states. 
A related, even deeper problem is an unavoidable part of a currency union not backed by a political one: democratic deficit. Greece's creditors are right that 18 members of the euro zone cannot be bound by the decisions of one. At the same time if Greece remains in the euro it will be because Mr Tsipras has had to capitulate entirely despite clear backing from his fellow citizens. At best, that will leave Greeks feeling more demoralised than ever, and probably more embittered. Conditions agreed to under duress may not be met; stereotypes of bloodsucking Germans and indolent Greeks may spread. ""It's starting to eat Europe,"" says a demoralised EU official. The sort of political imagination needed to help Europe's citizens see each other as the same sort of people involved in a common project has never been more necessary and less apparent. 
Such concerns will not soon be addressed; more immediate tasks are at hand as Greece is either bound back in to the euro zone in a way not to its liking or pushed out. Mr Tusk, for one, is worried about Grexit playing to Russia's advantage. And Mr Tsipras faces a grim dilemma: to betray the hope he stirred in the long-suffering Greek people, or to lead them to a devastating Grexit they do not want.","To stay in the euro zone , Alexis Tsipras's will have to jettison almost every promise Alexis Tsipras has made to Alexis Tsipras's own voters

IN SYNTAGMA Square, outside Greece's parliament, the No vote in the July 5th referendum was a cause for celebration--a moment of in-your-face triumph for voters fed up with five years of joblessness and powerlessness. ""Tsipras, we love you,"" they sang. ""We voted for a revolution for all the people of Europe,"" said an unemployed 24-year-old; ""We voted against broken dreams,"" said a fresh-faced student. 
The exhilaration was due, in part, to the unexpected size of the No majority, which at 61.3% was far higher than any poll had suggested. The margin differed according to age and political inclination (see chart) but the No campaign won in every region, including the conservative borderlands adjoining Bulgaria and Turkey. Only a handful of Athens's wealthiest enclaves, along with the shipowning island of Andros, fielded a majority for Yes. The defeat was so resounding that Antonis Samaras, one of a number of former prime ministers who urged a Yes vote, immediately resigned from his position as leader of the main opposition New Democracy party. 
This all added up to a personal triumph for Alexis Tsipras, prime minister and head of the left-wing Syriza group in parliament. But it was hardly one to savour. Mr Tsipras had promised the voters that a No would strengthen his hand in last-ditch negotiations with the European Union and IMF and that it would not entail the departure from the euro that more than 75% of Greeks wish to avoid. Without help he cannot honour either promise. 
Careful to avoid sounding triumphant, Mr Tsipras immediately made the conciliatory gesture of sacking Yanis Varoufakis, the finance minister whose hectoring tone and heightened rhetoric--he referred to the creditors as ""terrorists""--vexed and offended the euro-zone politicians who had to deal with him. Euclid Tsakalotos, a soft-spoken Oxford-trained economist who had earlier replaced Mr Varoufakis as negotiator with the EU and IMF, replaced him as finance minister, too. 
Hoping to rally the country's other political parties behind him Mr Tsipras called their leaders together. The meeting was sour in its mood; it took almost seven hours to hammer out a statement calling for a deal that would be socially fair, limit austerity to the minimum, include generous funding for growth and address the country's debt. ""We backed him not because we think the premier will necessarily pull off a deal but because if the worst happens we'd all go down together,"" said an MP from To Potami (The River), a centre-left party. 
If Mr Tsipras does get an agreement, though, it will not be one which meets the aspirations of that all-party statement. The rest of the euro zone is in no mood for compromise (see previous story); it wants a harsher deal than previously offered. The 40-year-old premier would have to acquiesce to tax increases and cuts in wages, pensions and spending he has long fought. 
Backing from the centrist opposition means that a new bail-out agreement would be able to pass a vote of approval in parliament, but it would probably split Syriza; the ensuing turmoil could force Mr Tsipras to resign and call an election. ""We're about to find out whether Tsipras has grown up enough to put country before party,"" said a former centre-left politician who helped steer Greece into the euro a decade and a half ago. 
If, instead, there is no bail-out and Grexit ensues, some analysts fear a level of social unrest that would drive Mr Tsipras to adopt authoritarian measures. Panos Kammenos, the defence minister, and leader of the small right-wing Independent Greeks party, Syriza's coalition partner, caused uproar last week when he said the army can always ""guarantee the country's internal security."" Others imagine Grexit would bring with it a government of national unity led by a non-political public figure. 
Meanwhile Greeks line up to withdraw the daily EUR 60, which is all their ATMs have allowed them since capital controls were imposed at the end of June and the banks partially closed. In practice, apparently due to a shortage of EUR 20 notes, many only get EUR 50. Old people wait outside the handful of banks allowed to open to pay pensions in temperatures well over 30[degrees]C. ""For a government that promises to protect pensioners, it's very disappointing,"" says Dimitris, a 76-year-old post-office worker who voted for Syriza in January but, having failed to get his full pension last week, voted Yes on the 5th. 
Despite the withdrawal limits, queues at ATMs stay long, and not just because they are hotbeds of gossip; Greeks recognise that a banknote has more lasting value than a line in a bank statement which can be redenominated into a new currency, or subjected to a ""haircut"", at any time. ""Everyone I know has a stash of cash under the bed,"" says Stamatia, a call-centre worker. One of the only businesses to have boomed in past months has been home-security and safe installation. 
One unexpected consequence of the desire to keep bank balances low enough to avoid any haircut is an uptick in electronic income-tax payments; although businesses prefer cash, the government can hardly be seen to do so. Dimitris Mardas, the deputy finance minister, says that this means the government may be able to pay civil servants their mid-month salary on July 13th, something which had previously seemed very unlikely. It is, though, the smallest and most temporary of silver linings. With liquidity assistance to the banks capped (see box) the ATMs will soon start running dry. A senior banker in Athens says debit cards and online banking cannot outlast the cash system by more than a few days, or a week at the outside.","The landslide for No felt good at the time 
 IN SYNTAGMA Square , outside Greece 's parliament , the No vote in the July 5th referendum was a cause for celebration -- a moment of in - your - face triumph for voters fed up with five years of joblessness and powerlessness . "" Alexis Tsipras , we love Alexis Tsipras , "" they sang . "" We voted for a revolution for all the people of Europe , "" said an unemployed 24 - year - old ; "" We voted against broken dreams , "" said a fresh - faced student . 
 The exhilaration was due , in part , to the unexpected size of the No majority , which at 61.3 % was far higher than any poll had suggested . The margin differed according to age and political inclination ( see chart ) but the No campaign won in every region , including the conservative borderlands adjoining Bulgaria and Turkey . Only a handful of Athens 's wealthiest enclaves , along with the shipowning island of Andros , fielded a majority for Yes . The defeat was so resounding that Antonis Samaras , one of a number of former prime ministers who urged a Yes vote , immediately resigned from his position as leader of the main opposition New Democracy party . 
 This all added up to a personal triumph for Alexis Tsipras . But it was hardly one to savour . Alexis Tsipras had promised the voters that a No would strengthen Alexis Tsipras's hand in last - ditch negotiations with the European Union and IMF and that it would not entail the departure from the euro that more than 75 % of Greeks wish to avoid .

As the week progressed, more memberships were cancelled, and the faction around Mr Lucke was debating whether to found a new political group.

""WE HAVE an a-Greek-ment,"" declared Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, on the morning of July 13th. Mr Tusk's little joke seemed forgivable at the time: after talking through the night, euro-zone leaders had thrashed out a deal that averted Greece's imminent exit from the single currency. The reality is grimmer. A decent deal would have put Greece on the path to sustainable growth and taken the prospect of Grexit off the table. Instead, Europe has cooked up the same old recipe of austerity and implausible assumptions. The IMF is supposed to be financing part of the bail-out. Even it thinks the deal makes no sense. 
True, some ideas are useful. In exchange for talks on a package estimated at EUR 82 billion-86 billion ($90 billion-94 billion), the creditors have put structural reforms higher up the agenda than in the two previous bail-outs. That is welcome: opening closed-shop industries to competition is a surer path to growth than austerity is. But even if they are carried out, structural reforms take a long time to pay off. In the meantime, the Greek economy is suffocating because of bank closures and capital controls. The agreement does too little to ease this chokehold. 
The creditors are concocting a bridge-financing package designed to prevent Greece from defaulting to the European Central Bank (ECB) on July 20th. But money will not flow until reforms have gone through the Greek parliament (a first batch was passed on July 15th) and the details of the bail-out are settled. Money will also be made available to recapitalise the banks, but the extent of their capital shortfall will only be clear after the summer. The ECB can meanwhile keep the banks afloat with emergency financing, but capital controls will remain. Given the possibility that losses will be imposed on creditors, the incentives to put money into Greek banks are non-existent. The IMF increased its estimate of Greece's financing needs by EUR 25 billion after only two weeks of banking limbo; as today's misery drags on, the hole will deepen. 
Even now, there is a huge financing gap to fill. One hope is privatisation: the agreement requires Greece to transfer assets to an independent fund that will generate EUR 50 billion by selling them off. Fat chance. Over the past five years Greece's government has managed to raise a grand total of just EUR 3 billion from asset sales. 
In another triumph of wishful thinking, the deal also reckons Greece can soon borrow in private markets. Although previous bail-outs have greatly reduced the burden of interest payments to euro-zone creditors, which start only after 2020, Greece's debt stock is now projected to peak at 200% of GDP. No private creditor is going to lend money to Greece at reasonable rates when its debt load is unsustainable. The only option--one that has, miraculously, united Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister, and the IMF--is debt relief. Yet the euro zone has ruled out forgiving any debt outright, and put off the decision of whether to extend maturities for another day. 
That leaves the old standby of austerity. Among the initial measures passed by the Greek parliament on July 15th was one leading to ""quasi-automatic spending cuts"" in the event of shortfalls in Greece's budget targets. If those cuts were ever enacted, they would only harm the economy further. The politics are little better. Marshalling ongoing domestic support for the bail-out in Greece, with his own left-wing Syriza MPs in revolt, will be an enormous problem for Mr Tsipras (see page 31). Years more hardship will only radicalise a country that is already a haven for the hard left and the fascist right. 
The hokey-cokey currency 
If Greece trips up, whether in the coming days or quarters, Grexit will immediately hove back into view. This week Mr Tsipras saw what a strong negotiating position really looks like, as Germany's irascible finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, openly dangled plans for a temporary Grexit. That idea was excised from the final agreement, but too late. Germany's unshakable commitment to the irrevocability of the single currency has gone and it cannot be reinvented. Greece must toe the line, or get out. The summit made it clear that Greek membership of the euro is transactional and contingent. 
Plenty have called the agreement a coup d'etat; Mr Tsipras himself talks of having had a knife at his throat. That conveniently ignores his own culpability in sowing mistrust among the other 18 euro-zone members: his decision to break off negotiations and call a referendum earlier this month squandered any political capital he had left in Brussels. 
The summit has deepened the tension between sovereignty and stability that bedevils the euro. If it is to work, the euro zone requires more fiscal centralisation. But the Greek referendum and this week's deal have laid bare the trade-offs involved, away from national self-determination and towards more intrusive external control. Saving Greece is hard enough; securing the euro will be tougher still.","A deal between Greece and Europe averts one disaster , and hastens the next

In exchange for talks on a package estimated at EUR 82 billion-86 billion ( $ 90 billion-94 billion ) , the creditors have put structural reforms higher up the agenda than in the two previous bail - outs . That is welcome : opening closed - shop industries to competition is a surer path to growth than austerity is . But even if they are carried out , structural reforms take a long time to pay off . In the meantime , the Greek economy is suffocating because of bank closures and capital controls . The agreement does too little to ease this chokehold . 
 The creditors are concocting a bridge - financing package designed to prevent Greece from defaulting to the European Central Bank ( ECB ) on July 20th . But money will not flow until reforms have gone through the Greek parliament ( a first batch was passed on July 15th ) and the details of the bail - out are settled . Money will also be made available to recapitalise the banks , but the extent of their capital shortfall will only be clear after the summer . The ECB can meanwhile keep the banks afloat with emergency financing , but capital controls will remain . Given the possibility that losses will be imposed on creditors , the incentives to put money into Greek banks are non - existent . The IMF increased its estimate of Greece 's financing needs by EUR 25 billion after only two weeks of banking limbo ; as today 's misery drags on , the hole will deepen . 
 Even now , there is a huge financing gap to fill . One hope is privatisation : the agreement requires Greece to transfer assets to an independent fund that will generate EUR 50 billion by selling them off . Fat chance . Over the past five years Greece 's government has managed to raise a grand total of just EUR 3 billion from asset sales . 
 In another triumph of wishful thinking , the deal also reckons Greece can soon borrow in private markets . Although previous bail - outs have greatly reduced the burden of interest payments to euro - zone creditors , which start only after 2020 , Greece 's debt stock is now projected to peak at 200 % of GDP . No private creditor is going to lend money to Greece at reasonable rates when its debt load is unsustainable . The only option -- one that has , miraculously , united Alexis Tsipras , and the IMF -- is debt relief . Yet the euro zone has ruled out forgiving any debt outright , and put off the decision of whether to extend maturities for another day . 
 That leaves the old standby of austerity . Among the initial measures passed by the Greek parliament on July 15th was one leading to "" quasi - automatic spending cuts "" in the event of shortfalls in Greece 's budget targets . If those cuts were ever enacted , they would only harm the economy further . The politics are little better . Marshalling ongoing domestic support for the bail - out in Greece , with Alexis Tsipras's own left - wing Syriza MPs in revolt , will be an enormous problem for Alexis Tsipras ( see page 31 ) . Years more hardship will only radicalise a country that is already a haven for the hard left and the fascist right . 
 The hokey - cokey currency 
 If Greece trips up , whether in the coming days or quarters , Grexit will immediately hove back into view . This week Alexis Tsipras saw what a strong negotiating position really looks like , as Germany 's irascible finance minister , Wolfgang Schauble , openly dangled plans for a temporary Grexit . That idea was excised from the final agreement , but too late . Germany 's unshakable commitment to the irrevocability of the single currency has gone and it can not be reinvented . Greece must toe the line , or get out . The summit made it clear that Greek membership of the euro is transactional and contingent . 
 Plenty have called the agreement a coup d'etat ; Alexis Tsipras talks of having had a knife at Alexis Tsipras's throat . That conveniently ignores Alexis Tsipras's own culpability in sowing mistrust among the other 18 euro - zone members : Alexis Tsipras's decision to break off negotiations and call a referendum earlier this month squandered any political capital Alexis Tsipras had left in Brussels . 
 The summit has deepened the tension between sovereignty and stability that bedevils the euro . If it is to work , the euro zone requires more fiscal centralisation . But the Greek referendum and this week 's deal have laid bare the trade - offs involved , away from national self - determination and towards more intrusive external control . Saving Greece is hard enough ; securing the euro will be tougher still .",350,Greece,cb-350-3,IN TERM,True,"Alexis Tsipras , the Greek prime minister",9,True

THE late Carlos Fuentes, a Mexican writer, compared the exercise of mutual influence between Spain and its former colonies to ""a mirror: looking from the Americas to the Mediterranean, and back"". Those transatlantic reflections continue--and reach far across Mare Nostrum--in ways that would have seemed surprising only a few years ago. 
Seen from Latin America, the agonies of the euro zone arouse a sickening sense of deja vu. The limits on withdrawals from Greek banks mimic the corralito (""little fence"") imposed by Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's finance minister in 2001, in a doomed attempt to preserve his country's currency board, which pegged the peso at par to the dollar for a decade. 
Argentina is Exhibit A for those who argue that Greece would be better off outside the euro. Denunciations of austerity and the IMF by Alexis Tsipras, Greece's prime minister, and his far-left Syriza party attract the sympathy of Latin America's leftist-populist leaders. Yet the parallel is somewhat misleading: Argentina recovered strongly from 2003 onwards not just because it defaulted and devalued but because world prices for its farm exports surged. And Greece has swallowed vast lumps of concessional credit provided by Europe's taxpayers, not usurious loans from the financial markets. Mr Tsipras's last-minute deal suggests he realises that Greece is not Argentina. 
Less remarked is the political inspiration that Europe's new far-left movements derive from Latin America. Mr Tsipras's recourse to a referendum to shore up his domestic support echoes the tactics of Venezuela's late Hugo Chavez, who called six in 14 years in power. So does the overblown claim that Greece is the victim of a ""coup"", the agitprop device that chavismo uses to disqualify all opposition. 
In the case of Podemos, Spain's would-be Syriza, the links with chavismo were much closer, though recently downplayed by both sides. A foundation linked to its leaders received EUR 5.2m ($5.7m) over the 12 years to 2014 from the governments of Venezuela and Ecuador, according to ABC, a Spanish newspaper. ""We've seen enormous parallels,"" Pablo Iglesias, Podemos's leader, told Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, last year. ""We will seek your advice on many things."" Mr Iglesias is also a fan of Ernesto Laclau, an Argentine theorist of radical populism who died last year. 
On both sides of the Atlantic, economic and political chaos brought populists to power. In Argentina it was the austerity of ""internal devaluation"" to restore export competitiveness under Mr Cavallo that eventually led to the presidency of Cristina Fernandez. In Venezuela a stable two-party system was brought down by the collapse of the oil price in the late 1980s, and the corruption this exposed. Mr Correa's rise followed the implosion of Ecuador's political parties and its currency. Likewise, the exhaustion of Greece's two-party system brought Mr Tsipras to power. Mr Iglesias, with his denunciation of la casta (the political caste of the two main parties) is counting on something similar in Spain. 
Time was when the southern European left gave Latin America advice on democracy. The demise of the Franco dictatorship in Spain helped to inspire a wave of democratisation in Latin America. In Mexico in 1991, Bello recalls listening to an eloquent plea from Felipe Gonzalez, then Spain's socialist prime minister, for the Latin American left to abandon revolution and embrace democracy. 
In June Mr Gonzalez was back in the region to support two opposition politicians jailed in Venezuela. At a press conference on his return, he was questioned about the implications of Podemos. ""In Spain the regime will not be liquidated by some kind of alternative adventure,"" he declared. 
That is a reasonable bet. For all their problems Europe's political systems are still more robust than many of those in Latin America. Thanks to Spain's economic recovery and a new centrist rival, Podemos's appeal has probably peaked. Unlike Chavez, Mr Tsipras shows no sign of using a Rousseauesque appeal to ""the popular will"" in referendums as a justification for gutting democratic institutions. 
Latin America shows that Europe's leaders cannot afford to be complacent, especially with regard to political corruption. But for all its failures the European Union provides an exoskeleton of institutions, and shows a commitment to democratic norms, that Latin America lacks. Time and fiscal irresponsibility are taking their toll on Latin America's far-left regimes. If anyone in Europe needs reminding, the likes of Venezuela--with its slump, hyperinflation and repression--prove that populism is a poor remedy for the diseases of austerity and corruption.","Populist parallels between Europe and Latin America

THE risk of a chaotic Grexit was averted by the morning of July 13th. But the rest of Europe exacted a price from Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister. To have a chance of a third bail-out, Greece must meet strict terms. And, even if it does, and a three-year programme providing financing of as much as EUR 86 billion ($94 billion) is concluded this summer, many wonder if the deal will really help the country stand on its own feet. 
Much depends upon how resilient Greece is after the turmoil of the past month, and the self-harm of early 2015. It has slipped back to a mostly cash economy, with capital controls and shuttered banks. Even before these setbacks, a recovery in the first nine months of 2014 had turned to recession in the final quarter of 2014 and first quarter of 2015. Credit to the private sector dried up as banks faced a drain of deposits, forcing them to rely on ""emergency liquidity assistance"" (ELA), nominally from the Bank of Greece but controlled by the European Central Bank (ECB). 
To jump-start any growth, banks must reopen and start offering trade credits, needed for vital imports. That will require the ECB to raise the cap on ELA, which was fixed at EUR 89 billion on June 28th, soon after Mr Tsipras called his referendum. Some Greek bankers hoped this would happen within a day of parliament accepting the new deal's basic terms; others thought relief might be delayed until July 20th, when the Greek government is due to redeem debt held by the ECB; it must pay EUR 3.5 billion, plus interest of EUR 700m. If the bridge financing needed for this payment is provided (probably through a fund backed by the whole EU) it will be easier for the ECB to raise the ELA cap. 
Even if this all happens, reopened banks will not work normally. Strict capital controls will stay in place to stop a further flight of money out of Greece; the cash that depositors can take from their accounts will remain limited, probably still at EUR 60 a day. The banks have been recapitalised once, after the restructuring of Greek government debt (held privately) in 2012; now they must bolster their capital again, given the poor state of their business clients. 
Until this recapitalisation exercise, involving stress tests, is done in September, Greek depositors will be wary of returning cash into their accounts for fear that they might be ""bailed-in"" to meet a capital shortfall. This is what happened to big depositors in Cyprus (notably Russians) two years ago. In fact that is unlikely now because the money affected would be working capital held by small Greek firms, the economy's mainstay. Moreover, the July 13th deal also provides EUR 10 billion-25 billion to help recapitalise the banks. 
It will take time for confidence to return to the banks and depositors; that means capital controls will remain in place for a long time. In Cyprus they were not fully lifted for two years. Meanwhile Greece faces a fresh dose of austerity, for example through the rise in VAT, which will raise 1% of GDP. The euro summit did not specify precise budgetary targets for this year and next, but in previous talks creditors had stipulated a surplus on the primary budget of 1% of GDP this year and 2% next year. Gikas Hardouvelis, a former Greek finance minister, says that unless these targets are softened (accepting a deficit this year) the deal will weaken a frail economy. 
The structural reforms set out in the accord should help in the longer term. The biggest change is to the pension system, whose vagaries were a huge cause of financial instability, notes Platon Tinios of Piraeus University. First, with immediate effect, minimum pensions will be payable only at 67, the statutory retirement age. Second, many loopholes that let people retire early will close. By 2023 almost all people will be eligible to retire at the earliest at 62 with payments actuarially reduced from the amount they would get at 67, unless they have contributed for 40 years. 
The accord expects EUR 50 billion to come from privatisations, managed by an independent fund. A similar goal was set by the Greek government in 2011; it never came close. The IMF says only EUR 3 billion has been raised in the past five years. 
Anyway, privatisation proceeds will hardly dent Greece's total debt which the IMF now expects to peak at almost 200% of GDP. Although the actual burden is much lower because of various forms of relief, such as long maturities, Greece's debts will clearly never be repaid in full. The IMF said this week that its burden could be made sustainable only through steps ""that go far beyond what Europe has been willing to consider so far"". But the deal of July 13th only allows a stretching of maturities, not outright debt forgiveness. That alone casts a shadow over the new plan.","Term set by Greece 's creditors raise more questions than answers 
 THE risk of a chaotic Grexit was averted by the morning of July 13th . But the rest of Europe exacted a price from Alexis Tsipras . To have a chance of a third bail - out , Greece must meet strict terms . And , even if it does , and a three - year programme providing financing of as much as EUR 86 billion ( $ 94 billion ) is concluded this summer , many wonder if the deal will really help the country stand on its own feet . 
 Much depends upon how resilient Greece is after the turmoil of the past month , and the self - harm of early 2015 . It has slipped back to a mostly cash economy , with capital controls and shuttered banks . Even before these setbacks , a recovery in the first nine months of 2014 had turned to recession in the final quarter of 2014 and first quarter of 2015 . Credit to the private sector dried up as banks faced a drain of deposits , forcing them to rely on "" emergency liquidity assistance "" ( ELA ) , nominally from the Bank of Greece but controlled by the European Central Bank ( ECB ) . 
 To jump - start any growth , banks must reopen and start offering trade credits , needed for vital imports . That will require the ECB to raise the cap on ELA , which was fixed at EUR 89 billion on June 28th , soon after Alexis Tsipras called Alexis Tsipras's referendum . Some Greek bankers hoped this would happen within a day of parliament accepting the new deal 's basic terms ; others thought relief might be delayed until July 20th , when the Greek government is due to redeem debt held by the ECB ; it must pay EUR 3.5 billion , plus interest of EUR 700 m. If the bridge financing needed for this payment is provided ( probably through a fund backed by the whole EU ) it will be easier for the ECB to raise the ELA cap . 
 Even if this all happens , reopened banks will not work normally . Strict capital controls will stay in place to stop a further flight of money out of Greece ; the cash that depositors can take from their accounts will remain limited , probably still at EUR 60 a day . The banks have been recapitalised once , after the restructuring of Greek government debt ( held privately ) in 2012 ; now they must bolster their capital again , given the poor state of their business clients . 
 Until this recapitalisation exercise , involving stress tests , is done in September , Greek depositors will be wary of returning cash into their accounts for fear that they might be "" bailed - in "" to meet a capital shortfall . This is what happened to big depositors in Cyprus ( notably Russians ) two years ago . In fact that is unlikely now because the money affected would be working capital held by small Greek firms , the economy 's mainstay . Moreover , the July 13th deal also provides EUR 10 billion-25 billion to help recapitalise the banks . 
 It will take time for confidence to return to the banks and depositors ; that means capital controls will remain in place for a long time . In Cyprus they were not fully lifted for two years . Meanwhile Greece faces a fresh dose of austerity , for example through the rise in VAT , which will raise 1 % of GDP . The euro summit did not specify precise budgetary targets for this year and next , but in previous talks creditors had stipulated a surplus on the primary budget of 1 % of GDP this year and 2 % next year . Gikas Hardouvelis , a former Greek finance minister , says that unless these targets are softened ( accepting a deficit this year ) the deal will weaken a frail economy . 
 The structural reforms set out in the accord should help in the longer term . The biggest change is to the pension system , whose vagaries were a huge cause of financial instability , notes Platon Tinios of Piraeus University . First , with immediate effect , minimum pensions will be payable only at 67 , the statutory retirement age . Second , many loopholes that let people retire early will close .

UNRAVELLING the tangled logic of Greece's bail-out talks, Charlemagne has learned, is a little like trying to explain the rules of cricket to an American. How to make sense of a process in which Greek voters loudly spurn a euro-zone bail-out offer in a referendum, only to watch Alexis Tsipras, their prime minister, immediately seek a worse deal that is flatly rejected by the euro zone, which in turn presses a yet more stringent proposal to which Mr Tsipras humbly assents? Better, perhaps, not to try. 
After six months of this nonsense, little wonder everyone is depressed. The immediate danger of Grexit has at least been averted, after Mr Tsipras and his fellow euro-zone heads of government pulled a brutal all-nighter in Brussels this week. But it comes at the price of a vast taxpayer-funded bail-out for Greece, worth up to EUR 86 billion ($94 billion) over three years, and a humiliating capitulation by Mr Tsipras. Greece's economy is in tatters, its creditors are fuming and Europe's institutions are in despair. Much to Britain's disgust even non-euro countries have been sucked into the nightmare: a bridge loan designed to keep Greece afloat while the bail-out talks proceed looks set to tap a fund to which all EU countries have contributed. 
But wasn't this week's agreement a triumph for the shock troops of austerity? Hardly. Finland's coalition, formed only two months ago, tottered at the prospect of funding a third Greek bail-out. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, has admitted that it would violate an election pledge he made in 2012. One euro-zone diplomat says that 99% of her compatriots would say ""no"" to the bail-out if offered a Greece-style referendum. Even Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor and Mr Tsipras's chief tormentor, is damaged. The deal, crafted largely by Mrs Merkel, Mr Tsipras and Francois Hollande, France's president, has exposed the German chancellor to competing charges: of cruelty abroad and of leniency at home, notably among Germany's increasingly irritable parliamentarians, who must vote twice on the Greek package. 
Europe's single currency, designed to foster unity and ease trade between its members, has thus become a ruthless generator of misery for almost all of them. That is why hardly anyone has a good word to say about the new agreement. In private, officials acknowledge that the best to be said for it is that it kept Greece inside the euro. Some would not go even that far. On July 14th, one day after the euro summit, Wolfgang Schauble, Germany's bristly finance chief, declared that many of his colleagues in Berlin thought Greece would be better off leaving the euro than submitting to its demands. (He did not need to add that he shares that belief.) That evening Mr Tsipras admitted that the deal he had signed was terrible for Greece, but said that he was left with no choice if he wanted to avoid a return to the drachma. This gives the lie to the second sentence of the agreement, which states that ""ownership by the Greek authorities is key"". 
Several more fantasies emerge over the course of its seven pages. In order merely to earn the right to begin bail-out talks, the Greek government, which took office promising to end austerity and restore the nation's battered dignity, must implement an epic list of reforms, from an overhaul of its civil-justice code to the rules governing its bakeries. Some, like a ""depoliticisation"" of the public administration, have eluded every government since Greece won freedom from the Ottomans in 1832. As the IMF pointed out this week, Greece's creditors assume it can catapult itself from the lowest to among the highest productivity-growth and labour-force-participation rates in the euro zone. 
That Mr Tsipras has been obliged to submit so cravenly is largely his own fault. Since taking office his preening government has vaporised the bonds of trust on which a currency union without a central authority must rely. But Europe's hopes for bailed-out Greece now rest in a prime minister who has built his career opposing its bail-out philosophy. If Mr Tsipras does secure his rescue package, its regular reviews will be tortuous affairs. No one in a position of authority, it seems, has any better ideas. 
The frustration with Greece is at its most intense in Mr Schauble's finance ministry, which last weekend floated the idea of a temporary Grexit. The proposal, which made its way into a draft euro-zone finance ministers' document, was quickly scotched at the leaders' euro summit; because a deal was struck, say officials, the doomsday option was not needed. But the foreign tutelage enshrined in the published document hardly represents a shining vision for Greece's future. This newspaper has always opposed a Greek departure from the euro because of the economic shock it would bring and the political chaos that could follow. But faced with a programme that infantilises Greek citizens, endlessly saps its creditors' energies and offers little hope of improvement, it is easy to see why some are tempted by the alternative. 
Give Greece a chance 
Can anything be salvaged from the wreckage? Perhaps. The boost to confidence that should follow the removal of the Grexit risk might counter the recessionary impact of the agreement's austerity. Mr Tsipras might use his domestic authority constructively, starting by rebuilding his relations with the euro zone and attacking vested interests at home. As for his fellow leaders, having yanked Greece back from the abyss at great cost, they will be keen to make the deal work. They could offer Greece a slightly easier fiscal path than under previous agreements. Following the entreaties of the IMF, they might even make good on their vague pledges of debt relief, though that will be a hard sell. 
Yet Charlemagne confesses to pessimism. Interviewed after he signed the deal, Mr Tsipras spoke darkly of an ideological ""clash"" within Europe that ""will become more obvious over time"". Other ministers in his government have been freer with their military metaphors. The euro zone's war with Greece has been traumatic enough. The peace could be harder still.","Built to foster friendship , the euro is manufacturing misery instead

""FRANCE is only really herself if she is in the lead,"" wrote the founder of the modern republic, Charles de Gaulle. For the current French president, Francois Hollande, leadership abroad has involved a steep learning curve: before taking office in 2012, he ran the provincial council of rural Correze. Yet in power Mr Hollande has shown a rather steadier hand in conducting foreign affairs than he has displayed running his own country. 
His activity abroad reaches wide. This week he was busy in Paris gathering support for a climate conference, to be hosted by France in December, which he hopes will lead to a binding accord on carbon emissions. His foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, held a particularly firm line during six-country talks with Iran, which resulted in a nuclear deal on July 14th. It was a French idea, for instance, to create a ""snapback"" mechanism allowing sanctions to be reimposed automatically if Iran breaks its word. Now the French are capitalising on the deal. Mr Fabius will fly to Tehran to meet President Hassan Rohani on July 29th--although, to the dismay of eager French business types hoping for a seat on the plane, this is to be a political trip only. 
There has been no such bashfulness in France's dealings in the Gulf. Where America has lost favour because Barack Obama was talking to Iran, France has quietly stepped in. Mr Hollande has jetted off four times to Saudi Arabia since his election, most recently in May when he was the first foreign guest for many years at a Gulf leaders' summit. The French are beginning to see a commercial pay-off. Before seeing the Saudis, Mr Hollande sold Qatar a squadron of Rafale jets, built by France's Dassault, worth EUR 6.3 billion ($7 billion). It was the third Rafale export deal on his watch. Hopes of commerce also underpinned his trips to Cuba in May and Angola in July. 
Even the Greek economy's near-death experience could be seen as a victory for Mr Hollande. While Germany's finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, favoured a Greek exit from the euro zone, Mr Hollande had only one aim: to keep Greece in the currency area. As a co-creator of that currency, France had a founder's interest in its health, as well as worries about its own vulnerability to unstable bond markets should the zone break up. Mr Hollande sent French finance-ministry officials to help Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister, draft reform proposals, and acted as a go-between in talks with a sceptical Germany. ""France, in these negotiations, ensured that it was Europe that emerged victorious,"" Mr Hollande gloated afterwards. 
Mr Hollande may be a lesser player than Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor, in dealings with Russia over Ukraine. But his belated suspension of war-ship sales to Russia was an important signal. 
And France, with Britain, remains one of Europe's only two weighty military powers, each spending roughly 2% of GDP on defence, the target set by NATO. Indeed France recently aborted a planned four-year freeze of military spending, adding EUR 3.8 billion in real terms to its defence budget from 2016, to reinforce its counter-terrorism capability. And France uses its firepower. Mr Hollande has sent soldiers to repel jihadists in Mali, and to stop genocide in the Central African Republic. Before America pulled back, France had fighter jets ready to bomb Syria in 2013. As one foreign observer puts it, the French now have a rare mix of armed muscle and readiness for action. France held off from the 2003 assault on Iraq, so the public has not turned against such ventures. It has soldiers in Africa and the Gulf, and the president has the constitutional power to deploy them. 
The mystery is how poorly Mr Hollande manages to project himself as a force in diplomacy. The big French role in the Iran talks largely got lost from view, at least outside France. And Mr Hollande's attempt to flag it up, during an interview on Bastille Day, came across as fanciful. Military matters aside, Mrs Merkel is the public face of Europe in Washington, DC, and the main external actor in Greece's drama. 
Part of the explanation is temperament. Nicolas Sarkozy, Mr Hollande's predecessor, used look-at-me hyperactivity to disguise France's weakening role within the Franco-German axis. By contrast, Mr Hollande's consensus-seeking instincts and unassuming presence seldom command attention. His grand proposals for further integrating the euro zone, announced on July 19th, went largely unnoticed. 
Perhaps most importantly, Mr Hollande's activity abroad is overshadowed by a poor economic record at home. After near-zero growth for the past three years, French GDP is expected to increase by just 1.1% this year. This raises longer-term questions about how far France can sustain its robust internationalism. More immediately, it explains why Mr Hollande has failed to translate foreign feats into poll numbers. 
Elected to tax the rich and create jobs, Mr Hollande quickly discarded his 75% top income-tax rate; and unemployment remains stuck at over 10%. The austerity he vowed to end in Europe is now being applied, with his consent, to Greece. ""He has not only lost authority but there is a sort of indifference towards him,"" says Laurent Bouvet of the University of Versailles. Mr Schauble's tough line is approved by 70% of his compatriots. By contrast, Mr Hollande languishes at 19%, worse than any other modern French president three years into a first term. Even de Gaulle, who was finally disowned by the French, never saw his second-term rating dip below 52%. He was revered by some citizens, hated by others; many seem unmoved by Mr Hollande, whatever his global mission.","The more Francois Hollande does on the world stage, the less he excites his voters 
""FRANCE is only really herself if she is in the lead,"" wrote the founder of the modern republic, Charles de Gaulle. For the current French president, Francois Hollande, leadership abroad has involved a steep learning curve: before taking office in 2012, he ran the provincial council of rural Correze. Yet in power Mr Hollande has shown a rather steadier hand in conducting foreign affairs than he has displayed running his own country. 
His activity abroad reaches wide. This week he was busy in Paris gathering support for a climate conference, to be hosted by France in December, which he hopes will lead to a binding accord on carbon emissions. His foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, held a particularly firm line during six-country talks with Iran, which resulted in a nuclear deal on July 14th. It was a French idea, for instance, to create a ""snapback"" mechanism allowing sanctions to be reimposed automatically if Iran breaks its word. Now the French are capitalising on the deal. Mr Fabius will fly to Tehran to meet President Hassan Rohani on July 29th--although, to the dismay of eager French business types hoping for a seat on the plane, this is to be a political trip only. 
There has been no such bashfulness in France's dealings in the Gulf. Where America has lost favour because Barack Obama was talking to Iran, France has quietly stepped in. Mr Hollande has jetted off four times to Saudi Arabia since his election, most recently in May when he was the first foreign guest for many years at a Gulf leaders' summit. The French are beginning to see a commercial pay-off. Before seeing the Saudis, Mr Hollande sold Qatar a squadron of Rafale jets, built by France's Dassault, worth EUR 6.3 billion ($7 billion). It was the third Rafale export deal on his watch. Hopes of commerce also underpinned his trips to Cuba in May and Angola in July. 
Even the Greek economy's near-death experience could be seen as a victory for Mr Hollande. While Germany's finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, favoured a Greek exit from the euro zone, Mr Hollande had only one aim: to keep Greece in the currency area. As a co-creator of that currency, France had a founder's interest in its health, as well as worries about its own vulnerability to unstable bond markets should the zone break up. Mr Hollande sent French finance-ministry officials to help Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister, draft reform proposals, and acted as a go-between in talks with a sceptical Germany. ""France, in these negotiations, ensured that it was Europe that emerged victorious,"" Mr Hollande gloated afterwards. 
Mr Hollande may be a lesser player than Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor, in dealings with Russia over Ukraine. But his belated suspension of war-ship sales to Russia was an important signal. 
And France, with Britain, remains one of Europe's only two weighty military powers, each spending roughly 2% of GDP on defence, the target set by NATO. Indeed France recently aborted a planned four-year freeze of military spending, adding EUR 3.8 billion in real terms to its defence budget from 2016, to reinforce its counter-terrorism capability. And France uses its firepower. Mr Hollande has sent soldiers to repel jihadists in Mali, and to stop genocide in the Central African Republic. Before America pulled back, France had fighter jets ready to bomb Syria in 2013. As one foreign observer puts it, the French now have a rare mix of armed muscle and readiness for action. France held off from the 2003 assault on Iraq, so the public has not turned against such ventures. It has soldiers in Africa and the Gulf, and the president has the constitutional power to deploy them.

Chaka Fattah, a Democratic congressman from Philadelphia, was indicted on 29 charges of racketeering, bribery and fraud.

Peru's army freed 39 people apparently enslaved by the Shining Path, a communist rebel group that caused mayhem during the 1980s but has faded in importance. The government said the captives had been held in a ""production camp"", where children farmed and women bred new insurgents. Some of them had been kidnapped 30 years ago. 
Colombia's president, Juan Manuel Santos, ordered a suspension of air strikes against camps used by the FARC, a leftist rebel army. This was in response to a declaration of a month-long ceasefire by the FARC. Both made similar commitments some months ago, but they broke down when violence flared in April. The de-escalation should help the FARC and the government make progress in peace talks that are taking place in Havana.

JUST one month ago Greece was on the verge of leaving the euro. Germany had raised the prospect of a ""time out"" lasting at least five years, following a breakdown in trust between euro-zone countries and the Greek government. Even when an acrimonious weekend summit in Brussels ended on July 13th with a tentative plan for a third bail-out, providing up to EUR 86 billion ($96 billion) over three years in return for further austerity and reforms, there was widespread pessimism about whether a more detailed agreement could really be reached. Yet on August 11th the Greek government settled the specific conditions of the rescue with the four institutions representing the interests of creditors: the European Commission, the European Central Bank (ECB), the IMF and the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), a rescue fund for the euro zone. 
The new proposals were due to be passed into law by the Greek parliament on August 13th, after The Economist had gone to press. The hope among Greek officials was that euro-zone finance ministers would endorse the deal the following day. That could in turn pave the way for a release of funds from the ESM in time for the Greek government to redeem bonds held by the ECB worth EUR 3.2 billion when they mature on August 20th. 
This timetable may yet prove too optimistic. The agreement will still have to be ratified by several euro-zone parliaments, including the German Bundestag. Despite the surprisingly swift progress in the negotiations, the German government has struck a cautious tone, arguing that thoroughness is more important than speed. If Germany drags its heels, Greece may need a second emergency loan from a rescue fund backed by the whole of the European Union in order to repay the ECB (it received a first one in mid-July to clear arrears with the IMF and repay another lot of bonds held by the ECB). The question of relieving some of Greece's huge public debt, to be addressed once the bail-out has been agreed, is another potential pitfall: the IMF has made clear it requires European concessions on this point if it is to join the bail-out later this year. 
In order to get this far, Greece has already had to legislate two sets of reforms in the past month. These have raised VAT and made minimum pensions payable only at the age of 67. A European directive on dealing with failing banks has been adopted and the independence of the national statistics agency has been reinforced. Judicial delays are also to be tackled. 
This week's agreement includes steps to liberalise markets, especially energy. Tax administration is to be overhauled with tougher procedures to deal with taxpayers who are in arrears. A new privatisation fund is being set up, with the objective of eventually raising EUR 50 billion, of which half will go to recapitalise Greek banks, a quarter to pay down debt and the remaining quarter to investment. Privatisation is expected to raise up to EUR 6.4 billion between 2015 and 2017, an ambitious target given that Greece has managed to raise only EUR 3 billion in the past five years. 
Important though such structural reforms may be in improving Greece's long-term prospects, what matters in the short term is healing a traumatised economy that has slipped back into recession and is fettered by capital controls. One encouraging sign is that the creditors have not imposed overly harsh fiscal targets for this year and next. Greece is expected to run a primary deficit (ie, excluding interest payments) of 0.25% of GDP in 2015 and a surplus of 0.5% in 2016. Another helpful development is an acceptance on the part of euro-zone creditors that attempts to impose a ""bail-in"" to recapitalise the banks (by converting large deposits into equity) would be wholly counter-productive since this would destroy the working capital of Greece's small businesses. 
Yet even if the hurdles to a full agreement can be surmounted, the outlook for Greece remains precarious. Despite the recent promising developments, the risk of more political upsets remains very real. The decision by Alexis Tsipras, Greece's prime minister, to accept the bail-out terms has split his party, forcing him to rely upon opposition parties to pass legislation. That may lead to an early election. Chronic political uncertainty was a crucial reason why Greece's first two bail-outs went wrong. It may also blight the third.","Another step away from the brink for the euro 's perpetual delinquent

Dog days of August 
The Republican race for president trundled on. The candidates attended the state fair in Iowa, the first state to vote in the nominating process, to devour deep-fried Snickers bars and deliver homilies on their policies. Donald Trump maintained his poll lead in the party and called for illegal immigrants to be deported. Among the grown-ups John Kasich, the moderate governor of Ohio, was endorsed by Robert Bentley, the governor of conservative Alabama. 
On the Democratic side Hillary Clinton sustained a healthy lead in the race, though her main challenger, Bernie Sanders, closed the gap a bit. Speculation turned to whether Joe Biden, the vice-president, would enter the fray. Meanwhile Bob Woodward, a journalist famed for breaking the Watergate story in the 1970s, compared Mrs Clinton's travails over her use of a private e-mail account while secretary of state to the Nixon tapes. Mrs Clinton's favourability rating has wilted over the summer. 
America's National Labour Relations Board decided not to issue a ruling as to whether the American-football team at Northwestern University should be reclassified as employees, rather than students. A former captain of the team had championed the closely watched case, which would have allowed the players to organise as a union. 
Not quite friends 
John Kerry became the first American secretary of state to visit Cuba in 70 years. He attended the raising of the American flag at the embassy in Havana, which had reopened after a 54-year interruption. Mr Kerry said the United States would not end its trade embargo until Cuba improved its human-rights record. Cuba's foreign minister, Bruno Rodriguez, in turn criticised the United States for allowing racial discrimination and police brutality. 
Nearly a million people across Brazil demonstrated against the government of Dilma Rousseff in the third big wave of protests since March. The protesters are angry about a multibillion-dollar bribery scandal at Petrobras, a state-controlled energy firm, and about the floundering economy, which is in recession. Most want Ms Rousseff to be impeached, although she has not been directly implicated in the Petrobras scandal. 
Brutality without bounds 
Islamic State beheaded Khaled Asaad, the 81-year-old former director of antiquities at Palmyra, a UN heritage site in Syria. It is thought he was tortured to reveal the location of unexcavated tombs in the city. IS fighters have ransacked other cultural sites, arguing that they encourage idolatry. They have also sold stolen works of art to finance their campaign of terror. 
The Supreme Court in Israel ruled that the government should release from ""administrative detention"" Muhammad Allan, a Palestinian lawyer and member of the militant Islamic Jihad group, who had been on a hunger strike for more than nine weeks. Mr Allan's health has deteriorated. An MRI scan shows he suffered brain damage as a result of his fast. 
South Africa's government reversed a decision by a parole board that would have seen the release on August 21st of Oscar Pistorius, a disabled athlete who had been jailed last year for killing his girlfriend. Michael Masutha, the justice minister, said the decision to release Mr Pistorius after he had served less than a year of his five-year sentence had been made prematurely. 
South Sudan's government refused to sign a peace deal with rebels it has been fighting for 18 months after talks in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capital. Mediators have said they would call for international sanctions if the warring parties did not end their conflict. 
The unpopularity contest 
The German parliament approved the latest European bail-out of Greece, thereby clearing the biggest hurdle to paying out up to EUR 86 billion ($95 billion) over the next three years. The government in the Netherlands thwarted a vote of no confidence after Dutch MPs were recalled from their summer break to debate the bail-out. In Greece itself Alexis Tsipras, the prime minister, faced a rebellion in his party after pushing through the deal. 
The German government warned that up to 800,000 migrants will seek asylum in the country this year. The number of refugees has already doubled compared with the whole of last year. Meanwhile EU officials reported that the number of migrants detected at Europe's borders had reached 107,500 in July, well above June's figure of 70,000. 
Turkey is heading towards new elections. Talks broke down ahead of a deadline to form a coalition government among the four parties in parliament following an inconclusive election earlier this summer. In the south-east of the country Kurdish militants killed eight Turkish soldiers in a bomb attack. 
Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, spent three days in Crimea, the peninsula annexed from Ukraine last year, apparently to promote tourism. Meanwhile, fighting between Russian-aided rebels and Ukrainian troops in the east of Ukraine flared up again.","A bomb which went off at a popular shrine in central Bangkok , the capital of Thailand , killed 20 people and injured more than 100 . It was unclear who had detonated the device . Thailand 's military junta , which seized power last year and which called the attack the worst - ever such incident in the country , blamed a "" network "" but said it was "" unlikely "" it was the work of international terrorists . 
 In Sri Lanka the ruling United National Party won a majority of seats in a general election , blocking the attempt by a former authoritarian president , Mahinda Rajapaksa , to regain power via Parliament . 
 Shuja Khanzada , a minister who led anti - terrorism efforts in Punjab , Pakistan 's most populous province , was killed by a suicide - bombing in which at least 19 other people died .

 Dog days of August 
 The Republican race for president trundled on . The candidates attended the state fair in Iowa , the first state to vote in the nominating process , to devour deep - fried Snickers bars and deliver homilies on their policies . Donald Trump maintained his poll lead in the party and called for illegal immigrants to be deported . Among the grown - ups John Kasich , the moderate governor of Ohio , was endorsed by Robert Bentley , the governor of conservative Alabama . 
 On the Democratic side Hillary Clinton sustained a healthy lead in the race , though her main challenger , Bernie Sanders , closed the gap a bit . Speculation turned to whether Joe Biden , the vice - president , would enter the fray . Meanwhile Bob Woodward , a journalist famed for breaking the Watergate story in the 1970s , compared Mrs Clinton 's travails over her use of a private e - mail account while secretary of state to the Nixon tapes . Mrs Clinton 's favourability rating has wilted over the summer . 
 America 's National Labour Relations Board decided not to issue a ruling as to whether the American - football team at Northwestern University should be reclassified as employees , rather than students . A former captain of the team had championed the closely watched case , which would have allowed the players to organise as a union . 
 Not quite friends 
 John Kerry became the first American secretary of state to visit Cuba in 70 years . He attended the raising of the American flag at the embassy in Havana , which had reopened after a 54 - year interruption . Mr Kerry said the United States would not end its trade embargo until Cuba improved its human - rights record . Cuba 's foreign minister , Bruno Rodriguez , in turn criticised the United States for allowing racial discrimination and police brutality . 
 Nearly a million people across Brazil demonstrated against the government of Dilma Rousseff in the third big wave of protests since March . The protesters are angry about a multibillion - dollar bribery scandal at Petrobras , a state - controlled energy firm , and about the floundering economy , which is in recession . Most want Ms Rousseff to be impeached , although she has not been directly implicated in the Petrobras scandal . 
 Brutality without bounds 
 Islamic State beheaded Khaled Asaad , the 81 - year - old former director of antiquities at Palmyra , a UN heritage site in Syria . It is thought he was tortured to reveal the location of unexcavated tombs in the city . IS fighters have ransacked other cultural sites , arguing that they encourage idolatry . They have also sold stolen works of art to finance their campaign of terror . 
 The Supreme Court in Israel ruled that the government should release from "" administrative detention "" Muhammad Allan , a Palestinian lawyer and member of the militant Islamic Jihad group , who had been on a hunger strike for more than nine weeks . Mr Allan 's health has deteriorated . An MRI scan shows he suffered brain damage as a result of his fast . 
 South Africa 's government reversed a decision by a parole board that would have seen the release on August 21st of Oscar Pistorius , a disabled athlete who had been jailed last year for killing his girlfriend . Michael Masutha , the justice minister , said the decision to release Mr Pistorius after he had served less than a year of his five - year sentence had been made prematurely . 
 South Sudan 's government refused to sign a peace deal with rebels it has been fighting for 18 months after talks in Addis Ababa , Ethiopia 's capital . Mediators have said they would call for international sanctions if the warring parties did not end their conflict . 
 The unpopularity contest 
 The German parliament approved the latest European bail - out of Greece , thereby clearing the biggest hurdle to paying out up to EUR 86 billion ( $ 95 billion ) over the next three years . The government in the Netherlands thwarted a vote of no confidence after Dutch MPs were recalled from their summer break to debate the bail - out . In Greece itself Alexis Tsipras , faced a rebellion in Alexis Tsipras's party after pushing through the deal . 
 The German government warned that up to 800,000 migrants will seek asylum in the country this year . The number of refugees has already doubled compared with the whole of last year . Meanwhile EU officials reported that the number of migrants detected at Europe 's borders had reached 107,500 in July , well above June 's figure of 70,000 .

WHEN in doubt, call an election, goes a Greek political adage. It is as valid as ever. After only seven months in power, Alexis Tsipras, the prime minister, resigned on August 20th with the intention of winning a new mandate. The move followed a revolt by hardline legislators in his leftwing Syriza party over austerity measures, wiping out Mr Tsipras's majority in parliament. Greeks will vote for the sixth time in eight years on September 20th or 27th. 
It makes political sense for Mr Tsipras to seek a new mandate right away rather than try to limp on. Austerity measures imposed by European creditors will start to bite in October, after which governing may become even trickier. 
The creditors have mostly supported the return to the polls even if it increases short-term uncertainty. In any case, they intend to drip-feed aid only when the measures Mr Tsipras signed up to have been implemented. 
The most recent opinion polls show Syriza leading the centre-right New Democracy party by 24% to 22%, an unexpectedly narrow margin; some 15% of voters are undecided. Polls conducted before the austerity package was agreed put Syriza at 33-35%, close to the 36.3% it won at elections in January. 
Syriza's rebel faction, led by Panagiotis Lafazanis, once a senior official in the Greek communist party and until recently Mr Tsipras's energy minister, quickly transformed itself into a new political party named Popular Unity. It includes 25 MPs from the outgoing parliament and will probably pull in at least one-third of the members of Syriza's 200-strong central committee, say party insiders. 
Mr Lafazanis will campaign for an exit from the euro and the reintroduction of the drachma. Some 25% of Greeks favour such a move, claim Popular Unity officials. The recent poll puts support for Popular Unity at 4.5%. Yanis Varoufakis, the outspoken former finance minister turned international anti-austerity guru, has declined to join the party. 
Mr Tsipras is hoping that the brevity of the campaign will favour him. The opposition is incoherent, and thanks to a quirk of Greek law governing elections held within 12 months of the previous one, he as his party's leader gets to choose all its candidates. Two months of capital controls, which restrict daily cash withdrawals to EUR 60, and a stagnating economy have not destroyed Mr Tsipras's personal appeal. Even though he could not escape austerity measures, ""he put up a terrific fight against the Germans in the negotiations [and] that made people feel better,"" says Aristides Fenios, a garage owner. Most analysts, though, think that Syriza will fall short of an overall majority (it won 149 out of 300 parliamentary seats in January), forcing it into a coalition. 
Greece's reward for adhering to the new creditor-imposed programme, say officials, will be access to billions of euros in the new funds, a carrot offered by the European Commission which may help speed a return to sustained economic growth from 2016. Greece would also be eligible for additional funds from the European Central Bank's quantitative-easing fund to stimulate growth, which Ireland and Portugal have already qualified for after successfully completing their own bail-out programmes. But weary Greeks will have to put up with more voting first.

A RECENT cartoon in Kathimerini, a Greek newspaper, depicts Alexis Tsipras, the prime minister, waking up in a cold sweat. ""I had a nightmare!"" he exclaims to his partner. ""What was it?"" she asks. ""That I was re-elected!"" he replies. 
Poor Mr Tsipras. Swept to power on a wave of anti-austerity hope in January, for six months he and his leftist government captivated the world as they battled to convince euro-zone partners to lend Greece more money without the tough conditions of two previous bail-outs, saw banks forced to close and came close to losing the euro. 
Today Mr Tsipras cuts a diminished figure. He capitulated before Greece's creditors and signed a third programme under duress. The country still lives under capital controls. The economy is even more of a wreck. His party has split. The demagogue who once promised to upend Greek politics seems worn out. In calling an election on September 20th to renew his mandate, Mr Tsipras offers an awkward proposition for Greek voters: that they should choose him to implement the bail-out he denounces. Little wonder the campaign is dull. Watching this spectacle after the high drama of the summer is like sitting through a B-movie after a session of Hitchcock, says George Pagoulatos, a professor at the Athens University of Economics and Business. 
Mr Tsipras is largely the author of his fate. He demonstrated diplomatic and economic ineptitude from the start. His pick for finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, a vain economics professor with an unparalleled ability to inspire loathing in his negotiating partners, was only the first of his many missteps. The referendum he called in June on a bail-out offer that would expire by the time of the vote made little legal sense and triggered the capital controls that set back Greece's fragile recovery; soon afterwards he was obliged to sign a much tougher deal. Yet voters cheered his defiance of the German imperium. For a moment it seemed as if Mr Tsipras could lead Greeks anywhere--including, perhaps, out of the euro zone and even the European Union. 
One useful truth has emerged from this wild ride: that Greece's euro membership is incompatible with the anti-austerity message Syriza once peddled. But it was a costly experiment. The economy may shrink by around 2% this year, after returning to growth in 2014 (output has shrunk by a quarter from an admittedly unsustainable pre-crisis level). Unemployment, which had been dribbling down from a high of nearly 28%, is creeping up again. Capital controls are suffocating businesses, particularly importers. Taxes will soon go up. Many Greeks now talk of their suffering as another historical calamity to be endured, like occupation by the Turks and the Nazis. 
Polls show Syriza neck-and-neck with its rival, the centre-right New Democracy. But in office neither party will have much room for manoeuvre. The bail-out sets the parameters for policy. An ever-vigilant euro zone, scorched by the experiences of this year's negotiations, will pounce on the first sign of deviation from the path Greece has agreed to follow in exchange for its rescue funds. Coalition partners will act as a further check on adventurism. 
With a lot less at stake in this election, the candidates have been reduced to making personal jabs. New Democracy's leader, Evangelos Meimarakis, an affable old-timer, charges Mr Tsipras with reckless incompetence. Mr Tsipras's pitch is that of the heroic failure, who fought hard for his country but could not overcome the mighty Angela Merkel and her euro-zone factotums. He adds that Mr Meimarakis's party has not been cleansed of the corrupt habits that marked its recent turns in office. But that is an old line, and anyway ignores the reality of Syriza's brief term: it turns out that the new party is as attached to the Greek traditions of clientelism and patronage as the old ones were. 
Is Greece thus condemned to an eternity of economic drudgery? Not necessarily. There are lots of good things on offer for the next government should its creditors consider it to be behaving, notes Mujtaba Rahman, at the Eurasia Group, a consultancy. These include public funds to recapitalise the battered banks, inclusion in the European Central Bank's quantitative easing scheme and the biggest prize of all: a restructuring of Greece's public debt, probably through an extension of maturities. 
Whatever government emerges from the election will therefore have good reason to get moving on the many reforms it must enact before the bail-out's first review later this year. One observer who has discussed the bail-out with the economics teams of the main parties says it is hard to tell them apart. Even Mr Tsipras has softened his tone towards its provisions (although if Syriza loses, it might return to hell-raising in opposition). 
Trouble ahead 
The bigger battles will come next year, when the austerity implied by the bail-out's fiscal targets start to bite and reform fatigue sets in. Tough battles with interest groups such as farmers lie ahead. None of the stewards of previous programmes has come anywhere close to implementing reforms properly. And today, says Wolfango Piccoli of Teneo, a risk-analysis firm, the Greek bureaucracy is, if anything, even less capable of executing reforms than in the past. Slippage seems inevitable, although the absence of large debt repayments before next July should at least provide respite from the question of Grexit. 
If he wins re-election, Mr Tsipras will find himself in precisely the same position as in January: overseeing a broken economy and relying on rescue funds. He will need to draw on serious reserves of statesmanship to manage a controversial bail-out that will hurt before it heals, without succumbing to the temptations of populism. That will be neither dream nor nightmare, but the prosaic reality of governing a troubled country that has never been in a position to afford the indulgences of radicalism--least of all now.","After a disastrous year Alexis Tsipras's may yet win re - election .

 With a lot less at stake in this election , the candidates have been reduced to making personal jabs . New Democracy 's leader , Evangelos Meimarakis , an affable old - timer , charges Alexis Tsipras with reckless incompetence . Alexis Tsipras's pitch is that of the heroic failure , who fought hard for his country but could not overcome the mighty Angela Merkel and her euro - zone factotums . Alexis Tsipras adds that Mr Meimarakis 's party has not been cleansed of the corrupt habits that marked its recent turns in office . But that is an old line , and anyway ignores the reality of Syriza 's brief term : it turns out that the new party is as attached to the Greek traditions of clientelism and patronage as the old ones were . 
 Is Greece thus condemned to an eternity of economic drudgery ? Not necessarily . There are lots of good things on offer for the next government should its creditors consider it to be behaving , notes Mujtaba Rahman , at the Eurasia Group , a consultancy . These include public funds to recapitalise the battered banks , inclusion in the European Central Bank 's quantitative easing scheme and the biggest prize of all : a restructuring of Greece 's public debt , probably through an extension of maturities . 
 Whatever government emerges from the election will therefore have good reason to get moving on the many reforms it must enact before the bail - out 's first review later this year . One observer who has discussed the bail - out with the economics teams of the main parties says it is hard to tell them apart . Alexis Tsipras has softened Alexis Tsipras's tone towards its provisions ( although if Syriza loses , it might return to hell - raising in opposition ) . 
 Trouble ahead 
 The bigger battles will come next year , when the austerity implied by the bail - out 's fiscal targets start to bite and reform fatigue sets in . Tough battles with interest groups such as farmers lie ahead . None of the stewards of previous programmes has come anywhere close to implementing reforms properly . And today , says Wolfango Piccoli of Teneo , a risk - analysis firm , the Greek bureaucracy is , if anything , even less capable of executing reforms than in the past . Slippage seems inevitable , although the absence of large debt repayments before next July should at least provide respite from the question of Grexit . 
 If Alexis Tsipras wins re - election , Alexis Tsipras will find Alexis Tsipras in precisely the same position as in January : overseeing a broken economy and relying on rescue funds . Alexis Tsipras will need to draw on serious reserves of statesmanship to manage a controversial bail - out that will hurt before it heals , without succumbing to the temptations of populism . That will be neither dream nor nightmare , but the prosaic reality of governing a troubled country that has never been in a position to afford the indulgences of radicalism -- least of all now .",350,Greece,cb-350-3,POST TERM,True,"Alexis Tsipras , the prime minister",36,True

ALEXIS TSIPRAS, who won his second national election victory on September 20th by a poll-defyingly wide margin, is only 41 years old--one of the euro zone's youngest prime ministers. Yet he has been a professional left-wing politician for two decades. While his Syriza party languished in opposition, Mr Tsipras enjoyed his role as Greece's anti-austerity firebrand, denouncing the reforms of socialist and centre-right governments and insisting that only a state-led economy could create jobs and restore generous benefits. But as he starts his second term in office, he must put his ideological convictions on hold. 
Syriza's win gave Mr Tsipras a fresh mandate to keep Greece in the euro zone. To do so, the new government must immediately increase taxes, cut pensions and accelerate the privatisation of state-owned companies--reforms Mr Tsipras defiantly opposed during his first term. That was before the threat of an involuntary ""Grexit"" made him accept a new EUR 86 billion ($95 billion) bail-out by Greece's creditors--and their conditions. Like earlier Greek leaders in trouble, Mr Tsipras has executed an ideological kolotoumba, or somersault. The question now is whether the rest of Syriza can flip over as well. 
On election night, Mr Tsipras sounded more pragmatic than after his first win in January. He told a flag-waving crowd there were difficulties ahead, but that with ""persistence"" (rather than, say, ""resistance"") they could be overcome. His revamped cabinet includes Euclid Tsakalotos, the Oxford-educated economist who negotiated the bail-out, as finance minister. The deputy finance minister, George Chouliarakis, led Greece's number-crunching team in the negotiations. 
Mr Tsakalotos, a lifelong Marxist, suffered doubts before agreeing to take the job. But there is wriggle room in the bail-out deal to soften the impact of rapid market reforms. Meanwhile, Mr Tsakalotos leads the Group of 53, now the farthest-left internal group in Syriza since the extremist Left Platform defected and triggered the election. The Group of 53 will do its best to salvage some of Mr Tsipras's lost idealism. 
If Syriza has grown less fond of extreme left-wing rhetoric, so have Greek voters. Popular Unity, the party founded by Left Platform after it defected, failed to win enough votes to enter parliament. Yanis Varoufakis, the outspoken former finance minister who broke with Mr Tsipras over the new bail-out, decided not to run. 
Yet the prime minister and his team are far from re-inventing themselves as social democrats. Rather than forming a coalition with Greece's moderate pro-European left, the small Pasok (PanHellenic Socialist Movement) and To Potami (The River) parties, Mr Tsipras turned to the coalition partner from his first term: the Independent Greeks, a right-wing nationalist party that touts conspiracy theories and wants to deny Syrian refugees even temporary asylum in Greece. Martin Schulz, president of the European Parliament, called it ""bizarre"" that Mr Tsipras should keep in with ""this strange far-right party"". 
The new cabinet also retains some of Syriza's fiercest critics of capitalism. Panos Skourletis kept his job as minister for energy and environment, signalling that the new Syriza-led government has no plans at present to make concessions to the private sector. Mr Skourletis cited environmental grounds to revoke permits granted to a Canadian gold-mining company for a EUR 1 billion investment, the largest in Greece for two decades--even though they had been approved by Greece's highest legal body. He has refused to reconsider despite protests by hundreds of mine workers desperate to keep their jobs. 
Greece's creditors are waiting to see whether Mr Tsipras will act on his promises to crack down on corruption and high-level tax evasion by the old political elite, which has replaced Germany and the International Monetary Fund as the target of his rhetoric. None of Greece's oligarchs has so far been hauled before the public prosecutor. Syriza officials claim the previous government was so overwhelmed by the struggle to stay in the euro that there was no time to address other big issues. 
Mr Tsipras's turn away from leftist orthodoxy has manifested itself in his private life as well. He spent the summer staying at a Greek shipowner's villa by the sea, commuting by helicopter to his office. This month he enrolled his seven-year-old son at one of Greece's most expensive private schools. Some Syriza officials voiced disapproval. But the size of Mr Tsipras's election win--Syriza finished less than one percentage point down from January--suggests that voters were not concerned.

BANKS have been at the centre of Greece's economic and financial misfortunes this year, as the radical-left Syriza party won an election and then became embroiled in a bitter struggle with the country's international creditors. Deposits drained out of them on fears that the country would leave the euro and revert to the drachma, inflicting huge losses on depositors. Banks' woes multiplied when the European Central Bank (ECB) refused to provide them with further liquidity, forcing the government to close them for three weeks during the summer and to impose capital controls. In the end, Greece managed to secure a third bail-out and stay in the euro. But the injuries the banks had sustained along the way seemed ruinous. 
As a result, the EUR 86 billion ($94 billion) bail-out from the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), the euro zone's rescue fund, included a buffer of up to EUR 25 billion, or 14% of GDP, to rebuild the banks. The exact amount would be specified once the supervisors had combed through their books. The ECB, which has directly supervised big banks in the euro zone for the past year, was to examine the four main Greek banks--Alpha, Eurobank, National Bank of Greece (NBG) and Piraeus. Greece's central bank was to review Attica, a smaller lender. 
The supervisors appraised the banks' assets as of the end of June 2015 to see how many loans had soured owing to the economy's travails under Syriza. They also gauged the banks' resilience through a stress test, which simulated the effects of an even worse recession in 2015-17 than the European Commission was already projecting. The commission envisaged GDP declining by 2.3% this year and 1.3% in 2016 before growing by 2.7% in 2017. Under the supervisors' ""adverse scenario"", GDP would be 5.9% lower in 2017 than in the commission's ""baseline"" forecast. 
The supervisors' findings, published on October 31st, were sobering, but less dire than expected in the summer. To maintain a capital ratio of 8% of risk-weighted assets at the end of 2017 under the adverse scenario, the big banks will require an injection of EUR 14.4 billion, ranging from EUR 2.1 billion for Eurobank to EUR 4.9 billion for Piraeus. Attica will need EUR 1 billion. That means the total necessary to put the banking system on a sound footing is EUR 15.4 billion rather than the EUR 25 billion originally assumed. 
Moreover, the call upon bail-out money from the ESM, which will be made available in Greece via the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund (HFSF), should be even less than that. The ECB is expecting private sources to provide at least EUR 4.4 billion for the four main banks--the capital shortfall under the baseline scenario. In fact, the four should be able to raise more than that. NBG, for example, is planning to sell Finansbank, its subsidiary in Turkey, which could raise around EUR 3 billion. That compares to a total shortfall for NBG under the adverse scenario of EUR 4.6 billion. 
Moreover, any recourse to the HFSF will trigger a ""bail-in"" of some creditors, meaning that they would be obliged to contribute to the recapitalisation. Depositors will be excluded but banks currently have around EUR 6 billion of preference shares and debt that could be bailed in, according to Nondas Nicolaides of Moody's, a credit-rating agency. The threat hanging over such creditors, which include senior bondholders, will allow banks to drive a hard bargain with them when offering to exchange bonds for shares. Alpha, for instance, could get around EUR 1 billion through such a deal out of the total of EUR 2.7 billion in capital that it needs to raise. 
Investors in Greek banks have had a torrid year (see chart). But for the adventurous there is a case for taking a punt. Political risk may have trumped financial calculations earlier this year, but it looms less now. Alexis Tsipras, the prime minister, has learnt the hard way that Greece's creditors hold the cards. The hard-left faction of Syriza peeled away before a second election, in September, and Mr Tsipras won a new mandate on a more moderate platform. 
As for the banks, they have been more sinned against than sinners all along. Before the euro crisis they were one of the better functioning elements of the Greek economy, which succumbed to fiscal mismanagement and political miscalculation. Indeed, the banks may find it easier to regain the trust of international investors than of domestic depositors, who are likely to remain wary of them until they feel more confident about Greece's long-term future within the euro area.","The bill is cheaper than expected

FOR a Dutchman driving his caravan to the Costa del Sol, the only thing to remind him that he had crossed borders used to be the successive text messages welcoming him to Belgium, France and Spain. That was before this summer's migrant crisis--and last weekend's terrorist attacks in Paris. Now the liberty to roam the 26 countries in the border-free Schengen zone, which Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, calls a ""unique symbol of European integration"", is under greater threat than at any point since its inception. 
Calls to curb borderless travel were already growing louder in August after Ayoub El Khazzani, a Moroccan national, carried an assault rifle across two borders on a Thalys train before attacking fellow passengers. In September Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor, warned that without agreement on how to handle refugees they would grow louder still. The overwhelming scale of migrant arrivals led several countries, including Hungary, Slovenia, and ultimately Germany and Austria, temporarily to reintroduce border controls. Sweden, then getting 10,000 new arrivals each week, joined them on November 12th. The Netherlands has doubled its spot checks in the border area since September. And Denmark's announcement that it will introduce electronic number-plate scanners at border crossings strains the limits of the Schengen framework. 
The attacks in Paris have changed the debate. Ever since it became clear that the terrorists had strong links to Belgium, Peugeots coming over the border from Brussels have seemed just as great a threat to France as planes flying in from Damascus. As investigators retrace the movements of the terrorists and their weapons, more intra-European links will surely be uncovered, and more of Schengen's weaknesses. 
After last week's attacks, France swiftly reinstated border checks at major crossings. The Schengen framework allows such temporary measures for national security; the French had been planning the move anyway for a UN climate conference in Paris later this month. Now they are pushing for more. At a meeting of justice and home-affairs ministers in Brussels on November 20th, France will ask that Europe start to collect passenger name records from those travelling within the region--which it has pressed for since the Charlie Hebdo attacks--and for further exchange of data through the Schengen Information System, a security database. France will also demand a true Europe-wide agency to police Schengen's external borders. Francois Hollande, its president, said he wanted a Europe of open borders, not a continent of ""walls and barbed wire"". 
But others disagree, especially in the east. Hungary has already built a 100-mile fence along its Serbian border. Austria is planning one on its border with Slovenia. Slovakia's prime minister, Robert Fico, says he too is ready to build fences (the security of Slovak citizens ""is a higher priority than the rights of migrants""). After the Paris attacks Poland's minister of European affairs declared that the EU's deal to redistribute asylum-seekers was off. Slovakia's election campaign has become an anti-migrant shouting match. Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orban, blamed migration for the killings in Paris. (He also said it increased rape and threatened Europe's culture.) 
In western Europe, right-wing populists are playing on the public's fears. Nothing helped their cause more than the (unconfirmed) report that one of the Paris gunmen entered Europe through Greece, posing as a Syrian refugee. Marine Le Pen, who has warned for months that jihadists are posing as refugees, claimed vindication. Matteo Salvini of Italy's right-wing Northern League repeated his call for the suspension of Schengen. In polls taken since the bombings, 70% of Dutch people say the borders should close. 
Fear and loathing are not the sole response. On November 15th Germany's interior minister, Thomas de Maiziere, urged the press and society not to link the attacks to the refugee debate. The dominant line in talk shows in Germany and much of western Europe is that the refugees are victims of Islamic State's terror, not perpetrators. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey's president, an unlikely but necessary ally of Mrs Merkel's, said at last week's G20 summit that treating refugees as terrorists would be ""evading humanitarian responsibility"".

The group's barbarity was unrelenting. Gruesome propaganda included the burning alive in a cage of a Jordanian pilot whom IS had captured, the beheading of 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians in Libya and the murder of the 82-year-old head of antiquities at Palmyra, a heritage site in Syria that was looted by IS. 
Western governments felt compelled to counter the threat, especially after IS claimed responsibility for an assault on Paris in which gunmen mowed down people in restaurants and bars and at a rock concert, killing 130 and injuring hundreds. President Francois Hollande declared that France was at war with IS. 
After claiming that a Russian airliner had been bombed by IS affiliates in Egypt, Russia sent fighter jets to Syria, ostensibly to bomb IS. Most of its firepower, however, was directed at other opponents of the Syrian despot, Bashar al-Assad, a client of Vladimir Putin. In California 14 people were killed by a married couple inspired by IS. In December Barack Obama claimed that the American-led coalition was hitting IS hard, curtailing its operations in Iraq and Syria. 
Turkey alsoentered the fray, after a student gathering was bombed in a town near the Syrian border. But Turkey also targeted the Kurdish PKK. Suicide-bombers in Ankara attacked a peace rally that called for an end to Turkey's actions against the Kurds, killing 102 people. The chaos only strengthened the hand of the ruling Justice and Development party, which won an election in November. 
Je suis Charlie 
Other atrocities committed by jihadists included the killing of 148 people at Garissa University in Kenya, which the Shabab in next-door Somalia said it had carried out. A lone gunman slaughtered 38 tourists, most British, on a beach in Tunisia; three months earlier 22 people were killed at a museum in Tunis. In early January gunmen stormed the offices of Charlie Hebdo in Paris, killing 12. That attack prompted millions to protest worldwide in defence of free speech. But in some Muslim countries mass rallies were held denouncing the magazine for publishing cartoons of Muhammad the Prophet. 
Around half of the hundreds of thousands of people who streamed into Europe in the continent's worst refugee crisis since the Balkan wars came from Syria. The image of a three-year-old Syrian boy found drowned on a Turkish beach caused widespread outrage. Several summits were held to try to resolve the crisis. Germany threw open its borders and is on course to accept more than 1m asylum-seekers this year. 
China's stockmarkets plunged during the summer, sending out global ripples. China's ham-fisted attempts to stop the sell-off, such as directing large state investors (""the national team"") to buy shares, did nothing to calm nerves. Nor did a sudden devaluation of the yuan. The whole episode raised perturbing questions about the state of China's slowing economy and the competence of its regulators. 
The total value of announced takeovers in 2015 passed $4.3 trillion, breaking a record set in 2007. Pfizer's $160 billion purchase of Allergan, Dow Chemical's $130 billion merger with DuPont and Anheuser-Busch InBev's $110 billion acquisition of SAB Miller were three of the biggest in history. Other deals included Shell/BG Group ($70 billion), Charter Communications/Time Warner Cable ($55 billion), Anthem/Cigna ($52 billion) and Heinz/Kraft ($50 billion). 
The tech industry passed several milestones. Dell's $67 billion takeover of EMC was the biggest to date. Facebook set a new record when one billion people logged onto the social network in a single day. But there were fears that the heady valuations of many private tech startups, also known as ""unicorns"", might turn out to be another bubble. 
It was a dismal year for Volkswagen. A boardroom spat at the German carmaker led to the resignation of Ferdinand Piech as chairman. VW was then embroiled in crisis in the autumn after admitting it had installed software on diesel cars that cheated emissions tests in America. 
The president of everybody 
VW's wrongdoing came to light because of an American investigation. America also brought another institution based in Europe to task when it laid corruption charges against several officials at FIFA, football's world governing body. Football fans cheered when Sepp Blatter at last stepped down as FIFA's president. 
A UN summit on climate change, held in Paris, produced an agreement that aims to hold the increase in the global average temperature to ""well below 2[degrees]C above pre-industrial levels"", a more ambitious goal than had been expected. It marked an unprecedented political recognition of the risks of global warming, though some greens were sceptical that governments would follow through. 
Gay marriage took two giant steps forward. It became legal everywhere in America when the Supreme Court ruled that the constitution grants an ""equal dignity"" to gay couples. And Ireland became the first country to approve gay marriage by a popular vote. 
Two big elections in Latin America suggested that the continent's ""pink tide"" was turning. In Argentina Mauricio Macri was elected president, beating the candidate favoured by the departing Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner and bringing an end to 12 years of populist rule by the Kirchner family. In Venezuela, voters fed up with years of economic mismanagement rejected the party of President Nicolas Maduro in a parliamentary election. 
A career-defining election 
Britain's general election confounded the pollsters when the Conservative Party, which had governed in coalition with the Liberal Democrats for five years, secured its first overall majority in Parliament since 1992. The Lib Dems were reduced to a handful of MPs, whereas nationalists won all but three seats in Scotland. The opposition Labour Party went into self-destruct mode after the election by choosing Jeremy Corbyn, a leftist, as its new leader. 
The polls also got it wrong in Canada, where the Conservative Party was chucked out of office and a new Liberal government, headed by Justin Trudeau, was voted in. In Israel Binyamin Netanyahu wrong-footed the pundits when he was returned to power as prime minister. The Law and Justice Party, a group of xenophobic populists and conspiracy theorists, won two elections in Poland. 
Nigeria elected a new president, Muhammadu Buhari, who defeated an incompetent incumbent, Goodluck Jonathan. Malcolm Turnbull became Australia's fourth prime minister in five years, when Tony Abbott was ousted by his Liberal Party. 
An election in January brought the far-left Syriza party to power in Greece. It went on to win a referendum in July that rejected austerity imposed by the IMF and EU. But with markets jittery, and trading on the Athens stock exchange suspended for five weeks, Alexis Tsipras, the prime minister, was eventually forced to agree to another bail-out, much to the disgust of his more radical colleagues. Weary Greeks trudged to the polls for a third time in September and re-elected Mr Tsipras. With the euro zone still in the doldrums, the European Central Bank introduced a huge quantitative-easing programme in January. 
After years of talks, Iran and six world powers reached a deal on Iran's nuclear programme. Some hailed it as a chance for Iran to come out of the cold. Others, notably Israel, said the deal was a mistake that would allow Iran to develop nuclear weapons and throw its weight around. 
Dilma Rousseff had a terrible start to her second term as Brazil's president. A corruption scandal involving Petrobras, a state-controlled oil firm, ensnared members of her Workers' Party. The opposition threatened to impeach her because of allegedly illegal funding arrangements for the government. The economy shrank by 4.5% in the third quarter. 
Russia's economy stumbled. The IMF expects Russian GDP to contract by 3.8% this year and 0.6% in 2016. The country has been hammered by falling oil prices. Brent crude started the year trading at just under $60 a barrel; it is now below $38. Russia has also been hurt by sanctions in response to its military meddling in eastern Ukraine, though the fighting eased after a ceasefire was signed in February. 
Nepal was struck by an earthquake of magnitude 7.8 in April, the worst in the Himalayan country in 80 years. The death toll of 9,000 was the highest from a natural disaster since the earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan in 2011. 
Myanmar held its first freely contested election since 1990. The National League for Democracy, headed by Aung San Suu Kyi, trounced the party of the ruling junta. Cuba and the United States restored full diplomatic relations, which had been put in the deep freeze during the cold war. Travel restrictions were eased. America hopes its engagement with the Castro regime will push the island towards democracy. 
He'd like to build a great wall 
America's presidential candidates started their campaigns. Hillary Clinton wobbled under pressure about her use of an insecure private server for official e-mail, but remains the Democratic front-runner. The Republican establishment was unpleasantly surprised when D onald Trump soared into the lead in the party's race, despite badmouthing women, Mexicans, Muslims, etc. The primaries start in February. Paul Ryan became (somewhat reluctantly) Speaker of the House following the defenestration of John Boehner. 
America suffered several mass shootings. In one, inCharleston, South Carolina, nine people at a black church were gunned down by a white supremacist. Elsewhere the police were berated for their excessive use of force. The worst riots in Baltimore since the 1960s were triggered by the death of a black man in police custody. 
The aviation industry introduced rules ensuring at least two crew members remain in the cockpit during a flight, after a suicidal co-pilot deliberately crashed a German airliner into the French Alps, killing all 150 people on board. 
After a nine-and-a-half-year wait, the New Horizons space probe whizzed past Pluto at 14km per second (31,000mph). It took remarkable pictures that are only now filtering back to Earth, such as the ice-covered al-Idrisi mountains. 
Social media roared with indignation when Cecil the Lion was killed in a Zimbabwean national park by a dentist from Minnesota. Although the dentist had a permit, close to 1.5m people have signed a petition calling for him to face justice without anaesthetic.","Islamic State extended its bloody reach far beyond its base in Iraq and Syria .

2015-12-19,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/1753490404/fulltext/A3AA9E9C90CF4066PQ/17?accountid=14657,"It is too early to write off Europe's anti-austerity parties 
LESS than a minute into his speech and Albert Rivera, the leader of Ciudadanos, a centrist party that has stormed the barricades of Spanish politics, is already speaking of reformas estructurales. Mr Rivera wants to liberalise Spain's labour market, clean out the public administration and overhaul the tax system. These tough prescriptions do not look like vote-winners in a country that has been through the economic wringer. Yet Ciudadanos has risen from single digits in the polls a year ago to around 20% today, and is set to act as kingmaker after Spain's unpredictable general election on December 20th (see page 41). 
Like bronzed pensioners on the Costa Blanca, several political ideas are seeing out their last days in Spain. One of them is that liberals of Mr Rivera's sort cannot thrive in southern Europe. Another is the prediction, often heard during the darkest days of the euro crisis, that the cuts countries like Spain had to endure would generate a devastating political blowback. Yet Spain's ruling People's Party (PP), helped by buoyant growth and jobs numbers, remains on top of the polls, albeit much weakened. 
It is a similar story elsewhere in the euro-zone periphery. Ireland's ruling Fine Gael hopes to win another term next spring on the back of a zippy recovery. Portugal's centre-right government came first in October's election, only to see a leftist alliance assemble a jerry-built coalition that will struggle to last a full term. In Greece Syriza's anti-austerity resolve crumbled on its first encounter with the German-led imperium. Even in Italy, which has failed to grow since joining the euro, Matteo Renzi, the centre-left prime minister, is just about keeping a ragtag of populists at bay. 
But it was in Spain, the euro zone's fourth-largest economy, where the backlash was most feared. Unlike Greece, Ireland and Portugal, Spain (just) avoided a full bail-out. But its calamitous crash left over half of young workers unemployed. In January Pablo Iglesias, the leader of Podemos, another political newcomer, addressed vast crowds in Madrid on the iniquities of austerity while his brother-in-arms, Alexis Tsipras, led Syriza to victory in Greece. Europe's panjandrums feared the spread of political ""contagion"" from Greece across the periphery, starting in Spain. 
What happened? A year later Mr Tsipras is dutifully executing the terms of Greece's third bail-out, Podemos's support has plummeted and Ciudadanos has waltzed through the door that Mr Iglesias prised open. In Ireland Sinn Fein, a party rooted in terrorism that has tried to reposition itself as the voice of anti-austerity, is slipping in the polls after once leading them. Today the populist momentum in Europe is with right-wingers, who have exploited the refugee crisis to tap into cultural as well as economic fears. 
A number of factors explain the left's struggle. In part, it is the difficulty of turning insurrections into political parties. Coalitions must be built and maintained, outrage transmuted into a policy platform. Podemos began life as a fusion of grassroots indignados and a cabal of hard-left political-science professors, and the fissures sometimes show: this year a gentle tack towards the centre has seen some senior figures quit in disgust. Sinn Fein's dark history renders it toxic for many Irish voters. In August an anti-euro faction split off from Syriza. 
Europe's anti-austerians have also learned that their crusades are hard to conduct inside the euro zone, with Brussels supervising their every fiscal move. Grounded in internationalism, none of the new left populists wants to leave the single currency. Pablo Bustinduy, a Podemos candidate, says his party's attacks on austerity go ""hand-in-hand"" with a pro-European message. But he is scathing about the austerian turn the euro zone has taken. The Europe that the new left professes to love often seems to be just an artefact of its imagination. 
Despite this, the right is in no position to crow. European politics has not yet returned to its pre-crisis routines. Although Podemos's standing in the polls has faded, Spain's politics has fractured and Mr Iglesias's support may turn out to be vital in forming a government (he has had a good campaign). In Ireland, Spain and Greece once-stable systems have become primaeval political soups from which all manner of governments may emerge. The left's cause retains vitality: Podemos's dedication, grounded in the suffering of the indignados, could yet prove more enduring than Ciudadanos's clever but bloodless proposals. 
Not barking, but growling 
More to the point, Podemos's anger could prove useful, even if its reheated socialism is no cure for Spain's economic ills. The country's corrupt politics were crying out for the disruption that both Podemos and Ciudadanos have brought. Young Spaniards were walloped by the crash, but the PP has pandered to the old: last week Mariano Rajoy, the unpopular prime minister, pledged to slash income tax for Spain's pensioners. Little wonder, notes Jorge Galindo of Politikon, a Spanish website: the PP is polling first among voters over 65, and fourth among everyone else. This is not a strategy for the long term. Nor do the tired Socialists appeal to Spain's disaffected young. 
Despite the strong recovery, only 12% of Spaniards say they trust their country's institutions--the lowest figure in the EU--and over one-fifth of the labour force remains jobless. Even those in work often struggle to pay the bills. The PP's reforms have helped, but Spain is still a country stratified by age and status in which protected insiders enjoy secure employment and pension rights while young outsiders struggle to gain a foothold. 
These conditions are ripe for any party that can credibly promise rupture and regeneration. Whoever takes office after Sunday's election will face difficulties, starting with yet more austerity: Spain's deficit remains the euro zone's highest. Podemos will still have lots to talk about. But in debt-ridden, over-regulated, high-unemployment Spain the real challenges lie elsewhere. Time to get moving on those reformas estructurales .","It is too early to write off Europe 's anti - austerity parties 
 LESS than a minute into his speech and Albert Rivera , the leader of Ciudadanos , a centrist party that has stormed the barricades of Spanish politics , is already speaking of reformas estructurales . Mr Rivera wants to liberalise Spain 's labour market , clean out the public administration and overhaul the tax system . These tough prescriptions do not look like vote - winners in a country that has been through the economic wringer . Yet Ciudadanos has risen from single digits in the polls a year ago to around 20 % today , and is set to act as kingmaker after Spain 's unpredictable general election on December 20th ( see page 41 ) . 
 Like bronzed pensioners on the Costa Blanca , several political ideas are seeing out their last days in Spain . One of them is that liberals of Mr Rivera 's sort can not thrive in southern Europe . Another is the prediction , often heard during the darkest days of the euro crisis , that the cuts countries like Spain had to endure would generate a devastating political blowback . Yet Spain 's ruling People 's Party ( PP ) , helped by buoyant growth and jobs numbers , remains on top of the polls , albeit much weakened . 
 It is a similar story elsewhere in the euro - zone periphery . Ireland 's ruling Fine Gael hopes to win another term next spring on the back of a zippy recovery . Portugal 's centre - right government came first in October 's election , only to see a leftist alliance assemble a jerry - built coalition that will struggle to last a full term . In Greece Syriza 's anti - austerity resolve crumbled on its first encounter with the German - led imperium . Even in Italy , which has failed to grow since joining the euro , Matteo Renzi , the centre - left prime minister , is just about keeping a ragtag of populists at bay . 
 But it was in Spain , the euro zone 's fourth - largest economy , where the backlash was most feared . Unlike Greece , Ireland and Portugal , Spain ( just ) avoided a full bail - out . But its calamitous crash left over half of young workers unemployed . In January Pablo Iglesias , the leader of Podemos , another political newcomer , addressed vast crowds in Madrid on the iniquities of austerity while Alexis Tsipras's led Syriza to victory in Greece . Europe 's panjandrums feared the spread of political "" contagion "" from Greece across the periphery , starting in Spain . 
 What happened ? A year later Alexis Tsipras is dutifully executing the terms of Greece 's third bail - out , Podemos 's support has plummeted and Ciudadanos has waltzed through the door that Mr Iglesias prised open . In Ireland Sinn Fein , a party rooted in terrorism that has tried to reposition itself as the voice of anti - austerity , is slipping in the polls after once leading them . Today the populist momentum in Europe is with right - wingers , who have exploited the refugee crisis to tap into cultural as well as economic fears . 
 A number of factors explain the left 's struggle . In part , it is the difficulty of turning insurrections into political parties . Coalitions must be built and maintained , outrage transmuted into a policy platform . Podemos began life as a fusion of grassroots indignados and a cabal of hard - left political - science professors , and the fissures sometimes show : this year a gentle tack towards the centre has seen some senior figures quit in disgust . Sinn Fein 's dark history renders it toxic for many Irish voters . In August an anti - euro faction split off from Syriza . 
 Europe 's anti - austerians have also learned that their crusades are hard to conduct inside the euro zone , with Brussels supervising their every fiscal move . Grounded in internationalism , none of the new left populists wants to leave the single currency . Pablo Bustinduy , a Podemos candidate , says his party 's attacks on austerity go "" hand - in - hand "" with a pro - European message . But he is scathing about the austerian turn the euro zone has taken . The Europe that the new left professes to love often seems to be just an artefact of its imagination . 
 Despite this , the right is in no position to crow . European politics has not yet returned to its pre - crisis routines . Although Podemos 's standing in the polls has faded , Spain 's politics has fractured and Alexis Tsipras's support may turn out to be vital in forming a government ( Alexis Tsipras has had a good campaign ) .

ONE dodgy referendum lost Ukraine Crimea. Another threatens to lose it the European Union. On April 6th the Dutch public will vote on the ""association agreement"" the EU signed with Ukraine in 2014. The deal cements trade and political links with one of the EU's most important neighbours; the prospect of losing it under Russian pressure triggered Ukraine's Maidan revolution. But last summer a group of Dutch mischief-makers, hunting for a Eurosceptic cause they could place on the ballot under a new ""citizens' initiative"" law, noticed that parliament had just approved the deal. Worse luck for the Ukrainians. 
Unlike the Crimeans in 2014, the Dutch will not be voting under foreign occupation. But nor are they likely to have familiarised themselves with the Ukraine agreement's 2,135 pages. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, says a Dutch ""No"" could unleash a ""continental crisis"". That is a stretch: as the referendum is non-binding, the Dutch government could ratify the agreement anyway, and its most important provisions are already in force. But Mr Juncker put his finger on something, because national referendums on EU matters are turning into a throbbing headache. 
Margaret Thatcher once dismissed referendums as ""a device of dictators and demagogues"". The opposite was true for the central and eastern Europeans who joined the EU in the 2000s; their accession votes, usually passed with whopping majorities, marked the final rejection of tyranny. Elsewhere most EU referendums have turned on one-off issues, like joining the euro or ratifying an internal treaty. Negative votes, such as the French and Dutch dismissals of an EU constitution in 2005, have at least forced Eurocrats to pause for breath before resuming the march of integration. 
But now the silly season is here. A few months before the Dutch referendum, Danes were asked to vote on whether their government should convert its ""opt-out"" on EU justice and policing matters to an ""opt-in"". They plumped for the status quo, leaving their government with an awkward negotiation in Brussels. A few months earlier Alexis Tsipras, Greece's prime minister, called a referendum on a euro-zone bail-out agreement that would expire before the vote was held. His mighty oxi (""no"") victory was quickly converted to humiliating assent when his government realised that tough bail-outs were the price of euro membership. 
EU referendums are held for many reasons. The hapless Mr Tsipras hoped to boost his negotiating hand in the euro zone. David Cameron, Britain's prime minister, is holding an EU membership vote largely as a tool to manage his fractious Conservative Party. Some, more cynically, are called to provide a seal of legitimacy to something a government was going to do anyway. 
But a growing number of referendums serve as brakes on European integration. If voters cannot throw out the bums in Brussels, they can at least lob rotten fruit at them. Politicians, too, find them useful: of the national referendums that have consequences for the entire EU (such as treaty ratifications), a third have been called for partisan rather than constitutional reasons, according to Fernando Mendez at the Centre for Research on Direct Democracy in Switzerland. 
The trouble is that the politics of referendums cuts both ways. Two years ago the Swiss voted to restrict immigration from the EU. That directly contradicted free-movement agreements, and Swiss officials are struggling to square the circle. Brussels threatens to suspend a raft of bilateral agreements if the Swiss go through with it--partly to avoid emboldening the British, who want immigration concessions in their EU renegotiation. In turn, should Britain vote to leave, the EU will have every incentive to take a hard line when the British come back to negotiate their post-EU trade deal. Mr Tsipras's gambit flopped because the euro zone could not allow the precedent of a debtor state unilaterally changing the terms of its loans. 
No referendum is an island 
The tools of direct democracy are always controversial--at times, they have threatened to make American states like California ungovernable--but they are doubly difficult in the EU. First, in America federal law trumps state law, meaning no state can vex another by placing a lunatic proposal on the ballot. But in the EU, which is not a federal construction, there is nothing to stop one member holding a referendum that causes trouble for the rest. When things go wrong, the usual remedy is to tweak whatever regulation or accord made voters unhappy (usually a treaty) and to seek a second vote that produces the correct answer. 
A second problem is that the EU needs more integration just when many voters are turning against it. The euro zone and EU migration policy are both half-built ships. Each may require changes to EU treaties to allow more centralisation. But extending Brussels's powers into new areas will fuel the appetite for referendums that could scupper the changes. Moreover, notes Stefan Lehne, a former Austrian diplomat, these days EU politicians test the existing treaties to breaking point in order to avoid triggering referendums. The clamour for direct democracy thus fosters the legalistic jiggery-pokery to which it has been a reaction. 
All this smells horribly undemocratic to some. But joining a club, or striking a deal with it, will always limit governments' room for manoeuvre. National politicians can shoulder some of the blame for not being clear with voters about what their arrangements with the EU imply. But too often EU officials seem wedded to the views of their founding father, Jean Monnet, who wrote that he ""thought it wrong to consult the peoples of Europe about the structure of a community of which they had no practical experience"". That may have worked when Eurocrats restricted themselves to tinkering with agricultural subsidies and fisheries policy. Not any more: the age of referendums is here to stay.","Plebiscite - pushers have got Europe 's voters hooked on the cheap rush of direct democracy

He is waiting for a smuggler to help him cross Greece's northern border with Macedonia, closed since February 21st to Afghan migrants like him. Across the square, Mahmud, a restaurant manager who has come from Aleppo with his wife and three children, fears that the route to Germany may soon close for Syrians too. ""We mustn't get stuck in Greece,"" he says firmly. 
That may be hard to avoid. Last week Austria restricted arrivals to 3,200 per day, of whom 80 may apply for asylum. Macedonia, Serbia and Croatia are clamping down too. By February 23rd a backlog of 4,000 migrants had gathered at the Greek-Macedonian frontier; Greek police turned back dozens of buses carrying new arrivals. On February 24th ten countries along the migration route met in Vienna to discuss further steps. Greece was not invited. At the port of Piraeus, where ferries bring the migrants who arrive in Greece's Aegean islands, aid workers urged Afghans to remain in government-run reception facilities rather than attempt the journey north. 
For months experts have warned that if northern Europe restricts refugee flows without an overall plan for handling migration, Greece faces disaster. The United Nations predicts 1m arrivals this year. Alexis Tsipras, the prime minister, worries that Greece will become ""a black box"" for migrants. As razor wire goes up across the Balkans, his fears may be about to come true. 
The crisis could hardly have come at worse moment for Mr Tsipras. His left-wing Syriza government faces a revolt by lawyers, doctors and farmers against reforms demanded by Greece's international creditors. Farmers angry at moves to raise their income taxes to the same level as other Greeks blocked highways with their tractors, closing border crossings with Bulgaria and Turkey. A meeting on February 22nd with Mr Tsipras proved fruitless. Two days later the supreme court prosecutor threatened to investigate protest leaders; the blockades were quickly removed. 
While the farmers' rebellion may have been crushed, lawyers are on strike over a new pension scheme, which they say would force them to pay more than 30% of their income in employee contributions. George Katrougalos, the labour minister, wants to raise employers' contributions instead, claiming that pensions are among the last income sources for Greek families hit by the country's long recession. But Greece's creditors from the EU and International Monetary Fund say the pension system is on the verge of bankruptcy. They want an across-the-board benefits cut of at least 10% before releasing the next tranche of funding from the EUR 86 billion ($95 billion) bail-out Greece concluded last year. 
That leaves the Greek government on the edge of insolvency as the migrant crisis is about to explode. Two decades ago Greece comfortably absorbed almost 1m economic migrants from the Balkans. This time, after six years of recession, the unemployment rate is above 25%. Mr Tsipras's inexperienced government has struggled to take care of migrants in transit, let alone provide facilities for those who stay longer than a few days. It took a threat of immediate expulsion from the EU's passport-free Schengen zone before Greece fulfilled its obligation to provide ""hotspots"" on five islands where migrants could be processed according to EU regulations. With local mayors raising ""not-in-my-backyard"" objections, nothing happened until the defence ministry took over; army contractors built the facilities in less than a month. 
Greece has already agreed to host up to 60,000 asylum-seekers who enter an official programme to relocate them to other EU countries. So far most have ignored the offer and pressed on with the journey. In any case, according to current plans, EU countries would take in only 13,000 migrants from Greece in the next six months. Some in Syriza used to argue that providing poor facilities for migrants would encourage them to move along. But thousands of Tunisians, Moroccans and Pakistanis blocked at the Macedonian border earlier this month are now settling in. Greece cannot afford to deport them. 
One priority, says a Syriza official, is to keep migrants as far as possible from tourist resorts. In Kos, an Aegean island popular with German holidaymakers, summer bookings have collapsed because of fears it will be overrun. Sports facilities and disused military camps on the mainland are being refurbished as temporary refugee camps. But the country's total capacity is no more than 70,000 (see chart), and more than 2,000 migrants are arriving daily in Piraeus. The numbers will rise as the weather improves. If the northern border closes, Greece will fill very quickly.","HIS sleeping bag around his shoulders , Khaled , a 28 - year - old truck driver , sits in a corner of Victoria Square , a gathering point for migrants in central Athens .

HE HAS been in office for only ten months, but the fate of Shinzo Abe hangs on upper-house elections on July 29th. Voters appear to think the conservative prime minister, who emphasises ""patriotic"" education in schools and rewriting the pacifist constitution, is out of touch with their concerns about jobs and welfare; a scandal involving lost records at the pensions agency has caused particular upset. Mr Abe's popularity ratings have plunged. So the elections have become a vote of confidence in the prime minister himself. This week he faced another test: an earthquake that killed ten people and damaged a nuclear plant, giving Mr Abe the chance to sound tough on its owners, who were slow in admitting the leakage.
The coalition that the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leads is almost certain to lose seats, and probably its upper-house majority. If the coalition falls just a few seats short of a majority, Mr Abe might stumble on. A worse defeat might trigger a leadership race within the LDP. Yet the likeliest winner, Taro Aso, the foreign minister, lacks the zeal that voters appear to want for tackling domestic concerns, and has a nationalist agenda very like Mr Abe's. So he would face similar difficulties. A third scenario, says one LDP politician, would be such a humiliating defeat that his party would choose a grand old man, probably Yasuo Fukuda, 71, as a caretaker prime minister. By definition, such a job would be short-lived. So in all these scenarios a period of political uncertainty looms. Some analysts forecast a reversion to the political instability of the 1990s, when Japan got through ten prime ministers in a dozen years and when the redoubtable LDP itself briefly lost power.
If Japan is reverting to type, the argument goes, then the period of Mr Abe's predecessor, Junichiro Koizumi, was an aberration. Mr Koizumi was certainly unusual. A lion-maned maverick, he displayed leadership rare in a Japanese prime minister. He championed reforms and took on the vested interests within his own party, and the system of competing factions for distributing plum posts and other favours. Achievements fell short of the promises, but voters loved it, returning Mr Koizumi and his party in a landslide general election in 2005.
Last year Mr Koizumi stood down early. He said he wanted to have time again to dine well and listen to opera. A backbencher, Mr Koizumi gives no press interviews nor any sign of wanting to return to run the country--though even some enemies in his party now wish he would.
Yet his reformist supporters in the Diet may not share the LDP's general despair. Indeed, some of those known as ""Koizumi's children"", who swept into the Diet on Mr Koizumi's reformist coat-tails, think their time might be coming. When he stepped down, Mr Koizumi urged this group not to join any party faction, and about half of the original 80-odd have complied. In June some 30 of them began holding regular biweekly meetings--just as mainstream factions do. They have become, in effect, a non-faction faction, with Mr Koizumi as their unspoken head.
Some modernisers within the LDP, including among Koizumi's children, see little hope of more stable politics and more sensible policymaking in Japan without a split in the LDP. Reformists would part with the party's old dinosaurs and join with like-minded folk in the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ).
Yet Kuniko Inoguchi, a minister under Mr Koizumi and a leading light in his non-faction, casts doubt on the idea. No new party could match the LDP's organisational powers, she says, and Mr Koizumi knows this better than anyone. Hence the importance of the ""revolutionary"" non-faction. Market-oriented and internationalist, it will be needed to serve in the post-election regime, and to draw defectors from the DPJ. So, says Mrs Inoguchi, ""Mr Koizumi's influence will in time become only more powerful."" If she is right, then Mr Abe, not Lionheart, is the aberration.

BOWING to the inevitable, though with surprising timing, Shinzo Abe announced his resignation as Japan's prime minister on September 12th, after just a year in office. The grandson of a prime minister and son of a foreign minister who had missed his shots at the top job, Mr Abe had all his life been groomed to be prime minister--not least by his domineering mother, who last year insisted he grasp the chance even as grandees of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) urged him to wait. In the event, it is hard to think of a less glorious term than Mr Abe's.
It had started on a high note. Mr Abe was relatively young--the first prime minister to have been born after the second world war. He had the nod from the outgoing prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, who had dazzled the nation with his message of change. A year earlier Mr Koizumi had called a general election and won in a landslide, appealing over the heads of his party in favour of essential reforms, notably the privatisation of the postal-savings system, a fount of political patronage. Thanks to him, Mr Abe inherited not just a huge majority for the LDP-led coalition in the lower house of the Diet (parliament), but also a stronger office of the traditionally weak prime minister. Moreover, Japan's economy was returning to health after long years of slump. Mr Abe's government was initially very popular.
Yet the tide in Mr Abe's affairs only ebbed. True, early on he made a notable opening towards China, with whom relations had been strained under Mr Koizumi. Other than that, Mr Abe proved unable to impose discipline upon a cabinet of the corrupt and incompetent. Worse, he had a tin ear for the political mood. Voters, it had turned out, had been beguiled more by Mr Koizumi the messenger than by his message of structural reform, which entailed pain and uncertainty, notably in Japan's rural regions and among the old.
Mr Abe failed to address these concerns. Domestic policy interests him not a jot. Rather, he pursued a dogged passion for the symbols of a Japanese nationhood that he believes has been castrated by the country's pacifist constitution and abiding war guilt. Mr Abe's inert response to a bureaucratic scandal involving 50m missing pensions records underscored how out-of-touch he was. In late July voters punished his government in elections for the Diet's upper house: for the first time in its half-century life, the LDP and allies lost the upper-house majority, to the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ).
Not just the opposition but LDP heavyweights too began calling for Mr Abe's resignation. Many a prime minister had resigned for less. That he could claim that he would carry on was a measure of his party's disarray. On August 27th a cabinet shuffle replaced Mr Abe's callow band of brothers with a team of LDP heavies.
That seemed to buy Mr Abe time. Yet the DPJ's leader, Ichiro Ozawa, who vowed to destroy the LDP when he stormed out of it 14 years ago, still insisted his first priority was to topple Mr Abe. The fight he picked was the extension of emergency ""anti-terror"" measures, due to expire on November 1st, which allow Japan to keep refuelling ships in the Indian Ocean. Ostensibly, Japan is helping American-led efforts in Afghanistan--absurdly, by providing free fuel for Pakistan's navy, hardly a frontline priority--though suspicions are growing that help has also gone to Iraq.
Mr Abe cares deeply about the presence: to him, it reaffirms Japan's alliance with America, the basis for the country's security, and proves Japan's readiness to play a more muscular role in the world. He argues that a pull-out of its ships would greatly harm Japan's international standing. No matter, says Mr Ozawa. Though long ago he had helped launch the debate about how Japan could play a more ""normal"" role in the world, the DPJ leader says that the Indian Ocean operation breaches constitutional limitations on collective self-defence. More than anything, though, Mr Ozawa's stand is tactical: his masterstroke is to have challenged Mr Abe on his own ground, by promising that the upper house would block any extension.
On September 12th Mr Abe claimed that his position was no longer tenable because Mr Ozawa refused to meet him. The claim is implausible, and the timing extraordinary: only two days earlier, Mr Abe had delivered his policy speech before the Diet. It suggests a sudden loss of political nerve. Ill health and exhaustion may have had a lot to do with it; on September 13th Mr Abe was hospitalised for tests.
To limit the enormous damage, the LDP now wants to find a swift successor as party president and therefore--thanks to the LDP's continuing majority in the lower house--prime minister. Party members will vote for Mr Abe's successor on September 23rd. The presumed favourite is Taro Aso, foreign minister under both Mr Koizumi and Mr Abe and currently the LDP's secretary-general. Urbane if with an earthy humour, Mr Aso is another prime minister's grandson and leads a small party faction. He could prove acceptable to the bigger factions if these were assured plum posts. But some members will argue that this back-room dealing is just what voters loathe about the LDP and will favour a Koizumi-style reformist.
More likely, perhaps, the party might conclude that Mr Aso's neoconservative views, which resemble Mr Abe's, are not what it needs right now. A caretaker prime minister might be put forward, such as Yasuo Fukuda, a grand old man of the party whose name crops up when the matter of the LDP's salvation arises. But no matter who is chosen, he will still face Mr Ozawa's dogged obstructionism. The opposition leader's tactics will come under closer scrutiny from voters now that Mr Abe is no longer the centre of attention. Still, he has destroyed the prime minister, as promised, and intends to fulfil his second promise: to make life hell enough for the LDP to force it to call a general election. It may be just a matter of time.","Ill health and a newly energised opposition force the prime minister 's exit

Sorry.
In a remarkable turn, the job is Yasuo Fukuda's to lose
SOON after he announced on September 12th his intention to resign as prime minister, Shinzo Abe withdrew to the barren consolations of a hospital room and drip, physically and perhaps emotionally broken. No formal handover of power to his chief cabinet secretary, Kaoru Yosano, took place, yet since his resignation nearly nothing has been heard of Mr Abe. It is said that Mr Yosano carries the odd bundle of papers to him. In effect, the world's second-largest economy is leaderless.
Mr Abe's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has rushed to find a successor. Elections for the party presidency will be held on September 23rd. Two days later the winner will become prime minister, because appointing one is the job of the lower house of the Diet (parliament), and there the ruling coalition has a huge majority. By contrast, in late July the LDP lost control of the upper house to the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), a humiliating defeat that was at the root of Mr Abe's undoing.
It had for months been assumed that the front-runner to succeed Mr Abe, whenever he went, was Taro Aso, grandson of Japan's most notable post-war prime minister, Shigeru Yoshida. Mr Aso was foreign minister under Mr Abe until he was appointed the party's secretary-general in late August in a revamped government and party line-up. Mr Aso, a former Olympic shot and a fan of manga comics, has an urbane assurance that once had widespread appeal. Yet so deep runs the anger within the LDP at the nature and timing of Mr Abe's resignation--unnecessary weeks after the election defeat, yet a mere two days after the prime minister had opened a new session of the Diet with Japan's version of a state-of-the-union address--that Mr Aso's ambitions now look shattered.
Not only is he tainted by association with Mr Abe. Mr Aso also knew of the prime minister's intentions a couple of days before the country and the rest of the party's grandees. It was a blunder for a usually adroit politician not to warn his colleagues of their approaching crisis. With extraordinary speed, disgusted members called upon Yasuo Fukuda, a 71-year-old stalwart, son of another former prime minister, to step in, something he had not done last time round. He has already won the backing of all the main factions and looks poised to become prime minister. Mr Aso's surviving hopes lie with the LDP's prefectural chapters, which cast votes along with Diet members.
It would be a novelty if the two candidates had big policy differences. But as far as it is possible to tell, their views are remarkably similar. Neither wants the LDP to revert to the system of regional patronage and public works that Mr Abe's predecessor, Junichiro Koizumi, did much to destroy. But both want to help the presumed victims of market reforms and budget tightening, most of them outside the main cities of Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya.
If anything, what differences did exist have narrowed. Mr Fukuda, like his father, has argued for full reconciliation with the Asian victims of Japanese imperial aggression, and his ties with China are close. Mr Aso, meanwhile, is a scion of a family cement company that used Chinese and Korean slave labour, and he has a revisionist view of Japan's past. As foreign minister, he proposed an ""arc of freedom and prosperity"" that conspicuously excluded China. Yet now he claims to be the first foreign minister to welcome China's rise. Only over nuclear North Korea do real differences remain. Mr Aso is adamant that pressure must be used until North Korea dismantles its weapons and explains the mysterious disappearances of ordinary Japanese during the 1970s and 1980s. Mr Fukuda, by contrast, stresses the eventual normalisation of ties.
Above all, Mr Fukuda appeals to his party on style. Greyness is back, synonymous with competence. Conciliation and compromise are to get a chance, while flamboyance is out. Even that consummate showman, Mr Koizumi, with no love for Mr Fukuda, has given his backing.
And perhaps the LDP, for once, is smart. For the autocratic opposition leader, Ichiro Ozawa, himself a former LDP strongman, was counting on confrontation to bring down the government. His chosen issue is the extension of emergency ""anti-terror"" measures sanctioning the refuelling of ships in the Indian Ocean as part of the campaign in Afghanistan. Mr Ozawa has said that the upper house will vote down any extension of operations not countenanced by the United Nations.
Already, Mr Fukuda is unsettling the DPJ. He says he wants to discuss a framework allowing Japan to play a more predictable role in the world's troublespots. The government succeeded in pushing the UN Security Council into thanking Japan and other countries helping fight terrorists in Afghanistan. For Mr Ozawa, this was unwelcome. Many in his party regret the knock to Japan's international standing from the leadership crisis, and do not want to make matters worse by ordering Japan's navy back from the Indian Ocean. One such critic, Seiji Maehara, Mr Ozawa's predecessor as leader of the DPJ, says his successor should follow the party consensus, not pre-empt the debate. As for Mr Fukuda, wanting to survive as prime minister until a budget is passed next spring, and perhaps until Japan's hosting of the G8 summit next summer, he may hope that one compromise wrested from the DPJ will lead to another.

After more than a week of mounting pro-democracy protests led by Buddhist monks on the streets of Yangon and other cities in Myanmar, the military government resorted to force. Many protesters were injured and several shot dead. Soldiers raided monasteries and detained hundreds of monks. Aung San Suu Kyi, the opposition leader, made her first public appearance in four years. She was in tears. Western leaders competed with each other to express support for the protests. China and Russia said they were an internal matter.
The Liberal Democratic Party and the lower house of the Diet (parliament) chose Yasuo Fukuda as Japan's prime minister. The 71-year-old son of an earlier prime minister, Mr Fukuda said he had drawn the short straw.
China cancelled talks with Germany's justice minister in protest at a meeting Chancellor Angela Merkel held with the Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled spiritual leader.
American officials expressed concern at the detentions by Pakistan's security forces of hundreds of political activists. The detentions seemed intended to prevent protests against the planned re-election on October 6th of General Pervez Musharraf as president for a further five-year term.

Mr Abe's year in office was disastrous for the LDP. In late July the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) gained control of the Diet's upper house. The DPJ will now do all it can to force a general election.
Whereas most prime-ministerial candidates, it seems, are the grandsons of former prime ministers, Mr Fukuda is the first Japanese politician to follow his father into the top job. Until now he has been a man, by his own confession, of the LDP's shadows, and at 71 he is pretty old even by Japan's standards to be prime minister. Yet he has a reputation for competence and common sense, and seven of the party's eight factions backed him.
Acting fast to form a new government, he has drawn on those factions' heavies. Nobutaka Machimura, the leader of the biggest faction, who had served for a month as Mr Abe's foreign minister, becomes Mr Fukuda's chief cabinet secretary and in effect government gatekeeper. Masahiko Komura, defence minister under Mr Abe, becomes foreign minister, a post he has held before, while the able Shigeru Ishiba returns to defence. As for the new party leadership, Mr Fukuda has named faction heads to all four top posts.
The DPJ soon accused Mr Fukuda of returning to the LDP's bad old days, before Mr Abe's iconoclastic predecessor, Junichiro Koizumi, of spreading around jobs for the boys and handing power to the bureaucrats. This is undeniably true. At the same time, DPJ members privately admit that this is a formidable bunch for the party's bruising head, Ichiro Ozawa, to fight. In their tactics they are as likely to try killing the DPJ through conciliation as much as confrontation.
As for the new government's liberalising bent, it is too soon to write Mr Fukuda off. Although sometimes a master of obfuscation, he has been clear on the matter: with its population ageing and shrinking fast, Japan must boost productivity. With high levels of debt, the government must also balance its books--by 2011, before interest payments, insists Mr Fukuda, reiterating an LDP commitment. Certainly, steps will be taken to help presumed victims of reform or those whom the economic recovery has not touched. There is talk of raising the minimum wage. The new government (which keeps 15 out of the 17 in Mr Abe's final cabinet), as well as the party leadership, has its share of budget-balancers and free-marketeers.

IN JAPAN'S ruling party, says Taku Yamasaki, a former secretary-general, ""we feel a tremendous pain, to the marrow of our bones."" The reason is the loss by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in summer elections of the upper house of the Diet (parliament). The LDP had been the biggest party there for half a century. Never before have opposing parties controlled the two chambers--for whereas the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) now has the upper house, the LDP and its ally, New Komeito, have a hefty majority in the lower one.
The constitution scarcely foresaw a divided government, so the political system faces huge uncertainty. The government of Yasuo Fukuda has seen its popularity rise since he took over last month from Shinzo Abe, who resigned as prime minister after a terrible year. But the government could yet fall. If it survives, it is not clear how it can pass laws. So already murky prospects for tackling urgent problems--a high national debt, an ageing society, pension obligations and defining Japan's place abroad--have got even murkier. Yet among many politicians, a palpable thrill has supplanted the usual drudgery. The ambitious sniff a chance for personal advancement, but also to remake their parties--and even the political structure.
Mr Fukuda's first challenge is to extend the Japanese navy's refuelling role in American-led operations in the Indian Ocean. These form part of the ""war on terror"", supposedly by helping seize vessels linked to the Taliban and al-Qaeda. Japan has a pacifist constitution restricting military activities overseas. But its interpretation is disputed: the DPJ's leader, Ichiro Ozawa, has long believed, quasi-religiously, that only the United Nations can mandate military operations abroad. Mr Ozawa seized on the Indian Ocean operations as a means to topple the government.
Mr Abe said he would resign if he could not extend the operations--and then resigned anyway. Mr Fukuda quickly gave up the idea of extending the current measures, in favour of a new law to authorise the Japanese presence. Suspicions have recently grown that Japanese-supplied fuel was used by the United States in 2003 in the run-up to the war against Saddam Hussein, something America denies. It has not helped Mr Fukuda keep the support of his New Komeito allies; with Buddhist roots, the party has a pacifist bent. Still, on October 17th the cabinet approved a new bill that will now go to the Diet. To appease New Komeito, it restricts the operations to just one year, with fuel to go only towards stopping suspicious ships. In any event, no new law will be in place before the existing one expires. On November 1st the Japanese navy will be recalled. It will prove a deep international embarrassment.
Yet behind the scenes, Mr Ozawa looks in sudden trouble. His own party resents his stubborn, autocratic style. To meet criticism that mere obstruction was damaging the DPJ's image, last week Mr Ozawa offered a vision for a new international role. The refuelling was unconstitutional, he said, but a Japanese presence in Afghanistan itself, under the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), would be fine, since this has a UN mandate.
To some, this is a brilliant stroke, cutting the ground from under the LDP, while taking the national debate forward. But many DPJ left-wingers are suspicious of all foreign involvement, and alarmed that Mr Ozawa is prepared to put Japanese troops in harm's way--not one has been killed in the 15 years since Japan first joined peacekeeping missions. Seiji Maehara, a former party leader, says that to insist on UN backing is to give Russia and China a veto over Japanese foreign policy. Meanwhile, the DPJ's shadow defence minister, Keiichiro Asao, backpedals from Mr Ozawa's recommendations. Combat troops should perhaps not be considered, but rather specialists in disarming and reconstruction.
What happens next, Mr Asao stresses, hinges on the opinion polls. The upper house could veto Mr Fukuda's bill or just sit on it for up to 60 days--should the prime minister extend the Diet session beyond its planned closure on November 10th. Either way, Mr Fukuda must then choose whether to let the bill die, or push it into law using the government's two-thirds majority in the lower house.
That is a forceful measure, never used before, and Mr Ozawa threatens an upper-house censure. But Koichi Kato, another former LDP secretary-general, says that Mr Fukuda could survive a censure if public opinion is on his side; ironically, approval of the little-understood Indian Ocean operations has risen since Mr Abe said he would stake his job on them. When television pictures show the ships' embarrassing return, opposition to withdrawal may strengthen. Mr Fukuda may close this special session of the Diet and vote on the refuelling law when the ordinary session opens in January. Then the lower house can at least get on with the crucial deliberations over next year's budget, postponing a confrontation with the DPJ.
If the government falls sooner and a general election is called, things get interesting. Some of the grizzled eminences who engineered Mr Fukuda's post-Abe coup--among them Mr Yamasaki, Yoshiro Mori, an LDP former prime minister, and Tsuneo Watanabe, who heads the Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's biggest newspaper--have long viewed the DPJ leadership as just an errant LDP faction. Mr Ozawa was once LDP secretary-general before falling out and vowing revenge; his own secretary-general, once in the LDP, is the grandson of a late prime minister and brother of Mr Fukuda's justice minister. Some of these eminences dream they can arrange a ""grand coalition"" between the two parties.
Most likely, the ruling coalition will keep a much-diminished majority, and Mr Ozawa will be under pressure to resign. A way will have to be found for the two parties to co-operate. But other dynamics might also be at work. If the LDP becomes too hawkish, says Mr Kato, then New Komeito could desert it for the DPJ. In turn, modernists from the DPJ, among them Mr Maehara, might be asked to join the LDP. A more competitive two-party system, in other words, might just be the outcome. But that is to pitch hope over experience.","A fight about Japan 's role in the world masks a different political struggle

POLITICS in Japan is typically slow and steady. But in just four days this week, Ichiro Ozawa, the leader of the main opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), betrayed his own party, resigned over it and dismissed the party's ability to govern or win a general election. Yet party leaders begged him to return, and he did. Stranger still, Mr Ozawa's antics followed a triumph in July, when he led the DPJ to its most impressive electoral victory, winning control for the first time of the upper house of the Diet (parliament).
All of this reflects a new phenomenon: polarising party politics. After more than 50 years of near-continuous rule by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), Japanese political culture has almost no experience of dealing with this. In the past, the main adversaries were within the LDP: powerful factions that needed to be placated with power and funds for patronage. Dealing with small opposition parties was easy. They posed little threat. The cohabitation or ""twisted Diet"" since July has resulted in a political deadlock. Not a single law has been passed.
Mr Ozawa's resignation offer came on November 4th. He had, he lamented, created ""political confusion"". DPJ members were outraged that in closed-door discussions with Yasuo Fukuda, the prime minister, he had entertained the idea of forming a ""grand coalition"" with his LDP. This smacked of betrayal. The DPJ won its mandate in July by arguing that only by throwing out the LDP could Japan truly change. Opinion polls suggest a majority of the public also oppose such a coalition.
In explaining his resignation, Mr Ozawa managed to insult his own party. The DPJ, he said, ""lacks capability"" to govern, and would find it difficult to win the more powerful lower house in the election due by September 2009. Only by joining government might the DPJ win the public's trust, he concluded.
He had a point. The DPJ's obstructive stance is likely to backfire. It even sparked the abrupt resignation of Shinzo Abe, prime minister until September, when it became clear that the DPJ would block the extension of a law authorising the Japanese navy's support for America's military operation in Afghanistan by refuelling ships in the Indian Ocean. On November 1st the ships sailed home.
Mr Ozawa is an unappealing but pivotal figure in Japanese politics. After breaking from the LDP, where he had been a rising star, he formed an opposition party that resulted, briefly, in the only non-LDP government that ruled for eight months in 1993-94. Later in the 1990s Mr Ozawa led--and often tore apart--a number of parties. With a reputation for arrogance, stubbornness and backroom dealing, he earned the nickname ""the Destroyer"", because of the damage he inflicted on his own side. Indeed, the DPJ sought to keep Mr Ozawa this week for fear he might otherwise lure some DPJ members into a new party that would ally with the LDP, and lose the party its control of the upper house.
For decades the parties were able to manage Diet strategy through a process called kokutai seiji, ie, basically private dealings among party elders. Ostensibly, policymaking is now more transparent. But the reality is that nothing has yet replaced the old ways. So Mr Ozawa and Mr Fukuda--old-time LDP politicians--tried to do what they do best: a backroom deal.
Without a way for the LDP and DPJ to overcome policy differences and pass laws, paralysis will continue. Already, a host of bills is stalled. Most prominent is the ""anti-terrorism"" law to let Japan's Self-Defence Forces be deployed overseas--the issue that brought down Mr Abe. The DPJ opposes the refuelling, claiming it violates Japan's pacifist constitution. This week it put forward a proposal that would allow the army to be sent abroad for humanitarian and infrastructure work under a United Nations mandate.
The matter is far from a priority for ordinary Japanese, who tend to be more worried about the economic gap between rural and urban centres, and about fixing the pension system. Meanwhile, debate over a bill to control the influence of money on politics has stalled. This is a big issue. For two weeks the public has been treated to daily disclosures of financial improprieties by a former deputy minister of defence. But late this week the parties were co-operating enough for some bills, eg, on the minimum wage and labour standards, to make progress.
Rather than try to win a true mandate through a general election in the lower house, both parties want to delay polls as long as possible. The DPJ, looking even less fit for power after this week's shenanigans, knows it would not win. The LDP sensibly frets that it would lose the two-thirds majority that lets it override the upper house controlled by the DPJ. Moreover, both parties are so internally divided between conservatives and liberals that they seem on the point of unravelling. Japanese politics, traditionally cosily predictable, has become unfathomable.

But in just four days this week , Ichiro Ozawa , the leader of the main opposition Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) , betrayed his own party , resigned over it and dismissed the party 's ability to govern or win a general election . Yet party leaders begged him to return , and he did . Stranger still , Mr Ozawa 's antics followed a triumph in July , when he led the DPJ to its most impressive electoral victory , winning control for the first time of the upper house of the Diet ( parliament ) . 
 All of this reflects a new phenomenon : polarising party politics . After more than 50 years of near - continuous rule by the Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) , Japanese political culture has almost no experience of dealing with this . In the past , the main adversaries were within the LDP : powerful factions that needed to be placated with power and funds for patronage . Dealing with small opposition parties was easy . They posed little threat . The cohabitation or "" twisted Diet "" since July has resulted in a political deadlock . Not a single law has been passed . 
 Mr Ozawa 's resignation offer came on November 4th . He had , he lamented , created "" political confusion "" . DPJ members were outraged that in closed - door discussions with Yasuo Fukuda , he had entertained the idea of forming a "" grand coalition "" with his LDP . This smacked of betrayal . The DPJ won its mandate in July by arguing that only by throwing out the LDP could Japan truly change . Opinion polls suggest a majority of the public also oppose such a coalition . 
 In explaining his resignation , Mr Ozawa managed to insult his own party . The DPJ , he said , "" lacks capability "" to govern , and would find it difficult to win the more powerful lower house in the election due by September 2009 . Only by joining government might the DPJ win the public 's trust , he concluded . 
 He had a point . The DPJ 's obstructive stance is likely to backfire . It even sparked the abrupt resignation of Shinzo Abe , prime minister until September , when it became clear that the DPJ would block the extension of a law authorising the Japanese navy 's support for America 's military operation in Afghanistan by refuelling ships in the Indian Ocean . On November 1st the ships sailed home . 
 Mr Ozawa is an unappealing but pivotal figure in Japanese politics . After breaking from the LDP , where he had been a rising star , he formed an opposition party that resulted , briefly , in the only non - LDP government that ruled for eight months in 1993 - 94 . Later in the 1990s Mr Ozawa led -- and often tore apart -- a number of parties . With a reputation for arrogance , stubbornness and backroom dealing , he earned the nickname "" the Destroyer "" , because of the damage he inflicted on his own side . Indeed , the DPJ sought to keep Mr Ozawa this week for fear he might otherwise lure some DPJ members into a new party that would ally with the LDP , and lose the party its control of the upper house . 
 For decades the parties were able to manage Diet strategy through a process called kokutai seiji , ie , basically private dealings among party elders . Ostensibly , policymaking is now more transparent . But the reality is that nothing has yet replaced the old ways . So Mr Ozawa and Yasuo Fukuda -- old - time LDP politicians -- tried to do what they do best : a backroom deal . 
 Without a way for the LDP and DPJ to overcome policy differences and pass laws , paralysis will continue . Already , a host of bills is stalled . Most prominent is the "" anti - terrorism "" law to let Japan 's Self - Defence Forces be deployed overseas -- the issue that brought down Mr Abe . The DPJ opposes the refuelling , claiming it violates Japan 's pacifist constitution . This week it put forward a proposal that would allow the army to be sent abroad for humanitarian and infrastructure work under a United Nations mandate . 
 The matter is far from a priority for ordinary Japanese , who tend to be more worried about the economic gap between rural and urban centres , and about fixing the pension system . Meanwhile , debate over a bill to control the influence of money on politics has stalled . This is a big issue . For two weeks the public has been treated to daily disclosures of financial improprieties by a former deputy minister of defence . But late this week the parties were co - operating enough for some bills , eg , on the minimum wage and labour standards , to make progress . 
 Rather than try to win a true mandate through a general election in the lower house , both parties want to delay polls as long as possible . The DPJ , looking even less fit for power after this week 's shenanigans , knows it would not win . The LDP sensibly frets that it would lose the two - thirds majority that lets it override the upper house controlled by the DPJ . Moreover , both parties are so internally divided between conservatives and liberals that they seem on the point of unravelling . Japanese politics , traditionally cosily predictable , has become unfathomable .

THE first trip to Washington, DC by a new Japanese prime minister--Yasuo Fukuda of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) was on his way as The Economist went to press--usually follows a script. George Bush will probably josh too informally with Mr Fukuda, or mispronounce his name. Mr Fukuda will assure Mr Bush of the importance of Japan's post-war alliance with the United States. But away from the ritual, there is no hiding the strains in the alliance.
One is a hardy perennial: how much should Japan pay for American forces underwriting its defence? Japan is pushing to pay less. It is also uncomfortable at the pace of America's rapprochement with North Korea while the question of Japanese kidnapped by that country in the 1970s and 1980s remains unresolved. Mr Fukuda has said he wants Japan to play a more important role in the six-nation talks meant to get North Korea to disarm. But the domestic sensitivity about the abductees precludes this.
The biggest strain, however, has to do with the uncertain future of Japan's commitment to the American-led ""war on terror"". This also lies at the heart of a domestic political crisis that helped bring down Shinzo Abe, whom Mr Fukuda replaced as prime minister in September, and has all but stymied the current government.
The chief manifestation of the commitment was the Japanese navy's presence in the Indian Ocean, resupplying other ships engaged in the fight against the Taliban and al-Qaeda. But that presence was thrown into doubt when the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) seized control of the upper house of the Diet (parliament) in elections in late July. The DPJ's leader, Ichiro Ozawa, claimed that the operations breached Japan's pacifist constitution. He vowed to use his party's upper-house majority to block any attempt to extend the navy's presence. The Americans huffed and puffed but to no avail. The mandate expired on November 1st and the ships have been called home.
Internationalists in both main parties are mortified that Japan (not for the first time) appears unwilling or unable to play a role in the world commensurate with its size. Yet Mr Fukuda brings a small gift for Mr Bush. This week the lower house passed a bill authorising a new refuelling mission, albeit one heavily circumscribed: fuel and water may be used not for combat or even search-and-rescue missions, but only to help intercept shipping that might be supplying terrorists.
Recent farcical political events make it more likely that this bill will pass into law. In early November, Mr Ozawa surprised even those who thought they knew him by entering into talks with Mr Fukuda over a ""grand coalition"", one in which he and his party would get plum government posts; the future of the refuelling mission was one of the bargaining chips. When Mr Ozawa brought the deal back to his party's executive, it was appalled. Mr Ozawa resigned, but a party with a dire shortage of good leaders reinstated him.
Such backroom dealing has made both parties look shambolic, but Mr Ozawa's DPJ is in greater disarray. Mr Fukuda now looks more likely to use his two-thirds majority in the lower house to override any upper-house veto of the refuelling bill. The DPJ might half-heartedly pass an upper-house motion censuring the government, but Mr Fukuda could ignore it. This week he talked confidently of hosting next summer's G8 meeting that takes place in Japan.
The irony is that Japan's refuelling contribution was in some ways a token. It became important because it raised the question of just how far Japan should support America. Even leaders such as Mr Abe, who argued for a more robust Japan, believed that could only be achieved by falling in behind American demands.
In Washington, Mr Fukuda will take a slightly different tack, pointing out that Japan's main priorities lie in Asia--implying that Japan should not be asked to sign up to every ""coalition of the willing"" proposed by America. Some Washington policymakers might agree. In a speech last week in Tokyo, Mr Bush's defence secretary, Robert Gates, while calling on Japan to shoulder ""global responsibilities"", also called for a rethink of the alliance. It seems a promising suggestion, but not one likely to be acted upon soon. Mr Bush's administration has just a year to run, and Mr Fukuda may not last that long.","No hiding the strain in Japan 's relations with big brother

ONCE it was the Walkman. Then it was the PlayStation. Today it is the Toyota Prius that epitomises Japan's technological and industrial prowess. Built by Japan's largest company, which is now on the verge of becoming the world's largest carmaker, the Prius is a hybrid car propelled by the combination of a petrol engine (for range) and an electric motor (for energy-efficiency). The Prius was the first commercial hybrid car and has become by far the most successful, with sales of over 1m since its launch in 1997. Although that is a modest figure compared with Toyota's annual output of around 8m vehicles, it has transformed the company's image. Toyota is now known for greenery and innovation as well as manufacturing efficiency.
But the Prius also symbolises another transformation: that of Japan itself. Just as a hybrid car combines the distinct advantages of petrol and electric propulsion systems, Japan has been developing a new hybrid model of capitalism that brings together aspects of the old Japanese model, which ran into trouble in the early 1990s, with carefully chosen elements of the more dynamic American or Anglo-Saxon variety of capitalism. The resulting hybrid model has been adopted by many firms and has already helped to transform Japan's fortunes. After wrenching political and corporate reforms, the country in 2002 emerged from over a decade of economic stagnation. Since then the recovery, originally export-led, has spread to the economy as a whole (see chart 1, next page). Japanese firms have restructured, paid down their debts and are now posting record profits. The banking system has been cleaned up. Yet despite this progress, Japan still faces huge problems.
Government debt, at around 180% of GDP in the current fiscal year, is the highest for any developed economy (see chart 2, next page). The government will soon have to raise consumption taxes just to stop the debt from growing. Japan also faces a painful demographic squeeze as its population ages and the workforce starts to shrink. This will put a premium on increasing labour-productivity growth, which at 1.2% is only half the OECD average, largely thanks to the hugely inefficient service sector, which accounts for 70% of GDP and two-thirds of employment. Japan's average labour productivity in services fell from 88% of the American level in 1993 to 84% in 2003. This highlights another of Japan's problems: its two-tier economy, made up of an efficient, globalised manufacturing sector and an inefficient, inward-looking services sector.
Japan also risks losing its edge in innovation. Although it spends far above the OECD average on research and development (R&D) as a share of GDP, this money is not always put to good use. The Science Council of Japan estimates that Japan's R&D is only about half as efficient as Europe's and America's. Entrepreneurial start-ups account for only around 4% of firms in Japan, compared with 10% in Europe and over 14% in America, and Japan comes bottom in several rankings of entrepreneurship. Despite the might of its big exporters, Japan is also a laggard in globalisation, with the lowest levels of foreign direct investment, imports and foreign workers in the OECD. With a domestic market that offers little scope for growth, Japan is missing out on opportunities overseas.
Time for a new model
Its old industrial model, which formed the basis of the ""Japanese miracle"" in the second half of the 20th century, was devised under very different circumstances: high growth and a pyramidal population structure, with far more young people than old, notes Atsushi Seike, a labour economist at Keio University in Tokyo. This old model was founded on three main elements: first, lifetime employment, in which workers spend their entire career at the same firm, slowly working their way up the ranks; second, seniority-based pay, which links wages to length of tenure rather than ability; and third, company-specific unions, which promoted close co-operation between unions and management.
Another typically Japanese practice was a close relationship with a ""main bank"" and other companies organised into corporate groups known as keiretsu, bound together by a web of reciprocal cross-shareholdings. The old model was well suited to the times: it delivered social stability and cohesion as Japanese workers pulled together to catch up with Western nations, and helped Japan to become the world's second-biggest economy.
But the population structure has changed beyond recognition and Japan is no longer a developing country, so the old model no longer fits and many of its strengths have become weaknesses. It hinders consolidation among Japanese firms, which is necessary if they are to become more globally competitive. It prevents the efficient redeployment of labour and a proper use of women and elderly workers, which will be vital if Japan is to cope with its ageing population and shrinking workforce. The old model hampers entrepreneurship and innovation in small companies, an important component of a dynamic and responsive economy. All of this acts as a brake on growth. At the same time, Japan needs to become more closely integrated into the global economy, both to gain access to fast-growing foreign markets and to enable competition from foreign firms to spur improvements in the stodgy services sector. That is why a new, more flexible model is needed.
In the late 1990s, when Japan had endured almost a decade of stagnation, the American model seemed to have all the answers--a reversal from the 1980s, when American firms were trying to emulate the seemingly unstoppable Japanese model. America's economy was booming, fuelled by a flourishing technology industry. Its approach seemed more successful at promoting innovation and growth in the internet era, and its vibrant start-up scene was a far cry from Japan's staid big-company capitalism.
So policymakers rewrote corporate law to allow Japanese companies to adopt an American-style model of corporate governance, and some companies began to adopt Anglo-Saxon practices such as performance-based pay, share options, outside directors, promotion based on ability, pursuit of shareholder value and hiring new employees in mid-career. The banking system was recapitalised, cross-shareholdings were unwound and companies embarked on a programme of restructuring. ""But a funny thing happened on Japan's way to the American model--it never got there,"" observes Steven Vogel, a political scientist at the University of California, Berkeley. Many of the reforms met with opposition and were scaled back. Then the dotcom crash and the Enron scandal caused the American model to lose its lustre, to the delight of Japan's old guard.
Instead, forward-looking Japanese firms have devised a hybrid model that combines elements of both the old Japanese and the Anglo-Saxon model. ""We have been going through a process of trial and error, of what to change and what not to change,"" says Fujio Cho, the chairman of Toyota. The effect has been to move Japan somewhat closer to the American way of doing things, at least in some areas and in some companies. ""You pick and choose which bits you adopt,"" says Hirotaka Takeuchi, dean of the school of corporate strategy at Hitotsubashi University. ""Japan has tilted more towards the Anglo-Saxon model, but wants to go its own way. The debate is about how far to tilt.""
Sir Howard Stringer, the first non-Japanese boss of Sony, the Japanese electronics giant, embodies the attempt to combine Japanese and Anglo-Saxon approaches. ""In our company, as in others, there was a lurch towards the Western model,"" he says. ""My job is to manage that without alienating Japanese sensibilities. Some of the virtues of the Japanese model have to be retained. It is a balancing act, sometimes stimulating, sometimes frustrating, but there is merit on both sides."" It helps that he is a foreigner but not an American, admits Welsh-born Sir Howard.
Finding the right balance
But now that the economy is growing again, there is much debate about whether Japan has found the right balance or whether more reform is needed--or even whether it is time to reinstate some of the old ways. After the departure of Junichiro Koizumi, the charismatic and reformist prime minister who held office between 2001 and 2006, there is a sense that the political momentum for change has been lost. Instead, there is growing concern that the spoils of the recovery have not been equitably distributed, and that inequality is rising--a worrying phenomenon for a society in which 75% of people once identified themselves as middle-class.
""There has been a backlash recently, particularly since we recovered from the recession,"" says Mr Seike. This contributed to the fall of Mr Koizumi's successor, Shinzo Abe, who resigned in September. Japan's new prime minister, Yasuo Fukuda, said in his first policy speech in October that ""in promoting structural reform, we have seen disparity and other problems surface."" He was committed to further changes, he said, but would also address the inequalities arising from previous reforms.
Japan is now at a crucial stage. ""Owing to the recent resurgence of the Japanese economy, support for reform is beginning to fade and the future of Japan can be said to be hanging in balance,"" notes a report from Keizai Doyukai, a business lobby. Much of the political wrangling in Japan, and the various takeover battles and showdowns between activist investors and corporate executives, can be seen as part of the debate about how much more Japan needs to change, and how large a component of American or Anglo-Saxon capitalism ought to be incorporated into the new hybrid industrial model. ""Japan has to Anglo-Saxonise, but in a Japanese way,"" says Yasuchika Hasegawa, the vice-chairman of Keizai Doyukai. ""Japan has to find its own capitalism style.""
Not everyone shares his enthusiasm for the hybrid model, which pays more attention to shareholders at the expense of other stakeholders in a company--in particular, its employees. There is obvious ambivalence about the adoption of American practices at Nippon Keidanren, Japan's conservative big-business assocation, which has campaigned to slow the pace of reform. When there are two models, says Masakazu Kubota, Keidanren's managing director, globalisation means the more competitive model will prevail. ""Unfortunately, the most competitive system is in the United States,"" he says.
In part, Keidanren is trying to shield its more dinosaur-like members from reform. But its scepticism reflects a wider concern. Japanese companies are social institutions, providing social cohesion and taking on many roles that in other countries are performed by the state. By contrast, the Anglo-Saxons view companies as money-making machines that can be freely bought, sold, merged and dissolved in order to maximise returns to shareholders. ""What makes Japan interesting is that it's a society having a debate about shareholder versus stakeholder capitalism,"" says David Marra, a Japan specialist at A.T. Kearney, a consultancy. ""Japan is at a potential tipping point for the next few years.""
Yet despite the current political paralysis, reform has taken on its own momentum. The slow drip of legal and regulatory changes, many of them passed by previous administrations or introduced by Japan's powerful bureaucracy, continues. Individually, some of them do not amount to very much, but collectively they add up to a change in the Japanese business environment. ""Retrospectively, the changes during the past decade were significant, and we are a different country now in many respects,"" says Mr Hasegawa.
This special report will look at four of the most important areas of change: corporate governance, the labour market, the climate for entrepreneurs and innovation, and Japan's response to globalisation. It will examine what has changed and what has not; how and where Japan has struck compromises between the Japanese and Anglo-Saxon models; how widely the new hybrid model has been adopted; and whether it will be able to solve Japan's many problems.","After 15 years of gloom , Japan 's companies have emerged with a new , hybrid model a bit closer to America 's , says Tom Standage

"" Yasuo Fukuda was committed to further changes , Yasuo Fukuda said , but would also address the inequalities arising from previous reforms . 
 Japan is now at a crucial stage . "" Owing to the recent resurgence of the Japanese economy , support for reform is beginning to fade and the future of Japan can be said to be hanging in balance , "" notes a report from Keizai Doyukai , a business lobby . Much of the political wrangling in Japan , and the various takeover battles and showdowns between activist investors and corporate executives , can be seen as part of the debate about how much more Japan needs to change , and how large a component of American or Anglo - Saxon capitalism ought to be incorporated into the new hybrid industrial model . "" Japan has to Anglo - Saxonise , but in a Japanese way , "" says Yasuchika Hasegawa , the vice - chairman of Keizai Doyukai . "" Japan has to find its own capitalism style . "" 
 Not everyone shares his enthusiasm for the hybrid model , which pays more attention to shareholders at the expense of other stakeholders in a company -- in particular , its employees . There is obvious ambivalence about the adoption of American practices at Nippon Keidanren , Japan 's conservative big - business assocation , which has campaigned to slow the pace of reform . When there are two models , says Masakazu Kubota , Keidanren 's managing director , globalisation means the more competitive model will prevail . "" Unfortunately , the most competitive system is in the United States , "" he says . 
 In part , Keidanren is trying to shield its more dinosaur - like members from reform . But its scepticism reflects a wider concern . Japanese companies are social institutions , providing social cohesion and taking on many roles that in other countries are performed by the state . By contrast , the Anglo - Saxons view companies as money - making machines that can be freely bought , sold , merged and dissolved in order to maximise returns to shareholders . "" What makes Japan interesting is that it 's a society having a debate about shareholder versus stakeholder capitalism , "" says David Marra , a Japan specialist at A.T. Kearney , a consultancy . "" Japan is at a potential tipping point for the next few years . "" 
 Yet despite the current political paralysis , reform has taken on its own momentum . The slow drip of legal and regulatory changes , many of them passed by previous administrations or introduced by Japan 's powerful bureaucracy , continues . Individually , some of them do not amount to very much , but collectively they add up to a change in the Japanese business environment . "" Retrospectively , the changes during the past decade were significant , and we are a different country now in many respects , "" says Mr Hasegawa . 
 This special report will look at four of the most important areas of change : corporate governance , the labour market , the climate for entrepreneurs and innovation , and Japan 's response to globalisation . It will examine what has changed and what has not ; how and where Japan has struck compromises between the Japanese and Anglo - Saxon models ; how widely the new hybrid model has been adopted ; and whether it will be able to solve Japan 's many problems .",740,Japan,A30-184,IN TERM,True,"Japan 's new prime minister , Yasuo Fukuda",4,True

George Bush hosted a Middle East peace summit in Annapolis, Maryland. As well as the Israeli and Palestinian delegations, Saudi Arabia, Syria and other Arab states also came. The conference ended with a commitment to the goal of a Palestinian state, and a promise of immediate talks, but with no mention of borders, Jerusalem or Jewish settlements on the West Bank. Hamas, the rejectionist Islamist group that controls the Gaza Strip, held a huge rally and denounced Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president.
Zimbabwe's chief statistician said that he can no longer work out the country's inflation rate because there are not enough goods left in the shops to count. In September inflation was reckoned to be almost 8,000%.
The United Nations said that the Sudanese government was obstructing the deployment of a 26,000-strong peacekeeping force in Darfur, which could ""make it impossible for the mission to operate"".

A British teacher, Gillian Gibbons, was charged with blasphemy in Sudan after allowing her class to name a teddy bear Muhammad.
Ruddy good show
After 11 years as Australia's prime minister, John Howard lost an election to Kevin Rudd's Labor Party. Mr Rudd marked his victory by accepting an invitation to this month's climate-change meeting in Bali, and by promising to make a formal apology to Australia's indigenous people for past mistreatment.
Having legitimised his ""re-election"" as Pakistan's president through a handpicked Supreme Court, Pervez Musharraf shed a tear as he relinquished command of the army. The next day he was sworn in as a ""civilian"" president. Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister ousted by Mr Musharraf in a coup in 1999, returned home and filed his nomination for a parliamentary election due on January 8th, even though he still wants other opposition parties to join a boycott of the ballot.
Senior European Union officials flew to Beijing for their annual summit with China. It was marked by sharper-than-usual European criticism of China's mounting trade surplus and weak currency. Nicolas Sarkozy, president of France, preceded the EU in Beijing and oversaw the signing of French contracts worth billions of euros.
At least 16 people were killed in a bomb explosion in Sri Lanka's capital, Colombo. A day earlier the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam described as ""naive"" the hope for peace in its 24-year war with the government.

Troubled streets
Two years after a previous round of riots in Paris's banlieues, a fresh set of disturbances broke out following the deaths of two youths in a motorbike accident involving a police car. As well as the usual car burnings, some rioters used shotguns. President Nicolas Sarkozy promised a tough response.
Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, accused America of stopping international observers from coming to monitor the Russian parliamentary election on December 2nd. The United Russia party that he now heads is expected to win by a landslide.

HOW much has corporate Japan changed in the past decade? A great deal, say optimists, who point to all the things that are different; not enough, say pessimists, who point to everything that has stayed the same. Both are right. In recent years Japanese companies have emerged from the gloom of the 1990s with the help of a new industrial model that combines elements of the old Japanese way of doing things with some carefully chosen bits of American capitalism.
As our special report in this issue argues, the result is a hybrid, an effort to achieve the best of both worlds--rather as a Toyota Prius combines the range of a petrol engine with the energy efficiency of an electric motor. Many Japanese companies now provide merit-based pay and share options, for example, but not to the extent that American firms do. There is more shareholder activism and more mergers and acquisitions, but activists and acquirers are expected to be polite. And although the older salarymen get to keep their jobs for life, the young are less inclined to offer to ""bury their bones"" at the company that first hires them, and are keener on playing the market and moving around.
All of this is to be welcomed, and much of it has been made possible by a steady flow of reforms. But the emergence of the new hybrid model has been accompanied by the worrying creation of a two-tier labour market. The share of ""non-regular"" workers--which includes temporary, part-time and contract workers--has risen from 19% in 1989 to 33% today. Non-regular workers generally earn less than half as much as ""regular"" workers do, and are denied the generous perks and social-insurance coverage that such insiders receive.
During the 1990s companies placed a greater emphasis on non-regular workers, often reducing or freezing the hiring of regular workers, in order to reduce costs. But this tactic poses a long-term threat both to companies and to the economy as a whole. Non-regular workers receive little training, so that Japanese firms run the risk of ending up with a cohort of unskilled, middle-aged non-regular staff. And their low pay is one of the factors that has helped to hold down domestic consumption, making the Japanese economy's moderate recovery in recent years heavily dependent on exports--something that is now the cause of great concern, particularly as demand overseas for Japanese goods weakens.
Japan prides itself on being an egalitarian society. In a survey carried out in 1987, 75% of the population identified themselves as middle class. By last year the figure had fallen to 54%, and the number of people who identified themselves as below middle-class had risen from 20% to 37% over the same period. Worries over rising inequality were cleverly exploited by the opposition in the upper-house elections this summer, which led to the downfall of the prime minister, Shinzo Abe. His successor, Yasuo Fukuda, has pledged to continue along the path of reform while addressing inequality.
The best way to do that would be to focus on further reforms to the labour market, and in particular to reduce the lavish employment protection granted to regular workers, which is one of the reasons why firms hire non-regular workers instead. At the same time, business needs to extend some social-insurance schemes to cover non-regular workers, and improve conditions for non-regular workers with such things as better child-care provision and more training.
And the rest will follow
Some companies have already responded to Japan's moderate recovery by shifting some non-regular workers into regular positions. Other firms should be encouraged to do the same. As well as addressing inequality, this could help to boost consumption. Reducing the protection offered to regular workers would make corporate restructuring easier. And better terms for non-regular workers would encourage more women to enter the workforce and more older people to keep working in semi-retirement, both of which will be necessary as Japan's population ages and the workforce starts to shrink. Entrepreneurship would benefit, too. At the moment anybody in a regular job who has an idea for a new company has a very strong incentive to shelve his idea and stay put. The labour market is, in short, the point at which Japan's various problems overlap, and where further reform is now most urgently required.","Corporate Japan has devised a new industrial model, but further reform is still needed

THE saga that has brought politics in Japan to a halt is nearing its crisis. In July the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) won control of the upper house of the Diet (parliament) from the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which still controls the lower house and governs in coalition with New Komeito, a junior partner. Unlike counterparts in many democracies, Japan's upper house has formidable powers. The constitution never envisaged a split parliament, with the upper house able to veto nearly every government bill. The government could overrule a veto with its two-thirds' majority in the lower house. Yet this weapon has not been used in 50 years, and may backfire, particularly if the public deems its use unwarranted.
This week the upper house began deliberating a bill passed last month that would send the Japanese navy back to the Indian Ocean to provide fuel to American-led operations in Afghanistan. Hardly central to the ""war on terror"", the mission was still the most visible proof that Japan was showing the flag. But it was hurriedly recalled on November 1st, when the DPJ refused to allow an extension to its mandate.
Internationalists in both parties are embarrassed that Japan, yet again, appears weak-kneed over its international responsibilities. Nevertheless the DPJ's leader, Ichiro Ozawa, is playing hardball. He vows to oppose the bill, despite dissent even within his own party. His predecessor as leader, Seiji Maehara, says that to rely on a United Nations mandate to send the army abroad, as Mr Ozawa insists Japan should, ""is to give Russia and China power of veto over Japan's foreign policy.""
Now comes an intense tactical game, which Yasuo Fukuda, prime minister since September, must win to hang on in power. Mr Fukuda has already extended the Diet's current extraordinary session once, until December 15th, so that the refuelling bill can be deliberated in the upper house. But that is not enough time. He might have been tempted to let the bill lapse. He does not believe Japan should join every American-led ""coalition of the willing"". Besides, in early November he held private talks with Mr Ozawa about forging a ""grand coalition"", for which he might have jettisoned the bill. Yet Mr Ozawa's complicity shocked his party's executive. He resigned as DPJ leader, but was hurriedly reinstated for lack of an alternative.
Mr Fukuda has since been to Washington, DC, where he assured Mr Bush he would make every effort to send the ships back to the Indian Ocean. With honour at stake, the prime minister will probably extend the Diet session one last time, waiting for the upper house either to reject the refuelling bill or to sit on it for a full 60 days, which amounts to the same thing. He will then try to ram the bill into law using the coalition's supermajority, and the upper house will probably condemn the government with a motion of no confidence.
Until recently, such a motion was thought dramatic enough to have the prime minister dissolve the government and call a general election. But the game is fast changing. For a start, though no fervent public support exists for the refuelling mission, there is no passionate opposition. And despite a growing defence-procurement scandal, the DPJ has failed to implicate LDP politicians--even Fukushiro Nukaga, now finance minister, to whom scandals usually stick like a faithful dog. Lastly, not everyone in the DPJ really wants a snap election. Though the party is certain to pick up seats, DPJ candidates have yet to be selected for many districts, and even then only a miracle would grant the party a lower-house victory. The odds are rising that Mr Fukuda might shake off the upper-house censure, explain to the country that he tried his best to secure co-operation, and continue as prime minister.
If so, the refuelling saga will prove a mere skirmish before real battle is joined over next year's budget and the livelihood issues that ordinary Japanese care about-- at a time, Sadakazu Tanigaki, the LDP's policy chief, points out, of a soft economy at home and a darkening economic outlook abroad. The Diet's ordinary session will open in January, and the government must pass a budget before the fiscal year beginning on April 1st. Though the lower house can do that alone, the upper house must also approve a raft of bills required if the budget deficit is to be financed and government salaries and contracts paid.
Again, Mr Fukuda will present himself as a model of reasonableness, listening to opposition demands to boost welfare and tackle regional inequalities. Yet meeting such demands would bust the budget. And there will be pressure to pass bills swiftly. Perhaps talk of a grand coalition will resurface. More likely, a budget clash will loom, and Mr Fukuda will use the supermajority once again, this time to keep the government running. If the public blamed him for the confrontation, Mr Fukuda might then feel the need to dissolve the government. Mr Fukuda intends to prove he can be more than a stopgap ""caretaker"" prime minister. But most lower-house politicians expect an election as early as April, and many have run up their campaign posters in readiness for a January snap election--just in case.","Forget the national interest , Japan 's parties are locked in a tactical fight

IN JAPAN'S dynastic politics, even foreign policy is a family business. The most recent prime minister, Shinzo Abe, was the grandson of one prime minister; the incumbent, Yasuo Fukuda, is the first prime minister to follow his father's footsteps into office.
The hawkish Mr Abe indulged in occasional revisionism over Japan's rapine wartime past and espoused a sweeping ""arc of freedom and prosperity"" that was supposed to anchor Japan in a Eurasian community of democratic nations but was in practice a not-particularly-subtle attempt to throw a cordon around a rising China. Though the arc languishes as official policy on the foreign ministry's website, it has in practice been abandoned by Mr Abe's successor.
Thirty years ago Mr Fukuda senior went to Manila and promised South-East Asia that Japan had forever renounced aggression against its neighbours, and would do everything to build confidence and mutual respect. This became known as the Fukuda doctrine. In the practice of it, Mr Fukuda pere opened diplomatic relations with China. Now, Mr Fukuda fils is proving a chip off the old block.
Late last month at the 16-country East Asia Summit in Singapore, the younger Mr Fukuda looked singularly at ease schmoozing with Asia's leaders, most of whom say they value discretion over confrontation. In effect, he assured them that the Fukuda doctrine was alive and well. Though there is no question of Japan abandoning its 60-year alliance with the United States (and neighbours would no doubt be horrified if it did), Mr Fukuda assured them that he would follow a more ""Asia-focused"" policy.
China, in particular, has taken notice. Its leaders have not forgotten the father, and the stripling 71-year-old son will get a warm welcome on a first official trip to Beijing in late December or early January. Where Mr Abe used bluntly to bring up China's human-rights record and its lack of military transparency, people who know Mr Fukuda say that there is no question of his raising such indelicate issues with the Chinese. As an early seasonal gift, his government last month refused to meet the Dalai Lama, who was on a visit to Japan, explaining that the Tibetan leader was not ""important"" enough.
The upshot is that traditionally strained relations between Japan and China look set for a sharp improvement. President Hu Jintao will visit Japan in the spring, and is likely to be invited as a guest to the G8 summit to be held in early July in Hokkaido, in northern Japan. Climate change will top the summit's agenda, and China's pollution record will draw flak, as will its human-rights record soon after, during Beijing's Olympics. Mr Hu will look to Mr Fukuda--if he is indeed still prime minister--to provide friendly covering fire on both counts. The last thing China wants to do in the coming months is undermine Japan's prime minister, and this will help Mr Fukuda, with a minimum of effort, to rise above his domestic problems and look every inch the statesman.","Like father , like son

HOUSES in Japan are supposed to be built to withstand earthquakes. Even so, few of them defy demolition for more than a few decades. The housing stock is amazingly young: more than 60% of all Japanese homes were built after 1980 (see chart on next page). That is because there is almost no market for old homes in Japan. New legislation to be put forward this month will try to remedy that.
The roots of Japan's unusual housing market go back centuries. Buildings were often razed by earthquakes or fire, so durable houses were rare. Earthquake insurance largely did not exist until the 1990s (and even today is little used).
In post-war Japan land has value but buildings do not. The law separates the ownership of the land and the structure, so the two are distinct in Japanese minds. After the war, the government sought to foster private home-ownership by offering tax incentives for new buildings. The policy was a great success. Arguably too great: by 1968 there were more homes than households to occupy them.
At the same time, tax burdens abound for selling land with old buildings. After around 30 years homes are demolished for new ones to spring up. Because the lifetime of houses is short, cheap construction materials are used and the buildings are not maintained. There is no tradition of do-it-yourself home upkeep. Just as there is little interest in secondhand furniture or clothes among the sanitation-obsessed Japanese, so too home-owners prefer to build anew rather than refurbish the old.
There is also a dearth of institutions and expertise that might oil the gears of a market in old houses, from surveyors to judge the quality of a property to banks that assess its value and provide a mortgage. As a result, where 89% of British homes have had more than one owner, and 78% of homes in America and 66% in France, only 13% of Japanese homes have ever been resold.
But attitudes today are changing. The constant rebuilding places an unnecessary drain on people's financial resources, says Koichi Teramoto of the Ministry of Land. A couple easing into retirement may demolish their house to sell the land in order to move into a smaller abode that they must then build from scratch. Although better-built homes cost more up front, they cost far less over time--as much as one-third less after a few generations, according to Mr Teramoto. The ministry also worries that the constant demolition is terrible for the environment.
The costs to the wider economy are also great. A home is more than a man's castle: it is typically his most important financial asset. Not in Japan. For most of the post-war period land prices soared, so the lack of a housing resale market was not a problem. But since the bursting of the property bubble in the early 1990s, most land prices have fallen: some are as much as 80% off their peak. That houses also depreciate in value constrains consumption and adds to deflationary pressures; which in turn pushes people to be particularly cautious savers (more than 50% of Japan's household wealth is kept as cash in bank accounts) and helps to keep interest rates barely above zero.
To remedy the problem, the prime minister, Yasuo Fukuda, this month plans to introduce new tax rules to encourage the construction of more durable buildings. Under a draft of the ""200-year homes"" policy, national, regional and municipal property taxes may be reduced by between 25% and 75% for up to seven years for houses that adhere to robust building standards. Mortgages for such homes can be longer (50 years as opposed to the traditional maximum of 35 years) and building approvals will be simpler.
Property experts think these measures are too timid, however. They argue that a true market for used homes needs standardised methods of construction, as well as more transparency about the quality and value of houses. Far more generous tax incentives are vital too. Until then, homes in Japan will continue to fare like the country's ubiquitous electronic gadgets: be treated as disposable.","Homes in Japan last for only 30 years.

THE Diet, Japan's parliament, this week saw the end of one session, an extraordinary one in every sense, and the start of another that will be ordinary only in name. With the lower house held by his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its allies, and the upper house in the hands of the opposition, Yasuo Fukuda, the prime minister, has an excruciating task in securing the passage of the annual budget.
The extraordinary session was a consequence of the Democratic Party of Japan's victory in the upper-house elections last July. The DPJ's blunt leader, Ichiro Ozawa, vowed to oppose any extension of the navy's mission in the Indian Ocean, where it refuels allies' ships as part of NATO's war in Afghanistan. The government sees the mission as proof of Japan's global commitment; Mr Ozawa says it breaches the country's pacifist constitution.
Mr Ozawa warned Mr Fukuda, who took over as a ""caretaker"" prime minister in September, that the unprecedented use of the LDP's supermajority in the lower house to override upper-house opposition to the refuelling mission would provoke a formal censure from the upper house. And that would surely bring a general election.
Yet on January 11th, when the LDP used its supermajority to reinstate the mission, no censure followed. As for toppling the government, late last year Mr Ozawa held secret talks with Mr Fukuda on forming a ""grand coalition"", an action disowned by his party. If there is any logic to Mr Ozawa's climbdown, it is that the public is indifferent to the refuelling debate. Wages are stagnant and the future of social welfare uncertain: pocketbook matters count. A member of the shadow cabinet says the DPJ is holding its fire for the budget fight. With the economy and stockmarket stumbling, that offers the best chance of bringing down the government.
A drama is certain. The annual budget needs simply to pass the lower house. But all sorts of supplementary bills need upper-house approval. If they do not get it, the ruling coalition could--at some political cost--use its supermajority again. However, procedural rules mean there is not enough time for that before the new fiscal year begins on April 1st. So government programmes might come to a halt, while tax uncertainties would harm investment.
A big battle will be over the renewal of a petrol-tax surcharge, whose proceeds are earmarked for roads and such. If the opposition wills it, petrol will fall by yen24 ($0.22) a litre on April 1st, and Mr Fukuda may be loth to anger consumers by forcing a price rise a few weeks later. But who cares about consumers? Most prefectural governments, including DPJ ones, want the surcharge, to lavish as pork on local building firms. Besides, stalling the budget for political ends could backfire on the opposition. And Mr Fukuda may not use his supermajority powers. Budget matters are not black-or-white, and Mr Fukuda is grey by nature. Compromises are possible.
It is a conundrum for the opposition. Unusually, the opinion polls suggest the DPJ is more popular than the ruling coalition and, for all its internal divisions, it has little to lose from a general election. Yet the election is Mr Fukuda's to call, and he says he will not even think of one until he has hosted the G8 summit, in July.
Most politicians now expect an election not in April but late in the summer. That assumes that Mr Fukuda will weather not just the budget fight, but also an almighty mess of lost records at the pensions agency and a defence-procurement scandal that looks about to claim a former defence minister, Fumio Kyuma.
By the summer, though, Mr Fukuda, the ""caretaker"", may want to hang on longer. He is not bound to call an election until September 2009. Stability, of sorts, then. The price? Continued political chaos and none of the bold measures badly needed to set the economy on a firmer footing.

HIS meaty hands cupped his face, shielding it from cameras in the back of a police car. Masanori Fujii was one of three wrestlers and a former trainer arrested on February 7th for killing a 17-year-old sumo trainee in June. The body of the young recruit, Takashi Saito, was riddled with cigarette burns, bruises from baseball-bat blows and the scar from a beer bottle smashed against his forehead. His right ear was torn off. Initially, his trainer, or ""stablemaster"", denied hitting Mr Saito, who had several times tried to run away from the stable. The police ascribed the death to ""natural causes"" and the powerful Japan Sumo Association (JSA) accepted it.
Only when the stablemaster, Junichi Yamamoto, pressed the family to cremate the body quickly did the father demand an autopsy. It turned out Mr Yamamoto had wielded the bottle and ordered the three wrestlers to inflict more punishment. The death has shocked Japan. Even Yasuo Fukuda, the prime minister, said he took the incident very seriously and that it was important how the JSA deals with it.
But reforming sumo, which has a history of more than 2,000 years, is not easy. The JSA was founded in 1927 and has been scandal-prone ever since. In the 1930s a group of leading wrestlers left the JSA and created an independent sumo league to protest at unfair financial arrangements. More recently the JSA has been accused of tolerating match-rigging and its leaders of tax evasion.
The opaque self-governing institution oversees all aspects of sumo: organising matches, setting rules, promoting the sport and running its finances. An investigation released in December found that over 90% of stables hit wrestlers with sticks. In theory the JSA is supervised by the education ministry. But it is truly a law unto itself.
It comprises 105 ""elders"", highly ranked former wrestlers, who all own a share in the JSA, much like partners in a law firm. Shares are passed down from a retiring stablemaster to his prized retired wrestler, or sold to another former champion. Stablemasters (now numbering 53) must own one. A share costs around $2m and has fetched as much as $4m.
It is hard for former wrestlers to make a living outside the ring. A share in the JSA is usually their only financial asset. Little wonder the JSA's elders resist calls for openness and accountability. Reform would probably entail a loss of money and status--and give people other than wrestlers a say in how the sport should be run.
Life in the stables is gruelling. Some recruits are virtual prisoners, either because quitting is considered betrayal or for financial reasons: the JSA provides stables a basic sum of $20,000 a year or more for each wrestler. So there is an incentive to drag back runaways, such as Mr Saito.
At the Oshima stable in eastern Tokyo one morning this week, 11 wrestlers collided, grunted, panted and tumbled their way through morning practice. One was occasionally slammed to a wall. Another was repeatedly thrown down, only to return to the ring gasping ""gottsuan desu"" (""thank you for the practice""). But when the training ended, the howls of pain soon changed to laughter.
The JSA took months before it expelled Mr Yamamoto, the stablemaster accused of killing the teenager. On February 1st it renewed its chairman for a fourth term, suggesting all is business as usual. That the police took almost eight months before making arrests underscores the degree to which officialdom tends to leave the JSA to itself. Sumo's origins lie in Shintoism; even today wrestlers are treated as deities and the JSA elders consider themselves high priests protecting sacred traditions. Yet the JSA's self-governance does depend on its doing some governing.","Scandal rocks the national sport

THE ghost of Japan's ""lost decade"" haunts the United States. As the consequences of America's burst housing bubble are felt through financial markets, it has become popular to ask whether Japan's awful experience of boom-and-bust has lessons for other rich countries facing, at best, sharp slowdowns. Japan's property-and-stockmarket bubble burst in 1990, creating bad loans equivalent in the end to about one-fifth of GDP. The economy began growing properly again only 12 years later, and only in 2005 could Japan say it had put financial stress and debt-deflation behind it. Even today the country's nominal GDP remains below its peak in the 1990s--a brutal measure of lost opportunities.
Yet ghosts can deceive. Similarities exist between Japan then and America today, notably the way that a financial crisis threatens the ""real"" economy. But the differences outnumber them. Japan should indeed be a source of worry--not, however, because other rich countries are destined for the same economic plughole, but because it is the world's second-biggest economy and it has not tackled the fundamental causes of its malaise.
A tale of two crunches
Even by today's gloomiest assumptions, Japan's bust dwarfs America's, if in part because its boom did too. Take for instance the collapse in the equity market. America's S&P 500 is down just 8% from its 1999 peak. The Nikkei 225 share index is now nearly two-thirds below its 1989 peak. In commercial property the comparison between the two boom-and-busts is almost as dramatic.
The more important difference, though, is how each country got into its mess and then responded to it. In America, the government can be blamed for inadequate oversight of the vast market in slicing and dicing mortgages, but it has reacted aggressively to the bust, with monetary and fiscal stimulus. Financial institutions are busy declaring their losses. In Japan, the government was deeply complicit in puffing up the market and complicit, too, in hiding the ensuing mess for years.
Japan's economy is still held back by its politicians (see pages 30-32). Though much has changed since 1990, a cyclical slowdown is now laying bare Japan's structural shortcomings. A few years ago, people hoped that Japan, which is still a bigger economic power than China and has some marvellous companies, would help take up some of the slack in the world economy if America tired; that now looks unlikely. Productivity is disastrously low: the return on new investment is around half that in America. Consumption is still flagging, thanks in part to companies' failure to increase wages. Bureaucratic blunders have cost the economy dearly, and Japan needs a swathe of reforms to trade and competition without which the economy will continue to disappoint.
The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has ruled for the best part of half a century and remains a machine of pork and patronage, has given up trying to tackle these problems. What reformist tendencies it had under the maverick Junichiro Koizumi, prime minister between 2001 and 2006, have now gone into reverse. To make matters worse, last July the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) won control of the upper house of the Diet (parliament). The constitution never envisaged upper and lower houses of the Diet being controlled by opposing parties, and since the upper house has nearly equal powers to the lower one, the opposition can frustrate virtually every government initiative.
Thus Yasuo Fukuda, prime minister since September, spent his first four months in office fighting to reauthorise a solitary refuelling ship operating in the Indian Ocean. Now the government is locked in grinding battles with the DPJ over bills to authorise a budget for the fiscal year that starts in April and to appoint a new governor of the Bank of Japan on March 19th.
But the problem is not merely a constitutional one. Japan is at an uncomfortable point: no longer a one-party state, yet still far from being a competitive democracy with rival parties alternating in power. Both main parties are riven by contradictions: both contain modernisers alongside a grizzled old guard of conservatives and socialists. Political chaos has allowed the old forces within the LDP--the factions, the conservative bureaucrats, the builders and the farmers--to reassert their influence. Meanwhile, the DPJ's leader, Ichiro Ozawa, who used to have a reformist streak, now sounds like an old-style LDP boss.
Japan's politics is skidding for the buffers. The crash may come as early as March, over budget differences. One way to avoid it, some politicians think, is for the LDP and the DPJ to form the kind of ""grand coalition"" which Mr Fukuda and Mr Ozawa talked about in November. This plan was thwarted when the rest of the DPJ leadership, rightly, balked: in effect, it would have taken Japan back towards being a one-party state, distributing largesse rather than reforming the economy.
Time for a good wash
Yet the buffers may be the best place for Japan. Or rather, a general election--perhaps a string of elections--offers the best chance of forcing parties to confront their inconsistencies, offering voters real choices rather than candidates who compete to bring home the bacon.
There are glimmers of hope. A cross-party group of modernising politicians, academics and businessmen has formed a pressure group, Sentaku (with connotations both of choice and of giving things a good wash). Radically, they want to decentralise the top-heavy system in which local politicians are in thrall to Tokyo's pork providers; they think the main parties should campaign on coherent manifestos; and they are urging ordinary Japanese, who do not readily bother their heads about such things, to reflect on the folly of voting for politicians who smother their districts in unused highways and bridges that lead nowhere--the visible blight of failed politics.
Many politicians say a general election would only add to the chaos. That is the argument of a political class grown fat on a broken system. Voters need a chance to start putting it right. If choice is chaos, bring it on.","The world 's second - biggest economy is still in a funk -- and politics is the problem 
 THE ghost of Japan 's "" lost decade "" haunts the United States . As the consequences of America 's burst housing bubble are felt through financial markets , it has become popular to ask whether Japan 's awful experience of boom - and - bust has lessons for other rich countries facing , at best , sharp slowdowns . Japan 's property - and - stockmarket bubble burst in 1990 , creating bad loans equivalent in the end to about one - fifth of GDP . The economy began growing properly again only 12 years later , and only in 2005 could Japan say it had put financial stress and debt - deflation behind it . Even today the country 's nominal GDP remains below its peak in the 1990s -- a brutal measure of lost opportunities . 
 Yet ghosts can deceive . Similarities exist between Japan then and America today , notably the way that a financial crisis threatens the "" real "" economy . But the differences outnumber them . Japan should indeed be a source of worry -- not , however , because other rich countries are destined for the same economic plughole , but because it is the world 's second - biggest economy and it has not tackled the fundamental causes of its malaise . 
 A tale of two crunches 
 Even by today 's gloomiest assumptions , Japan 's bust dwarfs America 's , if in part because its boom did too . Take for instance the collapse in the equity market . America 's S&P 500 is down just 8 % from its 1999 peak . The Nikkei 225 share index is now nearly two - thirds below its 1989 peak . In commercial property the comparison between the two boom - and - busts is almost as dramatic . 
 The more important difference , though , is how each country got into its mess and then responded to it . In America , the government can be blamed for inadequate oversight of the vast market in slicing and dicing mortgages , but it has reacted aggressively to the bust , with monetary and fiscal stimulus . Financial institutions are busy declaring their losses . In Japan , the government was deeply complicit in puffing up the market and complicit , too , in hiding the ensuing mess for years . 
 Japan 's economy is still held back by its politicians ( see pages 30 - 32 ) . Though much has changed since 1990 , a cyclical slowdown is now laying bare Japan 's structural shortcomings . A few years ago , people hoped that Japan , which is still a bigger economic power than China and has some marvellous companies , would help take up some of the slack in the world economy if America tired ; that now looks unlikely . Productivity is disastrously low : the return on new investment is around half that in America . Consumption is still flagging , thanks in part to companies ' failure to increase wages . Bureaucratic blunders have cost the economy dearly , and Japan needs a swathe of reforms to trade and competition without which the economy will continue to disappoint . 
 The Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) , which has ruled for the best part of half a century and remains a machine of pork and patronage , has given up trying to tackle these problems . What reformist tendencies it had under the maverick Junichiro Koizumi , prime minister between 2001 and 2006 , have now gone into reverse . To make matters worse , last July the opposition Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) won control of the upper house of the Diet ( parliament ) . The constitution never envisaged upper and lower houses of the Diet being controlled by opposing parties , and since the upper house has nearly equal powers to the lower one , the opposition can frustrate virtually every government initiative . 
 Thus Yasuo Fukuda , spent Yasuo Fukuda's first four months in office fighting to reauthorise a solitary refuelling ship operating in the Indian Ocean . Now the government is locked in grinding battles with the DPJ over bills to authorise a budget for the fiscal year that starts in April and to appoint a new governor of the Bank of Japan on March 19th . 
 But the problem is not merely a constitutional one . Japan is at an uncomfortable point : no longer a one - party state , yet still far from being a competitive democracy with rival parties alternating in power . Both main parties are riven by contradictions : both contain modernisers alongside a grizzled old guard of conservatives and socialists . Political chaos has allowed the old forces within the LDP -- the factions , the conservative bureaucrats , the builders and the farmers -- to reassert their influence . Meanwhile , the DPJ 's leader , Ichiro Ozawa , who used to have a reformist streak , now sounds like an old - style LDP boss .

TEN years ago Japan was on the point of financial and economic meltdown, with a political establishment utterly incapable of facing up to the crisis. Those Japanese who cared coined a not altogether pleasing English phrase: ""Japan passing"", implying not only that the world's second biggest economy was being passed by in a fast-changing world, but also that Japan could no longer even be taken seriously. A headline in The Economist at the time tried to sum up the situation more pithily: ""Japan's amazing ability to disappoint"".
Until recently, that dreadful time could be regarded as an awful nightmare from which the country had woken up, for Japan seemed to be starting to live up to expectations. A razzle-dazzle prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, came to office in 2001, appearing to bring profound change both to the political establishment and to its ability to deal with economic problems which had festered since Japan's asset bubble burst in 1990.
Mr Koizumi forced banks and companies to clear up piles of bad loans. Companies, thus unburdened, started to make money once more, and from early 2002 the economy began to grow again. Mr Koizumi appeared to have weakened the special interests--farmers, the construction ministry, senior bureaucrats--to which his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) had long been in thrall and which had supported its near-unbroken rule over the past half-century. In effect, Mr Koizumi declared war on the old-style LDP.
Voters loved it. Under Mr Koizumi's banner of market-minded reform, they delivered a stunning general-election victory to the LDP and its coalition partner, New Komeito, in September 2005. When Mr Koizumi retired a year later, there was a widespread belief that Japan was set fair for economic modernisation.
Yet once more there is talk of ""Japan passing"". The stockmarket has fallen alarmingly since last summer, and has been in open rout for much of 2008 (see chart on next page). Measured by the Nikkei 225 share index, Japanese shares are 27% below last year's July high: deep bear-market territory. Share prices are now back to their levels of September 2005--not even half where they stood 20 years ago. In January foreign investors pulled record amounts out of the Japanese stockmarket. Ask any money manager: Japan still has an amazing ability to disappoint.
The latest doubts concern the robustness of Japan's four-year recovery, during which the economy has grown at a remarkably steady 2% or so a year. Though the most recent GDP estimate, for the last quarter of 2007, suggests above-average growth, many economists point out that the series is notoriously volatile, business investment has probably been exaggerated, and the quarterly growth figure will therefore very likely be revised downwards. Economists at Goldman Sachs said in late January that the economy was already in recession; others who are not so sure claim it is a close-run thing.
Meanwhile, political chaos has reigned since last summer. It has unseated one prime minister, Shinzo Abe, who succeeded Mr Koizumi but resigned under nervous and physical strain in September 2007. And it has ensured only the vaguest grip on power for his successor, Yasuo Fukuda. The chaos was set in train when the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), led by Ichiro Ozawa, became the dominant party in the upper house of the Diet (parliament) last July after elections for half the chamber's seats. It has now brought the impetus for growth-boosting reforms, or indeed for any joined-up policymaking at all, to a halt.
So now the LDP's Diet-affairs chairman, Tadamori Oshima, responsible for pushing through Mr Fukuda's agenda, such as it is, despairs that ""investors and political establishments around the world take one look at Japan today and conclude that we politicians are incapable of deciding on anything, not even whether to put one foot in front of the other."" With foreign investors selling out, says Mr Oshima, Japan is fast becoming as irrelevant as it was a decade ago. He asks this British correspondent to prescribe a decent shinguru moruto--single malt--for his depression.
Despair is spreading among the political class responsible for the mess. If the opposition deplored the ""absence of a framework to sustain economic growth"", you might take it with a pinch of salt. But the admission comes from none other than the economy minister, Hiroko Ota, who for good measure says that Japan can no longer be considered a ""top-tier"" economy. Although she identifies the problem correctly, she has disappointingly little to say about how to solve it.
Demographics darken Japan's prospects further. Its population is greying faster than that of any other big economy, so the old will become an increasing burden on workers. Today, one-fifth of Japanese are over 65; by 2015 the proportion will grow to one in four, or about 30m. Now, with Japan's birth rate well below replacement, at 1.32, and with little immigration to speak of, the population of 127m has already started to shrink and will fall each year by about 0.6% over the next half-century. It is predicted to drop below 100m by mid-century. Already, rural regions are emptying, and the shutters are closing on the centres of more and more small towns. Without robust economic growth, Japan faces pain, especially since the government has racked up high levels of national debt in an attempt to spend its way out of its post-bubble slump.
The bureaucrats' blunders
Even though companies are far sounder than they were a decade ago, with fewer debts and more focused operations, Japan's productivity is still pitifully low. A lack of investment is not the problem. Rather, low interest rates, an export boom and a business environment in which managers are scarcely accountable to shareholders may have generated too much of the stuff. Indeed, as Andrew Smithers of Smithers & Co points out, high investment and slow growth mean that Japan's return on new investment is around half the level in America. At least companies, notably Japan's exporters, have been making record profits. But now the impact on exports of higher oil prices, coupled with a sharp rise in the yen since last summer--a consequence largely of financial-market volatility--throws that profitability into question. That is even before considering what harm an American-led slowdown might do.
Were Japan's recovery broad-based, an export slowdown would matter less, because domestic consumption would take up the slack. Yet despite repeated predictions from economists, household spending has failed to follow a rise in business investment and exports.
The reason again lies with companies. Even where they have been making record profits, companies have hoarded their cash rather than pay more out in the form of higher wages, which have stagnated even as employment has increased. Now that a stronger yen and dearer oil are eating into profit margins, the situation may not improve soon. As a result, Mr Smithers notes, even after drawing down savings this decade, households still consume a smaller proportion of GDP than in any other rich country. It raises a question: was the path that Mr Koizumi chose to get Japan out of the economic swamp misguided, at least in part? By emphasising low interest rates (good for indebted companies but bad for savers) and low wages (ditto) to help companies out of their mess, Japan's economy has depended too much on exports and is now worryingly vulnerable to external shocks.
Politicians complain about firms' tendency to hoard cash, and urge firms to pay workers more. Yet the incompetence and unpredictability of politicians helps explain the companies' caution. A year ago, for instance, in a well-intentioned attempt to crack down on predatory lending, the government all but destroyed the consumer-finance industry.
A more serious episode still started last summer, when a system for vetting new buildings was introduced in reaction to the faking of earthquake-proofing data--itself a reaction to hasty new regulation brought in a few years back. The housing ministry was unable to get new software for the new system running in time. New-building approvals ground to a halt, and new construction fell by 40%.
Slowly, matters are righting themselves--new construction in December was just one-fifth below levels a year earlier. But the extraordinary effect of a single bureaucratic bungle has been to knock 0.6 percentage points off Japan's growth. The building-standards fiasco was one reason for the reduction in the government's growth forecast for the fiscal year to the end of March, from 2.1% to 1.3%.
These costly blunders were committed even before July's elections divided the Diet; with the current political chaos, the risks of things going wrong is still higher. The incompetence of politicians and bureaucrats does not just lead to expensive short-term disasters; it also threatens Japan's long-term growth prospects.
Japan needs a mass of economic reforms--a more open climate to foreign investment, for instance, lower tariffs on imported food, fewer subsidies for farmers, freer trade, better tax treatment of foreign companies, the abolition of a welter of business subsidies, a more flexible labour market, greater fiscal rectitude (national debt is currently around 180% of GDP), more accountability by pension funds and insurance companies, further privatisation of services and much more. Takatoshi Ito of Tokyo University, who sits on the Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy, the government's advisory body that drove structural reform during the Koizumi years, has calculated the economic benefit of pursuing the reforms the CEFP advocates, and the costs of abandoning them. Pursue reform, he argues, and Japan should be able to grow at a respectable 2% a year. Abandon it, and growth will crawl along at 1-1.4%.
And crawl it will, if Mr Ito is right, because Japan has abandoned reform. Blame a political establishment of underwhelming talent and vision, and an almighty constitutional mess.
First in line for blame is Mr Abe. Though he came to office as a self-styled reformer, nothing he has ever said or done suggests an interest in improving the economy. Once in office, he seems to have calculated that Japan would chug happily along, leaving him to pursue pet nationalist themes such as inculcating patriotism in schools. A tin ear for other issues left him oblivious to a growing chorus of dismay at decaying country towns, sluggish wage growth and a growing scandal of bureaucratic incompetence and corruption in the state pension system. On top of that, Mr Abe's government, though short-lived, was dogged by a seemingly endless series of financial scandals. The LDP's upper-house defeat was the punishment. Amazingly, Mr Abe appears to think he deserves another shot at high office--at 53, he is young by the standards of Japanese politicians.
Second in line are the ancient crocodiles of the LDP. In a panic, they closed around Mr Fukuda, who at 71 is the face of experience over Mr Abe's callow youth. Under Mr Koizumi and Mr Abe, decision-making had devolved from the LDP corridors to the prime minister and even as far down as the cabinet. Under Mr Fukuda, power has flowed back to the factions and to the party gerontocrats--notably two former prime ministers, Yasuhiro Nakasone (89) and Yoshiro Mori (70) as well as Tsuneo Watanabe (81), publisher of Japan's biggest-circulation newspaper, the Yomiuri Shimbun. It was Mr Watanabe who arranged the farcical secret meetings late last year between Mr Ozawa, leader of the opposition DPJ, and Mr Fukuda about forming a ""grand coalition""--though he has not since bothered to inform his newspaper's readers about that.
Taking back the car keys
In effect, a generational coup has taken place, with the keys to the political car taken back by the oldies. The result is that structural change is on hold. Negotiations to lower trade barriers with other countries have slowed. Tax reform to set the budget on an even keel has been put off. A senior reform-minded civil servant says that morale among modernising bureaucrats, those that favour privatisation and more competition, has sunk. None of them, he says, now dares propose growth-boosting reforms--as they used to under Mr Koizumi and even Mr Abe--for fear of incurring the disfavour of their political masters. Meanwhile, attacks on foreign investment are on the rise again among politicians and old-guard civil servants.
Mr Fukuda understands Japan's problems better than Mr Abe did. He spelt some of them out in his policy address to the Diet's new session last month: he underlined the need to overcome labour-market rigidities that discourage women and the elderly, and discriminate against Japan's army of workers who can find only temporary jobs. He bemoaned Japan's feeble standing as an international financial centre, thanks in part to hostility to foreign investment. He stressed the importance of putting the government's rickety finances to rights, and he has since championed the cause of consumers.
Yet both allies and opponents alike believe he has neither the gumption nor the authority forcefully to push for these goals. In particular, the government already looks like missing a long-agreed target to balance the budget, before interest payments, by 2011. In the government's latest budget, for the fiscal year beginning in April, the LDP's traditional clients, farmers and road-builders, are getting goodies denied them in recent years.
Third in line for blame comes the DPJ's Mr Ozawa. His party's ranks have plenty of young politicians favouring market-driven reforms. Deploring the one-party state that Japan has largely been under the LDP since the second world war, this bunch thinks Japan would be better served by competitive parties alternating in power. Perhaps Mr Ozawa does, too. After all, nearly two decades ago when he himself was a baron in the LDP, he first launched the debate about how Japan should modernise long before the political establishment was thinking about it. Ever since he stormed out of the LDP, he has vowed to bring it down.
Mr Ozawa's style, however, if occasionally brilliant, is also thin-skinned and autocratic: he does his deals in the shadows without consulting colleagues. These are hardly the right qualities for the leader of a party that makes such a great show of transparency and accountability.
Meanwhile, his mercurial character has only got more erratic. Since campaigning as the farmer's friend--admittedly a successful strategy in the upper-house elections, where rural votes carried a disproportionate weight--Mr Ozawa has come to sound like the old-style LDP bosses against whom he once turned. That unsettles the modernisers in his party, most of whom represent urban, more reform-minded constituencies.
And how else, apart from ascribing a growing erratic streak to Mr Ozawa, to explain the extraordinary about-face last November, when he switched from vowing to bring down Mr Fukuda and his government to cutting private deals with the prime minister? To the DPJ's modernisers, a grand coalition would spell doom to the party, which defines itself precisely by offering itself as an alternative to the LDP. Younger parliamentarians have become so dissatisfied with Mr Ozawa that Yukio Hatoyama, the DPJ's secretary-general, now says that he, and not Mr Ozawa, is answerable to the party caucus. It is a hint that Mr Ozawa, at least for the time being, has agreed to cede some authority.
Yet Mr Ozawa has a gun to the party's head. He knows that a split over his leadership might cause the DPJ to crumble. And should he choose to leave (he has flounced out of parties before), a handful of parliamentarians leaving with him would mean that the DPJ would almost certainly lose its upper-house majority.
Most of all, perhaps, blame two parties bursting with internal contradictions, a constitution that never envisaged opposing parties controlling the Diet's two chambers, and a culture that treats politics as a personal, sometimes family, business, not a means of offering voters choices about how their country should be run. An election would not solve these problems, but it might at least encourage parties to tell voters what they stand for.
Lastly, the voters must take some of the blame. Ten years ago, when The Economist lamented Japan's amazing ability to disappoint, one shrewd parliamentarian wrote in to challenge that. The headline, he said, should have read: ""The Japanese people's amazing inability to be disappointed"". A general election would at least give them the chance to start holding their politicians to a higher standard.

On top of that , Mr Abe 's government , though short - lived , was dogged by a seemingly endless series of financial scandals . The LDP 's upper - house defeat was the punishment . Amazingly , Mr Abe appears to think he deserves another shot at high office -- at 53 , he is young by the standards of Japanese politicians . 
 Second in line are the ancient crocodiles of the LDP . In a panic , they closed around Mr Fukuda , who at 71 is the face of experience over Mr Abe 's callow youth . Under Mr Koizumi and Mr Abe , decision - making had devolved from the LDP corridors to the prime minister and even as far down as the cabinet . Under Yasuo Fukuda , power has flowed back to the factions and to the party gerontocrats -- notably two former prime ministers , Yasuhiro Nakasone ( 89 ) and Yoshiro Mori ( 70 ) as well as Tsuneo Watanabe ( 81 ) , publisher of Japan 's biggest - circulation newspaper , the Yomiuri Shimbun . It was Mr Watanabe who arranged the farcical secret meetings late last year between Mr Ozawa , leader of the opposition DPJ , and Yasuo Fukuda about forming a "" grand coalition""--though he has not since bothered to inform his newspaper 's readers about that . 
 Taking back the car keys 
 In effect , a generational coup has taken place , with the keys to the political car taken back by the oldies . The result is that structural change is on hold . Negotiations to lower trade barriers with other countries have slowed . Tax reform to set the budget on an even keel has been put off . A senior reform - minded civil servant says that morale among modernising bureaucrats , those that favour privatisation and more competition , has sunk . None of them , he says , now dares propose growth - boosting reforms -- as they used to under Mr Koizumi and even Mr Abe -- for fear of incurring the disfavour of their political masters . Meanwhile , attacks on foreign investment are on the rise again among politicians and old - guard civil servants . 
 Yasuo Fukuda understands Japan 's problems better than Mr Abe did . Yasuo Fukuda spelt some of them out in Yasuo Fukuda's policy address to the Diet 's new session last month : Yasuo Fukuda underlined the need to overcome labour - market rigidities that discourage women and the elderly , and discriminate against Japan 's army of workers who can find only temporary jobs . Yasuo Fukuda bemoaned Japan 's feeble standing as an international financial centre , thanks in part to hostility to foreign investment . Yasuo Fukuda stressed the importance of putting the government 's rickety finances to rights , and Yasuo Fukuda has since championed the cause of consumers . 
 Yet both allies and opponents alike believe Yasuo Fukuda has neither the gumption nor the authority forcefully to push for these goals . In particular , the government already looks like missing a long - agreed target to balance the budget , before interest payments , by 2011 . In the government 's latest budget , for the fiscal year beginning in April , the LDP 's traditional clients , farmers and road - builders , are getting goodies denied them in recent years . 
 Third in line for blame comes the DPJ 's Mr Ozawa . His party 's ranks have plenty of young politicians favouring market - driven reforms . Deploring the one - party state that Japan has largely been under the LDP since the second world war , this bunch thinks Japan would be better served by competitive parties alternating in power . Perhaps Mr Ozawa does , too . After all , nearly two decades ago when he himself was a baron in the LDP , he first launched the debate about how Japan should modernise long before the political establishment was thinking about it . Ever since he stormed out of the LDP , he has vowed to bring it down . 
 Mr Ozawa 's style , however , if occasionally brilliant , is also thin - skinned and autocratic : he does his deals in the shadows without consulting colleagues . These are hardly the right qualities for the leader of a party that makes such a great show of transparency and accountability . 
 Meanwhile , his mercurial character has only got more erratic . Since campaigning as the farmer 's friend -- admittedly a successful strategy in the upper - house elections , where rural votes carried a disproportionate weight -- Mr Ozawa has come to sound like the old - style LDP bosses against whom he once turned . That unsettles the modernisers in his party , most of whom represent urban , more reform - minded constituencies . 
 And how else , apart from ascribing a growing erratic streak to Mr Ozawa , to explain the extraordinary about - face last November , when he switched from vowing to bring down Yasuo Fukuda and Yasuo Fukuda's government to cutting private deals with Yasuo Fukuda ? To the DPJ 's modernisers , a grand coalition would spell doom to the party , which defines itself precisely by offering itself as an alternative to the LDP . Younger parliamentarians have become so dissatisfied with Mr Ozawa that Yukio Hatoyama , the DPJ 's secretary - general , now says that he , and not Mr Ozawa , is answerable to the party caucus . It is a hint that Mr Ozawa , at least for the time being , has agreed to cede some authority . 
 Yet Mr Ozawa has a gun to the party 's head . He knows that a split over his leadership might cause the DPJ to crumble . And should he choose to leave ( he has flounced out of parties before ) , a handful of parliamentarians leaving with him would mean that the DPJ would almost certainly lose its upper - house majority . 
 Most of all , perhaps , blame two parties bursting with internal contradictions , a constitution that never envisaged opposing parties controlling the Diet 's two chambers , and a culture that treats politics as a personal , sometimes family , business , not a means of offering voters choices about how their country should be run . An election would not solve these problems , but it might at least encourage parties to tell voters what they stand for . 
 Lastly , the voters must take some of the blame . Ten years ago , when The Economist lamented Japan 's amazing ability to disappoint , one shrewd parliamentarian wrote in to challenge that . The headline , he said , should have read : "" The Japanese people 's amazing inability to be disappointed "" . A general election would at least give them the chance to start holding their politicians to a higher standard .

THE governor of the Bank of Japan (BoJ), Toshihiko Fukui, stands down on March 19th, and his successor had long been a given: Toshiro Muto, Mr Fukui's able deputy. Yet for weeks, the government of Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda has put off an announcement of Mr Muto's nomination, since resistance to him has grown within the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), which controls the upper house of the Diet (parliament). The succession has come down disturbingly close to the wire.
Within the DPJ, grounds for opposing Mr Muto vary. Some members dislike how the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) came up with its candidate the usual way--behind closed doors--and want a more transparent process. Others weigh Mr Muto's five years at the central bank against his 37 years at the overbearing Ministry of Finance, and fear for the bank's new-won independence.
Meanwhile, a political debate about monetary policy is also growing. After years of interest rates at zero to counter deflation, Mr Fukui had hoped to leave office having ""normalised"" monetary policy--that is, to bring rates up to Japan's nominal growth rate of 1.5-2%. But he moved too late, having raised rates only to 0.5% before America's credit bust and signs of a cyclical slowdown in Japan made further hikes politically objectionable. Most bank-watchers assume that the BoJ will not be able to raise rates again until the Federal Reserve next tightens, an event that is not in the foreseeable future. In the meantime, some within the LDP call for rates to be cut to zero again.
Curiously, opposition voices, backed by some economists, argue loudest for continued normalisation. Japan's low interest rates, they say, have not boosted the economy. In particular, savers have earned poor returns, so depressing consumption. Raising rates, by contrast, would put money in people's pockets, while also breaking Japan's deflationary mindset. In that context some favour Yutaka Yamaguchi, a former BoJ deputy governor who now advises investment banks. Mr Yamaguchi is thought by his promoters to favour faster normalisation. Kazuo Ueda, an academic and former member of the BoJ's policy board, has supporters in both camps, as does Haruhido Kuroda, head of the Asian Development Bank. For the moment, Mr Muto remains the likeliest candidate. Still, that others are even in the running at this late stage is a measure of Japan's political confusion.

THE troubles that seized Japan's politics last summer are approaching a crisis. After winning control of the upper house of the Diet (parliament) in July, the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) has two issues it can use to frustrate the government led by Yasuo Fukuda and perhaps bring it down. 
The first is the choice of a new governor for the Bank of Japan to replace Toshihiko Fukui, whose term expired on March 19th; in recent days Mr Fukuda's handling of the succession has descended into farce. The second issue is the budget for the tax year that begins on April 1st. This includes government proposals to renew a levy on petrol which, thanks to a powerful lobby within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) known as the doro zoku or ""road tribe"", is earmarked for building roads no one needs. The opposition's leader, Ichiro Ozawa, has vowed to oppose the ""temporary"" levy, now in place for over 30 years, as an emblem of the pork and patronage that lie at the heart of much that is wrong in Japan's politics.
The LDP-led coalition chose Mr Fukuda as prime minister for his competence and authority. Little of either has been evident in his handling of the succession at the central bank. DPJ members have long signalled their opposition to the government's first choice as new governor, Toshiro Muto, Mr Fukui's deputy. To some, it is Mr Muto's long career at the overbearing Ministry of Finance that counts against him; to others, he lacks international experience when it is most needed, at a time of turmoil in global markets (see page 101).
For weeks the government postponed the nomination, suggesting it was looking for a compromise candidate. It then announced Mr Muto. After the DPJ-led upper house predictably vetoed that nomination, the government proposed on March 16th that Mr Fukui should serve a second term. Even LDP members admit that this suggestion showed a breath-taking lack of due diligence, since Mr Fukui's political support crumbled two years ago, after he had admitted to placing undeclared investments with a financier later found guilty of insider dealing. 
So, on March 18th, the government proposed a new candidate: Koji Tanami, once the top official at the finance ministry. The DPJ vetoed him too, on the ground that he is even more of an apparatchik than Mr Muto and has no expertise in monetary policy. At midweek a new deputy governor, Masaaki Shirakawa, looked likely, at least for a while, to fill the vacuum--an unnecessary one, since candidates acceptable to both sides have been there for the choosing all along, notably Haruhiko Kuroda, head of the Asian Development Bank. By not putting him forward, Mr Fukuda showed himself unable and unwilling even to pick up the phone to the opposition. He also exposed a breakdown within his own administration. The prime minister's relations with his chief cabinet secretary and main gatekeeper, Nobutaka Machimura, are particularly bad.
A blow to credibility, then, even before Mr Fukuda's bigger fight, over the budget. The budget itself has already passed; it needs the approval only of the lower house, where Mr Fukuda commands a majority. Yet several supplementary measures, including the petrol levy as well as tax breaks on foreign funds invested in Japan, need upper-house approval, too. Mr Ozawa wants revenues from the levy to be put into the general tax pot, undercutting the road tribe. Some members of the LDP who resent the road-builders propose that the levy could be shifted into general revenue over three years. Mr Fukuda himself suggests he will compromise. 
But it is unclear how much compromise Mr Ozawa will accept. Katsuya Okada, a former leader of the DPJ, says that with power apparently slipping away from Mr Fukuda, and back into the shadowy world of the bureaucracy, the opposition must stand firm and insist that the levy should be shifted into general revenue immediately. 
If no deal is done, then the price of petrol will fall by yen24 a litre (92 cents per American gallon) on April 1st. Mr Fukuda can accept it, and face a hole in the budget. Or he can use the coalition's supermajority to override the upper house and restore the levy. But that would take two months and risk angering motorists. Either way, his credibility may suffer further. Mr Ozawa claims the government will fall.
Yet he may fall first. Many modernisers in his party are unhappy with their mercurial, autocratic boss. They tolerate him chiefly for his tactical brilliance at election time. But if no election is in prospect--and Mr Fukuda or his successor is not bound to call one until September 2009--more DPJ members will want someone to challenge Mr Ozawa as party leader in September, even at the risk of splitting the party. Sensing the danger, Mr Ozawa may wish to bring the DPJ into a ""grand coalition"" with the LDP, and demand a senior post. But when he tried that last autumn he dismayed his party colleagues. His many enemies within the LDP, through whose ranks Mr Ozawa once rose, might also object.
So Japan remains stranded unhappily between the one-party state it once was, under a dominant LDP, and the truly competitive democracy it might one day become. Some politicians have mused about the possibility of a political upheaval after the next election, in which the main parties would collapse under their internal strains and regroup. Now, says Kaoru Yosano, economy minister under the reforming Junichiro Koizumi and briefly chief cabinet secretary before Mr Fukuda came to office, the conspiracies are multiplying, and more and more people are agitating for just such an upset even before an election.
One way it might happen is for modernising politicians in both the LDP and the DPJ--those who favour clear policies, structural reform and fiscal probity--to rebel against their leaders and join forces in a new pro-market majority. Such treachery is entertained in various new cross-party discussion groups, innocent though they look. 
A central figure here is Hiroyuki Sonoda of the LDP, who in the 1990s helped found a short-lived party with now-prominent members of the DPJ. He is thought to favour Mr Yosano as the best would-be prime minister in any coup to bring down the LDP. A champion of Koizumi-style reforms, Mr Yosano himself remains enigmatic. So does Mr Koizumi, who once vowed to destroy the old LDP. He retired to the back benches in 2006 but has started giving public speeches again. His long shadow continues to haunt Japan's politics. One word from him could be enough to make--or break--any palace coup.","How Yasuo Fukuda and Ozawa might both self - destruct

THE annual wage negotiation between Japan's unions and its biggest companies is called shunto; the characters literally mean ""spring struggle"". The closely watched outcome at a handful of firms--Toyota, Nissan and Mitsubishi, among others--serves as a benchmark for wages for the rest of corporate Japan. In the post-war boom years, shunto was regarded as a core element of Japanese stakeholder capitalism, on a par with lifetime employment, the seniority-wage system and cross-shareholding. But in recent years it has descended into empty theatrics. 
During the ""lost decade"" of the 1990s, the unions shied away from asking for much. As the labour force changed--one-third of workers are now part-time or temporary, rather than ""regular"" staff--the unions' importance was diluted. In the past five years many of Japan's big firms made record profits, but they have not been sharing their good fortune with their workers. Take-home wages have remained stagnant and, in some years, have even declined over the past decade (see chart).
At the same time, the aggregate wage cost that firms bear has fallen sharply as expensive baby-boomers retire and cheap, non-regular employees take up the slack. The problem has become so severe that the prime minister, Yasuo Fukuda, uncharacteristically urged companies to pay their workers more. Even Japan's conservative business lobby, the Keidanren, has pushed firms to crack open their coffers. 
This year's shunto ended this month with a hollow victory for employees. Most firms offered an increase in basic monthly pay of yen1,000 (around $10). So futile have the talks become that the unions have shifted tack. They now focus on improving working conditions and are trying to narrow the income gap between regular and non-regular workers, notes Charles Weathers, an economist at Osaka City University, in a comprehensive paper* on shunto. The wage difference can be as much as 40%. The big buzzwords in Japan are kakusa kakudai (growing inequality) and waakingu pua (literally, ""working poor"").

Strikingly, as the cost of imports such as oil and raw materials has soared, the price of finished goods has remained stable and profit rates have not declined much. What explains this odd situation? Kyoji Fukao, an economist at Hitotsubashi University in Tokyo, says that by paying workers less, companies have in essence boosted their productivity growth (by around 1.5%, according to preliminary data). But this saving may lead to problems in the future, he warns, because part-timers do not receive the same training as regular employees.
The Nikkei, Japan's business daily newspaper, reminds its readers that wages in Japan are ten times higher than in China. That might prevent workers from getting too uppity. Shunto was used to neuter militant left-wing unions in the 1950s. But then Japan grew its way out of its social problems, notes Mr Weathers. With a shrinking population and sluggish economic growth, that is no longer an option.

Politics
Though Zimbabwe's official electoral commission delayed the publication of results of a presidential election for five days after the poll on March 29th, it looked likely that Robert Mugabe had lost. A run-off within three weeks between Mr Mugabe and Morgan Tsvangirai, who would be the strong favourite, remained a possibility. An independent challenger, Simba Makoni, was predicted to have won less than 8% of votes cast. The commission announced that Mr Mugabe's ruling ZANU-PF party had been defeated in the parliamentary election. 
Ian Khama, son of Botswana's first president, Sir Seretse Khama, was inaugurated as the country's new president. Festus Mogae voluntarily stepped down after ten years in office. 
Cote d'Ivoire faced violent protests against the high cost of food, leaving one person dead. Similar demonstrations have erupted in other parts of west Africa. 
Syria hosted the 22-country Arab League's annual summit, but only half of the leaders turned up. Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Egypt sent insultingly low-ranking delegations in protest against alleged Syrian meddling in crisis-ridden Lebanon, which boycotted the meeting outright. 
The authority of Iraq's prime minister, Nuri al-Maliki, was badly undermined by the failure of the Iraqi army to defeat the militias loyal to a radical cleric, Muqtada al-Sadr, in Basra. Hundreds of people were reported to have been killed in fighting there, in other southern towns and in Baghdad.
The dirt sticks

 Politics 
 Though Zimbabwe 's official electoral commission delayed the publication of results of a presidential election for five days after the poll on March 29th , it looked likely that Robert Mugabe had lost . A run - off within three weeks between Mr Mugabe and Morgan Tsvangirai , who would be the strong favourite , remained a possibility . An independent challenger , Simba Makoni , was predicted to have won less than 8 % of votes cast . The commission announced that Mr Mugabe 's ruling ZANU - PF party had been defeated in the parliamentary election . 
 Ian Khama , son of Botswana 's first president , Sir Seretse Khama , was inaugurated as the country 's new president . Festus Mogae voluntarily stepped down after ten years in office . 
 Cote d'Ivoire faced violent protests against the high cost of food , leaving one person dead . Similar demonstrations have erupted in other parts of west Africa . 
 Syria hosted the 22 - country Arab League 's annual summit , but only half of the leaders turned up . Saudi Arabia , Jordan and Egypt sent insultingly low - ranking delegations in protest against alleged Syrian meddling in crisis - ridden Lebanon , which boycotted the meeting outright . 
 The authority of Iraq 's prime minister , Nuri al - Maliki , was badly undermined by the failure of the Iraqi army to defeat the militias loyal to a radical cleric , Muqtada al - Sadr , in Basra . Hundreds of people were reported to have been killed in fighting there , in other southern towns and in Baghdad .

WITH a slowing economy and rising energy costs, a fall in petrol taxes on April 1st of up to yen24 (24 cents) is something to celebrate. Not, however, if it causes a political smash-up. That is why Yasuo Fukuda, the prime minister, apologised to Japan for ""the failure in politics"" that had led to the cut. He had proposed ways to extend a ""temporary"" petrol levy that had been in place for over 30 years. But the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), which controls the upper house of parliament, rejected them. So a showdown looms at the end of April, when Mr Fukuda can use his coalition's two-thirds ""supermajority"" in the lower house to override the upper. If he does, then the upper house may pass a rare motion of censure. 
The crisis has prompted the boldest move Mr Fukuda has made in a career drenched in caution. Japanese governments have long used the petrol levy and other tax revenues to splash out on road-building, in a form of patronage politics that has helped the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to hold on to power while smothering a once gorgeous country in concrete. Instead of scrapping the levy, Mr Fukuda proposed that from next year its proceeds would be applied to the general budget. This has shocked his own party's pro-construction ""road tribe"", with which he may now face as fierce a battle as he does with the opposition.
It is far from certain that the opposition will profit from the chaos. The DPJ's leader, Ichiro Ozawa, is praised for having highlighted the scandal of taxes earmarked for road-building, which symbolise everything that is wrong with Japan's ""construction state"". Not even Junichiro Koizumi, the reformist LDP prime minister of 2001-06, managed that. But the DPJ's refusal to consider Mr Fukuda's proposals smacks of opportunism. So does Mr Ozawa's recent insistence that the main reason for scrapping the petrol levy was to boost the economy. If Mr Fukuda judges the public readier to punish the opposition rather than him for the ""failure in politics"", he may choose to ignore any censure.
Mr Fukuda's bigger challenge may be the one from his own party. For the moment, even the road tribe has fallen sullenly into line. The prime minister holds a powerful if unspoken sanction over its members: the ability to call a snap general election in which many would lose their seats. But the tribe will not give up without a fight. Meanwhile, the restless modernisers who convinced Mr Fukuda to be bold will want to keep him to his promises. Their unspoken sanction is to vote against his government at the end of April, or leave the ruling party altogether, either way threatening the supermajority on which he depends.","An end to the construction state , or to Yasuo Fukuda ?

AN ODD new phenomenon: as public approval for Japan's prime minister, Yasuo Fukuda, sinks to new lows, his standing within the ruling coalition led by his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is suddenly rising, stilling fevered talk of palace coups. Mr Fukuda appears at last to be articulating a message of reform. The LDP's modernisers hope it is not too late.
The change came late last month, when Mr Fukuda opened a war on two fronts. He accused the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), which controls the upper house of the Diet (parliament), of recklessness for blocking the renewal of a special tax on petrol. The DPJ had picked on the tax, whose proceeds go to building unnecessary roads, to highlight how the LDP is in thrall to pork-barrel interests. Since April 1st, motorists have enjoyed cheaper petrol.
Mr Fukuda opened a second front inside his own party, against the construction lobby, known as the ""road tribe"". He argued that the special tax should swiftly be reinstated, but also that from next year the revenues, currently earmarked for road-building, should be put into the general budget. He also called for a review of road-building plans, which will cost the taxpayer yen59 trillion ($580 billion) over the next ten years. The road tribe is upset. But it is loth to split the party, and has no choice but to back Mr Fukuda if it is to have any revenues to fight over. Hidenao Nakagawa, an LDP powerbroker, says that an end to the earmarking of the tax is now a ""certainty"" and insists that the LDP's future lies with Mr Fukuda.
Kuniko Inoguchi was a minister under Junichiro Koizumi, the reformist prime minister from 2001-06. She sees shades of Mr Koizumi in Mr Fukuda's stand against his party (though, cool and cynical, he could hardly be more different in character from the maverick ""Lionheart""). Many areas of the budget, she says, are in the hands of bureaucrats, off-limits to the prime minister or even the finance ministry because they are often paid for by earmarked taxes. All these are now fair game. Others go further. Kaoru Yosano, an economy minister under Mr Koizumi and a potential successor to Mr Fukuda, insists that a comprehensive tax reform, the broader context in which the earmarking of taxes needs to be tackled, is suddenly back on the agenda.
The visible glee of Mr Yosano, a policy wonk, is understandable, for Japan's fiscal situation remains dire. Though the budget deficit fell from 8.2% of GDP in 2002 to 4% last year, gross public debt has reached 180% of GDP and is rising. A survey by the OECD published this week argues that the government's target of stabilising the debt-to-GDP ratio by the middle of the next decade is based on unrealistic assumptions about growth prospects.
The power of the construction lobby proves that room exists for the government to cut spending--but not by much. In particular, Japan's rapid ageing means that spending on pensions and health care will have to rise. For now, it remains well below the OECD average. So tax revenues will have to rise if holes in the budget are to be plugged; as a share of GDP, these revenues are also below those of G7 peers. 
Mr Yosano sketches out the grand bargain. Income taxes for the very rich will need to go up as a largely symbolic gesture, while today's narrow base of income tax must be broadened. (The OECD also notes that the tax code discourages labour mobility and married women going out to work.) The corporate tax base will also have to be broadened (here, the OECD argues that once a raft of tax breaks is jettisoned, corporate taxes could actually be cut, stimulating the economy and bringing in more tax revenues). Lastly, indirect taxes must play a bigger part. In particular, says Mr Yosano, the sales tax should at least double, in incremental steps, to 10%.
It is not quite impossible for Mr Fukuda to launch this formidable agenda. An early test will come on April 27th, when a by-election is held in Yamaguchi prefecture, in the south-west of Japan's main island. If the LDP vote collapses, colleagues in marginal seats may hesitate to back the prime minister in reinstating the petrol tax. But if Mr Fukuda brings his own party into line, proving to the public that he is a leader after all, then dealing with the opposition may seem like a doddle.","Perhaps , just perhaps , the tide is turning for Yasuo Fukuda

WHENEVER Japan's next general election takes place, the odds of Yasuo Fukuda, the hapless prime minister, leading his party into it have dwindled. On April 27th, the 71-year-old was presented with a crushing by-election defeat for his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) at the hands of the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), for a vacant seat in the lower house of the Diet (parliament). Three days later, Mr Fukuda, using the ruling coalition's supermajority in the lower house, courted deeper unpopularity by reinstating a petrol tax that had lapsed a month earlier after the DPJ-controlled upper house opposed its renewal. Mr Fukuda's approval ratings are now even lower in some polls than the low point of his predecessor, Shinzo Abe.
The manner of defeat in Yamaguchi prefecture says much about the LDP's disarray. The party's first mistake was to create the vacancy, by pulling out the incumbent to run for mayor of Iwakuni, a small city hosting a controversial American base. Its second was to run a political novice against a strong candidate who had held the seat before. Third, the novice's chief credentials were that he had been a mandarin in the construction ministry. Yet Mr Fukuda's survival hangs on people taking seriously his promise to face down pork-barrel interests. Lastly, in a masterstroke of bad publicity and timing, pensioners had to start paying more for medical treatment two weeks before the by-election--even as government incompetence in the loss of 50m computerised pensions records has yet to be resolved.
The defeat undermined the prime minister's promises of reform. He argued for the reinstatement of the petrol levy, worth yen2.6 trillion ($25 billion) a year, on the grounds that the country's finances are already shaky enough. Yet for the past three decades the proceeds from the levy have been earmarked for road construction. The DPJ's leader, Ichiro Ozawa, seized on this; modernisers within the ruling coalition also oppose earmarked taxes that benefit powerful construction lobbies. Some coalition politicians had even threatened to vote against the government over reinstating the petrol levy.
Mr Fukuda has promised both to transfer future road-related taxes to the general budget from next year and to hold a review of the government's long-term road-building plans. Until the upper house opposed these, too, they were set to cost Japan's taxpayers an astonishing yen59 trillion over the next ten years. Yet a lot rests on the prime minister's word that these issues will be tackled in a special Diet session in the autumn. For Mr Fukuda proposes to use his supermajority again, probably on May 13th, in order to reinstate the original ten-year plan--in order, supposedly, to reform it. Letting it simply die, he says, would create havoc for localities.
For now, Mr Fukuda seems to have won the LDP's doubters round. Their leader, Taro Kono, says Mr Fukuda has satisfied their immediate demands by promising to get the stamp from both the ruling parties and the cabinet for his proposals. Both LDP reformists and pork-barrel-rollers will hesitate to plot against Mr Fukuda before Japan acts as host to the G8 summit in July, and will probably have to back him in the special autumn session.
Because the DPJ won the by-election, more of its members think that not only can it bring the government down, it can even win a general election. Mr Ozawa has again proved himself a brilliant electoral tactician and his uncertain standing in the party has risen. Yet the DPJ has still to convince voters that it is as capable of ruling as it is of obstruction; or, indeed, that its private if autocratic leader even wants to lead the country. More than anything, there is still the small matter of the DPJ's approval ratings: lower, even, than the LDP's.","Back from the brink , but still beleaguered

FIRST came the ""ice-breaking"", then the ""ice-melting"". Now, Hu Jintao hopes, comes ""everlasting warm spring"". A series of reciprocal visits over the past 20 months by the leaders of China and Japan have brought a thaw in bilateral relations. On May 6th Mr Hu, China's president, began a state visit, China's first to Japan in a decade; at five days, it will also be Mr Hu's longest single foray to any country. The next day he and Japan's prime minister, Yasuo Fukuda, signed a blueprint for ties that represented a ""new starting-point"", with regular top-level visits in future and both military and cultural exchanges.
The latest freeze began in 1998, when Mr Hu's predecessor, Jiang Zemin, came to Tokyo demanding a lavish written apology for Japan's wartime past. A growing number of Japanese had come to feel that their country had apologised enough for its wartime brutality. Besides, they resented the way a rising China played on war-guilt to extract concessions from its rich neighbour. Relations hit rock bottom under Junichiro Koizumi, Japan's prime minister from 2001-06. Top-level contacts between the two countries were suspended after Mr Koizumi began making devil-may-care visits to Yasukuni, the Tokyo shrine that honours not just Japan's war dead but also executed war criminals.
Mr Koizumi's successor, Shinzo Abe, a right-wing hawk, nevertheless broke with Mr Koizumi's line by visiting Beijing as his first gesture in office. He refrained from visiting Yasukuni. The Chinese were grateful. They were overjoyed when Mr Fukuda took over after a year. He enjoys that double-edged accolade of being a ""friend of China"". He has long criticised politicians' visits to Yasukuni and believes that good relations with Japan's Asian neighbours are paramount.
Mr Hu and Mr Fukuda had plenty to talk about. China has overtaken America as Japan' s biggest trading partner. China is hungry for know-how, and Japan thinks it can be of particular help in providing environmental technology--after all, Chinese pollution reaches Japan. For Mr Fukuda, whose domestic standing is shaky, a big prize would be a Chinese commitment to tackle climate change, a big theme at the G8 summit, which Japan will host in July. As for Mr Hu, he will be thankful if his visit passes without strong protests over Tibet.
As the two leaders discussed a panda to replace Ling Ling, who died at Tokyo's Ueno Zoo last week, they stressed improved relations. For instance, the two countries' armies have embarked on confidence-building measures such as port calls by naval ships. Elsewhere, diplomats point to the way a food scare in Japan earlier this year over tainted Chinese dumplings was handled calmly by the authorities on both sides, even as Japan's mass media whipped up hysteria.
Disputes remain, however. One of the biggest is over gasfields in the East China Sea. Despite four official rounds of negotiations, the two countries have failed to reach agreement on joint development, thanks to touchiness about sovereignty. Originally, Mr Hu's visit was to be the occasion for a deal. Still, an enforced bonhomie has set the tone for this visit, with Mr Hu planning a spot of convivial ping-pong. Not long ago comments by China's leaders, thundering editorials and crude films about the second world war did much to stoke anti-Japanese nationalism--violent street protests broke out in 2005, and in 2004 Chinese football fans went on the rampage after their team was beaten by Japan. Now, China wants to tamp such nationalism down. Anti-Japan behaviour at the Olympics would be a disaster.
It may come as a relief to both sides that, according to Horizon Research, a polling outfit, the attitudes of urban Chinese are turning more positive towards Japan. A growing number think historical differences should be set aside. But it will take a lot more ping-pong to erase the impression of many Japanese that they are loathed in China more than they are admired.","But ties between Asia 's two biggest powers remain delicate

JAPAN has always wavered between being open and closed. As late as the 1850s foreigners were technically forbidden from setting foot on its soil. Today that sentiment lingers in the way that the country's politicians and companies resist activist shareholders and dealmakers. On May 29th Steel Partners, an American investor, successfully ousted the boss and six directors of Aderans, a wigmaker--a big victory for shareholders. More often though, Fortress Japan survives: the Children's Investment Fund (TCI), a British activist investor, has just failed to boost its 9.9% stake in J-Power, an electric utility.
In fact it is worse than that. Japanese companies are not so much wary of foreigners as they are closed to outsiders of any stripe. Assertive Japanese investors have also been beaten back. Companies sheltered from demands to improve performance have slid into some bad old habits. In the past couple of years they have renewed their cross-shareholdings and built takeover defences, which protect them from outsiders. Corporate governance is weak. Companies look to the stockmarket for prestige rather than capital. Noisy shareholders are seen as a nuisance. Independent outside directors are rarities. Hostile takeovers are unheard of. Foreigners may complain most loudly about the isolation of Japanese companies, but everyone, especially the Japanese public, is a victim.
The hope now is that the cost of all this is beginning to sink in. Two influential committees, appointed by the prime minister's office, have issued a package of structural reforms that serves as a rebuke to parochial bureaucrats and business leaders. It calls for low corporate taxes and a simpler system to attract foreign direct investment. It recommends breaking the $1.5 trillion public pension fund into several ""baby"" funds to be separately managed by professional investors--an idea that would boost the domestic market and fuel competition over returns. And it urges the Tokyo Stock Exchange to set guidelines that discourage poison-pill takeover defences. 
The problems of senior service
At the same time, Japanese institutional investors are getting uppity. The Pension Fund Association, which manages $120 billion on behalf of its 29m members, has begun to vote against the renomination of directors unless their companies attain a return on equity above 8%. Although that is only half the norm for American and European firms, it would be a useful symbolic step to improve the Japanese average of 9.5%. Even some corporate leaders are starting to acknowledge the need for change (see page 77). 
Turning the committee's proposals into reality will require political will. The prime minister, Yasuo Fukuda, will come under huge pressure to water down the ideas before he submits them to the Diet (parliament), as part of an economic plan, in June. Yet, even if Mr Fukuda stands firm, he will have only made a start. That is because the most important area for competition to take hold in Japan is not among organisations, but among the people who work in them. 
One reason why Japanese managers fail to strive for better corporate performance is that they lack the incentive to do so. Blame this on Japan's ""seniority-wage system"".

And the same goes for those domestic investment funds.","A few signs of progress in Japan ; but it must let young workers compete with older ones 
 JAPAN has always wavered between being open and closed . As late as the 1850s foreigners were technically forbidden from setting foot on its soil . Today that sentiment lingers in the way that the country 's politicians and companies resist activist shareholders and dealmakers . On May 29th Steel Partners , an American investor , successfully ousted the boss and six directors of Aderans , a wigmaker -- a big victory for shareholders . More often though , Fortress Japan survives : the Children 's Investment Fund ( TCI ) , a British activist investor , has just failed to boost its 9.9 % stake in J - Power , an electric utility . 
 In fact it is worse than that . Japanese companies are not so much wary of foreigners as they are closed to outsiders of any stripe . Assertive Japanese investors have also been beaten back . Companies sheltered from demands to improve performance have slid into some bad old habits . In the past couple of years they have renewed their cross - shareholdings and built takeover defences , which protect them from outsiders . Corporate governance is weak . Companies look to the stockmarket for prestige rather than capital . Noisy shareholders are seen as a nuisance . Independent outside directors are rarities . Hostile takeovers are unheard of . Foreigners may complain most loudly about the isolation of Japanese companies , but everyone , especially the Japanese public , is a victim . 
 The hope now is that the cost of all this is beginning to sink in . Two influential committees , appointed by Yasuo Fukuda's office , have issued a package of structural reforms that serves as a rebuke to parochial bureaucrats and business leaders . It calls for low corporate taxes and a simpler system to attract foreign direct investment . It recommends breaking the $ 1.5 trillion public pension fund into several "" baby "" funds to be separately managed by professional investors -- an idea that would boost the domestic market and fuel competition over returns . And it urges the Tokyo Stock Exchange to set guidelines that discourage poison - pill takeover defences . 
 The problems of senior service 
 At the same time , Japanese institutional investors are getting uppity . The Pension Fund Association , which manages $ 120 billion on behalf of its 29 m members , has begun to vote against the renomination of directors unless their companies attain a return on equity above 8 % . Although that is only half the norm for American and European firms , it would be a useful symbolic step to improve the Japanese average of 9.5 % . Even some corporate leaders are starting to acknowledge the need for change ( see page 77 ) . 
 Turning the committee 's proposals into reality will require political will . Yasuo Fukuda , will come under huge pressure to water down the ideas before Yasuo Fukuda submits them to the Diet ( parliament ) , as part of an economic plan , in June . Yet , even if Yasuo Fukuda stands firm , Yasuo Fukuda will have only made a start . That is because the most important area for competition to take hold in Japan is not among organisations , but among the people who work in them . 
 One reason why Japanese managers fail to strive for better corporate performance is that they lack the incentive to do so . Blame this on Japan 's "" seniority - wage system "" . Employees receive low salaries early in their careers in return for job security and a big payout in their final years . Tenure , not performance , determines what they take home . This system provided stability during the post - war period , when a booming Japan was rebuilding itself . But today it almost guarantees that exceptional performance goes unrewarded and mediocre work goes unpunished . Japanese managers have little stake in raising the value of their company , since they stand to gain very little by it . And why should senior staff welcome new ownership if it would jeopardise their own company 's informal commitment to its employees ?

THE copper is used in computers. The nickel is for batteries. Tungsten is used to fortify steel for cars. Japan buys much of its rare metal from China to feed its electronics and car industries. But as booming China has begun to close the spigot to safeguard its own supplies, Japan, the world's second biggest economy, has been forced to look elsewhere for an alternative source--in Africa. 
On May 28th it hosted the Tokyo International Conference on African Development, a quadrennial event since 1993. About 40 African heads of state or government attended. Japan's prime minister, Yasuo Fukuda, promised to meet each one individually, as well as Bono, a pop singer, without whom no such gathering on Africa is complete.
But whereas in previous meetings aid topped the agenda, this time it has been all about the hunt for natural resources--with Africa's best interests at heart, of course. ""If we are able to utilise Africa's plentiful resources more fully by harnessing Japan's technologies,"" Mr Fukuda said, ""this will surely be a major trigger for growth and without a doubt benefit Africa."" 
This has become a familiar refrain from the leaders of Asia's other expanding economies. Japan is following firmly in the footsteps of China and India, both of which have hosted lavish African summits in the past 18 months, both of them keen to buy Africa's oil and metals. 
Like the others, Japan is offering sweeteners to make itself a saucier commercial partner. This week it pledged to double aid to Africa by 2012, to $3.4 billion. It will also provide up to $4 billion in low-interest rate loans, which means easing its rules against lending to countries that have previously received debt relief. 
Japanese officials stress that all this comes with no strings attached (except perhaps Africa's support for a permanent Japanese seat in the UN Security Council), a not-too-subtle hint that the country hopes to compete on an equal footing with China. Its loans are never linked to improvements in governance or human rights, unlike many of those from Europe, which hosted its own Africa summit in Portugal last December, or America. This reflects the fact that Japan has come late to this second scramble for Africa--and knows it.","It 's sushi for Africa 's leaders

Hillary Clinton formally suspended her campaign for the Democratic nomination in a graceful speech in which she urged all her supporters to work hard to ensure the election of Barack Obama as the next president. Her rival promptly posted a big ""Thank you Hillary"" banner on his website. All looked harmonious, for now.
Mr Obama kicked off his next campaign, the one against John McCain, with a tough speech on the economy in which he accused his Republican rival of pursuing a continuation of George Bush's policies. Mr McCain hit back, describing his rival as a typical tax-and-spend Democrat.
George Bush started a tour of Europe that is expected to be his last as president. He was greeted with little fanfare in each of the capital cities on his itinerary. He reiterated his desire to use diplomatic means to stop Iran from getting a nuclear bomb and said that new sanctions might be needed. But, he added, ""all options are on the table,"" presumably including force. 
Tornadoes and severe flooding struck cities in several mid-Western states, including Iowa, Indiana and Minnesota. At least 15 people died.
Soft speaking and big sticks
Exactly a year after the Islamist Palestinian movement, Hamas, took over the Gaza Strip, Israel's government said it would continue to back efforts by Egypt to reach a truce with it but told the army to prepare for military action if mediation failed. Meanwhile, the Palestinian prime minister, whose writ runs only on the West Bank, said he did not believe there would be a peace deal with Israel this year, as George Bush has predicted.
Morgan Tsvangirai, who is challenging Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe's president, in an election on June 27th, said the country ""is effectively being run by a military junta"" and that 3,000 of his supporters have needed hospital treatment because of state-organised violence. Tendai Biti, the secretary-general of Mr Tsvangirai's party, the Movement for Democratic Change, was arrested at Harare Airport.
The government of Djibouti claimed that nine of the statelet's troops had been killed in border clashes with Eritrean soldiers. The fighting started after weeks of rising tension between the two neighbours in the Horn of Africa.
An airliner burst into flames after landing in bad weather at the airport outside Khartoum, Sudan's capital, killing at least 29 people.
The hardest word
Canada's government apologised formally for the first time for forcing 150,000 aboriginal children to attend church-run boarding schools in an attempt to assimilate them into white society. 
Hugo Chavez, Venezuela's leftist president, called on Colombia's FARC guerrillas to end their four-decade armed struggle and release around 700 hostages. Computer files seized during a recent raid on a rebel camp had appeared to confirm Venezuela's backing for the guerrillas.
Boosted by a construction boom and high world food prices, Brazil's economy grew at an annual rate of 5.8% in the first quarter. But such hectic growth is unlikely to last. 
Thawing straits
China and Taiwan resumed formal talks for the first time since 1999. Meeting in Beijing, the two sides were expected to reach agreements allowing the first regular direct passenger flights, and visits by Chinese tourists to Taiwan.
South Korea's prime minister, all 15 cabinet members and nine senior presidential aides tendered their resignations as demonstrations gathered strength in Seoul against the government's decision to lift a ban on importing American beef. The president, Lee Myung-bak, was expected to accept five or six of the ministerial resignations.
The upper house of Japan's parliament, the Diet, passed a censure motion against the serving prime minister, Yasuo Fukuda. It was the first such motion in Japan's history, but carries no legal weight.
Afghanistan's foreign donors gathered in Paris to consider the government's request for $50 billion to finance a five-year reconstruction plan.
An air raid by American forces based in Afghanistan killed at least 11 Pakistani paramilitaries and eight Taliban militants in the tribal areas of Pakistan. A spokesman for the Pakistani army described the attack as an act of aggression that hit at the very basis of co-operation in the ""war against terror"".
Lawyers from across Pakistan took part in a protest march to Islamabad to demand the reinstatement of senior judges sacked by President Pervez Musharraf under emergency rule last year. The coalition government is divided over how to handle the demand.
Sheikh Hasina Wajed, a former prime minister of Bangladesh and leader of one of the two main political parties, the Awami League, was freed from jail on bail to allow her to receive medical treatment abroad. She had been detained on corruption charges. The League had made her release a condition of taking part in elections in December.

Protests over the rising price of fuel spread across Europe. Fishermen went on strike in Belgium, France, Italy and Portugal. Two lorry drivers were killed during fuel protests in Spain and Portugal. 
As The Economist went to press, Ireland voted in a referendum on the Lisbon treaty. Ireland is the only one of the 27 European Union members to hold a referendum on the new treaty. Our analysis of the results will appear on www.economist.com.
Stojan Zupljanin, a Bosnian Serb wartime commander, was arrested in Serbia and will be sent to The Hague's war-crimes tribunal. He was one of four fugitive Serbs wanted by The Hague and still at large.
Britain's beleaguered prime minister, Gordon Brown, narrowly won a parliamentary vote to extend to 42 days the period for which the police may hold suspected terrorists without charging them.

IT HAS, says the ruling coalition's exhausted parliamentary chief, Tadamori Oshima, been a bruising battle. And hardly beautiful: the six-month session of Japan's Diet (parliament) that is coming to a close has pitted the governing coalition led by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)--dissipated after a half-century in power and bereft of fresh ideas--against the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), newly empowered by its control of the Diet's upper house, eager to pick fights with the government, but still far from proving itself capable of actually governing. The censure motion passed against the government on June 11th--the first ever against a government by the upper house--ensured that the session ends on a sour note. The motion was passed out of spite, not principle, and reflects poorly on both camps.
If the battle has any winner, strangely, it is Yasuo Fukuda, the 71-year-old prime minister. This is not obvious from his popularity. The cabinet's approval ratings have risen slightly, but they are still abysmal, below levels at which previous prime ministers have resigned. Nor is it obvious from local elections on June 8th for Okinawa's prefectural assembly, in which the ruling coalition lost power. Voters seemed angry, especially about uncertainty over pensions, and about an ill-judged system implemented in April making health care costlier for the elderly.
Rather, Mr Fukuda appears for now to have won back control of a political agenda that had been seized by the DPJ from the instant he came to office in September. He has done this, procedurally, by using the coalition's supermajority in the lower house in order to ram through legislation opposed by the upper house. But mainly he has thrown the opposition off-balance by seeming to agree with its leader, Ichiro Ozawa, that the LDP is a party of reaction and narrow interests.
Mr Ozawa hoped in the spring to bring down the government by going for the LDP's pork-barrel interests, in particular a slew of earmarked taxes that feed an ugly road-building programme worth yen59 trillion ($550 billion) over ten years. In response, Mr Fukuda promised to revamp the programme and to scrap earmarked taxes. When Mr Ozawa said that the coalition's plans to lessen the baneful influence of the bureaucracy did not go far enough, Mr Fukuda duly instructed his government to incorporate the DPJ's proposals into its bill. Countless attributes mark Mr Fukuda--by temperament, dry, cautious and cynical--from Junichiro Koizumi, Japan's dashing and reformist prime minister in 2001-06, whom Mr Fukuda served as chief cabinet secretary. Still, Mr Fukuda has pulled off a Koizumi-like feat: with Mr Ozawa's help, he has positioned himself as a crusader against his own party's forces of reaction. 
Mr Fukuda has promised the public some very bold things, to be dealt with in a special session of the Diet running from late-August until perhaps early next year. Not even Mr Koizumi managed to defeat Japan's rotten ""construction state"". Yet Mr Fukuda has chosen to tackle road-building issues within the context of sweeping tax reforms designed to set the state's shaky finances on a sounder footing as Japan's population both shrinks and ages. 
This will entail a steep rise, presumably in stages, of the consumption (sales) tax--a delicate political matter. On July 1st the LDP's tax committee meets to begin hammering out the details. The chief lines of debate will be drawn between Kaoru Yosano, a former economy minister who argues for a swift start to hikes in the consumption tax, and Hidenao Nakagawa, once a close adviser to Mr Koizumi, who says the bureaucracy must be fixed and supply-side measures taken first. 
Over the summer, it will become a little clearer whether Mr Fukuda has the gumption to push his agenda. Much depends on his public standing--or perhaps on the big media groups who claim to speak for the public and who have not yet called for his head. The prime minister appears to expect that by playing host to the G8 summit in July, which is likely to focus on climate change and on the rising price of food and fuel, his popularity will recover. 
This week Mr Fukuda set out his stall as grey man turned green, promising a ""low-carbon revolution"". He called for Japan to cut its greenhouse-gas emissions by up to 80% by 2050. This may bolster his credentials as the summit's host, but not do much for his domestic standing. Soon after the summit, Mr Oshima expects, Mr Fukuda will shuffle his cabinet, whose members were largely inherited from Shinzo Abe, his hapless predecessor. Whether he replaces them with ""quiet revolutionaries"", as Mr Nakagawa puts it (including presumably himself), or instead rewards each party faction with a buggin's turn will give a strong sense of Mr Fukuda's resolve.
For now, colleagues--many critical just weeks ago--give him the benefit of the doubt, and say his mood is ebullient. One senior LDP member, called in to discuss the party's future, says he nearly fell off his chair when Mr Fukuda proposed transforming the LDP, traditionally the party of business, into the party of the environment. Mr Fukuda has also promised to promote the interests of consumers.
Yoriko Kawaguchi, a former foreign minister, says that Mr Fukuda was forced at first to grapple with inherited problems, but is now able to follow his own path. But she adds that any number of dangers--public disaffection, government scandal, a worsening economy, or a ruthless opposition--could yet mug him. Mr Oshima predicts that Mr Fukuda will now survive until an election must be called in September 2009. Beyond that, few ruling politicians want to ponder their party's future. For a prime minister thrown into Japan's current political mess, in other words, success is measured in months, not years.

THE simmering dispute between China and Japan over the East China Sea has long been high on the list of possible regional flashpoints. It centres on China's development of undersea natural gas and oil deposits straddling what Japan says is the borderline between the two countries' exclusive economic zones. A deal announced on June 18th allows Japanese investment in Chinese projects in return for a profit-share. At the very least, the dispute has fallen down the flashpoint list.
There were small demonstrations against the deal in China. But they were a far cry from the wave of anti-Japanese protests three years ago, when the dispute looked potentially nasty. All the fields are estimated to hold gas equivalent to just three weeks' Japanese consumption but the government had protested loudly at the appearance of Chinese survey vessels and drilling platforms in the disputed area. Though on China's side, extraction might take gas from Japan's. 
China ignored calls by Japan to suspend drilling. Planes and patrol vessels from both sides buzzed around the disputed areas. Later in 2005 a Chinese naval squadron appeared near the Chunxiao gasfield (known in Japanese as Shirakaba). One of the ships turned its gun turret on a Japanese reconnaissance plane. Japanese politicians condemned China's gunboat tactics and warned of the risk of conflict. 
In endless rounds of negotiations since then, China and Japan have stepped back from the brink. The principle of the gasfields' joint development has long been agreed. But a deal seemed elusive. Intervention from the top was needed but took a long time coming. It followed a visit by Hu Jintao to Japan last month, the first in a decade by a Chinese president. Like Yasuo Fukuda, Japan's prime minister, he champions better bilateral relations. This week Japan announced that its navy is to make an unprecedented port call in China.
For Mr Fukuda, the gas deal presages a ""sea of peace and co-operation"". In the Chunxiao field, Japan will form a joint venture with two Chinese state-owned companies, with profits split in proportion to their investment. Both sides have agreed that the Longjing field, which more certainly extends across the median line, will in future also be developed jointly, with costs and profits split. Agreement has yet to be reached on other fields.
The deal kicks matters of sovereignty down the road. The UN's Convention on the Law of the Sea recognises economic rights extending 200 nautical miles (370 kilometres) from a country's shoreline. But the East China Sea is just 360 miles at its broadest. Japan claims its boundary as the median line. But China says its zone extends to the edge of the continental shelf, almost to Japan. The convention does not specify how to resolve overlapping claims.
Territorial matters remain prickly. A reminder came with the unintentional sinking on June 10th of a recreational fishing boat from Taiwan by a Japanese patrol vessel near the Senkaku islands (Diaoyutai in Chinese), which are controlled by Japan but claimed by Taiwan and China. The vessel picked up all 16 passengers and crew.
Given Taiwan's Chinese-imposed isolation, the island is keen to be on friendly terms with Japan, one of the few countries to grant Taiwanese visa-free entry. But over the Senkakus, Taiwanese show an emotional side. They were inflamed by Japan's claim that the Taiwanese skipper was to blame for the collision, and by only vague expressions of regret. The Taiwan government officially recalled its unofficial ambassador to Tokyo, deemed to be too pro-Japanese. And on June 16th nine Taiwanese patrol vessels escorted a boatful of nationalists into Japanese waters.
Mr Fukuda's government is playing the matter down. Admitting the coastguard was heavy-handed, it promised to ensure that legal claims for compensation ran smoothly. Japan's man in Taiwan called on the Taiwanese captain, but offered no formal apology. The matter may die down. But the Chinese have cheekily suggested to the Japanese the joint development of possible gasfields around the Senkakus, too--which would be sure to rile Taiwan.","A new geographical discovery in Asia : a "" sea of peace and co - operation ""

AS DILIGENT hosts, the Japanese made sure this year's G8 summit, grouping the leaders of the biggest industrial economies plus Russia, saw little of the angry protest that has marred so many similar gatherings. It all happened at a remote highland resort at Toyako on Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost island. Many foreign activists were turned away at the border, and such demonstrations as did take place were kept to distant cities where riot police outnumbered malcontents. Even the media horde and those non-government organisations (NGOs) deemed semi-respectable were interned in a holiday camp about 20 miles from the eight great leaders.
To Yasuo Fukuda, Japan's prime minister, whose domestic standing is extremely shaky, the summit's smooth passage was a huge relief. He even showed a flash of statesmanship. In answer to perennial criticism that the G8, a self-appointed steering group for global problems, was hardly representative of the world, he invited seven national leaders from Africa to join Japan, the United States, Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Russia to discuss the continent's development.
At another point, Russia's Dmitry Medvedev found himself hobnobbing not only with the old-time capitalist club but also with fellow leaders (see picture) of the BRIC gang of fast-growing giants--in other words, his counterparts from Brazil, India and China. By inviting that lot, plus Mexico, South Africa, Indonesia, South Korea and Australia, the Japanese were able to bring together the bulk of the world's greenhouse-gas emitters. This was easily the G8's biggest ""outreach"" to date, and Mr Fukuda skilfully ensured that disagreements among that disparate bunch did not break out angrily into the open. Carry on like that, people at the summit quipped, and the 71-year-old leader might one day make a competent foreign minister.
On substance, however, the summit was a let-down. A year ago, when the Heiligendamm summit took place in Germany, oil and food staples were at half their prices today, while Northern Rock was an unknown little bank. At the Toyko summit the G8 leaders rose to the challenges posed by the ""three Fs""--food, fuel and the financial credit crunch--with platitudes, and little effort was made to resolve the contradiction between calls for larger oil supplies and the promise of a low-carbon future.
On Africa, higher food prices seemed to make a mockery of G8 pledges made three years ago to raise annual aid levels by $25 billion until 2010, even before NGOs warned that the commitment was already slipping. (Here, though, Japan can hold its head higher: in May it hosted a big African aid gathering, promising substantially to increase aid and technology transfer.)
The big disappointment was over climate change--despite some word games. Last year, Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, overcame the reluctance of George Bush and got the G8 to promise to ""consider seriously"" cutting greenhouse emissions by at least half by 2050. This time the G8 vowed to ""consider and adopt"" such cuts. Ms Merkel hailed this tighter language; the hosts called it the summit's biggest victory, coming just 18 months before 180 countries meet in Copenhagen to hammer out a successor to the Kyoto protocol. In effect, Mr Bush has at last committed America to a quantifiable target. With just 200-odd days of his presidency to run, this may be his final input to the climate-change debate; some would call it his only contribution.
Yet the strength of the G8's commitment starts to crumble under scrutiny--even without one cynical Russian diplomat pointing out how absurd it is for today's politicians to take responsibility for meeting goals four decades from now. The baseline from which the cuts are supposed to occur has been left vague. The European Union wants them to begin from 1990, while Japan (which unilaterally says it will aim for a 60-80% cut in emissions) thinks it more realistic to start from 2005 or perhaps this year. America hardly has an opinion.
To some, this obsession with distant targets is beside the point. The G8 could not come up even with nearer-term goals to cut emissions--say, by 2020. The lack of more immediate and concrete measures, says Michael Grubb of the Carbon Trust, set up by the British government to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, underscores an ""abdication of responsibility"". At the least, he says, the G8 leaders could have promised to treat cuts eventually agreed under UN auspices as legally binding. And they could have moved to bring the huge, dirty market in bunker fuel for shipping and aviation, hitherto excluded from discussion of caps, into the negotiations.
Without such marks of resolve, it is little wonder that the five biggest developing polluters, which account for a smallish amount of the man-made carbon dioxide now clogging the air but a fast increasing share of new emissions, refused to make any firm pledges. A Japanese diplomat worries that the relationship between the G8 and the so-called G5 (India, China, Brazil, Mexico and South Africa) over climate change may soon resemble management-and-labour stand-offs at their worst.
Perhaps such weakness was inevitable. Big challenges demand strong leaders. But if Mr Fukuda is weak domestically, Mr Brown looks little better. Mr Bush is a lame, unpopular duck. Nicolas Sarkozy of France struggles to comprehend how and why his voters' enthusiasm has evaporated. In all the big democracies (as well as elsewhere) the three Fs have played their part in creating a mood of dissatisfaction. Leaders find themselves punished, and also hobbled, by the low regard in which they are held by their voters.","A mountain - top gabfest provided a spectacular show and a long guest list but few answers to the woes of the world

WITH his once-hopeful presidency paralysed by weeks of street protests against imports of American beef, Lee Myung-bak (above) is now trying to restore a modicum of sanity to domestic politics and--in case that idea sounds insufficiently implausible--even to his country's dealings with North Korea. 
A new, humbler Mr Lee, once admired as the ""Bulldozer"", is on display. His people last month renegotiated a beef deal with the United States, which had said that unless South Korea opened its market completely to American beef, then Congress would not approve a sweeping free-trade pact. Protesters had decried the risks of mad-cow disease, so the new deal limits imports to low-risk animals under 30 months old. That cuts little ice with many emotional protesters but--after Mr Lee last week also sacked three cabinet ministers over the fiasco--was good enough for the opposition Democratic Party to end its boycott of the National Assembly. The assembly convened on July 10th, after a six-week delay, with a backlog of work.
The following day Mr Lee spoke to the assembly, begging its help in tackling inflation and passing a raft of pro-business measures, tax cuts and pension reforms. He called for an end to labour disputes, and he promised help to families on low incomes. He also pressed the National Assembly to ratify the free-trade deal.
Mr Lee's newly professed humility represented perhaps less of a turnaround than his olive branch to North Korea. Just half an hour before his assembly speech, news came through that a South Korean tourist had been shot dead by a North Korean soldier. The 53-year-old woman, who was taking an early-morning stroll on the beach near North Korea's Mount Kumgang resort, might have been Mr Lee's excuse to underscore his earlier hardline policy towards the repulsive regime. But the North's recent declaration (albeit incomplete, see box) of its nuclear programmes, along with pressure at home, has forced a rethink. He called for a resumption of dialogue. Humanitarian aid, he said, should be renewed without precondition. Relations between the Koreas should ""transcend changeovers in administration"". Clearly, Mr Lee now fears that without a change of heart, South Korea might stand on the sidelines as North Korea and America negotiate a normalisation of ties.
This week the parliamentary floor leader of the ruling Grand National Party echoed the president's sentiments. Hong Joon-pyo said that the shooting ""paradoxically"" showed why North-South reconciliation was necessary. The reaction from the North has been less surprising. Kim Jong Il's regime called the appeal for talks ""an intolerable insult"". Far from showing any hint of contrition, it insisted that an apology should come from the South for halting tourist visits to Mount Kumgang.
Challenges have mounted on other fronts. On July 14th Japan announced new, more nationalistic guidelines for school textbooks about how to deal with the matter of the Dokdo islands (Takeshima in Japanese), a pathetic parcel of rocks which have been Korean-controlled since the second world war but which Japan claims it incorporated in 1905--po-facedly glossing over the small matter of forcing Korea to become a protectorate that year too. Neither Mr Lee nor Japan's prime minister, Yasuo Fukuda, want to make a big fuss of the textbook nonsense, but neither can be seen to look soft. South Korea's ambassador to Japan has been recalled; protests at Japan's embassy in Seoul continue; South Korea has rebuffed an offer of talks.","A newly humble and emollient president, up to a point

AFTER months of rumour and machination, Yasuo Fukuda, Japan's prime minister, finally reshuffled his cabinet on August 1st, replacing 13 of the 17 ministers. The new government brings in some heavyweights. But it faces irreconcilable goals. One is to push through reforms that require big political battles. The other is to polish the image of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) for a general election which must be called by September 2009. 
The new government is split over these goals. The linchpin of the team is Taro Aso, a charismatic former foreign minister who becomes secretary-general of the LDP. He wants to splash money about. The economy may well be in recession: production, exports, wages and profits are all down. But Japan has the biggest debt-to-GDP ratio of any rich country (180% in 2007) and has promised that the budget will be in surplus by 2011, a test of probity. Mr Aso wonders aloud whether to push back that date.
But Mr Fukuda's new economic and finance ministers, Kaoru Yosano and Bunmei Ibuki, are fiscal hawks who want to stick to the target. Instead of spending more overall, they want to reallocate money that is now being wasted. Their target: the transport and construction ministry, home of pork-barrel spending. Its new minister, Sadakazu Tanigaki, is a former finance minister with the clout to prune the extravagance.
As Mr Fukuda tries to settle tensions within his team over spending plans, he must also prepare for a new session of the Diet (parliament). The going will not be easy. He has promised to set up a consumer-protection agency, improve health care and put receipts from the petroleum tax into the general account (where they can be used for anything) rather than keep them earmarked for road construction (ie, pork). He even wants to make permanent Japan's naval contribution to the international effort in Afghanistan--a controversial issue. 
Mr Fukuda's plans seem politically shrewd. He hopes an economic-stimulus package will stave off criticism that he is insensitive to the plight of ordinary Japanese. Through his assorted policy proposals, he aims to steal the mantle of reform from the DPJ, which has its own leadership election in September. But it will all require deft handling. If he stumbles, Mr Aso is waiting in the wings.","A new cabinet is torn between governing and preparing for the polls

AS YASUO FUKUDA walked from the stage this week, his colleagues angrily recalled why they had propelled him into the country's top job in the first place. It was to avoid a repeat of their humiliation last autumn at the hands of his younger predecessor, Shinzo Abe, who had shuffled his cabinet in the face of low popularity ratings, opened a special session of the Diet (parliament), and then abruptly resigned after a year in office. In an echo of that disaster, Mr Fukuda, with abysmal ratings of his own, also shuffled his cabinet, in early August. He had laid out his legislative agenda for an autumn special session. And then, on September 1st, he announced his resignation. If, as expected, he steps down on September 24th, he will have served almost exactly as long as Mr Abe.
For a man who agonised over choices, it was the most abrupt decision of the 72-year-old's political career (he did not even tell his wife). Mr Fukuda said he did not want to create a ""political vacuum"", and at least he moved before the special session had begun. Still, his shocked colleagues are bitter. The public's disdain for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is presumably now deeper. Meanwhile, the opposition camp is electrified, sensing a chance to end the half-century-long LDP shogunate. 
History may be kinder than his colleagues are to Mr Fukuda, who had a nearly impossible job as prime minister in a hung parliament--the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) has controlled the upper house since July 2007. Even more thankless, he led a party whose disagreements had broken out into the open after a charismatic reformer, Junichiro Koizumi, was succeeded by the disastrous Mr Abe. 
In his pronouncements, Mr Fukuda showed a keen sense of how Japan needed to tackle the burdens of an ageing population and mountainous national debt. He challenged his party's own pork-barrel interests, particularly the road-construction lobby, which not even Mr Koizumi defeated. In foreign matters he kept relations with America from fraying, by using the ruling coalition's supermajority to ram through legislation allowing Japan's navy to refuel ships in the Indian Ocean in support of efforts in Afghanistan. And he deepened Mr Abe's initiatives to warm Japan's ties with neighbouring China and South Korea. But there was no denying it: Mr Fukuda's leadership lacked even a smidgen of colour; the one thing he was not, as he admitted this week, was popular.
Had the cabinet shuffle offered a lasting bounce in the polls, Mr Fukuda might have struggled on for longer. Yet Koizumi-style reformists such as Hidenao Nakagawa were excluded from the new cabinet. Meanwhile Kaoru Yosano, the new economy minister, who has a clear sense of what needs to be done to overhaul the country's finances, was ordered to cobble together a fiscal-stimulus package in response to panicky and somewhat overblown fears that the economy, after six years of growth, was heading for a deep recession again (see page
).
Much of the pressure for the stimulus came from the LDP's coalition partner, New Komeito, a Buddhist-linked party. It has had little influence in government affairs, but with the LDP in disarray it is making its presence felt. Many New Komeito members are pacifists, and it pressed the government to shorten the coming Diet session, meaning it would not have time to use its supermajority to renew the Indian Ocean mission. More than anything, this may have tipped Mr Fukuda into resigning. 
The man who negotiated with New Komeito over the truncation of the Diet session and, unwittingly or not, thus helped undermine Mr Fukuda, was Taro Aso, the LDP's secretary-general. After a strong showing behind Mr Fukuda in the last leadership election, he is now the clear favourite to take over as party president and prime minister after the LDP votes on September 22nd. Mr Aso, a 67-year-old Catholic, is from a prosperous right-wing family. He was foreign minister under both Mr Koizumi and Mr Abe. A hawk who wants Japan to play a much more robust role abroad, Mr Aso is also an original compared with more ideological conservatives. For instance, he advocates taking the sting out of the militarist Yasukuni shrine, which bedevils Japan's relations with its neighbours, by moving worship of Japan's war dead to somewhere less contentious. Asonomics
On domestic matters, he favours a stimulus package, but opposes a return to the LDP's big-spending ways. Other than that, he seems rather unsure of his own core economic convictions. That is a potential weakness. Another is a reckless tendency for loose talk. For now, that may matter less than that Mr Aso is congenial, popular with the LDP's grassroots and the public. An unabashed fan of manga comics, the shares of whose publishers soared this week, he loves to press the flesh. Above all, he lacks the morose frown and sagging chops of both Mr Fukuda and Mr Abe. 
Mr Aso will face a challenge from Yuriko Koike, a former defence minister, who will try to rally disaffected Koizumi followers behind her. But winning the party's nomination will be the easy part. Yukio Hatoyama, the DPJ's secretary-general, promises ""all-out war"", expecting to bring down the government by year-end. He says the DPJ will oppose the stimulus package, which he describes as ""half-baked"", favouring the LDP's traditional interests over the elderly and the weak. By opposing the Indian Ocean operation, Mr Hatoyama says the DPJ can help split the ruling coalition. He mentions coyly that New Komeito has recently been eager to talk to the DPJ.
The new prime minister need not call a general election until next September, and some LDP elders will advise Mr Aso to hang on for as long as possible. But New Komeito favours an early general election, while the LDP's prospects might never look better than with an immediate Aso bounce in the polls. Nobuteru Ishihara, an ambitious youngster who is considering a quixotic tilt at the LDP presidency, thinks that Mr Aso will introduce a fresh cabinet to the country and call a snap election.
With an election, the uncertainties only multiply. The ruling coalition has no chance of keeping its supermajority, but might with luck win a simple majority, or plurality. But the headache of a hung Diet would remain. Victory also brings problems for the DPJ, since it counts on the support of small left-wing parties for its control of the upper house. These parties would certainly cause trouble if the DPJ decides to ditch unrealistic electoral promises in favour of sensible government. Therefore, says Isamu Ueda of New Komeito, all the scenarios point to a wholesale political realignment after the next election. Japan's politics has just set out on its biggest adventure in over 50 years.","For the country , the start of an awfully big adventure 
 AS Yasuo Fukuda walked from the stage this week , Yasuo Fukuda's colleagues angrily recalled why they had propelled Yasuo Fukuda into the country 's top job in the first place . It was to avoid a repeat of their humiliation last autumn at the hands of Yasuo Fukuda's younger predecessor , Shinzo Abe , who had shuffled his cabinet in the face of low popularity ratings , opened a special session of the Diet ( parliament ) , and then abruptly resigned after a year in office . In an echo of that disaster , Yasuo Fukuda , with abysmal ratings of Yasuo Fukuda's own , also shuffled Yasuo Fukuda's cabinet , in early August . Yasuo Fukuda had laid out Yasuo Fukuda's legislative agenda for an autumn special session . And then , on September 1st , Yasuo Fukuda announced Yasuo Fukuda's resignation . If , as expected , Yasuo Fukuda steps down on September 24th , Yasuo Fukuda will have served almost exactly as long as Mr Abe . 
 For Yasuo Fukuda , it was the most abrupt decision of Yasuo Fukuda's political career ( Yasuo Fukuda did not even tell Yasuo Fukuda's wife ) . Yasuo Fukuda said Yasuo Fukuda did not want to create a "" political vacuum "" , and at least Yasuo Fukuda moved before the special session had begun . Still , Yasuo Fukuda's shocked colleagues are bitter . The public 's disdain for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) is presumably now deeper . Meanwhile , the opposition camp is electrified , sensing a chance to end the half - century - long LDP shogunate . 
 History may be kinder than Yasuo Fukuda's colleagues are to Mr Fukuda , who had a nearly impossible job as prime minister in a hung parliament -- the Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) has controlled the upper house since July 2007 .

THE surprise resignation of Japan's prime minister, Yasuo Fukuda, has once again left the world's second-largest economy rudderless--just as it seems to be drifting dangerously towards the rocks. Although America is the centre of the world's financial troubles, Japan's economy appears to have been hit harder: its GDP fell sharply in the second quarter, whereas America's continued to expand. Indeed, many economists expect Japan's economy to shrink again in the three months to September, which on the rule of thumb of two consecutive quarters of decline, would imply a recession. You might conclude that without radical reform Japan will continue to underperform. However, a more thorough health check suggests that Japan's economy is actually in better shape than it looks, and its downturn may be shorter and shallower than those in America and most European economies could be.
Three days before Mr Fukuda quit, fears that the economy was sinking into another deep recession panicked the government into announcing a modest stimulus package of tax cuts and financial assistance for transport and construction industries, and for smaller firms. Even if these measures are carried out, most economists do not think it would do much to revive the economy. Some politicians would like a big increase in public spending, but the government has promised to eliminate its primary budget deficit (ie, before interest payments) by 2011-12 in order to reduce public-sector debt of 170% of GDP--the largest among the big rich economies.
The government's balance sheet may seem dire, but the private sector's looks healthier than for many years, because Japan has avoided the economic and financial imbalances that threaten many economies in the West. Unlike America and parts of Europe, notably Britain, Japan is not experiencing a credit crunch and house prices are not collapsing. Consumer and corporate finances are also generally in better shape.
Japanese financial institutions' losses on securities linked to American subprime mortgages so far amount to just $17 billion, out of worldwide losses of $500 billion. As a result, most banks can still lend, except to property developers, some of which rely heavily on funding from abroad and from small regional banks. Several of them have gone bust in the past few months. More generally, however, Japanese house prices are unlikely to crumble. After its housing bubble burst in the 1990s, the market has not inflated again. 
The biggest contrast with America and Britain is that Japanese households have reduced their debt from 71% of GDP in 2000 to 63% this year, according to Goldman Sachs. This is much lower than debt ratios of around 100% in both America and Britain, where borrowing has exploded over the past decade (see chart). The only other G7 economy where consumer debt has declined is Germany, which has also avoided a housing bubble.
Japanese companies have trimmed their debts even more dramatically, to 78% of GDP from 130% in 1991. The level is now well below where it was before the 1980s bubble, though higher than corporate America's debt of less than 50% of GDP. (American firms have traditionally relied more on equity financing). On the other hand, corporate debt has expanded rapidly in the European Union. 
Heavy debts, falling property prices and a shortage of new credit are a lethal cocktail, which could depress economic growth in America and parts of Europe for several years--as Japan itself found out in the 1990s. Today Japan's economy is much less burdened by debt and so likely to recover more quickly. 
Another reason why the downturn in Japan could be fairly mild is that almost half of Japan's exports go to other buoyant Asian economies. Exports had been the main force behind Japan's recovery before they slowed this year. Shipments to America and to Europe have fallen, but demand from the rest of Asia remains strong. In July, for the first time, Japan exported more to China than to America. 
Japan's long-term growth rate has undoubtedly been strangled by the lack of reform. Yet its economy is now in better shape than for many years. Japan's GDP is likely to grow faster than both America's and the euro area's over the next year. If so, 2009 will be the fourth year running that Japan's GDP per head shows the biggest increase of the three. And that is not only because its population is shrinking.","Japan could yet outperform the other big rich economies over the next year

BRUISED, bothered and bewildered, a Japanese prime minister for the second time in a year has thrown in the towel after a few ineffectual months in the ring. Yasuo Fukuda, like his predecessor, Shinzo Abe, had seen his popularity ratings slump, as his party rivals sharpened their knives and his policies fizzled. Meanwhile, Japan's longest period of continuous economic expansion since the war had stuttered to a halt (see page
). Whoever succeeds Mr Fukuda (Taro Aso, who thought a year ago he should precede him, is the favourite) will face the same seemingly insuperable obstacles. Japanese politics seems a hopeless and depressing mess. However, for those, like this newspaper, hoping for change in Japan, this is a moment not for hand-wringing gloom, but for hand-rubbing glee: Japanese politics may have entered its most exciting period in more than 50 years (see page
).
The excitement lies in the probable collapse of the old political order and the realignment it will herald. Of course, such a transformation has been predicted--and avoided--for years. And the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) still has two powerful weapons: its well-oiled machinery of patronage and the incoherence of the main opposition, the Democratic Party of Japan (Dpj). Politics still looks deceptively like business as usual. Indeed, in the end, it was a belated attempt to pursue reform and take on some of the LDP's vested interests that did for Mr Fukuda. He exhausted himself struggling against them. The succession will be decided in the traditional manner: among the LDP's barons, without asking the electorate. Japan will have its third leader in a row not to have led his party to a victory at the polls. Japan's top-down politics stands in stark contrast to America's thrilling primary season.
Yet LDP rule in its present form is in terminal decline. This had been disguised until recently by the premiership from 2001 of Junichiro Koizumi, who combined two qualities rarely seen in Japan's politicians: popularity and reforming drive. When Mr Koizumi retired in 2006, Mr Abe, youthful and assertive, seemed well-placed to maintain this momentum. But he proved disastrously inept. And it turned out that Mr Koizumi's policies were liked much less than the man himself. Despite his recent efforts to revive reform, Mr Fukuda, a stopgap, marked a return to the old, grey, back-room style. This week the party has had to admit that this did not work either. Time for a shake-up
If Mr Aso becomes the LDP's leader, he may call an election at once, hoping to profit from the bounce in popularity a fresh face might give the party. He certainly should do so, since it is time voters had their say. But even if he does not, an election is due by September next year. For all but 11 months of the past half-century, Japan has been ruled by the LDP. There is now a real chance the party might lose power, or at least the lower-house ""supermajority"" which allows it to force through legislation despite its loss in 2007 of a majority in the powerful upper house of the parliament. It will be years before the LDP has a real chance to win back that majority. Without upheaval, deadlock would be entrenched.
Which is why change might come at last. Mr Koizumi still has followers. One will challenge Mr Aso for the prime minister's job. But many have already realised that the LDP as currently constituted cannot represent their policy ambitions. Similarly, young Turks in the ranks of the DPJ vest few hopes in their party leader, Ichiro Ozawa, a political bruiser. The prospects have rarely been brighter for these two groups to join forces and drag Japan towards true policy-based competition between parties.

IF YOUR notion of Japan's ruling party is that after half a century in near-continuous power it is unrepresentative, out-of-touch and incompetent, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) would like you to think again. In the days since Yasuo Fukuda abruptly announced his resignation on September 1st--the second occasion in a year for the ruling coalition to lose a prime minister--television has been filled with a razzle-dazzle race to lead the LDP. The winner of that contest (the party votes on September 22nd) will automatically become prime minister at a special session of the Diet (parliament) on September 24th.
When Mr Fukuda said he was resigning, it seemed as if Taro Aso, the LDP secretary-general and a former foreign minister (on the right, above) would be pushed smoothly into the post, just as Mr Fukuda and Shinzo Abe before him were as good as picked by the party grandees behind closed doors. However, four other Diet members have put themselves forward, including the first woman to run for prime minister in Japan, Yuriko Koike (also pictured). It's invigorating stuff, the LDP hopes, stealing the opposition's thunder and showing up its hidebound style. For on September 8th the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) re-elected its own leader, Ichiro Ozawa, an old bruiser, unopposed. The LDP is even brazen enough to declare that the DPJ's inexperience at governing must necessarily reflect ill upon its presumed competence--as if the opposite held true for its own shambles of a government.
Moreover the race appears to be not just about personalities but policies--surely a first for the LDP. Boosters say it is really about the choices the country faces. On what Japan needs to do, Mr Aso is among the least articulate of the contenders, though he makes up for it with a cheerful air, earthy humour and (untypically for Japan) an evident hunger for the top job. This week the Japanese establishment watched with mounting alarm as famous American financial firms imploded. Mr Aso's recipe for dealing with the consequences for Japan, and for reviving the sluggish economy, is to push for a fiscal-stimulus package. He argues that budget commitments to tame Japan's enormous national debt should be put off. Mr Aso served under Junichiro Koizumi, swashbuckling prime minister from 2001-06, but is no fan of Koizumi-style structural reform. If he believes in anything, it is in a rather hawkish conduct of foreign affairs. 
By contrast, Mr Koizumi has come out of the shadows to anoint Miss Koike, a former environment and defence minister. She says the race ""is a real struggle about whether reform takes place or not"", and accuses Mr Aso of wanting to turn back to the LDP's old pork-barrel ways. Miss Koike vows to confront a powerful bureaucracy resistant to change. Meanwhile, her candidacy is causing a stir within the party, and not only because of her sex; it risks splitting the LDP's biggest faction, whose head backs Mr Aso. (Mr Koizumi, ever the iconoclast, no doubt approves of that too.)
The other candidates also have something to offer. Kaoru Yosano, the 70-year-old economy minister, is also for Koizumi-style reform, he says. However, his passion is to balance the books. Even with a slowing economy, Mr Yosano says, Mr Aso is reckless to propose abandoning the target of balancing the budget (before interest payments) by 2011. Shigeru Ishiba, a competent past defence minister, says he is running to stiffen Japan's resolve to take part in international peacekeeping and other operations. Nobuteru Ishihara, son of an outspoken Tokyo governor, mixes liberal reform with an unstuffy style.
For all this, Mr Aso is a firm favourite. So the contest risks, as one LDP member puts it, appearing to be merely a skit. After all, the candidates have a good chance of plum posts in an Aso government--even Miss Koike, who describes the LDP old guard voting for Mr Aso as ""Pavlovian dogs"" reacting to the stimulus of pork.
The new prime minister will swiftly form his cabinet, and then deliver his policy address to the Diet on September 29th. Mr Aso will urgently want to pass a stimulus package, and renew the Japanese navy's refuelling mission in the Indian Ocean, part of the international effort in Afghanistan. But the DPJ, which controls the upper house, vows to oppose both measures. So, says the LDP's Diet-affairs chief, Tadamori Oshima, a quicker way to get them passed may be to call a snap election--October 26th is the likeliest date.
For the LDP, much would be at stake in such a vote. Koichi Kato, a former party secretary-general, says that four-fifths of its Diet members are in the LDP not because of its policies, which are few, but because it is the party in power. It may well remain so after an election, but party veterans are fearful. ""The winds of fortune"", says Mr Oshima, covering his head with his hands, ""are blowing away from us.""","As the congenial Taro Aso steps forward , the LDP 's fate hangs in the balance 
 IF YOUR notion of Japan 's ruling party is that after half a century in near - continuous power it is unrepresentative , out - of - touch and incompetent , the Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) would like you to think again . In the days since Yasuo Fukuda abruptly announced Yasuo Fukuda's resignation on September 1st -- the second occasion in a year for the ruling coalition to lose a prime minister -- television has been filled with a razzle - dazzle race to lead the LDP . The winner of that contest ( the party votes on September 22nd ) will automatically become prime minister at a special session of the Diet ( parliament ) on September 24th . 
 When Yasuo Fukuda said Yasuo Fukuda was resigning , it seemed as if Taro Aso , the LDP secretary - general and a former foreign minister ( on the right , above ) would be pushed smoothly into the post , just as Yasuo Fukuda and Shinzo Abe before Yasuo Fukuda were as good as picked by the party grandees behind closed doors . However , four other Diet members have put themselves forward , including the first woman to run for prime minister in Japan , Yuriko Koike ( also pictured ) . It 's invigorating stuff , the LDP hopes , stealing the opposition 's thunder and showing up its hidebound style . For on September 8th the Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) re - elected its own leader , Ichiro Ozawa , an old bruiser , unopposed . The LDP is even brazen enough to declare that the DPJ 's inexperience at governing must necessarily reflect ill upon its presumed competence -- as if the opposite held true for its own shambles of a government . 
 Moreover the race appears to be not just about personalities but policies -- surely a first for the LDP . Boosters say it is really about the choices the country faces . On what Japan needs to do , Mr Aso is among the least articulate of the contenders , though he makes up for it with a cheerful air , earthy humour and ( untypically for Japan ) an evident hunger for the top job . This week the Japanese establishment watched with mounting alarm as famous American financial firms imploded . Mr Aso 's recipe for dealing with the consequences for Japan , and for reviving the sluggish economy , is to push for a fiscal - stimulus package . He argues that budget commitments to tame Japan 's enormous national debt should be put off . Mr Aso served under Junichiro Koizumi , swashbuckling prime minister from 2001 - 06 , but is no fan of Koizumi - style structural reform . If he believes in anything , it is in a rather hawkish conduct of foreign affairs . 
 By contrast , Mr Koizumi has come out of the shadows to anoint Miss Koike , a former environment and defence minister . She says the race "" is a real struggle about whether reform takes place or not "" , and accuses Mr Aso of wanting to turn back to the LDP 's old pork - barrel ways . Miss Koike vows to confront a powerful bureaucracy resistant to change . Meanwhile , her candidacy is causing a stir within the party , and not only because of her sex ; it risks splitting the LDP 's biggest faction , whose head backs Mr Aso . ( Mr Koizumi , ever the iconoclast , no doubt approves of that too . ) 
 The other candidates also have something to offer . Kaoru Yosano , the 70 - year - old economy minister , is also for Koizumi - style reform , he says . However , his passion is to balance the books . Even with a slowing economy , Mr Yosano says , Mr Aso is reckless to propose abandoning the target of balancing the budget ( before interest payments ) by 2011 . Shigeru Ishiba , a competent past defence minister , says he is running to stiffen Japan 's resolve to take part in international peacekeeping and other operations . Nobuteru Ishihara , son of an outspoken Tokyo governor , mixes liberal reform with an unstuffy style . 
 For all this , Mr Aso is a firm favourite . So the contest risks , as one LDP member puts it , appearing to be merely a skit . After all , the candidates have a good chance of plum posts in an Aso government -- even Miss Koike , who describes the LDP old guard voting for Mr Aso as "" Pavlovian dogs "" reacting to the stimulus of pork . 
 The new prime minister will swiftly form his cabinet , and then deliver his policy address to the Diet on September 29th . Mr Aso will urgently want to pass a stimulus package , and renew the Japanese navy 's refuelling mission in the Indian Ocean , part of the international effort in Afghanistan . But the DPJ , which controls the upper house , vows to oppose both measures . So , says the LDP 's Diet - affairs chief , Tadamori Oshima , a quicker way to get them passed may be to call a snap election -- October 26th is the likeliest date . 
 For the LDP , much would be at stake in such a vote . Koichi Kato , a former party secretary - general , says that four - fifths of its Diet members are in the LDP not because of its policies , which are few , but because it is the party in power . It may well remain so after an election , but party veterans are fearful . "" The winds of fortune "" , says Mr Oshima , covering his head with his hands , "" are blowing away from us .

AFTER trouncing his opponents to lead the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), Taro Aso, a 68-year-old former foreign minister, was sworn in on September 24th as Japan's third (unelected) new prime minister in two years. Mr Aso, a Catholic, is the grandson of Shigeru Yoshida, a former prime minister (seated above; the young Mr Aso is standing in the centre) and as blue-blooded as they come. But he has a populist appeal, and in this leadership bid, his fourth, managed to reassure colleagues that his sometimes brashly expressed hawkish views would not jeopardise Japan's improved ties with China and South Korea. His straight-talking, upbeat style contrasts with his morose, short-tenured predecessors, Shinzo Abe and Yasuo Fukuda. Unlike both, Mr Aso says he will put pocketbook issues to the fore. 
Mr Aso has two main aims in a special session of the Diet (parliament). The ruling coalition says that the global financial crisis makes it more pressing than ever to pass a stimulus package worth {Yen}11.5 trillion ($106 billion, though only one-fifth is new spending). Second is the renewal of the navy's refuelling operation in the Indian Ocean, part of the international effort in Afghanistan and a main symbol of Japan's readiness to play a bigger part in the world. 
On September 29th Mr Aso will present his agenda to the Diet. The make-up of his cabinet appears to dispel any doubts that he will call a snap general election. With the chief exception of Kaoru Yosano, a fiscal conservative reinstated as economy minister, the cabinet talent is astonishingly thin. Mr Aso cannot be serious.
Shigeru Ishiba is a defence expert, but he has been put in charge of farms. Hirofumi Nakasone, the new foreign minister, is notable chiefly for being the son of a former prime minister. The new internal-affairs minister is Kunio Hatoyama, another grandson of a prime minister, seen even by his friends as the most incompetent justice minister in memory. And Mr Aso has chosen Shoichi Nakagawa, a potential budget-buster like himself, as finance minister. When this correspondent recently called after lunch on the man now responsible for coping with the global financial crisis, he found him in erratic form, with his shirt unbuttoned to the waist. Japan needs more women in the workforce, but Mr Nakagawa has said that they have their ""proper place"" and their ""own abilities"" in, for example, ""flower arranging, sewing, or cooking"". Countering this view has been left to Yuko Obuchi, 34-year-old daughter of another prime minister, who is in charge of reversing Japan's declining birth rate.
The opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), led by Ichiro Ozawa, controls the Diet's upper house and vows to oppose the LDP's measures, raising the odds of a poll in early November. Much is at stake for the LDP, which for half a century has been in near-continuous power. It and its allies in the bureaucracy are seen as incompetent and out of touch. On top of the welfare ministry's gross mismanagement of the country's pensions system comes a growing scandal over tainted rice. 
Mr Ozawa is now urging his forces to bring about an upheaval in Japanese politics. There is little noble in his approach, rallying the disaffected from every quarter. Supposedly a party of reform, the DPJ has tried to forge an alliance with a reactionary group, the People's New Party, whose members broke with the LDP because they opposed the privatisation of the postal system. Socialists and Communists also form part of the DPJ's ragbag rebellion.
Mr Ozawa promises to restore the pension system, help the working poor and the old, and revitalise the countryside. The DPJ's proposals for paying for this are not credible. But in his own policy address on September 21st Mr Ozawa aimed squarely at a rotten target: the murky national budget. Mr Ozawa will try to convince voters that the LDP and its allies in the bureaucracy are congenitally incapable of revamping the way taxpayers' money is taken in and spent in unaccountable ways. Many voters will sit up and listen. Others will think that to return the LDP to the lower house would be to continue the mess of a hung Diet. Mr Ozawa's hopes for an upheaval look entirely plausible.","Aso steps up to the plate ; but perhaps not to stay very long

IF SOME national leaders can be said to be having a good economic crisis, Japan's prime minister since September, Taro Aso, is not among them. The crisis is not only failing to convince the country that he is the steady hand it needs. It is laying bare the ungovernability of the whole political system over which he presides.
Japan is now officially in recession after its longest post-war expansion, and is unlikely to climb out of it until perhaps the middle of next year. Rarely for a developed country, the financial system is without big toxic-debt problems. Rather, the shock has come through a sharp slowdown in exports. Big exporters such as Toyota and Sony and their suppliers are laying off contract and even regular workers. Consumer sentiment has taken a dive. As for business, company profits were a fifth lower in the first half of the financial year from April compared with a year earlier, and the second half will surely be worse.
The credit crunch that Japan had hoped to avoid has arrived. With bond markets all but closed, firms have turned to commercial banks for loans. But a falling stockmarket--the Nikkei 225-share average recently hit a 26-year low--has hurt the banks, which count equity holdings as capital. They are lending little to all but the biggest companies. On December 2nd the Bank of Japan announced that, until April, it would accept pretty much any old corporate debt as collateral from commercial banks for fresh loans. It says it will make {Yen}3 trillion ($32 billion) of extra funding available, yet questions remain about how much banks will lend on to companies. On December 3rd the finance minister, Shoichi Nakagawa, called in the heads of the biggest banks. But such efforts at moral suasion are unlikely to work.
It is possible to exaggerate the economic woes. Japan's biggest companies are not greatly indebted. No systemic crisis dogs the banking system, though Japan's regional banks are weak. The falling stockmarket has affected few Japanese directly, since for years they have hoarded savings in safe bank accounts (and indeed the freezer). Recently, a rush of younger Japanese have even been opening brokerage accounts. Meanwhile, some politicians in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) are lobbying hard for the government to start buying equities. One proposal by a senator, Kotaro Tamura, is for the government to borrow perhaps {Yen}30 trillion from the biggest banks and hand it to professional money-managers. Such a scheme may turn sentiment around.
The political mess, on the other hand, is hard to exaggerate. Mr Aso's ratings have dropped sharply. The press has made much of off-the-cuff remarks by the prime minster in which he has managed to offend doctors and the elderly, both future targets for government cuts. And it has relished his mispronunciation of certain kanji (Chinese characters used in Japanese script) for which schoolchildren would be chided. But at heart Mr Aso, the third LDP man in a row to be elected prime minister by his party rather than the country, has failed to explain quite why he bothered.
His predecessor, Yasuo Fukuda, resigned in order to make way for a sparkier leader to take the country to the polls. But at least three times Mr Aso has postponed what was expected to be a snap election. The delay, he explained, was to deal with the economic crisis, notably by introducing a fresh stimulus package. Yet now Mr Aso says the package will not be introduced until the main session of the Diet (parliament) opens in early January.
Given the obstruction of the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), which controls the upper house of the Diet, that makes political sense. But all the public sees is a spat between the ruling coalition's junior partner, New Komeito, which wants a tax rebate as the main part of the stimulus, and fiscal reformists in the LDP who think households are likelier to save the rebate than spend it, and who want to stop sky-high levels of national debt from rising further. Other LDP pork barons appear to have prevailed in scrapping the commitment to cut spending on public works by 3% a year.
Strains within the LDP are now breaking out into the open, particularly thanks to market liberals, followers of a former prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, who have recently been sidelined. ""Policy groups"" have been formed that throw down a challenge to Mr Aso; they might serve as springboards to form a new political party. Yoshimi Watanabe, a former minister of administrative reform and a critic of Mr Aso's weak political leadership (and of its corollary, strong bureaucratic power), is one of the rebels. Cryptically, he cites his late father, Michio Watanabe, as giving warning against putting party ahead of country. Watanabe senior, a popular LDP figure, once threatened to leave the party as a route to becoming prime minister. The son also refuses to rule out leaving. In the meantime, he calls for a grand coalition government--minus Mr Aso--as a first step towards breaking the political deadlock of two strong chambers controlled by opposing parties.
The DPJ's bruiser of a leader, Ichiro Ozawa, as unloved as Mr Aso, wants to sow further discord within the LDP. He too has revived the idea of a coalition government, but probably as a means of coaxing more disaffected LDP types into poking their heads above the parapet. For now most LDP politicians appear to think that would be foolhardy. Yet none thinks Mr Aso has total control over the election timetable--April now seems the likeliest month--let alone his fate as leader.

As panic spread, governments engineered the rescue of distressed banks or took them over directly. By the end of the month the remaining big Wall Street houses had either been absorbed by others or become bank holding companies. 
America and Europe reacted to the unfolding crisis by unveiling broad bail-out packages for the financial system. After a battle in Congress America extended $700 billion in funding. With credit markets frozen, central banks took emergency steps to boost liquidity. America's Federal Reserve made unprecedented market interventions, such as buying large amounts of short-term debt issued to companies to enable day-to-day financing.
Most central banks slashed interest rates. The Fed reduced its rates to near zero, lower than they have ever been. 
The global stockmarket gains of recent yearswere wiped out. Hopes that emerging markets would remain buoyant during a downturn in the West were dashed when markets plummeted in China, India, Russia and elsewhere. 
With job losses mounting, governments pondered measures to stave off a deep economic slump. Japan and the euro area fell into recession (using the definition of two quarters of negative growth) and America was officially declared to have been in recession since December 2007. The IMF, World Bank and OECD snipped their projections for economic growth next year. A change is gonna come
Events in the markets helped propel Barack Obama to a big win in America's presidential election. John McCain, Mr Obama's Republican rival, was widely judged to have fumbled his response to the crisis. 
Earlier, Mr Obama fought an epic battle with Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primaries. Mrs Clinton was given the job of secretary of state in the Obama administration, which starts work on January 20th. One of the new president's top priorities will be to implement a stimulus package, the passage of which should be made easier by increased Democratic majorities in Congress. 
Britain's Gordon Brown won plaudits for his handling of the financial crisis. It had looked as though 2008 would be a dismal year for the prime minister. His Labour Party trailed David Cameron's Conservatives by some 30 points in the polls, but rebounded when the Tories failed to explain how they would have handled the crisis differently. 
Yasuo Fukuda resigned as Japan's prime minister in frustration at his inability to implement policy. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party put Taro Aso into the job, but his future is in doubt as the country's economy contracts. 
Kenya was ravaged by violence following a disputed presidential election, leading to the formation of a fragile government of national unity in April. Two judges oversaw separate reports on the trouble that criticised politicians, police and the electoral commission. 
Pakistan's general election was a humiliation for the embattled presidency of Pervez Musharraf. His allies won just 16% of the seats, well behind the Pakistan People's Party led by Asif Zardari, the widower of Benazir Bhutto, a former prime minister assassinated last year. Mr Musharraf eventually resigned when parliament threatened to impeach him; Mr Zardari won an indirect ballot to replace him. The comandante's last move

It was Russia's first big military incursion beyond its borders since it invaded Afghanistan in 1979. Moscow pulled its troops back, eventually, but recognised the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. 
Dmitry Medvedev won Russia's presidential election in March, though real power remained with Vladimir Putin, who became Mr Medvedev's prime minister. 
Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb wartime leader, was arrested in Belgrade, 13 years after being indicted for crimes against humanity. He was sent to the war-crimes tribunal in The Hague to stand trial. 
India endured another year of frequent terrorist incidents, including a spate of bombings in one day in Jaipur. But even the experts were taken by surprise at the audacity of a co-ordinated attack by gunmen on Mumbai. Security forces fought the assailants over several days and at least 190 people were killed. 
The violence was less severe in Iraq than in previous years; American forces handed responsibility back to Iraqi troops for Anbar province, the bloodiest zone in the first years of the insurgency. Iraq's parliament endorsed an agreement that requires American troops to withdraw from Iraq altogether by the end of 2011.
Conversely, it was the deadliest year for coalition forces in Afghanistan since the 2001 invasion. In a chilling development, a 13-year-old boy was deployed as a suicide-bomber by the Taliban, killing three British marines.

China's big year as host of the summer Olympics didn't go quite according to plan. The games were a spectacular success, but China's suppression of the worst outbreak of violence in Tibet in decades led to protests in cities around the world that took part in a relay of the Olympic torch en route to Beijing. 
Three months before the Olympics China suffered its worst natural disaster in 30 years when a massive earthquake rocked the province of Sichuan, killing some 70,000 people and leaving 5m homeless. China launched an all-out rescue effort that was widely praised. 
In contrast, Myanmar's ruling junta was roundly condemned for its response to a cyclone that left large swathes of the Irrawaddy delta submerged, causing at least 145,000 deaths. The furtive regime was eventually persuaded to allow a trickle of foreign aid into the deluged region.

Thailand saw prime ministers come and go with alarming frequency amid a political crisis caused by a stand-off between allies of Thaksin Shinawatra, a former prime minister toppled in 2006, and pro-monarchy supporters. The latter staged a sit-in at Bangkok's international airport for a week that left thousands of passengers stranded. 
Canada's Stephen Harper failed to win a parliamentary majority for his Conservative government; two months after the election the prime minister had to suspend Parliament to avoid being ousted by the opposition.
Robert Mugabe won a presidential run-off election in Zimbabwe after his opponent, Morgan Tsvangirai, who won the first round, pulled out because of intimidation.

Jacob Zuma, the ANC's party leader, seems likely to win the job in 2009, provided that continuing court cases do not ensnare him. A breakaway party, the Congress of the People, may dent the ANC's authority in a general election in mid-2009, though probably without ousting the ruling party.

It was a bad year for Colombia's FARC guerrillas.

Wall Street's collapse just a few days after the LHC was switched on was deemed a coincidence.","The credit crunch turned into a full - blown globalfinancial crisis in September when Lehman Brothers , one of Wall Street 's big investment banks , declared bankruptcy and American officials seized control of American International Group to prevent the giant insurer 's collapse . As panic spread , governments engineered the rescue of distressed banks or took them over directly . By the end of the month the remaining big Wall Street houses had either been absorbed by others or become bank holding companies . 
 America and Europe reacted to the unfolding crisis by unveiling broad bail - out packages for the financial system . After a battle in Congress America extended $ 700 billion in funding . With credit markets frozen , central banks took emergency steps to boost liquidity . America 's Federal Reserve made unprecedented market interventions , such as buying large amounts of short - term debt issued to companies to enable day - to - day financing . 
 Most central banks slashed interest rates . The Fed reduced its rates to near zero , lower than they have ever been . 
 The global stockmarket gains of recent yearswere wiped out . Hopes that emerging markets would remain buoyant during a downturn in the West were dashed when markets plummeted in China , India , Russia and elsewhere . 
 With job losses mounting , governments pondered measures to stave off a deep economic slump . Japan and the euro area fell into recession ( using the definition of two quarters of negative growth ) and America was officially declared to have been in recession since December 2007 . The IMF , World Bank and OECD snipped their projections for economic growth next year . A change is gon na come 
 Events in the markets helped propel Barack Obama to a big win in America 's presidential election . John McCain , Mr Obama 's Republican rival , was widely judged to have fumbled his response to the crisis . 
 Earlier , Mr Obama fought an epic battle with Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primaries . Mrs Clinton was given the job of secretary of state in the Obama administration , which starts work on January 20th . One of the new president 's top priorities will be to implement a stimulus package , the passage of which should be made easier by increased Democratic majorities in Congress . 
 Britain 's Gordon Brown won plaudits for his handling of the financial crisis . It had looked as though 2008 would be a dismal year for the prime minister . His Labour Party trailed David Cameron 's Conservatives by some 30 points in the polls , but rebounded when the Tories failed to explain how they would have handled the crisis differently . 
 Yasuo Fukuda resigned as Japan 's prime minister in frustration at Yasuo Fukuda's inability to implement policy . The ruling Liberal Democratic Party put Taro Aso into the job , but his future is in doubt as the country 's economy contracts . 
 Kenya was ravaged by violence following a disputed presidential election , leading to the formation of a fragile government of national unity in April . Two judges oversaw separate reports on the trouble that criticised politicians , police and the electoral commission . 
 Pakistan 's general election was a humiliation for the embattled presidency of Pervez Musharraf . His allies won just 16 % of the seats , well behind the Pakistan People 's Party led by Asif Zardari , the widower of Benazir Bhutto , a former prime minister assassinated last year . Mr Musharraf eventually resigned when parliament threatened to impeach him ; Mr Zardari won an indirect ballot to replace him . The comandante 's last move 
 Fidel Castro stepped down as Cuba 's president , handing over the job to his younger brother , Raul , whose plans to reform the island 's communist economy were slowed by two devastating hurricanes . 
 A resurgent Russia invaded Georgia in August after Georgian forces entered the breakaway region of South Ossetia . It was Russia 's first big military incursion beyond its borders since it invaded Afghanistan in 1979 . Moscow pulled its troops back , eventually , but recognised the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia . 
 Dmitry Medvedev won Russia 's presidential election in March , though real power remained with Vladimir Putin , who became Mr Medvedev 's prime minister . 
 Radovan Karadzic , the Bosnian Serb wartime leader , was arrested in Belgrade , 13 years after being indicted for crimes against humanity . He was sent to the war - crimes tribunal in The Hague to stand trial . 
 India endured another year of frequent terrorist incidents , including a spate of bombings in one day in Jaipur . But even the experts were taken by surprise at the audacity of a co - ordinated attack by gunmen on Mumbai . Security forces fought the assailants over several days and at least 190 people were killed . 
 The violence was less severe in Iraq than in previous years ; American forces handed responsibility back to Iraqi troops for Anbar province , the bloodiest zone in the first years of the insurgency . Iraq 's parliament endorsed an agreement that requires American troops to withdraw from Iraq altogether by the end of 2011 . 
 Conversely , it was the deadliest year for coalition forces in Afghanistan since the 2001 invasion . In a chilling development , a 13 - year - old boy was deployed as a suicide - bomber by the Taliban , killing three British marines . 
 After being dogged by corruption allegations , Ehud Olmert decided to step down as Israel 's prime minister . He remains in office until February 's general election , which Binyamin Netanyahu is currently favoured to win . When no means wait and see 
 The European Union was thrown into a tizzy when Irish voters rejected the Lisbon treaty , which Eurosceptics see as an effort to impose the old draft constitution by the back door . EU leaders pressed Ireland to hold another vote . 
 The ideological divide in Latin America widened . Venezuela nationalised the cement and steel industries , Argentina 's government took over its private pension system and Ecuador defaulted on its foreign debt . But most governments in the region maintained their trust in free markets and inflation targeting . Rest ye merry gentlemen 
 Merger activity dwindled compared with 2007 . Several large takeover bids failed , such as Microsoft 's offer for Yahoo ! and BHPBilliton 's pursuit of Rio Tinto . Hewlett - Packard did buy EDS , and Anheuser - Busch , which makes Budweiser beer , was taken over by Belgium 's InBev . At $ 52 billion , it was one of the biggest ever foreign acquisitions of an American company . 
 China 's big year as host of the summer Olympics did n't go quite according to plan . The games were a spectacular success , but China 's suppression of the worst outbreak of violence in Tibet in decades led to protests in cities around the world that took part in a relay of the Olympic torch en route to Beijing . 
 Three months before the Olympics China suffered its worst natural disaster in 30 years when a massive earthquake rocked the province of Sichuan , killing some 70,000 people and leaving 5 m homeless . China launched an all - out rescue effort that was widely praised . 
 In contrast , Myanmar 's ruling junta was roundly condemned for its response to a cyclone that left large swathes of the Irrawaddy delta submerged , causing at least 145,000 deaths . The furtive regime was eventually persuaded to allow a trickle of foreign aid into the deluged region . 
 Most carmakers had a rotten year , no more so than in America . Detroit 's Big Three went caps - in - hand to Congress for public assistance . 
 The price of oil breached $ 100 a barrel for the first time in January . Oil prices spiked at more than $ 147 in July , but fell by more than two - thirds as the world economy drooped . 
 The end of the commodity boom was especially welcomed in countries that had witnessed riots over high food prices earlier in the year . Thaksin times 
 Thailand saw prime ministers come and go with alarming frequency amid a political crisis caused by a stand - off between allies of Thaksin Shinawatra , a former prime minister toppled in 2006 , and pro - monarchy supporters . The latter staged a sit - in at Bangkok 's international airport for a week that left thousands of passengers stranded . 
 Canada 's Stephen Harper failed to win a parliamentary majority for his Conservative government ; two months after the election the prime minister had to suspend Parliament to avoid being ousted by the opposition . 
 Robert Mugabe won a presidential run - off election in Zimbabwe after his opponent , Morgan Tsvangirai , who won the first round , pulled out because of intimidation .

THE scares over bird flu since 1997 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 have spurred research into the economic costs of pandemics. Studies paint a grim picture of what swine flu could mean for the world economy. For example, World Bank economists estimated last year that a pandemic with death rates similar to those in the Spanish flu that swept the world in 1918-19 could shrink global GDP by 4.8%. 
Although such research can help to identify the economic effects of swine flu, global recession means that some of the mechanisms it describes are already at work. The recession means, perhaps counterintuitively, that the incremental economic effect of a pandemic may be less dramatic than it would be in normal times. 
Economists argue that a pandemic would affect both global demand and global supply, but that the first of these is particularly vulnerable to the uncertainty and fear surrounding even the possibility of widespread disease. That would cause consumer spending to fall and businesses to put investment plans on hold.
Asia's experience with SARS is a guide. The outbreak caused a sharp drop in private consumption in the economies it affected. People avoided going out--as they are doing in Mexico. On April 29th the country's president, Felipe Calderon, announced a national suspension of non-essential activities from May 1st to May 5th. The cancelling of sporting events and concerts, the closing of bars and nightclubs, and people's propensity to stay inside had already cost Mexico City's service and retail industries $55m a day from April 24th, when authorities first closed schools. That sum was expected to double after a ban on restaurants seating customers.
Financial markets have reacted sharply: the peso has fallen by 5.5% against the dollar since the emergency began. Mexico's finance minister, Agustin Carstens, has said that he expects the economic cost to be 0.3-0.5% of GDP, based on Asian precedents. Luis Flores, an economist at IXE, a bank, reckons that the government's budget deficit could increase by 0.7% of GDP.
This outbreak has happened when, worldwide, consumer confidence is low. So any further drops in demand because of a swine-flu pandemic may be smaller than those caused by SARS, when airline-passenger arrivals in Hong Kong fell by nearly two-thirds in a month. But a pandemic would dent hopes of a rapid recovery from recession, by providing yet another reason for gloom to continue.
The uncertainty caused by a pandemic could hit investment too. Risk premiums for countries affected by the pandemic might rise. And worries about safety, justified or not, pose risks to trade. Already, China has banned Mexican pork, though there is no evidence to suggest that meat spreads flu viruses. World trade is already plummeting. Widespread reactions of this sort could steepen its dive. More than fear itself
The potential supply-side effects of a pandemic come mainly because people fall ill or die. Infected people cannot work, and others must take time off to care for them. This has an immediate effect on the size of the labour force, but with consequences that last many years. The future output of those who die is lost. That is especially important when people of working age are taken. The worst economic consequences of AIDS have come from death and sickness among young adults.
The worldwide costs from deaths and hospitalisation are hard to calculate in the absence of information about medical costs in each country. However, Martin Meltzer, Nancy Cox and Keiji Fukuda, now deputy director-general of the World Health Organisation, did the sums for America in a paper in 1999. They found that a pandemic affecting 15-35% of the population would have cost between $71.3 billion and $166.5 billion (in 1999 dollars). 
The bulk of this would come from forgoing all that the sick and the dead would have produced. In other words, it is an estimate of the effect on the potential output of the American economy. Because of the global slump, many more people are already out of work than in normal times. This probably means that the immediate cost of additional losses in output would be smaller than in the estimates made by Mr Meltzer, Ms Cox and Mr Fukuda.
Several studies have put all this together to estimate the overall impact of a pandemic on economic growth. In 2006 Warwick McKibbin and Alexandra Sidorenko found in a study for the Lowy Institute for International Policy in Sydney that even a mild pandemic could shave 0.8% off world GDP. For the worst possibility they considered, the drop would be a staggering 12.6%. They reckon a pandemic similar to the one that began in 1918 would reduce growth in the American economy by 3 percentage points and in Japan by 8.3 points. Roughly comparable numbers emerge from a study by economists at America's Congressional Budget Office (CBO), which found that a Spanish-flu-like pandemic would lower real GDP growth in America by about 5 points. Even a milder episode would lead to a 1.5-point drop.
These are large declines. The CBO notes that a severe pandemic would be like a typical post-war recession. As it happens, the worries about swine flu come when the world is already in its worst slump since the war. That would dampen the economic effects of a pandemic. But if a pandemic does occur, this would be small comfort indeed.

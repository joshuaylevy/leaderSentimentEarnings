A few paces from the porno shops and pin-ball parlours stands a brightly lit koban, a police box. Inside, three policemen sit behind a long, low table spread with detailed maps, old-fashioned telephones, and a box of red-tipped seals for stamping documents. Little local police stations like this one, sometimes manned by only one person, are to be found in 15,000 places across Japan. They represent one of the secrets behind Japan's enviably low crime rate.
Every few minutes somebody comes in to ask for help. A man dressed exclusively in leather is looking for a certain night club; this is pointed out for him on one of the maps. Another caller wants to report a lost bag; this involves official stamps. Then a grizzled man with a crew-cut enters, bows deeply to the policemen, and hands over Y200 ($1.95). He is repaying a loan: if you are caught short without money for a bus journey home in Tokyo, the police can be relied upon to help, out.
This remarkable cosiness between police and civilians comes with a correspondingly low crime rate. In 1990 Japan suffered 12 thefts per 1,000 people, compared with America's 53 and Germany's 44. The contrast between Japan's present and its past is even more remarkable, although the headline figures obscure the nature of the change. Between 1970 and 1990 the total number of recorded crimes jumped 15%, reflecting the growth in petty theft that naturally accompanied the spread of property. But the striking figure is that, over the same period, violent crime dropped by two-thirds.
What can other countries learn from this? Deriving lessons from Japan involves distinguishing between two kinds of reason for the country's social peace. The first is the particular nature of its society: homogeneous, disciplined, imbued with a fear of ostracism that encourages conformity. The second kind of reason, which may hold transportable lessons, lies in the special strength of its police.
It is tempting to ascribe Japan's low crime rate entirely to social causes. Japan has almost no under-class. Illiteracy is practically unheard of. Tramps remain a rare sight. Immigrants, whose children in some rich countries form a crime-prone underclass, are rare too.
Four decades of remarkable economic growth have rewarded disciplined work both handsomely and evenly. GNP per head has doubled since 1970. Income inequalities have remained remarkably low: at the age of 50, high-school graduates working in big firms get paid 85% as much as their university-educated contemporaries. Even in its worst post-war recession, the government's (admittedly optimistic) statistics say that unemployment remains below 3%. In short, the fat rewards of accepting society's rules have made it foolish to rebel.
Drug-taking is minimal: in 1991 a mere 60 people were arrested for offences relating to cocaine, and 110 for ones relating to heroin. Japanese people, explains Akira Kawada of the National Police Academy, disapprove of drugs. Last year a publishing magnate was arrested for importing cocaine; to show their distaste, some Japanese vowed to stop buying his books.
Yet the social causes of Japan's respect for the law, though powerful, can only suggest why Japan is more peaceful than other rich countries. They cannot explain why Japan is more peaceful today than in the past. Indeed, Japan's serious crime has dwindled even though some of the social conditions that tend to restrain crime have eroded.
HARDER TIMES
Immigrants, for example, maybe scarce, but they are more numerous than they were. Cocaine and heroin were even rarer ten years ago than today. Conservative, multi-generation households are giving way to nuclear families and people living alone. Close-knit, village-like communities are being replaced by modern anonymity.
Nobody is more aware of this last point than the Japanese police. In 1992 the National Police Agency complained of ""the borderless rampancy of crimes"", meaning that society, and therefore crime, has grown more mobile.
In 1970 one Japanese in five had a car; in 1990 one in two. Driving, rather than walking, cuts people off from their neighbours: they lose opportunities to greet each other in the street. Cars also encourage shoppers to o less to friendly local stores, and more to distant discounters where customers avoid each other's eyes. And cars enable families to abandon cramped town centres, where everybody knows the neighbours, in favour of spacious suburbs, where anonymity reigns.
All this weakens the old social ties that both deterred crime and made investigating it easier. In the motorised age, a criminal can escape faster from the scene of his crime. He may drive to the scene too, so the old assumption that he is somebody who lives nearby is no loner safe. Even if he does turn out to be a local, his neighbours may never have spoken to him. Personal relations are ""thinning"", in the police agency's phrase.
In May 1990 a small girl was found dead in Ashikaga, a quiet town in Tochigi prefecture, on the border between the Japan Alps and Tokyo's Kanto plain. Over the next 18 months, the police distributed an average of ten leaflets to each of Ashikaga's 53,000 homes, asking for useful information. But Ashikaga had suffered the transition to mobility: since the early 1970s cars had reduced the number of pedestrians in its shopping streets on the average July Sunday by two-thirds. Leaflets and door-to-door questioning produced few results. When a suspect was eventually arrested (he confessed to murdering two other children previously), it transpired that none of his neighbours had known his name, his job, or anything else about him.
NEIGHBOURLY POLICEMAN
Japan's policing triumph--the reduction of serious crime despite more awkward social circumstances--has been achieved through skilful adaptation. The most important instance of this is to be found in the maps and friendly grins in that Tokyo police box. The stream of callers asking for help testifies to a triumphant campaign to ensure that a traditional system has not been left behind by social modernisation, but has been adapted and extended as the central feature of policing in Japan.
The importance of neighbourhood policing was recognised decades ago. In 1967 the patrol police, who, as a subsection of the traffic police, had been considered the dregs of the force, were dignified with the status of a division.
These days, some 6,000 police boxes are manned day and night in Japan's towns; in the countryside, the boxes, which double as policemen's homes, number 9,000. By deploying manpower widely rather than concentrating it in big police stations, Japan's police aim to be more accessible than their western counterparts. They spend much time dispensing friendly services like telling people the way, taking charge of lost property, or sheltering stray pets. A wife in a live-in police box is expected to help, handling reports of lost goods if her husband is out when someone calls.
To maintain good community relations, the police take par in local events with deadly earnestness. Two years ago in Kanazawa, a small provincial town, the police used to commandeer the top floor of a civic centre for band practices, drowning out this correspondent's Japanese lessons. The National Police Agency claims that police bands give about 5,000 performances each year, and that these are heard (whether with pleasure the statistics do not relate) by some 20m people.
This cosiness traditionally encouraged the public to co-operate with the police, and to volunteer information about suspicious characters. To reinforce this, police-box officers try to call on each family, shop and company in their area twice a year.
But, as the Ashikaga murder showed, social change has undermined the efficacy of traditional police methods. The need to adapt has been clear since the late 1970s, when Masayuki Murayama, a legal academic at Chiba University, accompanied patrolmen on their rounds in Tokyo. He found that women were increasingly going out to work, so it was becoming harder to find householders to survey. Such residents as could be found were becoming less welcoming; only janitors and landlords seemed eager to help. Mr Murayama even found that policemen sometimes forged visit reports in order to escape this unrewarding duty.
Mr Murayama's patrolmen were scarcely more enthusiastic about handling routine callers at the police box. However essential this work might have been to preserving the police force's reputation, patrolmen considered it mundane. In the past, callers had occasionally volunteered information that led to arrests; by the 1970s this was rare, so handling calls gave policemen few opportunities to win points that might lead to promotion.
Instead, more and more arrests resulted from spot checks on suspicious-looking characters in the street--a few questions, an inspection of belongings. Mr Murayama found that patrolmen reserved their enthusiasm for this, since arrests won promotion points. This research was later backed up by official surveys, which found that police boxes were often left unmanned while their occupants were on patrol, much to the public's frustration.
Rather than resin itself the decline of the police box, however, Japan's police force has fought back. In the mid-1980s, the police bean to change the system of evaluating officers, to encourage helpfulness to the public rather than just notching up arrest scores. The visiting system has been adapted to make it more effective: visits concentrate on the people who need them most (the old, for instance) and the areas where they can be most useful (places where mobility is high and it is harder to keep tabs on people). To improve the quality of simple services, the police force has also started rehiring retired policemen, who concentrate exclusively on less taxing jobs like dealing with lost pedestrians and objects found in the street.
The retired policemen are also meant to reduce the number of occasions when police boxes are deserted. But this problem also has a high-tech solution. The police have installed about 100 ""automatic"" boxes: when a caller enters an empty box, a policeman from a nearby station appears on a video screen to answer questions. If the caller wants a local map, this is immediately faxed to him.
The range of help dispensed from the police box has been broadened so as to keep the public interested. In 1991 the police recorded 188,000 requests for personal advice, a modest expansion on 1990. Just under a third related to crime prevention; advice on family problems accounted for more than a quarter of the questions, and civil affairs (such as personal finance) accounted for nearly a fifth.
Social mobility has increased the number of old people living alone and uncared for by their children, and so vulnerable to crime. Community policemen have seen in this an opportunity: at the end of 1991 they claimed to be paying regular visits to some 140,000 people over 65 living alone, about one in seven such households. As well as dispensing advice on crime prevention, the police make it their business to report on the state of the elderly to their relations, so bolstering their reputation for helpfulness.
All this seems to be working. The public's continued willingness to co-operate with the police is revealed in the lost-and-found statistics. In 1991 the number of articles handed in to the police (4.1m) astonishingly exceeded the number of reported losses (2.9m). Fully Y18.5 billion ($137m) in lost cash was found and handed over to the police by dutiful citizens.
Could other countries emulate this system? Some have tried: in 1991 alone, 13 countries sent missions to Japan to study community policing. Frustratingly for foreigners, the friendly style of Japan's patrolmen does in part depend on the friendliness of the people they work with. In 1991 only three policemen died while carrying out their duties; of these, two were killed by an erupting volcano. Not being brutalised, Japanese policemen tend not to be brutal.
Yet this does not mean that Japan's policing friendliness is impossible to copy. For one thin, society can be encouraged to be gentle: gun control is one obvious measure hose absence in America is reckoned crazy in Japan. And the relaxed style of Japan's police owes much to two replicable policies: generous staffing, and leniency.
Japan's policemen claim that they are understaffed, noting that, in 1990, the country had one policeman per 556 Japanese, proportionately fewer than in America (one per 379) or France (268). But Setsuo Miyazawa, a legal academic at Kobe University, points out that Japan's police force is big relative to the number of crimes it must cope with. In 1990 Japan's thefts per policeman were just two-thirds of France's and less than a tenth of America's. Japan's policemen have less work, so their relaxed style should not come as a surprise.
The small number of crimes per policeman is the result of a 73% expansion in police staff between 1960 and 1990. Expansion made promotion easier to come by, which further helped morale; this was reinforced by several redefinitions of ranks. The latest came in 1991, when middle ranks (inspector and assistant inspector) expanded from 19% to 36% of the force, while the numbers of lowly patrolmen shrunk.
Good morale is reflected in the competition to join the police force. In 1991, even before the current recession made private-sector jobs hard to et, 8.6 candidates applied for each available job. More than a third of the 7,500 successful applicants had been to college or university.
Then there is the leniency. In 1990, 31% of offenders caught and questioned by the police were dismissed after signing an apology for some minor offence. The prevailing attitude of forgiveness achieves three objects. Police are spared the job of collecting evidence to support the prosecution of minor cases. The public is reinforced in its view that policemen are decent. And the stigma of judicial action is reserved for serious crimes.
THE UNNEIGHBOURLY POLICEMAN
None of this means that Japan's policemen are soft. Far from it: a big reason for the low rate of serious crime is that it is so hard to get away with. In 1989 Japan cleared 96% of its murder cases--for which the penalty may be death--and 76% of its robberies, a far higher proportion than elsewhere. The reasons for this are replicable too, though some may not be desirable.
The scattered deployment entailed by the police-box system enables patrolmen to et to the scene of a crime quickly. Those at the bar-district box could walk to the boundary of their allotted area in two minutes. In 1989 it took the police an average of five minutes and 49 seconds to reach the scene after receiving an emergency telephone call.
Japan's police force is experimenting with new methods. It is developing a central computer database of photographs and notes on suspects that can be easily consulted by prefectural police agencies. New roadside machines check number-plates of passing cars against those of wanted vehicles. More gadgets check fragments of fingerprints left by suspects against vast numbers of fingerprints held in a computer. Technological advance helps to derive clues from infinitesimal quantities of material left behind by criminals.
Next come the less desirable causes for Japan's high clearance rate, which come down to the fact that suspects have few civil rights. In theory, Japanese have the right to silence and legal help when they are arrested. In practice, suspects can be held for 23 days without being charged, and often without access to a lawyer.
Japan's police therefore have plenty of opportunities to force confessions. These are neither recorded verbatim nor tape-recorded. Instead, detectives write up the results of their interrogations into coherent statements, and tell the suspects to sin them.
In 1990 fully 91.5% of defendants tried at district and summary courts had signed such confessions, according to Mr Murayama. Japan's constitution declares that forced confessions, or confessions made after unduly long periods of detention, shall not be admitted in court; and that confession alone is insufficient basis for conviction. In practice, confessions carry a lot of weight, in part because those who are accused of crimes are given little chance to collect evidence for their defence.
In 1990 36% of defendants tried at district and summary courts had no witnesses at all to give evidence on their behalf. Among the rest, the average number of witnesses was just 1.5. Press reports of arrests and trials often assume that the accused is guilty. It is only slightly amazing, therefore, that in 1990 the conviction rate in district and summary courts was 99.8%.
Leniency and friendliness are thus matched with illiberal ferocity towards those presumed guilty; inducements to respect the law and the police are backed by harsh treatment for those who fail to do so. Other rich countries, with loner traditions of civil liberties, may balk at the second half of Japan's formula. But the first--the friendly policeman in a little local box--plus the blending of police work with some of the roles usually played by social workers--provides a valuable lesson for outsiders.","It is Friday night in a bar district of Tokyo , and the Japanese miracle is under way .

The prime minister, Tsutomu Hata, is flirting with anyone he thinks might save him from ignominious defeat at the polls. And a gatecrasher from the provinces is trying to put an end to the whole ridiculous fandango.
The main opposition, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), is threatening Mr Hata with a motion of no confidence as soon as the country's budget is passed, which will probably be in mid-June. On the face of it, he is likely to lose: he can count on only 178 votes in the 611-seat lower house of the Diet. But the leaders of the SDP, who refused to join his coalition when they were excluded from a new inner-circle group known as Kaishin, are playing a nice-cop-nasty-cop routine with him, with promises of absolution if he confesses the error of his ways.
The routine began with Wataru Kubo, the party's secretary-general, calling for Mr Hata to go. Mr Kubo knows that Kaishin is a vehicle for the ambitions of Mr Hata's colleague Ichiro Ozawa, rather than the prime minister himself. Mr Kubo hinted that, if Mr Hata were to expiate his guilt-by-association with resignation, the SDP would catch him before he hit the ground. It would join a new coalition, possibly with Mr Hata as its leader, and no election would be necessary. A few days later, however, the SDP seemed to be turning elsewhere. Its chairman. Tomiichi Murayama, suggested his party might be ready to co-operate with the LDP, Or at least with elements within it. Even without an election Mr Hata would be history.
In part this is bluff, in part a real difference of opinion. The SDP is split. Mr Kubo represents the reformers who would deregulate the economy, promote indirect taxes over direct ones, and favour an activist foreign policy. Mr Murayama, a creature of the trade unions, tends towards the status quo.
At present it looks as though Mr Kubo is going to have his way. There will be a price, of course: the end of Kaishin and the humiliation of Mr Ozawa. The down-payment has already been made. Keigo Ouchi, the chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party, was made to announce his resignation on June 1st. Though Kaishin was Mr Ozawa's idea, he persuaded Mr Ouchi to accept the honour of announcing its formation. Now that it has failed to shore up Mr Hata, Mr Ouchi is sacrificing himself as penance.
This is bad news for the LDP. It needs an election sooner rather than later. By September the new system of single-member constituencies promised under the new electoral law is expected to be in place. The current system over-represents the countryside and thus favours the LDP.
The party, though, still has weapons with which to attack the government. It seems content to leave the destruction of Kaishin to the SDP. At present it is trying to undermine the other large coalition member, the Clean Government Party, Komeito.
The cleanliness of any Japanese administration is dubious. Since the second world war, three prime ministers have been forced out of office under a cloud of corruption, and one has been sent to prison. On May 31st questions were even asked about the disappearance from the books of a loan by the hitherto spotless Mr Hata to his wife. Komeito's cleanliness, though, is next to godliness. It is prominently backed by Soka Gakkai, a Buddhist group with 17m members.
Too prominently, says Shizuka Kamei, who believes Komeito's activities contravene the legal separation between temple and state. On May 24th Mr Kamei, an LDP member of the budget committee, played what he claimed was a tape of Daisaku Ikeda, Soka Gakkai's leader, crowing about his influence over the cabinet of the previous prime minister, Morihiro Hosokawa.
All this manoeuvring, though, involves the same old names and faces. Yet the man who perhaps poses the greatest threat to Mr Hata's chances of holding the prime ministership for any length of time is not even in the Diet. He is Takahiro Yokomichi, the governor of Hokkaido. Like Mr Hosokawa (the other new face in Japanese politics, who comes from Kyushu, at the other end of the Japanese archipelago), he is a charismatic outsider. Unlike Mr Hosokawa, he inclines to the left, but like him he has ambitions to reform the political system by breaking up the existing parties. He is promoting the formation of the Council for Democratic Government (CDG), a Kaishin of the moderate left with members from a collection of parliamentary groupuscules including parts of the SDP.
The CDG is expected to proclaim itself officially in mid-June. At the moment it is reckoned to have between 50 and 60 existing Diet members--about as many as Mr Hata's group within Kaishin. This, and Mr Yokomichi's reputation as a popular, honest outsider, could make the governor a man of significance. Come the general election, he will be looking for a seat in the Diet.","After six weeks outside government, Japan's Social Democratic Party (SDP) is bored with being a wallflower.

The third in three months is Tomiichi Murayama, from the left-wing Social Democratic Party. Bizarrely, he is backed by the conservative Liberal Democratic Party(Lop), though not by the reformist party of the previous prime minister, Tsutomu Hata, which would have preferred Toshiki Kaifu, a member of the LDP. The selection was baffling, even to insiders, but the important results are simple. In the short term Japanese politics will be chaotic. In the medium term democracy may gain.
Mr Murayama is 70. He has no ministerial experience. And he comes from the left of the left. From August 1993 until April, the Social Democrats were part of the reformist government led by Morihiro Hosokawa. That coalition collapsed because Mr Hosokawa's sense of urgency clashed with the Social Democrats' foot-dragging. That is one trait they have in common with their new partners in the LDP and the small New Harbinger Party: both take a cautious view of deploying Japanese troops abroad, and both are happy to delay the economic deregulation that most accept is necessary. But the nay coalition is dogged by old memories. During the cold war the LDP firmly took America's side, while the Socialists (as they were then known) preached leftist neutralism.
Memories have already caused some parliamentarians to revolt. In the final round of the ballot for prime minister on June 29th, 51 members of the Diet defied their party leaders by voting against Mr Murayama. They included some big LDP names: Yasuhiro Nakasone, prime minister from 1982 to 1987; Michio Watanabe, a former foreign minister; and Mr Kaifu, prime minister from 1989 to 1881. Among Social Democrats, eight voted against their own boss, and another three abstained.
More revolts may follow as events test the coalition's unity. It may prove impossible, for example, to avoid speeding up the pace of deregulation. This week the yen rose to new heights against the dollar, threatening Japan's fragile economic recovery. Japan's vast trade surplus lies at the root of the yen's strength. Deregulation should help to shrink it by making it easier for foreign firms to sell in the Japanese market. Accordingly, on June 28th, the outgoing government announced a package of 279 promises to unravel rules and red tape.
The LDP and Social Democrats are likely to argue about how to fudge this inheritance. They may also bicker over tax reform, so provoking a clash with the finance ministry, which is anxious to raise consumption taxes. Meanwhile, North Korea's nuclear programme could provoke fresh pressure for economic sanctions. The LDP would want to co-operate with an attempt to impose sanctions; the Social Democrats would not.
The biggest threat to government cohesion, however, lies in the looming election. New constituencies are due to be drawn up by September; many expect an election a couple of months after that. Having fought each other through the cold war, the rank-and-file from both coalition parties are unlikely to co-operate on the hustings. Unless the election is delayed, their interests in keeping the coalition together will fade.
When it comes to the election, however, the benefits of chaos may start to be felt. For the clearest achievement of the political turmoil that began last year has been to break the LDP'S 38-year hold on government. The worry has been that an election might restore the LDP'S dominance, because the new electoral system does away with the multi-member constituencies that helped to protect smaller parties' voices.
As it is, however, the latest defections from the LDP and the Social Democrats have swollen the ranks of the reformist block. This includes Mr Hata and his predecessor, Mr Hosokawa, who belong to a new reformist grouping, Kaishin. Together with the Buddhist Clean Government Party and two other splinter groups, this block is just about big enough to take the LDP on.
The new divide may also offer voters a clearer choice of policies than they have enjoyed for some time. When the LDP was formed in 1955, its character was clear. It was pro-American, and pro-Japanese business. It was against the Socialists, who stood a chance of being elected. But as the Socialist opposition weakened, along with socialism worldwide, the main policy divisions ceased to coincide with party lines. Instead, they fell within the LDP--so depriving voters of a say over them.
Now parties and policies are matching up again. This week's defectors from the LDP, notably Messrs Nakasone and Watanabe, share Kaishin's more outgoing foreign policy; Kaishin's chief strategist, Ichiro Ozawa, believes Japanese troops should take more part in United Nations peacekeeping, despite Japan's pacifist constitution. Meanwhile the Social Democratic defectors come from the right of the party, which shares Kaishin's appetite for deregulation. The next election should give Japanese a chance to choose between this and the LDP'S conservatism.","As they say in Tokyo these days , Japan has become a karaoke democracy : everybody can have a turn at being prime minister .

""America's fiscal policy is to ignore fiscal policy,"" said one a few months ago; ""Europe's fiscal policy is that fighting unemployment comes first."" Lately however, there has been less cause to sound superior. With the formation of a new coalition government at the end of last month, a decade of fiscal prudence in Japan may be about to end.
The new government, led by the nominally socialist Tomiichi Murayama, has been insisting that it shares its predecessor's views on most subjects, notably the need to press ahead with deregulation and political reform. But agreement stops at tax policy. The previous government wanted to pay for a recent cut in income taxes with a higher consumption tax, to be announced by the end of the year. Mr Murayama says he will extend the income-tax cuts but postpone thoughts of higher consumption taxes.
Other government ministers are similarly generous. The new welfare minister wants to avoid raising workers' pension contributions. The transport minister promises more bullet trains. There is talk of replacing this decade's Y430 trillion ($4.4 trillion) public-works programme with a new ten-year plan costing Y600 trillion. And on July 6th the government increased subsidies to rice farmers by 70%.
The coalition says it will recoup some of these expenses by spending less on government. This goes down well with most voters, who reckon Japan has far too many interfering bureaucrats. Yet the truth is that it has 45,000 fewer public employees than in the late 1960s. Japan's government payroll accounts for 6.5% of total employment, much below the 15% average that prevails in the rich countries of the OECD. There may not be much scope for further pruning.
The coalition also hopes to save money by making spending more efficient. There is no lack of opportunity to do this. The health ministry is curbing drug costs by encouraging doctors to prescribe less lavishly. The building ministry is making tenders for public works more open and competitive. Yet, in other ways, deregulation may boost public spending. Regulation has helped weak firms by protecting them from competition, making consumers subsidise them through higher prices. As deregulation proceeds, political pressure is likely to force government to make up producers' losses: witness the new subsidies for farmers, which were offered as compensation for lifting the ban on rice imports.
These considerations pale, however, next to the ageing of Japan's population. In 1990 12.1% of Japanese were 65 or over, a smaller share than in America, Britain, Germany or France. By the end of this decade Japan will be greyer than all these countries except Germany (with which it will have drawn level). By 2020 one in four Japanese will be aged 65 or over--a higher proportion than in any other country.
This undermines Japan's secret fiscal weapon. In fighting to restore budgetary discipline after the deficit ballooned in the 1970s, the finance ministry boasted that it would never again issue ""deficit bonds"". Yet the finance ministry continued borrowing from a different source, which does not show up in narrow measures of the budget balance. Japan's post offices rake in deposits from housewives; and the public pension system takes monthly contributions from workers. The government uses part of these to provide subsidised housing loans and to carry out public works.
As Japan ages, however, the likely decline in the savings rate may drain money from the post offices, and the public pension schemes will start paying out more than they take in. Worse, the public pension system does not contain enough funds to meet its obligations to future pensioners. Bureaucrats in the welfare ministry reckon (whatever their minister says) that over the next two decades the share of wages going into pension contributions will have to double. Even if the retirement age is raised from 60 to 65, workers will have to pay 25% of their wages, up from the current 15%. Since this may be politically unacceptable, future governments will no doubt be tempted to borrow the money needed to pay pensions.
In the approach to the G7 summit, America has reissued its ritual call for Japan to pump demand into its economy in order to raise consumption and thus imports. Given the looming budget crisis, this would be a mistake for Japan, and might not serve America's interests either. An irresponsible boost might win the new government the approval of voters, and thus discourage the other changes that America wants to promote: Mr Murayama's instincts, despite this week's pronouncements, are to delay the deregulation that would open Japan's markets wider to imports.","After years of budget surpluses , officials at Japan 's Ministry of Finance were starting to sound smug . "" America 's fiscal policy is to ignore fiscal policy , "" said one a few months ago ; "" Europe 's fiscal policy is that fighting unemployment comes first . "" Lately however , there has been less cause to sound superior . With the formation of Tomiichi Murayama at the end of last month , a decade of fiscal prudence in Japan may be about to end . 
 Tomiichi Murayama , has been insisting that Tomiichi Murayama shares Tomiichi Murayama's predecessor 's views on most subjects , notably the need to press ahead with deregulation and political reform . But agreement stops at tax policy . The previous government wanted to pay for a recent cut in income taxes with a higher consumption tax , to be announced by the end of the year . Mr Murayama says he will extend the income - tax cuts but postpone thoughts of higher consumption taxes . 
 Other government ministers are similarly generous . The new welfare minister wants to avoid raising workers ' pension contributions . The transport minister promises more bullet trains . There is talk of replacing this decade 's Y430 trillion ( $ 4.4 trillion ) public - works programme with a new ten - year plan costing Y600 trillion . And on July 6th Tomiichi Murayama increased subsidies to rice farmers by 70 % . 
 Tomiichi Murayama says Tomiichi Murayama will recoup some of these expenses by spending less on government . This goes down well with most voters , who reckon Japan has far too many interfering bureaucrats . Yet the truth is that it has 45,000 fewer public employees than in the late 1960s . Japan 's government payroll accounts for 6.5 % of total employment , much below the 15 % average that prevails in the rich countries of the OECD . There may not be much scope for further pruning . 
 Tomiichi Murayama also hopes to save money by making spending more efficient . There is no lack of opportunity to do this . The health ministry is curbing drug costs by encouraging doctors to prescribe less lavishly . The building ministry is making tenders for public works more open and competitive . Yet , in other ways , deregulation may boost public spending . Regulation has helped weak firms by protecting them from competition , making consumers subsidise them through higher prices . As deregulation proceeds , political pressure is likely to force government to make up producers ' losses : witness the new subsidies for farmers , which were offered as compensation for lifting the ban on rice imports . 
 These considerations pale , however , next to the ageing of Japan 's population . In 1990 12.1 % of Japanese were 65 or over , a smaller share than in America , Britain , Germany or France . By the end of this decade Japan will be greyer than all these countries except Germany ( with which it will have drawn level ) . By 2020 one in four Japanese will be aged 65 or over -- a higher proportion than in any other country . 
 This undermines Japan 's secret fiscal weapon . In fighting to restore budgetary discipline after the deficit ballooned in the 1970s , the finance ministry boasted that it would never again issue "" deficit bonds "" . Yet the finance ministry continued borrowing from a different source , which does not show up in narrow measures of the budget balance . Japan 's post offices rake in deposits from housewives ; and the public pension system takes monthly contributions from workers . Tomiichi Murayama uses part of these to provide subsidised housing loans and to carry out public works . 
 As Japan ages , however , the likely decline in the savings rate may drain money from the post offices , and the public pension schemes will start paying out more than they take in . Worse , the public pension system does not contain enough funds to meet its obligations to future pensioners . Bureaucrats in the welfare ministry reckon ( whatever their minister says ) that over the next two decades the share of wages going into pension contributions will have to double . Even if the retirement age is raised from 60 to 65 , workers will have to pay 25 % of their wages , up from the current 15 % . Since this may be politically unacceptable , future governments will no doubt be tempted to borrow the money needed to pay pensions . 
 In the approach to the G7 summit , America has reissued its ritual call for Japan to pump demand into its economy in order to raise consumption and thus imports . Given the looming budget crisis , this would be a mistake for Japan , and might not serve America 's interests either . An irresponsible boost might win Tomiichi Murayama the approval of voters , and thus discourage the other changes that America wants to promote : Mr Murayama 's instincts , despite this week 's pronouncements , are to delay the deregulation that would open Japan 's markets wider to imports .",740,Japan,A29-8194,IN TERM,True,"The new government , led by the nominally socialist Tomiichi Murayama",10,True

Some 25 years after this prediction that material success would destroy Japan's traditional values, an opposing suggestion has gained currency: that a superstar economy, admired internationally, might enable Japan to spread those values beyond its shores.
Japan's post-war success has seemed to threaten the idea that modernisation means westernisation. The West claimed to have discovered universal laws governing everything from economics to aesthetics; until the second world war most political thought assumed that such laws would push countries towards a common destiny. Because western countries were the most advanced, other countries would come to resemble them as they developed.
This belief in a common destiny still pervades America's foreign policy. Yet the idea that modernisation necessarily means westernisation has attracted plenty of critics. It implies a hierarchy of cultures, so offending egalitarians. It puts white nations at the top, so inflaming racial sensitivities. It claims universality for rich nations' values, so conflicting with the reluctance of a free and tolerant world to pass judgment.
The critics take heart from Japan and its neighbours. East Asia has modernised spectacularly (see chart 1); yet it remains stubbornly different from the West. Westernisation, or at least the stereotyped view of it held in America, puts a high value on individualism; Asians like working in groups. It means tolerance of diverse life-styles; East Asia is disciplinarian and conformist. It means freedom of expression; even East Asian societies with free media lack open debate. It means democratisation; but even democratic East Asian countries have unelected bureaucrats wielding enormous power.
East Asia's success has encouraged the view that, far from meaning westernisation, progress can strengthen easternisation. In the past few years a slew of ""declinist"" books has appeared in the West, arguing that the eastern system is all but invincible, or that Japan is ""trading places"" with America in economic league tables. The Clinton administration appears to share this fear, to judge by what it says about Japan's ""closed"" markets and its own industrial policy (such anxieties prompted America's new $500m programme to boost production of flat-panel screens).
East Asians are joining the chorus. Last year regional leaders issued the Bangkok Declaration on human rights, in which the ""Asian Way"" (harmonious, disciplined, collectivist) was held up against its western counterpart (chaotic, licentious, anarchic). Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's elder statesman, says that Asians will valiantly defend order against the corrosive advance of western-style freedom. When Singapore's government caned an American teenager in May, plenty of Americans cheered.
The Asians have not forgotten Japan's wartime brutality. Yet many still see Japan as the natural champion of their system. Malaysia's prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, spent some time in Japan before launching his ""Look East"" campaign In the 1980s. South Korea has modelled its industrial policy on Japan's. In February Zhu Rongji, China's top economic official, spent ten days in Japan studying its economy. The Japanese are currently backing the translation into Chinese of an official history of their industrial policy. Last year they paid for a World Bank report on the East Asian miracle which found that aspects of government intervention were among the reasons for its success.
On these arguments, East Asia's envied success seems to present a challenge to the West that is in some ways stronger (if less antagonistic) than that of communism. Such an idea has become common among proud easterners, as well as those westerners who are critical of the West's own policies. But there are several problems with it.
One is that it depends on a crude and monolithic caricature of the West. ""Western"" economies themselves range from dirigiste France, through paternalist, long-termist Germany to the more genuinely (though still far from completely) free market of the United States; some of their societies are atomised and individualistic, others more group-and family-oriented; they offer, all of them, a moving target for any comparison rather than a fixed model. Moreover the prevailing model of development that was widely peddled after 1950 to budding modernisers (almost always with awful results) by western economists encompassed some elements of what many think of as the East Asian model: use trade barriers to force ""import substitution"", intervene heavily in markets, beat off exploitative foreign multinationals.
Without a western caricature as a comparison, East Asian methods begin to look less exceptional: a different recipe, perhaps, but drawn from a similar list of ingredients. But there is an even bigger objection to the notion of an all-powerful East Asian challenge to the West. For it depends on the vital premise that Japan, the East's first role model, will not grow to resemble the West. And this premise is itself fragile. For reasons that go deeper than Japan's long-drawn-out recent recession, Japan's unwestern features are withering. Just as it seemed poised to become the Oriental role model, Japan may remodel itself instead.
Believers in the East Asian way dispute this. They say that Japan is not about to dump traditions and post-war practices that have brought high growth, low crime and social equality. Yet the model that spawned these achievements is now losing its advantages. Some once-strong features have decayed into weakness. Others were suitable only for an economy that was cashing up. This survey argues that Japan is changing; that modernisation is indeed turning out to mean westernisation; and that Japan will grow ""neutral-tinted"", in Mishima's contemptuous phrase.
One example of a former strength that has become a weakness is the place of hierarchy and social conservatism. These Asian values have encouraged discipline; but they have also stifled new people and ideas. In Japan's post-war years this did not matter, because rapid growth was giving bright youngsters ample chances. But, since the first oil shock of 1973, Japan's rate of growth has slowed (see chart 2).(chart 2 omitted) To allow young stars to shine now, Japan needs to soften its traditional belief in hierarchy.
Other aspects of Japan's post-war model have a built-in obsolescence. Japan copied a mass of foreign technologies. But having caught up, it has to switch from copying to originating ideas. Similarly, Japan for years single-mindedly pursued export-led growth. Now its trade surplus is so unpopular--and its currency so strong--that it is having to follow western countries in relying more on domestic consumption to drive the economy forward.
NEW MODEL POLITICS
It could be that, despite the pressure for change, Japan will continue to cling to its traditions. But its recent political history suggests that this is unlikely. The merger, in 1955, of the country's two biggest political parties to create the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) produced uninterrupted one-party rule for 38 years. This was at first no bad thing. The LDP provided moderate, pro-business government at a time when the socialist alternative romanticised the Soviet Union. By the 1980s, however, the LDP was choking on its own corruption. In return for bribes, the party handed out public contracts and business licences. Outside firms lost out; competition was inhibited; consumers suffered. Yet the LDP was still not voted out of power, mainly because the electoral laws gave up to three times as much weight to rural votes as to urban ones--and the LDP kept rural voters happy with expensive farm protection.
Plenty of people doubted that Japan would ever shake off the LDP. Last year, however, an LDP government was toppled and replaced by a fractious coalition of reformists, some drawn from its own ranks. In January the new guard pushed through electoral reform, undermining the farm vote. Construction executives who had bankrolled the LDP have been hauled off to prison. And despite the formation in June of a new coalition led by a socialist, Tomiichi Murayama, but dominated by the LDP, the old order shows no sign of reviving.
Reformist ideas are now setting the agenda. Listen, for instance, to Ichiro Ozawa, the ex-LDP man most responsible for unseating the LDP government last year: ""We must reform our policies, our economy, our society and our consciousness, to bring them into greater currency with the rest of the world."" These are radical words. Yet they provoke surprisingly little dismay among Mr Ozawa's opponents. Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister whom Mr Ozawa felled, detests Mr Ozawa's activist foreign policy. But he agrees that Japan should deregulate its economy and encourage individualism. Might this not destroy social strengths like equality and public order? Mr Miyazawa responds to such suggestions by noting that ""the Japanese are very practical people"", unsentimental about past achievements, ready to adapt.
Reformers are at work inside Japan's bureaucracy too. Japan's mandarins remain notorious for stifling deregulation that would bring them closer to the Anglo-American model. But this is mere foot-dragging Few bureaucrats now argue that Japan would be better off with no deregulation at all; slowly, liberalisation is proceeding. A 30-something reformist at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry notes that most foot-draggers are older than he is. ""And there is one sure thing about generational conflicts: the young guys win.""
SHUFFLED REVOLUTIONS
There are more reasons for expecting Japan to westernise. Much of Japan's distinctiveness--the power of groups, the lack of vigorous political debate, paternalism, loyalty--reflects a weak individualism. If this were a fixed cultural trait, Japan's distinctiveness might well last. Yet it may instead result from a tangle in the thread of history that is now straightening itself out.
The West, after all, was not always individualistic. In feudal Europe intellectual life consisted mostly of hand-copying manuscripts that spelt out inherited interpretations of God's will; individual reason carried less weight than unreasoning utterances of the Catholic church. Serfs were owned by their masters, who in turn swore allegiance to mightier barons and sovereigns. This intellectual and material bondage faded with the Renaissance. The printing press gave individuals access to a richer variety of ideas. Martin Luther initiated the Reformation by declaring that the individual's interpretation of the Bible mattered more than inherited teaching. Feudal bondage gave way to freer labour markets; eternal pledges of allegiance were replaced by temporary contracts among free men.
Thus in the West individual freedom grew only slowly out of the ashes of a previous feudal order. In Japan feudalism survived into the 19th century Lords were bound to each other by ties of vassalage; peasants surrendered part of their crops as feudal dues; society was frozen in a caste system. Then, in 1853, American gunboats forced Japan to abandon 250 years of isolation. The country's leaders, realising that they would have to modernise to stay independent, responded by organising an industrial revolution in record time. But intellectual revolutions are slower to take hold. So weak individualism lingers on, blending with the bullet trains of Japan's advanced economy.
This mix seems strange to westerners, because their societies modernised in the opposite order to Japan's: the intellectual revolution came before the industrial one. Japan's disordered revolutions have produced a society celebrated as proof that progress can be combined with traditional group harmony. Yet the truth is that Japan's intellectual revolution was delayed, not cancelled. Individualism has been catching up; and with it, the notion of a distinctive Japanese role model is fading.","""Japan will disappear,"" wrote Yukio Mishima, novelist and nationalist; ""it will become inorganic, empty, neutral-tinted; it will be wealthy and astute."" Some 25 years after this prediction that material success would destroy Japan's traditional values, an opposing suggestion has gained currency: that a superstar economy, admired internationally, might enable Japan to spread those values beyond its shores.

Close relations between these two states may one day prove important in containing the two potential bullies in their part of the world: Russia and China.
For the moment, this prospect seems distant. Russia and China are both absorbed in domestic economic reform. On July 20th the Russians announced that they would cut the size of their Pacific fleet by a third. China is spending heavily on modernising its military equipment, but says this is because the armed forces suffered cuts in the 1980s.
Strong ties between South Korea and Japan have seemed, until recently, even less likely than imminent aggression from Russia or China. Korean schools drill their pupils with the grim facts of Japan's colonial occupation. Japanese prejudice towards Koreans living in Japan has reinforced Korean hatred. It does not help that Mr Murayama, who became prime minister last month, comes from the Social Democratic Party. The Social Democrats traditionally sympathise with Communist North Korea, and regard the capitalist South as an American puppet.
Over the next decade, however, big changes seem likely. Japanese and South Korean diplomats shrink from discussing China as a threat, perhaps because idle talk could provoke the Chinese. Yet Japan is worried enough to have asked the Chinese to disclose more about their military buildup; and the death of Deng Xiaoping, China's grey and fading eminence, will make Chinese behaviour unpredictable. Russia, for its part, might one day be tempted to relieve the frustration of chaos at home by thumping one of its neighbours.
Stuck next to their vast and potentially frightening neighbours, Japan and South Korea have good reason to improve relations. Mr Murayama's evident flexibility should help. On July 20th. he abandoned his party's old insistence that the existence of the Japanese military was unconstitutional; and during his visit to Seoul, he is expected to disavow his party's rhetoric of support for North Korea.
His hosts may not be impressed; the Social Democrats have blocked attempts to pass laws that would allow Japan to enforce sanctions on North Korea. But a new plan to soothe the wounds left by Japan's wartime brutality may please them more.
For two years East Asian women who were forced into prostitution by the Japanese army have been demanding compensation. Japan has retorted that it paid reparations long ago, so no further compensation is possible. But on July 18th the government announced that it might spend around Y100 billion ($1 billion) on gestures of remorse for the suffering of ""comfort women"". The money would go on development programmes, youth exchanges and an archive of documents on the Japanese army's cruelty.
The government may accept this gesture. It comes on top of the newly apologetic terms in which Japanese prime ministers talk about the war. The first such apology, issued last year, has already produced results: the South Korean government has lifted import bans on some Japanese goods, including cultural ones like pop songs. More children are learning Japanese at school. Bit by bit, old hatreds are waning.
This has reversed one traditional piece of local wisdom. It used to be said that Japan feared the unification of the two Koreas; these days Japan's diplomats welcome the prospect. But they want a particular kind of united Korea--a non-nuclear one. If the North does indeed have nuclear bombs, Japan will want them dismantled when the South takes over. And, although the collapse of the Communist North would remove the main reason for the South to offer hospitality to American troops, Japan wants them to stay there. Japan will be watching any moves towards unification closely, and Japanese prime ministers will no doubt become a common sight in Seoul.","Asia 's geopoliticians have their eyes fixed on Bangkok , where the region 's foreign ministers are launching a security forum .

The first such apology , issued last year , has already produced results : the South Korean government has lifted import bans on some Japanese goods , including cultural ones like pop songs . More children are learning Japanese at school . Bit by bit , old hatreds are waning . 
 This has reversed one traditional piece of local wisdom . It used to be said that Japan feared the unification of the two Koreas ; these days Japan 's diplomats welcome the prospect . But they want a particular kind of united Korea -- a non - nuclear one . If the North does indeed have nuclear bombs , Japan will want them dismantled when the South takes over . And , although the collapse of the Communist North would remove the main reason for the South to offer hospitality to American troops , Japan wants them to stay there . Japan will be watching any moves towards unification closely , and Japanese prime ministers will no doubt become a common sight in Seoul .",740,Japan,A29-8194,IN TERM,True,"Tomiichi Murayama , Japan 's prime minister ,",9,True

Japanese socialism was less about economics than about foreign policy. The Social Democratic Party (the name the party takes in English) reckoned alliance with America made Japan a tool of imperialism. It regarded Japan's army as unconstitutional, adding that, as the victim of the atom bomb, Japan had a special responsibility to espouse peace. It denounced Japan's flag and anthem as symbols of the nationalism that led Japan so disastrously into the second world war.
These views were so tenaciously held that there was little point debating them. Everybody but the socialists knew that Japan's security depended upon the Americans; that Japan maintained a large army; and that the flag and anthem were widely used even by non-war-criminals. Meanwhile extremism inhibited moderate criticism of Japan's defence and foreign policies. The socialists thought they could not advocate lower defence spending, for example, because they opposed the existence of the army. They could not propose left-leaning ways for Japan to advance its national interests, because all forms of nationalism were taboo.
Hence one reason for Japan's shallow pluralism: the country's biggest opposition party failed to provide a credible alternative to the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). That helped the LDP hold on to power for 38 years. Lacking two competing sets of policies, Japanese politics also lacked debate; instead it descended into bribes and cronyism. The absence of debate delayed the open acknowledgment of Japan's war-time past. As a result, Japan feels awkward in its dealings with its Asian neighbours, and muddled over whether to take part in international peacekeeping.
At last the ideological argument that has long suffocated political debate is over. In a special session of parliament that ended on July 22nd, Tomiichi Murayama, the prime minister and leader of the Social Democrats, declared that the army, flag and national anthem are all constitutional. Mr Murayama now supports the American alliance. He says pacifism is no longer appropriate. He accepts that Japan should acquire AWACS early-warning aircraft. In short, the socialists accept the foreign policy of the Liberal Democrats. That seems only appropriate, since LDP men hold most of the jobs in Mr Murayama's cabinet.
The demise of the old extremism has made way for moderate debate. This is timely, for in August a government panel is due to propose changes in Japan's defence policy. The panel is likely to say that Japan needs fewer land troops, more sophisticated anti-missile defences and more rapid-deployment equipment; now that the Soviet threat has waned, Japan needs to be ready for a wider variety of potential enemies. In the old Japan, defence policy might have been revised quietly, without public debate. But on July 27th, perhaps sensing the new times, the Japan Association of Corporate Executives called for a referendum on the role of the defence forces.
As well as encouraging debate, the end of socialism may help Japan's political renewal by finishing off the Social Democratic Party. Although Mr Murayama's about-face is supported by the party's top brass, it will demoralise provincial activists. In last year's lower-house election the party lost half its seats; next year's vote for the upper house may prove even more disastrous.
When the socialists no longer count, Japanese politics will be dominated by two moderate groups. One is the LDP, whose cautious foreign policy and vigorous industrial policy resemble those of America's Democrats. The other is built around the parties of the previous coalition government, and is fronted by a former LDP prime minister, Toshiki Kaifu. In its willingness to send troops abroad and its talk of deregulation, this group looks something like America's Republicans. Mr Kaifu met his chief allies for lunch on July 26th. Together they aim to form a single party by September.","Japan 's baffling politics has produced its oddest paradox yet : at the same time as the country has acquired its first socialist prime minister in 46 years , socialism has been finished off .

On August 12th, Shin Sakurai, the current environment minister, denied that his country had waged an aggressive war in the 1930s and 1940s. It is arguable that Japan was pushed into war by the British and Americans in 1941; but only after (and because) its armies had long since attacked China, killing hundreds of thousands of civilians, and they later went on to invade most of East Asia besides. So this is a curious view. Yet Mr Sakurai is not alone, not even as a cabinet minister expressing it publicly: in May, another minister, Shigeto Naano, did much the same.
The Chinese and South Korean governments at once protested against Mr Sakurai's remarks. On August 14th he resigned, as Mr Naano had been forced to before him. Japan's internationalisers then resumed their advance as though nothing untoward had happened. On August 15th, the anniversary of Japan's surrender in 1945, the customary prime minister's speech went further than any before in apologising for Japan's past brutality: other Asians, said Tomiichi Murayama, had suffered ""tragic sacrifices beyond description"".
The wording was strong partly because Mr Murayama comes from the left of the Social Democratic Party. Nearly all his predecessors have been conservatives. On the same day, seven members of his coalition cabinet made a point of mourning Japan's own war dead by visiting the Yasukuni shrine, which houses--among many surely innocent of any crime--the ashes of men who were as surely war criminals.
Mr Murayama's speech also reflected Japan's determination to strengthen ties with the boom countries of Asia. He will visit four Asian states from August 23rd to celebrate growing Japanese trade and investment in the region. Vietnam is one country the Japanese are particularly interested in. They also want Asian support for their campaign for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council.
The same prize encouraged the announcement, on August 17th, that Japan would send troops to aid UN peacekeeping on the borders of Rwanda. This is only the third occasion on which it has sent soldiers abroad since 1945; small contingents helped the UN keep the peace in Cambodia and Mozambique. Between 200 and 300 soldiers are expected to go to Rwanda. So far Japan has forbidden its troops to use weapons abroad. This month, however, a weighty defence review was completed; it calls for Japanese troops to assist UN peacekeeping ""as actively as possible.""
The review urged that Japan prepare for a variety of threats, rather than focusing exclusively on Russia. It hinted, for example, that Japan should invest in rapid-deployment equipment, to help it play a big role in the loose security forum that is taking shape in East Asia.
The suggestion is plainly sensible. Too bad that the Russian navy chose August 15th to fire on two Japanese fishing boats, injuring one man. The previous day the Russians had fired at another boat. The boats were attacked off Japan's northern coast, near the four Kurile islands that the Russians grabbed from it in 1945 in the last days of the war. One boat was detained by the Russians, who said four fishermen would be put on trial accused of violating the Russian frontier.
In the past 20 months, according to the Japanese foreign ministry, the Russians have detained 17 Japanese boats. The Russians say the fishermen are poaching; Japan says the islands are really Japanese, and is furious about the shooting. If the Kurile dispute hots up, the legacy of the second world war could prove to include worse thing than tactless remarks by cabinet ministers.","Try as they may , Japan 's historical fantasists can not block their country 's steady internationalisation .

Mr Lee asked if he could break the long journey by spending the night in Honolulu. America refused. The State Department decided that to allow Mr Lee to set foot on American soil would upset China. So Mr Lee had to remain in his aircraft.
Many Americans were appalled. Here was the head of one of the great trading nations of the world, a long-time friend of America, denied a simple courtesy, and indeed humiliated, because of a decision to kow-tow to the Chinese. The incident, was roundly condemned in the American Congress. This month the Senate voted 94-nil to grant visas to Taiwanese government officials who wished to visit America. Mr Lee himself has been invited by 37 congressmen to come to America. Although these are simply gestures and do not change the rules banning Taiwanese officials, they seem to have had an influence on the government.
A State Department official says that ""a comprehensive review"" of its policy towards Taiwan is underway. This will be the first such review since America stopped recognising the Taiwanese government as the theoretical ruler of all China 15 years ago, and established diplomatic relations with Beijing instead. The Taiwanese eagerly await America's new thinking, expected to be announced shortly.
They should not get too excited. It is will probably amount to several small, though symbolically important, changes. Taiwan's de facto embassy in America, the nebulously named Coordination Council for North American Affairs, will be allowed to call itself something more closely reflecting its true purpose, such as the Taiwan (or possibly Taipei) Representative Office. Senior Taiwanese officials, including the president, will probably be allowed to visit America and to have meetings with American officials in government offices. At present, Taiwanese officials visit America as ""civilians"" and negotiate with American officials in restaurants and other unofficial locations. Senior American officials may even be allowed to visit Taiwan. The only time this is known to have happened officially since the American switch to Beijing was when Carla Hills, then the American trade representative, visited Taipei in 1992.
But such changes will not budge the foundation of American policy that there is one China and that China is represented by Beijing. By implication, the United States accepts China's claim that Taiwan is a rebellious province that one day will be reunited with the mainland. For the moment, Taiwan will be happy with whatever improvements in its status it can get. But not for long. What Taiwan wants is not just a token facesaving visit by President Lee to America, but a full and unobstructed role on the world stage. The United States could give it that: and an American lead would be followed by many other countries.
Taiwan feels it is now ready for, and deserves, such a role. It was America's sixth-largest trading partner in 1993, buying $16 billion-worth of American products, twice as much as China bought. It was the world's 12th biggest trading nation last year. Taiwan's GNP per person is expected to hit $11,300 this year. Apart from Taiwan's economic clout, many Americans are impressed by its dramatic political transformation in recent years from dictatorship into multi-party democracy. While other Asian countries tend to sneer self-righteously at Taiwan's boisterous political style, Americans, accustomed to that sort of behaviour at home, take it in their stride.
Taiwan's official view of itself is evolving subtly. Its territorial links with China are getting less emphasis. Its government once insisted on being known as the Republic of China. In recent years it has taken to calling itself the "" Republic of China on Taiwan"". A collection of writing published by the government's information office in July was entitled, ""Quiet Revolutions on Taiwan, Republic of China"". Such permutations of nomenclature, arcane as they may appear to the outsider, are not accidental.
America is in a delicate position. It must balance its desire to develop smooth and constructive relations with the powerful and sometimes vengeful men in Beijing against Taiwan's justifiable aspirations for respect and a seat at the international table. While it considers these issues, America may see the pending policy review as a carrot to keep daggling in front of Taiwan. The review may also serve'as a small stick to flourish at China. Both Taiwan and China are anxious to get into GATT, the General Areement on Tariffs and Trade, and its successor, the coming World Trade Organisation. The Americans may want to wring concessions of various sorts out of both countries.
Taiwan's seemingly hopeless bid to rejoin the United Nations will be taken up by its friends when the General Assembly reconvenes this autumn. They have a moral case. The UN is a flexible organisation. In the days of the Soviet Union, it lived with the the technical absurdity that Ukraine and Belarus, integral parts of the Soviet Union at the time, also had seats. China, a permanent member of the Security Council, would surely block any move to grant Taiwan UN membership; it has that power. But eventually, Taiwan feels, justice must prevail and its 21m citizens will participate fully in the international arena.
China is eager to prevent anything of the sort. President Lee wants to attend the annual forum of the new Asia-Pacific Economic Conference in Jakarta in November. But China's objections may prevail, despite large Taiwanese investment in Indonesia. Japan's prime minister, Tomiichi Murayama, wanted Mr Lee to be invited to the Asian Games, to be held in Hiroshima in October, but Japan's foreign ministry vetoed the idea.
There may be a way ahead that would be acceptable to the rest of the world if not to the Chinese. Suppose Taiwan's government explicitly renounced its thin pretence to be the true government of China, and declared itself no part of China at all?
The reason more Taiwanese do not openly support independence is because they are afraid that China will carry out its threat to use force against Taiwan. Yet the ruling Kuomintang's slow, unadmitted, retreat from its claim could in time become an open advance toward independence. Until a few years ago, KMT propaganda smothered study and debate of Taiwanese history. Now revisionist historians and legal scholars argue that Beijing's claim to sovereignty over Taiwan is in fact tenuous: China actually occupied Taiwan for just eight years (1887-95).

With a little 3 luck (and much to the relief of journalists who have to remember all their names), Japan's numerous opposition parties are about to follow Thoreau's maxim and merge themselves into something they hope will look as though it could run the country. On September 5th their leaders are due to have a pow-wow to discuss how deep this merger should be: merely a voting alliance in the Diet, or an arrangement that reaches down to the grass roots. And what, if anything, they should believe in.
The merger of the eight parties (only the Communists are not invited), if it comes about, will be the brainchild of Ichiro Ozawa, the eminence rise of the reform movement in Japan. That there are so many opposition groups is largely Mr Ozawa's fault. He has worked assiduously to split open Japan's traditional political parties and winkle out those politicians he believes sympathetic to his causes-economic reform at home and a ""normal"" foreign policy. Now he must show himself a builder as well as a destroyer.
On the face of it, this should be easy. The argument for merger looks unanswerable. Without it, coherent opposition to the government, dominated by the Liberal Democratic Party, is impossible. With it, the opposition might even be able to turn enough coats in the governing coalition to take power without an election. And, if that election comes, unity will be needed to stop the opposition parties destroying each other in the reformed, first-past-the-post, electoral system.
The main obstacle to union may be Mr Ozawa himself. All the opposition parties distrust each other to a certain extent, and there is much jockeying for position in the constituencies over which candidates will stand down in favour of whom. But everybody distrusts Mr Ozawa, even though they support, with varying degrees of conviction, his ideas. Even his own group, the Japan Renewal Party, has reason to be wary. His previous attempt to arrange a reformers' union cost its leader, Tsutomu Hata, his job as prime minister. The attempted merger so incensed the Social Democratic Party that it left in a huff and formed a coalition with the Liberal Democrats.
So Mr Ozawa may find that he has to stoop to conquer. He may leave the incipient party's starring roles to a triumvirate of ex-prime ministers: Mr Hata, his predecessor, Morihiro Hosokawa, and Toshiki Kaifu, who recently fled the Liberal Democrats to form the poetically named High Ideal Party. Mr Ozawa may also have to back-pedal on some of his more radical ideas, such as a permanent seat for Japan on the United Nations Security Council.
Even a united opposition would be around so seats short of a majority in the Diet. But a row within the Liberal Democrats or the Social Democrats (either or both of which is entirely possible) could provoke enough backbenchers to change sides.
At the moment, the Social Democrats look the more vulnerable. On September 3rd, the party--whose leader, Tomiichi Murayama, is currently prime minister--will hold its national convention. This ought to be an occasion for triumph. In fact, it will be more like a decorators' convention, papering over cracks. Though there will almost certainly be a public show of unity, the party is split. Its reformers are unhappy about supporting the Liberal Democrats and its left-wing traditionalists do not want to make policy compromises with the Liberal Democrats. As many as 30 of its 74 representatives in the Diet's lower house look as though they would be prepared to jump ship into a new reformist party if the terms were right. Not quite enough to break the government, perhaps, but enough to make it think.","Simplify , simplify .

 On the face of it , this should be easy . The argument for merger looks unanswerable . Without it , coherent opposition to the government , dominated by Tomiichi Murayama , is impossible . With it , the opposition might even be able to turn enough coats in the governing coalition to take power without an election . And , if that election comes , unity will be needed to stop the opposition parties destroying each other in the reformed , first - past - the - post , electoral system . 
 The main obstacle to union may be Mr Ozawa himself . All the opposition parties distrust each other to a certain extent , and there is much jockeying for position in the constituencies over which candidates will stand down in favour of whom . But everybody distrusts Mr Ozawa , even though they support , with varying degrees of conviction , his ideas . Even his own group , the Japan Renewal Party , has reason to be wary . His previous attempt to arrange a reformers ' union cost its leader , Tsutomu Hata , his job as prime minister . The attempted merger so incensed the Social Democratic Party that it left in a huff and formed a coalition with Tomiichi Murayama . 
 So Mr Ozawa may find that he has to stoop to conquer . He may leave the incipient party 's starring roles to a triumvirate of ex - prime ministers : Mr Hata , his predecessor , Morihiro Hosokawa , and Toshiki Kaifu , who recently fled Tomiichi Murayama to form the poetically named High Ideal Party . Mr Ozawa may also have to back - pedal on some of his more radical ideas , such as a permanent seat for Japan on the United Nations Security Council . 
 Even a united opposition would be around so seats short of a majority in the Diet . But a row within Tomiichi Murayama or Tomiichi Murayama ( either or both of which is entirely possible ) could provoke enough backbenchers to change sides . 
 At the moment , Tomiichi Murayama look the more vulnerable . On September 3rd , Tomiichi Murayama will hold Tomiichi Murayama's national convention . This ought to be an occasion for triumph . In fact , it will be more like a decorators ' convention , papering over cracks . Though there will almost certainly be a public show of unity , Tomiichi Murayama is split . Tomiichi Murayama's reformers are unhappy about supporting Tomiichi Murayama and Tomiichi Murayama's left - wing traditionalists do not want to make policy compromises with Tomiichi Murayama . As many as 30 of Tomiichi Murayama's 74 representatives in the Diet 's lower house look as though they would be prepared to jump ship into a new reformist party if the terms were right .

On September 13th Japan's cabinet authorised the foreign minister, Yohei Kono, to use a speech at the United Nations on September 27th to express Japan's desire for a permanent seat on the UN's Security Council. Like Germany, Japan sees the UN's 50th birthday in 1995 as a fine occasion for reforming it.
Japan's open admission of its UN aspirations follows years of more discreet campaigning. The main tactic has been to prompt other countries to say how nice it would be if Japan had the seat it wants. Recently almost no foreign statesman has visited Tokyo without joining the chorus.
This month, for example, Australia's prime minister, Paul Keating, came to Tokyo in order (he thought) to discuss trade. Japan's government and press showed little interest in his commercial ideas. But the newspapers were full of stories about Mr Keating's declaration that ""Japan's absence from the Security Council is an anachronism."" Some suspect that the words were put into his mouth. Three days earlier Argentina's foreign minister used the same formulation in the course of a meeting with Mr Kono.
All in all, 40 countries have publicly backed Japan's candidacy. Last month the leaders of the Philippines and Malaysia added their voices, so strengthening Japan's claim to speak for resurgent Asia. The final boost to Japanese confidence came with the visit to Tokyo of the UN's secretary-general, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, starting on September 11th. He declared that Japan deserved a permanent seat on the Security Council, along with a veto over its decisions. With this kind of support, Japan feels it can be frank about its ambitions.
Whose ambitions exactly? This is in fact a victory for Japan's foreign ministry over the current government. Japan's coalition of liberals and socialists took power in June, claiming to be ""doveish"". This meant that it favoured a strict interpretation of Japan's pacifist constitution, and so would shrink from sending troops abroad to take part in UN peacekeeping missions. At the same time, the government said it was in no hurry to join the permanent members of the Security Council, since this might entail a role as world policeman. The prime minister, Tomiichi Murayama, repeated this view in Singapore as recently as August 28th.
The diplomats have finessed these objections. Mr Boutros-Ghali helpfully emphasised that permanent membership of the Security Council does not necessarily entail sending troops abroad. (Indeed, the UN's poorer members provide most of the men for peacekeeping.) This offered Mr Murayama a way to marry national ambition with pacifist principle. One of his cabinet colleagues, Ryutaro Hashimoto, argues that Japan should use a permanent seat as a platform to argue for world disarmament.
The diplomats are confident that pacifist talk will not reverse the steady build-up of Japan's international role. An election next year may conceivably shift power to the hawkish opposition, which fared well in a recent by-election (see next story). Besides, the current government seems prepared to compromise its stance on peacekeeping. On the day that it came clean about its UN ambitions, the cabinet resolved to send 470 lightly armed troops to Zaire and Kenya, where they will set up medical and water facilities for Rwandan refugees.","An informal campaign has at last turned formal .

An obscure by-election for a safe seat in a relatively unimportant assembly would not have impinged much even on the voters concerned. But the voting that elevated Yuzuru Tsuzuki to the House of Councillors (the upper house of the Diet) as a member for Aichi prefecture was more than that. The vote, on September 11th, was widely seen as the first test of the two-party political system that is struggling to be born in Japan. It gave the government a chance to gauge its support, and the opposition an opportunity to get its act together and do some coherent opposing.
Mr Tsuzuki was nominally an independent, but will probably support the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP). The DSP is one of the eight (or nine or 11, depending how you define them) opposition parties, alliances and groupuscules currently trying to form themselves into a single organisation. The contest in Aichi had, over the past few weeks, become a touchstone of this process. A good result would help cement the union and might even encourage defections from the government. A poor showing would presage further opposition bickering.
The government tried hard to keep the bickering going. It had in its favour the farcical reason for the by-election in the first place. The previous incumbent had been deposed by the Supreme Court for pretending he had attended Tokyo's prestigious Meiji University. It also ran a strong campaign. Its candidate, Jiro Mizuno (like Mr Tsuzuki, badged as an independent), was scarcely allowed to open his mouth. Instead, a series of bigwigs from Tokyo were sent down to talk on his behalf, though Makiko Tanaka, the widely-respected head of the Science and Technology Agency, can scarcely have improved Mr Mizuno's chances when she referred to him as Mr Shimizu by mistake.
In fact, he didn't really stand much chance. Aichi prefecture is Japan's industrial heartland. Nagoya, its chief city, hosts the headquarters of Toyota Motors and the large blue-collar vote has been loyal to the DSP since that party split from the Social Democrats that are now led by the prime minister, Tomiichi Murayama. What really counted was the margin of victory.
In the end, it wasn't even close. Mr Tsuzuki outpolled Mr Mizuno by almost two to one. The coalition retired to lick its wounds.

On November 21st three reform bills made it through parliament's upper house and on to the statute books. The old multi-member constituencies, which encouraged pork-barrelling and discouraged debate about policy, will now give way to a mixture of British-style single-member voting districts and German-style proportional representation. But reform has triggered so much political chaos that many Japanese have no idea how to cast their newly valuable ballots.
Back in July 1993, the fight over electoral reform caused two groups to secede from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. That broke the LDP's 38-year grip on power, and made politics complicated. In place of a reliably conservative ruling party and a predictably leftist opposition, Japanese voters were asked to choose between a growing array of new parties and splinter groups.
Over the past year, Japan has had no fewer than three prime ministers. The current coalition unites the LDP with its old leftist foe, a combination that bemuses the public. To make this coalition work, the Social Democratic Party has had to renounce just about all the socialist policies it stood for. The voters dislike this opportunism: a recent opinion poll found that only 43% of those asked approved of the cabinet, a poor showing compared with the approval ratings of 70% enjoyed by the first post-LDP government. But the poll's most revealing finding was this: 44% of voters do not support any party.
The opposition parties, at least, are doing their bit to soothe the public's cynicism. On December 10th nine of them will unite to form the New Progressive Party, led in fact if not in name by Ichiro Ozawa. Mr Ozawa wants Japan to play a larger military role in United Nations peacekeeping, and he wants bureaucrats to have less control over Japan's economy. Japanese tend either to hate or to admire the man. By bringing together about a third of parliament's lower house under his lead, Mr Ozawa may help to sharpen voters' choices.
This show of unity reflects the pressure of the new electoral rules. The opposition knows it must choose a joint candidate for each of the single-seat electoral districts, since multiple candidates would divide the non-LDP vote disastrously. Meanwhile, the new electoral logic is having the opposite effect on the government camp. Despite the splits of the past year, the LDP remains big enough to field a candidate in each electoral district. As a result, the LDP's junior coalition partners are starting to think less about keeping the LDP in power and more about preparing their own election strategy.
The most open rebel is Wataru Kubo, deputy leader of the Social Democratic Party, who is reckoned to speak for about 40 of the party's 68 lower-house members. For the past month Mr Kubo has been urging the Social Democrats to disband, and to reassemble as the core of Japan's ""democratic and liberal"" forces. Mr Kubo seems to have in mind an alliance with other leftish groups that dislike the LDP for its traditional business links, and dislike Mr Ozawa for his hawkish foreign policy.
Mr Kubo's manoeuvres are less deft than Mr Ozawa's marshalling of opposition forces. The Social Democrats' leader, Tomiichi Murayama, is also the prime minister, so is obliged to oppose any scheme that might break up the coalition. The small New Harbinger Party, which might feel at home with Mr Kubo's ideas, is part of the coalition too, and so cannot support him openly. Mr Kubo had hoped that his trade-union backers would prevail upon smaller leftist groups to join his cause. But the trade unions are themselves divided.
Mr Kubo is not deterred. On November 22nd he unveiled a vague policy platform for his proposed group, thus making it hard to drop the scheme without looking stupid. Though the odds are against it, this rebellion could provoke an election early next year. If Mr Kubo launches his new party in defiance of Mr Murayama, the prime minister's coalition will be left with barely enough seats for an overall majority; a handful of other secessions could topple it.
This would not suit the LDP, which is using its governmental power to rebuild the ties with businessmen and farmers that withered during its time in opposition. In 1993 the party's legal fund-raising efforts yielded a third less than the year before; by handing out subsidies and contracts to its friends, the LDP hopes to recover from this blow before the next election. Yet an early vote would not suit the opposition either. Recently Mr Ozawa has been saying that his new party needs time to develop its election manifesto.
Between them, the LDP and the opposition will probably find a way to put off a lower-house vote. But they have no power to delay local elections due in April, nor the upper-house election due in July. Both these are likely to involve humiliation for the Social Democrats, who have lost much of their traditional support by forsaking their old policies. Together, these embarrassments could provoke Mr Murayama's resignation, and hence a general election next autumn. In the meantime secession and uncertainty will compound most ordinary voters' disillusionment with politics.","FIVE years after a corruption scandal made political reform a live issue in Japan , the country has a new electoral system .

Having got over the old worries about Japanese militarism, western businessmen fretted in the 1980s about the economic threat from Japan's super-competitive exporters and its super-rich overseas investors. In the early 1990s those threats seemed mercifully to fade, only to be replaced by thoughts that a Japanese financial collapse could damage the rest of the world. That disaster, too, failed to come to pass. Yet paranoia is nothing if it is not creative. Today's fashionable economic threat comes from cheap-wage manufacturers in third-world countries, chiefly in Asia. And, as Japan emerges from recession, the worry now is that it is making common cause with Asia's low-cost producers.
Even the paranoid have enemies-and, sure enough, there is something in this new concern. A new intellectual self-confidence is emerging in Japan, among an array of academics, writers, government officials and politicians. Though their thinking is far from universal, it is certainly influential and it is not far-fetched to describe it as a new form of Japanese nationalism (see pages 19-21). What is new about it is that its adherents have had western experience and western educations, and argue in a rationalist, western sort of way, but nevertheless believe that there is something special about Japan's society and its economy. These nationalists also think that some of this specialness can be exported, and are offering advice to Japan's Asian neighbors which is different from the advice given by America.
Japan already has a big economic presence across its adjoining seas. The strong yen has driven Japanese firms to build factories in cheaper East Asia, where they contribute to the region's booming exports to America and Europe. Intra-Asian trade is also growing. A decade ago Japan exported a third more to America than to Asia. Now Asians buy a third more from Japan than Americans do, and more than twice as much as the European Union does. As its economic interests have tilted Asia's way, so Japan's diplomacy has also shifted in a manner that increases the risk of a clash with western interests.
At November's summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC), Japan refused to put its weight behind the American-led push for freer trade, saying that young industries in less-developed Asian countries have a reasonable claim to protection. Japan often sides with Asia against the western idea of universal human rights as well, arguing that developing economies cannot be expected to meet the rich world's standards. Some powerful Japanese go further. The Keidanren, an association for big businesses, is hinting that Japan should back the East Asian Economic Caucus, an Asians-only version of APEC invented primarily to exclude America.
On January 10th Japan's prime minister, Tomiichi Murayama, arrived in Washington for talks with Bill Clinton amid the usual cynicism-inspiring fanfare of ""trade breakthroughs"" between Japan and the United States, prompting the customary tussle between those who say Japan is unchangingly closed and those who claim it is becoming steadily more open. Compared with that tired fray, the new worry is more profound. Is the combination of nationalist confidence and a growing economic interest in Asia likely to pose a threat?
There are two layers to this. The first is intellectual: do the nationalists' ideas pose a genuine, threatening alternative to western liberalism? In economics, they do not. The cocktail of policies which these people deem ""different"" contains nothing that is truly new. Such ""difference"" gains its force only from a false comparison with an extreme straw man, namely a pure, neo-classical economic model favouring almost no government intervention and virtually free markets. Yet the regulatory state, active industrial policy and constricted financial systems that are advocated by Japan's new nationalists would be perfectly familiar to policy-makers in France and Italy, and to almost anyone who was in a western government in the 1960s. There is nothing new here, and no reason why differing views from the wide spectrum that is economics cannot vie with one another, in Asia or elsewhere. That is so even of trade protectionism, which is hardly a Japanese invention.
Argumentative but not adversarial
In politics, the competition of ideas could be fiercer, most notably over human rights. This brings in the second, diplomatic, layer to the answer, which is trickier than the first. Japan's increasing interests in Asia, combined with the new self-confidence, are indeed likely to lead it to tolerate, and even support, some policies that America and Europe do not like. Human rights and press freedoms may provide the most frequent battlegrounds, but there will doubtless be others, including the question of how to deal with China's dictatorship.
For sure, westerners must not blunt their own views about these subjects, and should engage Japan and others in argument whenever necessary. But that does not make Japan an adversary. For years, the justified western complaint was that Japan would not speak up for itself. If it now does so, that should be welcomed, and Japan's clear interests in maintaining its friendships with America and Europe can be used as a counter-balance. In Asia, Japan's growing influence could well be a weapon westerners will one day be thankful for, when a hothead needs to be cooled or an agressor restrained. So long as Japan's new nationalism remains nicer than the old sort, it will be a trend to understand, not a threat to confront.","WHERE Japan walks, western fears are seldom far behind.

Yet Bill Clinton's summit with Tomiichi Murayama on January 11th yielded more than many such pow-wows. In the place of the old trade augments emerged a new agreement on opening Japan's market for financial services (see page 64). And in the year that marks the 50th anniversary of Japan's devastating defeat by America, both sides resolved that wartime memories should not be allowed to spoil their alliance.
For Japanese who like to laugh at politics, there was a pleasing irony in this. Mr Murayama heads the Social Democratic Party, which has spent most of the post-war period criticising the American alliance. Indeed, the Social Democrats traditionally argued that the memory of the war, and particularly of the atom bombs that ended it, made it Japan's duty to be pacifist and neutral; it followed that Japan should stop playing host to American troops on its soil. But Japan's recently tumultuous politics has buried the Social Democrats' old principles. The question is whether it is about to bury the Social Democrats as well.
The shedding of principle that made possible this week's summit has deprived the party of a unifying idea. Two days before Mr Murayama met Mr Clinton, a group of rebels from his party met to prepare their secession. On one count 15 of the 73 Social Democrats in the lower house of parliament, plus eight upper-house members, have already agreed to leave the party.
As a gesture of disgust with Mr Murayama, this is impressive, since the rebels have little to look forward to once they leave. Some talk bravely of winning over enough defectors from other parties to give the New Democratic League, as their group calls itself, a chance to hold the balance between Japan's two dominant parties: the Liberal Democrats, who dominate the ruling coalition, and the opposition New Frontier Party, which was formed last year. This is a faint hope. The League's leader, Sadao Yamahana, is a sure vote-loser; the new party would lack cash.
Indeed, the rebellion's mysterious logic sums up the confusion of Japanese politics. Newspapers report on obscure Social Democratic committees ardently demanding the formation of yet more obscure subcommittees. One New Leaguer, Banri Kaieda, admits that he himself is unsure whether or when his co-conspirators will really leave the Social Democratic Party. Having entered politics in the reformist atmosphere of two years ago, Mr Kaieda is beginning to wonder how long he should stay.
The remaking of Japan's politics, says one coalition member, is a two-act play that is currently in intermission. The old order, in which the Liberal Democrats held power without interruption, has vanished along with the electoral system that used to support it. The new order, in which fresh voting rules enacted last month should help to forge healthier pluralism, has not yet come into being.
Most Japanese politicians reckon it will be three to five years before this transition is completed.

Not the government. Only the Yamauchi-gumi, a vast mafia outfit with headquarters in Kobe, was straight away handing out free noodles and nappies.
The Japanese government has mismanaged the relief of the city. It took two days to deploy the first soldiers in Kobe, and even then the first contingent was tiny. It took three days for the prime minister, Tomiichi Murayama, to find time to visit Kobe. Asked why he was slow to respond on the first day, he replied that the earthquake happened early in the morning.
Offers of foreign help (from places as diverse as Madagascar and Romania) were taken up slowly; a week after the earth first shook on January 17th, 13 out of 42 had been accepted. A team of Swiss rescue dogs was held up while quarantine officials hesitated over waiving the normal regulations. An offer of help from a British team of trained rescuers was ignored for five days. Foreign doctors were at first told not to treat patients because they lacked Japanese medical qualifications. Japan is happily free of the swarms of lawyers who descend on American disasters. But Japan is not free of maddening legalism.
This week the government still had no system for labelling buildings that might be in danger of collapse. When the British rescue team eventually arrived in Kobe nobody knew which ruins still needed to be searched for bodies. Hundreds of people who survived the earthquake but died in its aftermath might have been saved by faster action. Some of those trapped in the rubble died in fires. Others were killed more slowly, by cold and starvation.
The earthquake caused 5,000 deaths, destroyed 52,000 buildings, and left 11m tons of rubble to clear. The damage is likely to cost over $50 billion. Some 300,000 people still camp in tents or public building, vulnerable to a flu epidemic, not knowing how many months it will be before they have homes again.
Japanese prime ministers usually resign over bribery scandals, not administrative mistakes: running the country is generally reckoned the responsibility of bureaucrats. These days, however, Japan has something like a two-party system; the opposition New Frontier Party has demanded Mr Murayama's resignation. It has suggested that his Social Democratic Party's pacifist dislike of soldiers may explain the delay in sending them in. In Kobe itself, local Social Democrats seem in the past to have refused to cooperate with the army because they thought its existence unconstitutional.
The earthquake will help to bury this anti-army feeling. It may also reinforce popular criticisms of Japan's bureaucracy: that it is slow to act in a crisis, and keener to protect its petty rules than to look after citizens' interests. With luck, much-discussed administrative reform may now start rolling. But progress will be slow.

Which of these mini-revolutions most animates the Fukuokans? None, replies a local journalist; the main issue at the next general election will be whether a new metro line gets built.
Japan's politics remain parochial because the national government holds sway over the provinces. As a result, voters look to national politicians to deliver local goodies--a metro line, an airport, subsidies for local firms. If national elections are to involve debate on bigger issues, such as how boldly the country should open its markets, or how deeply it should involve itself in international peacekeeping, local matters must be left to Japan's provincial governments. The next step, in other words, is decentralisation.
But that is only half of it. The voters of Fukuoka also ignore the big national issues because they reckon these are the preserve of Japan's bureaucracy. Politicians are not elected for their views on economic management, school reform or foreign policy, since it is assumed that bureaucrats will take care of such thing. And, once they are in office, politicians do not expect to be judged on these issues either.
Last month's earthquake illustrates these attitudes. Tomiichi Murayama, the prime minister, did not acknowledge responsibility for his appallingly slow reaction to the disaster by resigning: he, and most Japanese, apparently blame the bureaucrats for the mismanagement. Japan's politicians resign not over administrative mistakes but over personal scandals--witness the departure of Toshio Yamaguchi, an opposition leader who stepped down on February 14th after it had been suggested that he took improper loans from two small banks.
So the concentration of power in the hands of Tokyo bureaucrats frustrates the hope that people in Fukuoka and elsewhere may start to vote on national issues. The frustration has given rise to some cynicism: opinion polls suggest people are once again disaffected with politics, and companies that stopped making political donations two years ago have resumed their old habit of buying influence. Yet this backsliding by some Japanese is only part of what is going on. The reformers also make advances.
These days just about all politicians pay lip service to the idea of decentralisation. In December the government promised to take up the issue, and some kind of legislation supporting the idea is expected to be passed by the summer. However vague that law turns out to be, it will reflect public concern. The most popular prime minister of recent times, Morihiro Hosokawa, owed much of his appeal to his backround as a provincial governor, which set him apart from the rest.
Politicians are also starting to challenge bureaucratic power. The first to talk about this was Ichiro Ozawa, the opposition party's strongman. In 1993, when Mr Ozawa's team controlled the government, the third-ranking bureaucrat in the formidable Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) was sacked by his political boss. Not to be outdone, the new cabinet of Mr Murayama axed MITI's top bureaucrat and a colleague in December.
All this goes down well with the voters, who resent the mandarins' arrogance and lack of accountability. Powerful interest groups are equally pleased: big business resents bureaucratic meddling in its affairs, while Japan's trading partners blame bureaucrats for excluding their products. Even within the ministries, younger officials concede the case for shedding control.
The question is whether this decentralisin and anti-bureaucratic mood is enough to force real changes. It produces fine words, to be sure: Mr Murayama's government has recently talked of slashing central-government agencies, and it was for resisting such talk that one of the MITI men lost his job in December. Some members of the coalition government have floated big ideas, such as a merger between the Japan Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank, two big public-sector lenders.
For the moment, however, action is scarce. The Ministry of Finance has blocked the bank-merger idea. On February 11th the cabinet promised to get rid of only 11 minor agencies. Yet the radical ideas were shelved, not discredited: opponents dare say no more than that change will take time, not that it will never happen. On February 14th Mr Murayama urged his colleagues to agree on more cuts by the end of March. The reformers advance.
Indeed, a familiar Japanese process is at work, rather like the one that led eventually to last year's reform of the electoral system. Politicians promise change; vested interests resist; the politicians postpone or water down their ideas so much that most people despair of them. In the end, however, repeated promises reach a critical mass. Electoral reform was discussed for several years until politicians found it too embarrassing not to act upon their pledges.
Weakening Tokyo's bureaucrats is a harder task than electoral reform, so it may take longer. Yet Japan is changing. With the end of continuous Liberal Democratic rule, and the rise of something like a two-party system, there is competition in promising reform--which means that the promises are both more extravagant and harder to abandon. The moment Mr Murayama's administration said it would scrap 11 government aencies this month, the opposition called for more.","The grand changes in Japan 's national politics do not impress the citizens of Fukuoka , an industrial city in western Japan .

For the first time, America has overtaken Germany to become Iran's biggest trading partner, responsible for some $4 billion of Iran's overseas business.
Since Iran had to reschedule $8 billion in short-term external debt last year, its letters of credit have become deeply unpopular in Europe and the Far East. Iran is ""off-cover"" to most government export insurance agencies. Exports from Europe have slumped. Instead, Iranian entrepreneurs have been paying cash illicitly to buy consumer goods and raw materials, including much from the Americans. Unlike the Europeans, American firms deal with Iran only in cash. They have stolen a march.
Although the American government banned the import of Iranian goods in 1987, and subsequently banned the export to Iran of American high technology, American firms are not otherwise prohibited from trading with the Islamic republic. Direct trade has fallen from its peak of $750m in 1992. But indirect American exports are buoyant. Most of them go through American subsidiaries in Europe and Dubai, a short hop across the Gulf.
The Germans are cross; their total trade with Iran is reckoned to have dropped from about $6 billion in 1992 to $2 billion in 1994. The American government, say German diplomats in Tehran, is pushing Europe to break ties with Iran while American firms are sneaking in to snap up scarce contracts. The Germans reckon indirect American exports to Iran may have reached $700m in 1994; conservative estimates put the figure at $300m.
American companies on the ground in Iran are still rare but they are tolerated. After Coca-Cola made a splash in 1992 by opening a licensed bottling plant--followed by Pepsi last year--Islamic radicals campaigned to ban both. They failed. In January the country's spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said that ""anything that strengthens world arrogance [translation: the United States] and Zionist circles is forbidden."" But this fatwa caused such a stir that a month later he denied he had banned the two drink companies.
Some American oil companies have bypassed their government's dislike of bilateral trade. Last year Exxon, Texaco and Mobil together bought $3.5 billion-worth of Iranian crude--24% of Iranian crude exports--for resale to customers in Latin America and Asia. Exxon is likely to be Iran's biggest single customer in 1995.
This has upset right-wing Republicans in the American Congress. Senator Alfonse D'Amato, America's answer to Ayatollah Khamenei, proposed last month a total trade embargo on Iran modelled on the one imposed on Cuba. His bill has support but is unlikely to become law soon. An embargo could harm American companies more than Iran, which can find new oil buyers.
The Europeans still seem to favour sales by credit. Switzerland's export-credit agency has put Iran back ""on-cover"" and Germany may do so. Japan will probably make a second payment of a loan for a dam south of Tehran. Japan's prime minister, Tomiichi Murayama, may have reflected the views of European governments and contract-hungry entrepreneurs everywhere when he said, after talking to Mr Clinton last month, that in Iran it was ""necessary to support the moderates"".

UNTIL this week, Japan enforced a strict divide between formality and frivolity. By day the salariman is uncommonly stiff; by night he is prone to drunken silliness. Daily newspapers are scrupulously dull; weeklies brim with half-true scandals. Most politicians are grey; but those in parliament's upper house enjoy a special dispensation to be colourful. Then, on April 9th, two frivolous types leapt over the wall. They landed in the governors' chairs in Osaka and Tokyo.
Osaka's new governor is ""Nokku"" Yokoyama, a former comedian and once a member of parliament's upper chamber. (The name refers to old boxing skits in which he was knocked out; this was considered funny.) The other candidates for the serious job of running Japan's second city were suitably grey: a senior bureaucrat from the science ministry and a respected lawyer. But Mr Yokoyama won, despite the sacrifice involved for fans: on being elected, Nokku announced that he would have to desist, temporarily at least, from his work as a television personality.
Tokyo's new governor, meanwhile, is Yukio Aoshima, a writer of nostalgic novels and another ex-member of parliament's upper chamber. His closest rival was a former civil servant backed by Japan's governing coalition and bits of the opposition; Mr Aoshima was cold-shouldered by all the main parties. His rival ran a slick, expensive campaign; Mr Aoshima refused to trudge the streets at all, preferring to stay at home reading. But the ostracised bookworm still managed to top the poll. Like Osaka's Mr Yokoyama, he is a television star, noted especially for a sitcom role as ""Nasty Grandma"".
The results bode well for Japan's long and tortuous fight against political corruption. They show that, in big cities at least, television has grown more powerful than traditional palm-greasing. They also prove that the popular disgust with establishment politics, which in 1993 ended the 38-year rule of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), has not fizzled out. Both the victors made much of their independence, accusing party men of being aloof from ordinary people. Osaka's new governor promises that he will open his offices one day a week to members of the public.
In many prefectures the big parties clubbed together to support a single candidate for the governorship. Despite this blurring of party lines, the establishment LDP seems to have come off worse than its reformist opponents. The LDP endorsed a candidate in all 13 contests for governor; only eight of its men won. Its main rival, the New Frontier Party, endorsed just ten candidates; nine won. Although voters are cross with all established parties, they have not quite lost sight of the difference between groups that favour change and those that oppose it.
This distinction will emerge more tellingly in the upper-house election that is due in July. There are likely to be fewer independents in that election: the governing coalition (consisting of the Liberal Democrats, the Social Democratic Party and one other small group, will line up against the New Frontier opposition. Another anti-establishment vote would humiliate the Social Democrats, who have lost much of their traditional support by discarding old socialist principles. A rout might prompt the resignation of the party's leader, Tomiichi Murayama, who also happens to be Japan's prime minister. The election for parliament's frivolous house is going to be deadly serious.","TOKYO

SHE may not be the Flying Dutchman, but the owners of the Pacific Pintail might be forgiven for thinking their ship was under a similar curse. Harried at sea by the countries whose coastline she was passing, and forbidden to land when she arrived at her destination in Japan, the ship looked as though she might be doomed to wander the oceans for ever.
The Pacific Pintail was being punished for carrying 14 tonnes of radioactive waste from France (where it had been reprocessed, to separate the waste from potentially useful uranium and plutonium) to Japan (where it had been generated in the first place). Nobody in Japan complained when the stuff went in the other direction; and the fact of its Japanese origin does not seem to have tempered the anger of those protesting against its return.
On April 25th, when the ship arrived outside Mutsu Ogawara, a port in Aomori prefecture, Morio Kimura, the newly elected governor of Aomori, refused to let her dock. Mutsu Ogawara is the port for Rokkasho, the site of Japan's largest concentration of nuclear plants. It has a set of pens which have recently been built to store highly radioactive waste while it cools down to a manageable level. After that, the plan is to bury the waste, if a politically and geologically acceptable site can be found. Therein lies the rub.
Before the pens were opened for business, Aomori's previous governor tried to extract a promise from the Science and Technology Agency (STA), which regulates such matters, that such a site would be outside Aomori. Not, in other words, in his backyard. He did not exactly get an assurance of a waste-free future: he got a marvellous piece of bureaucratic double-speak which said that the STA would find it ""hard"" to make Aomori a permanent disposal site.
Mr Kimura is, apparently, made of sterner stuff than his predecessor. When the Pacific Pintail arrived, he refused to let her dock unless the government gave a firm promise to move the waste once it had cooled down. Makiko Tanaka, the head of the STA, was hauled in for a meeting with the prime minister, Tomiichi Murayama. In fairly short order, the STA gave in. Victory. Except that the process of cooling will take some 50 years. Of course, Mr Kimura, Miss Tanaka and Mr Murayama will all be out of office by then.

Certainly 48m; maybe as many as 60m, depending on when and where you begin the gruesome body-count and whose figures you believe (see table on next page for some estimates).(Table omitted) Suffice it to say that much of Europe was at war for nearly six years until Victory-in-Europe or VE-Day, on May 8th 1945, and much of Asia until a little later, VJ-Day (or the more mealy-mouthed VP-Day--""Victory in the Pacific"" rather than ""over Japan"") on August 15th.
For the next few months world leaders will endure a remorseless roster of hand-shaking's and knee-bendings, more mournful than merry, partly in commemoration but also to reassure their peoples that such carnage will never again be perpetrated on such a global scale. Yet, fifty years on, the circumstances of slaughter are still debated, swept under the carpet-or even denied. ""One might think that the historians could have arrived at a consensus for interpreting the main events of the war,"" writes Norman Davies, a British historian, in the latest issue of the New York Review of Books. In reality, he observes, no such consensus exists.
One reason for this may be that on this 50th anniversary only two countries--Britain and the United States--obviously have more to celebrate than to rue. And even they are not twine-free of guilt. Winston Churchill encapsulated better than anyone the will to defeat evil. His country, by and large, fought a clean, resourceful and courageous war. Truly, at one point, did Britain stand alone against Hitler. Yet the use of nighttime area-bombing over such towns as Dresden and Hamburg, which, along with air attacks by other allies, may have killed 500,000 German civilians, was as morally questionable as the bombing of Hiroshima. It is true that 56,000 British airmen died in the war, often trying to drop those bombs, as did 93,000 British civilians, many of them victims of German aerial bombing. At least the A-bombs almost certainly ended the slaughter in Asia. In strategic terms, the bombing of Dresden is harder to justify.
Britain also suffered from the false assumption that traditional imperial power would reassert itself in the years that followed. ""The British Commonwealth and Empire stands more united and more effectively powerful than at any time in its long romantic history,"" said Churchill in his victory broadcast on May 13th. How wrong he was--and how damaging, among the debt and exhaustion, the consequent complacency and economic muddle that went with the slide from war-time centralisation into peace-time nationalisation.
As for America, it was the only power to emerge both as victor and beneficiary of the war. Its economy, still depressed in the run-up, took off mightily on the back of war production. It was generous in victory, both in the dispensing of material largesse and in its lack of vindictiveness. Its moral authority was strong. Yet question-marks stand over aspects of America's performance too. At the start Americans were reluctant to take part at all. In 1939 Europe and the fate of Jews, Czechs or Chinese seemed other people's business. Pre-war isolationism proved nearly disastrous. In May 1941 a feeble Congress passed a bill to extend conscription by just one vote. That summer, Republicans voted overwhelmingly against Lend-Lease, the act that decisively helped Britain to arm itself against fascism.
Above all, the morality of dropping the atomic bombs still tweaks American consciences. Conventional bombing was just as deadly: more people were killed in the raids over Tokyo and other Japanese cities in the last few months of the war than by the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki (where, together, more than 200,000 perished). Could the nuclear genie have been kept inside its bottle? Probably not. Did the bomb save lives by ending the war? Probably it did. But a burden of ill-ease weighs heavily on the country that first used it.
More pain than pride
It is among most other participants, however, that jubilation, this anniversary season, seems most inappropriate. There, one senses the pain and shame of history disputed and manipulated; of countries that were both villains and victims; of people who helped to win glorious battles against fascism but were enslaved by the victors; and of countries vanquished by fascism that had shown themselves far from virtuous or valiant in defeat.
It is indisputable that the Red Army of the Soviet Union did more to destroy the evil of Naziism than any other single force. It lost millions of brave men--far more than all the other allies put together. Roughly three-quarters of Hitler's soldiers who died did so on the eastern front. The Soviet, and especially Russian, peoples showed immense heroism. As many as 8m Soviet soldiers may have died, including more than 3m in German prison camps. Soviet civilians endured unimaginable suffering from Stalin's actions as well as Hitler's. At least 600,000 died in the siege of Leningrad alone.
Yet for countless more millions in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, the end of the war was cause for more, not less, misery. Victory saw communist oppression, already savage inside Stalin's pre-war borders, extend, for the next 45 years, to smother half of the European continent. Within the new Soviet empire, the history of the war, including the Nazi-Soviet pact of 1939, the role of communists in Europe's resistance, the nature of the Holocaust and the number of Soviet victims, was distorted by lies and deceit. Little cause for VE-Day celebrations there.
Now, however, Russians are becoming more honest. They broadly admit, without the old excuse that Stalin was ""playing for time"" against Hitler, that the 1939-40 carve-up of Eastern Europe was utterly wrong. The Molotov-Ribbentrop document, whose existence they denied until a few years ago, is now on display in Moscow's Tretyakov Gallery. Soviet responsibility (once placed on Nazi shoulders) for the murder of 26,000 Polish officers at Katyn in 1940 is equally frankly admitted: Stalin's order for that is on show in the same gallery. Young Russians make little attempt to defend Russia's subjugation of Eastern Europe in 1939 and after the war. Yet old habits linger: in the run-up to VE-Day little has been heard of the other allies' contribution to the war, which ordinary Russians still think they won single-handedly.
And the wobblers
It is in the countries first defeated and occupied by the Nazis that a readiness to face the truth is often farthest away. Many were both victims and accomplices, Austria being perhaps the most telling example. In most only a tiny minority actively resisted; a minority (often larger) actively collaborated; and the vast mass of people kept their heads down and ingloriously averted their gaze--especially when cattle-trucks full of Jews were rolling by.
Some, however, resisted more than others. A special place belongs to Poland--a double victim, chopped up by both Nazi and communist butchers. Those who escaped often fought bravely alongside the allies. The resistance offered by the Polish Home Army was deeper-rooted than any other movement in German-occupied Europe. Proportionately more Poles lost their lives than any other people, except for Jews and perhaps Ukrainians. Yet Poles, too, have their sore spot: their own anti-Semitism. With striking exceptions, they proved loth to risk their skins to help Polish Jews. Brutally depicted by a Frenchman, Claude Lanzmann, in ""Shoah"", a film about the death-camps, this charge is deeply resented, and most Poles still refuse to face it.
Elsewhere the record is pretty mixed. Norway gave little succour to the Nazis; Denmark managed to smuggle most of its Jews to neutral Sweden in time. Holland did better than Belgium, where many Flemings were all too ready to collaborate. But more than 90% of Dutch Jewry, rounded up obediently by a mainly Dutch administration, perished in the death camps. Today the Dutch too are undergoing a belated bout of soul-searching.
Of all the countries occupied by Germany, the one that finds it hardest to look in the mirror 50 years on is France. Its performance by and large remains a cause for shame, myth and evasion. The Vichy regime was disgustingly malleable to the Nazis. Its energetic enactment of anti-Semitic laws helped to ensure that all but 2,600 of the 75,000 Jews deported from France died in the camps. The resistance, estimated to number 20,000 in January 1944, rising to 200,000 by the summer and maybe 300,000 by the liberation, amounted to barely 1% of the adult population. After the liberation, an orgy of violence against alleged collaborators, and a distinct lack of judicial order, further besmirched France's name.
Yet until the 1970s, France--thanks largely to that beacon of patriotism, General de Gaulle--sustained the comforting myth of a nation of resistants. Since then, a more unsettling truth has disrupted the calm, most recently when Francois Mitterrand's devious ambiguity was exposed in a biography. Opinion polls suggest a nation still muddled and ill at ease over France's role in the war. Last year, nearly two-thirds of respondents said that Marshal Petain, the Vichy leader, was right, despite the urgings of de Gaulle, to come to terms with Hitler. Only 29% thought the French should feel bad about the actions of Vichy.
Current thinking in the former communist countries is no less blurred. The communist caricature of a grateful proletariat resisting fascism under the leadership of the noble Russians has given way to new exaggerations and falsifications. Ukraine is spectacularly divided, by region and ethnic loyalty, in its interpretation of the war. New nationalists everywhere are trying hard to rehabilitate dodgy leaders, such as Hungary's Admiral Miklos Horthy, who accommodated themselves to Hitler. In Yugoslavia, where 1.2m civilians died in the second world war according to Tito's probably inflated figures, today's feuding nationalists massage an array of numbers to serve their own propaganda, and to justify a war that to many is but a continuation of 1941-45.
In the swathes of Asia once overrun by Japan, an equally muddy pattern emerges--and no greater desire, on the whole, to remember the past accurately. Resistance, for the most part, was limited. As in Europe, most people submitted to force majeure. The Chinese fought hard, and suffered appallingly, but the history they now present is chiefly a vehicle of ideology. The Koreans, annexed into the Japanese empire in 1910, are relentlessly resentful. The Philippines lost over a million people.
Some of the muddiness in these countries reflects an ambivalence felt in Asia at the outbreak of the Pacific war. Many Asians felt that, if Japan was no angel, it was at least helping to drive out white colonialism. The Indonesians suffered grievously, but they shed Dutch rule. Others proved weak at resisting Japanese blandishments. Though his country may have lost 150,000 people in the war, the Malaysian prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, now suggests that bygones should be bygones--and that Asians, including the Japanese, should stop truckling to Europeans. Even Australia is keen to bury the past; it now officially prefers the VP formula to VJ.
As exemplars of self-analysis, the official losers offer the biggest lessons of all. First, Italy. As in France, the mythology of a nation of resisters has held sway for much of the past half-century. A double invasion--by the allies in the south, and by Germans in the north, after the Italian surrender of 1943--was doubly humiliating. But, in the public consciousness, the truth that the Italian resistance had only a marginal role in defeating fascism remains blithely hidden. On Liberation Day, celebrated yearly on April 25th, the allies' part in the Freedom business is rarely mentioned. A second falsehood--that the Italian people bore little responsibility for fascism itself--has been even more successfully cultivated. No great apologies have been heard for Italian aggression in Africa or the Balkans. But now that Italy's political glue of anti-communism has worn off and the old consensus collapsed, ugly truths may start to be aired.
An invidious comparison
It is, in contrast, hard to fault Germany's efforts to wipe away the stain of Naziism. Its apologies to its victims, Jews, Poles and others, have been sustained, unequivocal and sincere. Its liberal, democratic credentials are now unimpeachable. Although arguments within the European Union can still recall, sotto voce, Germany's Nazi past (the need to ""anchor"" Germany within the Union is a leading rationale of European integrationists), few would now try to stop it from playing its part in the world, including sending troops abroad.
Naturally, as in any democracy, rows over history still erupt in Germany. The nationalist right is keener, in the words of the late Franz-Josef Strauss, to ""get out from under the shadow of Hitler"", and to end what it sees as the self-abasement of continuous apology and the denial of the good in German history outside the 12-year ""aberration"" of 1933-45. Since the late 1980s, some ""revisionist"" historians, led by Ernst Nolte, have argued that Naziism was an exaggerated reaction to the equally evil phenomenon of Bolshevik communism: it was Lenin, after all, who first tried to eliminate whole categories of people.
Helmut Kohl sometimes stumbles when nodding at--without fully endorsing--what the nationalist right also likes to stress: that Germans were victims too, that 12m-14m of them were cruelly expelled from the eastern territories after the war, that millions of ordinary German people scarcely responsible for the global inferno died in it, that the penance of a 44-year division of their homeland was severe enough. But German leaders have, since the war, been unambiguous in acknowledging that their country bears chief responsibility for starting it and for creating a system of racial extermination that has no parallel in modern history.
If only Japan could address its past with the same candour. From its attack on China's province of Manchuria in 1931 until the emperor's surrender 14 years later; millions died in war, prison camps, bombing or from starvation. Japanese atrocities were infamous. In 1937 the Japanese army slaughtered at least 100,000 Chinese, mostly civilians, when it captured Nanjing. Japan forced at least 100,000 women into sexual servitude as ""comfort women"". Medical units indulged in thousands of experiments, including vivisection, on Chinese civilians and allied prisoners of war.
The sacking of Manila, massacres in Singapore, the dreadful treatment of prisoners of war, about a third of whom died in captivity, the enforced Bataan march in the Philippines (which killed 33,000 out of 78,000 allied prisoners on it), are all an indictment of Japan's brutal militarism. The horror of these events, and Japan's responsibility for starting the Pacific war, have not been fully acknowledged. As recently as 1989, a Japanese prime minister said that responsibility for the war ""should be left to future historians to judge"".
One reason for this collective fudge was America's decision to keep Emperor Hirohito in place after the war. The Tokyo trials of war criminals looked to most Japanese like mere ""victors' justice"": the man in whose name the war was fought was exempted from scrutiny while a number of those who had acted for him were executed. Unlike Germany, Japan was unable to make a clean break with its past. Japan had no tradition of liberal pluralism to hark back to. After the war the Americans needed the old Japanese bureaucracy, even more than the allies used Germany's Nazi one, to run things. Fourteen years after the war ended, the man who organised Japan's war-time penal labour system was prime minister.
In further contrast to Germany, where German jurists wrote a new constitution, in Japan Americans wrote it. In 1951 America acquired near-sovereign rights to military bases in Japan, whose renunciation of the use of force has inculcated an attitude of dependency, in foreign affairs, on the Americans. Japan's post-war political consensus has militated against open debate. Questions of individual responsibility and guilt, of royalty and self-sacrifice, of conducting war against ""racially inferior"" enemies, are still not viewed from the standpoint that westerners use. And the dropping of the atomic bombs has given many Japanese a soothing sense of moral equivalence, enshrining pacifism as the answer to the second world war. All sides, it is argued, were victims. The notion of a just war is wrong; war itself is unjust. It does not matter who started it. ""We are all guilty"".
Since quasi-one-party rule ended two years ago with the loss of the Liberal Democratic Party's dominance, this consensus of reticence and false moral equivalence may have frayed: in subterranean and subtle ways, the Japanese--like almost everyone else--are groping towards greater honesty about their past. Though little is taught about atrocities and the mistreatment of prisoners, school textbooks have become more honest. In 1992 the (new) emperor expressed regret when he visited China (nothing quite like Willy Brandt kneeling in the Warsaw ghetto, though). Similar professions of sorrow have been made to the South Koreans. Several prime ministers have made fuller--if sometimes still tortuous--apologies, none so frank as the present one, Tomiichi Murayama. And Japanese politicians are grappling with a more comprehensive resolution apologising for the war. Most Social Democrats want one; many Liberal Democrats do not.
But, though mounting Japanese aid to such countries as China is a quiet form of blood-money, Japan is far from reaching Germany's state of collective remorse and self-analysis. It has yet to reach a point where it can inspire confidence that it should shed its pacifist constitution and step forward as a regional leader that would be trusted as much as most Europeans now trust Germany. As China flexes its muscles and America again hears the siren-call of isolationism, the counterweight of a democratic and benevolent Japan will be wanted more than ever--but only once it has faced up more fully to its history. That would more truly represent a victory in the Pacific.","NOBODY can say for sure how many perished in the global cauldron. Certainly 48m; maybe as many as 60m, depending on when and where you begin the gruesome body-count and whose figures you believe (see table on next page for some estimates).(Table omitted) Suffice it to say that much of Europe was at war for nearly six years until Victory-in-Europe or VE-Day, on May 8th 1945, and much of Asia until a little later, VJ-Day (or the more mealy-mouthed VP-Day--""Victory in the Pacific"" rather than ""over Japan"") on August 15th.
For the next few months world leaders will endure a remorseless roster of hand-shaking's and knee-bendings, more mournful than merry, partly in commemoration but also to reassure their peoples that such carnage will never again be perpetrated on such a global scale. Yet, fifty years on, the circumstances of slaughter are still debated, swept under the carpet-or even denied. ""One might think that the historians could have arrived at a consensus for interpreting the main events of the war,"" writes Norman Davies, a British historian, in the latest issue of the New York Review of Books. In reality, he observes, no such consensus exists.
One reason for this may be that on this 50th anniversary only two countries--Britain and the United States--obviously have more to celebrate than to rue. And even they are not twine-free of guilt. Winston Churchill encapsulated better than anyone the will to defeat evil. His country, by and large, fought a clean, resourceful and courageous war. Truly, at one point, did Britain stand alone against Hitler. Yet the use of nighttime area-bombing over such towns as Dresden and Hamburg, which, along with air attacks by other allies, may have killed 500,000 German civilians, was as morally questionable as the bombing of Hiroshima. It is true that 56,000 British airmen died in the war, often trying to drop those bombs, as did 93,000 British civilians, many of them victims of German aerial bombing. At least the A-bombs almost certainly ended the slaughter in Asia. In strategic terms, the bombing of Dresden is harder to justify.
Britain also suffered from the false assumption that traditional imperial power would reassert itself in the years that followed. ""The British Commonwealth and Empire stands more united and more effectively powerful than at any time in its long romantic history,"" said Churchill in his victory broadcast on May 13th. How wrong he was--and how damaging, among the debt and exhaustion, the consequent complacency and economic muddle that went with the slide from war-time centralisation into peace-time nationalisation.
As for America, it was the only power to emerge both as victor and beneficiary of the war. Its economy, still depressed in the run-up, took off mightily on the back of war production. It was generous in victory, both in the dispensing of material largesse and in its lack of vindictiveness. Its moral authority was strong. Yet question-marks stand over aspects of America's performance too. At the start Americans were reluctant to take part at all. In 1939 Europe and the fate of Jews, Czechs or Chinese seemed other people's business. Pre-war isolationism proved nearly disastrous. In May 1941 a feeble Congress passed a bill to extend conscription by just one vote. That summer, Republicans voted overwhelmingly against Lend-Lease, the act that decisively helped Britain to arm itself against fascism.
Above all, the morality of dropping the atomic bombs still tweaks American consciences. Conventional bombing was just as deadly: more people were killed in the raids over Tokyo and other Japanese cities in the last few months of the war than by the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki (where, together, more than 200,000 perished). Could the nuclear genie have been kept inside its bottle? Probably not. Did the bomb save lives by ending the war? Probably it did. But a burden of ill-ease weighs heavily on the country that first used it.
More pain than pride
It is among most other participants, however, that jubilation, this anniversary season, seems most inappropriate. There, one senses the pain and shame of history disputed and manipulated; of countries that were both villains and victims; of people who helped to win glorious battles against fascism but were enslaved by the victors; and of countries vanquished by fascism that had shown themselves far from virtuous or valiant in defeat.

1995-05-27,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/224104875/fulltext/C0B1748AB1FC47CCPQ/19?accountid=14657,"CHINESE diplomats specialise in expressions of outrage; recent events have given them plenty of opportunity to indulge themselves. In the past week, China has warned of ""rave consequences"" for its relations with the United States, after Bill Clinton's decision to allow Lee Ten-hui, the president of Taiwan, to pay a private visit to America. It has condemned Japan's decision to cut aid to China, in protest at a Chinese nuclear test, as ""senseless and detrimental"". Before that China was berating the Philippines for its ""dangerous"" attempt to challenge China's seizure of some reefs in the disputed Spratly islands.
Of all these affronts, the Taiwanese one probably offends most. On May 22nd, the Clinton administration yielded to intense pressure from America's Republican-dominated Congress and said Mr Lee would be given a visa to travel to a college reunion at his alma mater, Cornell University, in up-state New York.
Despite American assurances that there had been no change in its ""one China"" attitude, the decision to admit Mr Lee was a significant departure from a long-standing policy. When he arrives in America next month, Mr Lee will be the first Taiwanese head of state to be ranted entry since 1979, when America switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing. At China's insistence, formal contacts with senior Taiwanese officials were banned and senior American officials were forbidden to visit Taiwan. Last autumn, the American government slightly amended its policy to allow cabinet-level exchanges.
The Chinese are already alarmed by Mr Lee's diplomatic forays. In 1994 he scored a success when he went ""on holiday"" to several South-East Asian countries and happened to bump into a series of leaders and senior officials on golf courses. China was unable to do more than complain. The American visit is viewed by the Chinese as another dangerous precedent. At the least it signals an important vote of confidence in the island's transition from military dictatorship to vibrant democracy.
Mr Lee's next target will be to attend the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum to be held later this year in Japan. His chances seem slim. He was kept away from the first two APEC summits and, when China growled, the Japanese meekly cancelled his invitation to the Asian Games in Hiroshima last year. But even the Japanese can be riled into action, given enough provocation.
This month the Chinese assured Japan's prime minister, Tomiichi Murayama, that they supported a ban on nuclear tests. Then they signed an agreement to extend the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and joined the four other declared nuclear powers in promising to exercise the ""utmost restraint"" in nuclear testing. On May 15th, however, the Chinese exploded a nuclear bomb. China's disregard for the nuclear niceties was less surprising than what came next.
On May 22nd Japan announced that it would cut aid to China. It will be a slight cut (the precise size has yet to be determined), and Japan will continue to supply about half the bilateral aid that China receives from rich countries. Still, the cut suggests that Japan may at last be summoning the nerve to stand up to China. It is a signal also that the vague conditions Japan attaches to its aid may actually mean something.
Until recently, Japan has done its best to ignore the threat from China. It has abstained from public criticism of China's record on human rights and democracy, and tolerated China's protectionism. Far from seeing China's military build-up as a threat, Japan's army plans to cut 17% of its troops and 25% of its tanks over the next decade.
Against this background, even a small cut in aid to China represents new thinking. It followed Mr Murayama's visit to Beijing earlier this month, in which he discussed China's military policies with unusual sharpness. As well as urging the Chinese to abstain from nuclear testing, Japan's prime minister demanded that China explain the reasons for its rearmament. He also declared that the dispute over the Spratly islands, claimed by China and five other countries, should be resolved by negotiationan indirect rebuke to the Chinese, given the recent clash with the Philippines.
The idea of being sucked into multilateral discussions of the Spratlys is anathema to the Chinese, who would much prefer to divide and rule. They are particularly resistant to the notion of expanding the remit of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), a talking-shop on security issues, which made its debut after the meeting of the Association of South-East Asian Nations last July. The ARF is the only place in which the countries of South-East Asia, China, Japan and America come together to talk about security. The Chinese say that it should remain a forum for ""exchange of views"", not for negotiation.
More generally, Chinese foreign policy will continue to attempt to divide potential adversaries. China may hope to create a sense of Asian solidarity with Japan, since both countries have experienced bitter trade disputes with America. China has also successfully used its title as ""the world's largest emerging market"" to drive wedges between western countries, eager to do business there. When France angered the Chinese by selling fighters to Taiwan, it was punished by the closure of its consulate in Guangzhou and the awarding of a Big contract to the Germans. American resolve over Taiwan may be similarly tested.
In the long run, however, a Chinese strategy of divide-and-rule may founder on the new realities of international politics. During the cold war, the West was preoccupied with the threat from the Soviet Union. If China wanted to wallop the Vietnamese or grab an island or two, it seemed a relatively minor matter. But, with the cold war over, China's growing economic might and its rapid military build-up are forcing the developed world to take Chinese bluster over issues like Taiwan and the Spratlys much more seriously. Sometimes that means standing up to China. There may be more clashes to come.","CHINESE diplomats specialise in expressions of outrage ; recent events have given them plenty of opportunity to indulge themselves . In the past week , China has warned of "" rave consequences "" for its relations with the United States , after Bill Clinton 's decision to allow Lee Ten - hui , the president of Taiwan , to pay a private visit to America . It has condemned Japan 's decision to cut aid to China , in protest at a Chinese nuclear test , as "" senseless and detrimental "" . Before that China was berating the Philippines for its "" dangerous "" attempt to challenge China 's seizure of some reefs in the disputed Spratly islands . 
 Of all these affronts , the Taiwanese one probably offends most . On May 22nd , the Clinton administration yielded to intense pressure from America 's Republican - dominated Congress and said Mr Lee would be given a visa to travel to a college reunion at his alma mater , Cornell University , in up - state New York . 
 Despite American assurances that there had been no change in its "" one China "" attitude , the decision to admit Mr Lee was a significant departure from a long - standing policy . When he arrives in America next month , Mr Lee will be the first Taiwanese head of state to be ranted entry since 1979 , when America switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing . At China 's insistence , formal contacts with senior Taiwanese officials were banned and senior American officials were forbidden to visit Taiwan . Last autumn , the American government slightly amended its policy to allow cabinet - level exchanges . 
 The Chinese are already alarmed by Mr Lee 's diplomatic forays . In 1994 he scored a success when he went "" on holiday "" to several South - East Asian countries and happened to bump into a series of leaders and senior officials on golf courses . China was unable to do more than complain . The American visit is viewed by the Chinese as another dangerous precedent . At the least it signals an important vote of confidence in the island 's transition from military dictatorship to vibrant democracy . 
 Mr Lee 's next target will be to attend the annual Asia - Pacific Economic Co - operation forum to be held later this year in Japan . His chances seem slim . He was kept away from the first two APEC summits and , when China growled , the Japanese meekly cancelled his invitation to the Asian Games in Hiroshima last year . But even the Japanese can be riled into action , given enough provocation . 
 This month the Chinese assured Tomiichi Murayama's , that they supported a ban on nuclear tests . Then they signed an agreement to extend the Nuclear Non - Proliferation Treaty and joined the four other declared nuclear powers in promising to exercise the "" utmost restraint "" in nuclear testing . On May 15th , however , the Chinese exploded a nuclear bomb . China 's disregard for the nuclear niceties was less surprising than what came next .

To the south stretches the vast garden that surrounds the palace of Japan's imperial family, in whose name that war was fought. Tokyo's budokan, its martial-arts hall, was a fitting choice for the gathering of nationalists who came together on May 29th. To the strains of Japan's national anthem, and beneath the flag of the rising sun, 10,000 elderly delegates commemorated the Greater East Asia War that rid the continent of European colonialists and, they believe, laid the basis for its current dignity and wealth.
Half a century after that war's end, Japan still has difficulty admitting what it was about. The country's ruling coalition has spent much of this year agonising over a parliamentary resolution that would apologise for Japan's wartime behaviour.
The two smaller members of the government, the Social Democrats and the New Party Harbinger, want to describe Japan's advance into Asia as an ""invasion"" and its rule over Korea as ""colonial"", which they plainly were. The prime minister, Tomiichi Murayama, said on Wednesday that he might break up the government if the resolution did not et through. But the Liberal Democrats, who dominate the coalition, shrink from such bold language. Seisuke Okuno, the Liberal Democrat who organised the budokan rally, has persuaded 70% of the party's parliamentarians to join his anti-apology campaign.
Mr Okuno draws much of his influence from Japan's association for bereaved families, which has a membership of more than 1m households and is a formidable organiser of votes. Its head is Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's Liberal Democrat trade minister. No ambitious party member can afford to ignore its views. To suggest that Japan's soldiers died for a dishonourable cause might insult their grieving relatives. Facing a tough election under a new electoral system, prudent Liberal Democrats have toed Mr Okuno's line.
Besides opportunism, the reluctance to apologise reflects the anti-western current that still runs through Japan's politics. ""The West"" is accused of imposing its rules on others, insisting on war apologies while glossing over its own colonial past, and de; mankind's that everyone else accept an unfair interpretation of fair trade. To those who complain of this, Asia is the centre of civilisation, birthplace of great religions and of mankind's early scientific advances. Today's Japan likes to speak for Asia at international gatherings. In the minds of some Japanese politicians, this aspiration blurs into the fiction that Japan fought the second world war on Asia's behalf.
The wide currency of this illusion r reflects the mistakes of America's post-1945 occupation of Japan. In Germany, those most guilty of crimes against humanity were brought to trial at Nuremberg. In Japan, the Americans failed to sweep away the leaders and the symbols of the wartime government and to install new ones in their place.
Nazi leaders were incarcerated or executed, or fled; Japan's leaders went back to running the country when the Americans left. The Germans got a new flag and a new national anthem; the Japanese did not. After Nuremberg, Germans could not deny the need to apologise for atrocities. In Japan the horror of the imperial army's medical experiments has only recently come to light. Japan's emperor renounced his deity, but stayed in his palace as his nation's symbol.
As a result, the Japanese cannot criticise the past without risking their faith in the present. For most Japanese politicians, that risk is too much.
Since the late 1970s Japan's conservative governments have built up the country's national symbols, even though this has involved obscuring the past. In the early post-1945 years, the flag and the anthem were rarely used. Now, the conservatives have seen to it that they are used regularly in schools. The misty religiosities of Shintoism, central to wartime propaganda, have undergone a similar revival. Since the 1980s senior politicians have paid their respects to the war dead at Yasukuni. The courts have upheld the right of Japan's Self-Defence Force to enshrine dead members as Shinto deities, even though the constitution separates religion from the state.
The left, for its part, has chosen for its symbol, and as an exhortation to pacifism, the mushroom cloud over Hiroshima. In May the Asahi Shimburt, a left-leaning daily, ran a series of editorials arguing that Japan should play the role of conscientious objector in the comity of nations, and that the ""idealistic"" war-renouncing article of Japan's constitution should not be revised. Japan should contribute to the world through its aid budget and its knowledge, but never by bearing arms.
Offered symbols from both right and left, Japan has chosen a distasteful mixture. The appeal of pacifism is limited by its Utopianism, so Japan's right has succeeded in building up Japan's armed forces, and in restoring old symbols to something like their former dignity. This means that war apologies have been, at best, grudging. But the symbol of the mushroom cloud has persuaded many Japanese to regard themselves as victims, not as aggressors. It is not a combination likely to win foreign friends.","ACROSS the road stands the Yasukuni shrine , the "" shrine of the peaceful country "" , where each year some 6 m Japanese worship the souls of soldiers who died during the second world war .

You will see the names of all the Vietnamese who passed the old civil-service exams, engraved upon stone tablets supported by stone tortoises. And you will realise that the Vietnamese, like us Japanese, value education, discipline and strong government. We have both been influenced by Confucius.""
This injunction to visit Vietnam comes from Eisuke Sakakibara, a top official in Japan's finance ministry. It has been taken to heart by a remarkable number of his most influential compatriots. Last year Tomiichi Murayama, the prime minister, visited Vietnam. In February he was followed by one of the largest and most influential delegations ever dispatched abroad by the Keidanren, Japan's big-business federation. Japan's ambassador in Hanoi is Kazuo Ogura, a high-flyer tipped shortly to become number two in Japan's foreign ministry. More than half the foreign media organisations in Vietnam are Japanese.
This preoccupation with an impoverished communist state has some straightforward explanations. Japanese businessmen are drawn by a workforce that is as cheap and young as Japan's is costly and ageing. Japan's geopoliticians, eyeing nationalist China with alarm, hope to find an ally in traditionally anti-Chinese Vietnam. Then there is Japan's standing anxiety about the security of its oil supplies. Tankers from the Arab states pass near Vietnam, and there is oil in Vietnam's coastal waters.
But the Japanese are also drawn to Vietnam by a more subtle force, which is why Mr Sakakibara's injunction is so revealing. Vietnam has been chosen as a stage on which Japan hopes to celebrate its new sense of affinity with the rest of Asia, and its new self-confidence.
In trade talks with America, Mr Sakakibara is the finance ministry's toughest negotiator; he denounces the idea that Japan should conform to American rules, saying that Japan's system is different and in many ways better. To him, the Temple of Literature is a reminder of the rich tradition that underpins Asia's recent economic success, and which Asians, including Japanese, should take pride in.
Mr Ogura, Japan's ambassador in Hanoi, believes that Japan should help to lead a sort of Asian renaissance. Asia has long been a place for westerners to civilise and convert, he says; but now Asia's prosperity has revived its independent dignity. Because America lifted its embargo on trade only recently, Vietnam is the first economy to reach the point of take-off without help from the West. Most of its investment comes from Taiwan, Japan and Hong Kong, not from America or Europe. Most of its trade is with Asia too. Japan alone provides fully half the aid that Vietnam gets from foreign governments.
Software salesmen
The Japanese would like their generosity to encourage the Asianness of Vietnam's development. To this end, a team of officials and academics arrived in Hanoi this month to prepare something unprecedented. Japan is going to advise the Vietnamese what kind of economy they should have: what should go into their next five-year plan, how they should design their industrial policy and financial system. Until now Japan has shrunk from offering comprehensive blueprints. Vietnam is to be the site of a new bid for influence.
Hiroshi Fukada, the man responsible for this effort in Japan's foreign ministry, is not shy to spell this out. Japan, he explains, is already the world's biggest aid donor and it wants to be commensurately influential. That means shifting ""from hardware to software""--from the building of roads to the transfer of knowledge gleaned from Japan's miraculous development. America and Europe underwent unplanned industrialisation, because they industrialised before anywhere else. The Japanese reckon that their experience of planned, copy-cat industrialisation may hold more lessons for other late-comers, such as Vietnam.
Some of the Japanese consultants recently in Hanoi bristle with criticisms of the World Bank and the IMF, which they see as evangelists for American-style development. Ryokichi Hirono, an engaging economist from Seikei University in Tokyo, fumes that the IMF is in the rip of an anti-inflation ""theology"". He claims that devotion to the god of price stability will hurt Vietnam's growth, so undermining popular support for reform.
Mr Hirono also suspects that the World Bank may push Vietnam to privatise state firms too fast. He worries about the loss of jobs and government income that privatisation might bring. ""I am a gradualist,"" he says; ""they are shock therapists.""
The consultants have drawn up a preliminary report which is scarcely more conciliatory. It laments that Vietnam has not done enough to map out an industrial policy--apparently, it says, because of the World Bank's liberal prejudices. It is not enough for Vietnam's government to develop infrastructure and build schools. Vietnam should also decide what kinds of factories the country needs, then prod firms to build them.
The report argues that strong state leadership is especially necessary in a country like Vietnam, where market forces are too rudimentary to be trusted. Many commodities are produced by a handful of firms, so competition is weak. The biggest market failure lies in the financial system. Commercial banks are a novelty in Vietnam; the consultants doubt whether they can be relied upon to lend soundly. They cannot even be trusted to raise capital, since many Vietnamese reckon their money is safer under their mattress. For the moment, therefore, the Japanese advisers think that the state will have to play a role both in raising capital and in deciding how to spend it.
The consultants also worry that the welcome growth unleashed by market reform will lead to very unwelcome inequalities. Growth is surging in the south and in the cities, and leaving peasants and northerners behind. More holes are appearing in Vietnam's threadbare welfare net; medical services are no longer free. The state may have to intervene to limit this lopsidedness.
The consultants' views are backed by money. Not only has Japan pledged Y58 billion ($690m) in aid this year, but Japan's private investors seem to take their cues from the government. Until the American embargo was lifted last year, Japanese firms were quietly urged to go slow in Vietnam; as a result, Japan languished in eighth place in the league table of foreign investors. With the lifting of the embargo, however, Japan has shot up to third place; Vietnamese officials expect it to overtake Hong Kong soon, and Taiwan eventually. A recent survey of the long-term plans of Japan's firms found that they rate Vietnam as the second-most attractive place to invest, after China.
Japan's bigger firms seem to have absorbed the consultants' views. Toyota is one of several Japanese firms to have chosen to invest in north Vietnam. Mitsubishi Oil has been especially socially conscious. The day before it stared drilling for oil in south Vietnam last year, its chairman, Kikuo Yamada, visited the rural birthplace of Ho Chi Minh, the country's revolutionary leader. Mr Yamada used the visit to launch a plan to develop local sesame-seed farms. Nothing could appeal to the concern for balanced growth more surely.
The flood of aid and private cash has naturally caught Vietnam's attention. The head of the Communist Party, Do Muoi, visited Japan in April. A high-powered committee has been formed to liaise with the consultants from Japan. Le Dang Doanh, one of the government's top economists, says Vietnam is eager to hear Japan's advice. He talks politely of Japan's success in combining growth with a large measure of equality and suggests that Vietnam and Japan have much in common.
In the end, however, the cash and the development blueprints may matter more for Japan than for Vietnam. For Japan, this is a chance to act as a big power and to strengthen its voice in the world. The Japanese who are challenging what they see as the American bias at the IMF and the World Bank are often the same Japanese who most strongly support their country's recent rejection of American trade demands.
The World Bank and the Japanese will strive to paper over their differences. The Bank's Vietnam specialists do not need to be told of the importance of rural growth, or the fight against poverty, or the flaws in Vietnam's financial system; they have written long studies on all three subjects. The IMF may shrug off the charge that its anti-inflation zeal hurts growth. After all, Vietnam has managed to cut inflation from 487% in 1986 to around 15% now, yet growth is running at a robust 9%.
For their part, the Vietnamese are unlikely to swallow any advice from foreigners whole. Mr Doanh, who sits on the committee to liaise with the Japanese, hints that Japan's interventionist model was easier to apply in the 1960s than it is today, since rich countries are now less tolerant of trade protection. He declares that, in the financial field, ""America's model is extremely interesting""; and that Vietnam would be wrong to follow Japan in delaying the development of equity and bond markets. Asked whether the distinguished liaison committee is a sign of Vietnam's eagerness to emulate Japan, Mr Doanh says only: ""It is better to listen to many voices than to one.""",""" GO TO Vietnam . Visit the Temple of Literature in Hanoi . You will see the names of all the Vietnamese who passed the old civil - service exams , engraved upon stone tablets supported by stone tortoises . And you will realise that the Vietnamese , like us Japanese , value education , discipline and strong government . We have both been influenced by Confucius . "" 
 This injunction to visit Vietnam comes from Eisuke Sakakibara , a top official in Japan 's finance ministry . It has been taken to heart by a remarkable number of his most influential compatriots . Last year Tomiichi Murayama , visited Vietnam . In February Tomiichi Murayama was followed by one of the largest and most influential delegations ever dispatched abroad by the Keidanren , Japan 's big - business federation . Japan 's ambassador in Hanoi is Kazuo Ogura , a high - flyer tipped shortly to become number two in Japan 's foreign ministry . More than half the foreign media organisations in Vietnam are Japanese . 
 This preoccupation with an impoverished communist state has some straightforward explanations . Japanese businessmen are drawn by a workforce that is as cheap and young as Japan 's is costly and ageing . Japan 's geopoliticians , eyeing nationalist China with alarm , hope to find an ally in traditionally anti - Chinese Vietnam . Then there is Japan 's standing anxiety about the security of its oil supplies . Tankers from the Arab states pass near Vietnam , and there is oil in Vietnam 's coastal waters . 
 But the Japanese are also drawn to Vietnam by a more subtle force , which is why Mr Sakakibara 's injunction is so revealing . Vietnam has been chosen as a stage on which Japan hopes to celebrate its new sense of affinity with the rest of Asia , and its new self - confidence . 
 In trade talks with America , Mr Sakakibara is the finance ministry 's toughest negotiator ; he denounces the idea that Japan should conform to American rules , saying that Japan 's system is different and in many ways better . To him , the Temple of Literature is a reminder of the rich tradition that underpins Asia 's recent economic success , and which Asians , including Japanese , should take pride in . 
 Mr Ogura , Japan 's ambassador in Hanoi , believes that Japan should help to lead a sort of Asian renaissance . Asia has long been a place for westerners to civilise and convert , he says ; but now Asia 's prosperity has revived its independent dignity . Because America lifted its embargo on trade only recently , Vietnam is the first economy to reach the point of take - off without help from the West . Most of its investment comes from Taiwan , Japan and Hong Kong , not from America or Europe . Most of its trade is with Asia too . Japan alone provides fully half the aid that Vietnam gets from foreign governments . 
 Software salesmen 
 The Japanese would like their generosity to encourage the Asianness of Vietnam 's development . To this end , a team of officials and academics arrived in Hanoi this month to prepare something unprecedented . Japan is going to advise the Vietnamese what kind of economy they should have : what should go into their next five - year plan , how they should design their industrial policy and financial system . Until now Japan has shrunk from offering comprehensive blueprints . Vietnam is to be the site of a new bid for influence . 
 Hiroshi Fukada , the man responsible for this effort in Japan 's foreign ministry , is not shy to spell this out . Japan , he explains , is already the world 's biggest aid donor and it wants to be commensurately influential . That means shifting "" from hardware to software""--from the building of roads to the transfer of knowledge gleaned from Japan 's miraculous development . America and Europe underwent unplanned industrialisation , because they industrialised before anywhere else . The Japanese reckon that their experience of planned , copy - cat industrialisation may hold more lessons for other late - comers , such as Vietnam . 
 Some of the Japanese consultants recently in Hanoi bristle with criticisms of the World Bank and the IMF , which they see as evangelists for American - style development . Ryokichi Hirono , an engaging economist from Seikei University in Tokyo , fumes that the IMF is in the rip of an anti - inflation "" theology "" . He claims that devotion to the god of price stability will hurt Vietnam 's growth , so undermining popular support for reform . 
 Mr Hirono also suspects that the World Bank may push Vietnam to privatise state firms too fast . He worries about the loss of jobs and government income that privatisation might bring . "" I am a gradualist , "" he says ; "" they are shock therapists . "" 
 The consultants have drawn up a preliminary report which is scarcely more conciliatory . It laments that Vietnam has not done enough to map out an industrial policy -- apparently , it says , because of the World Bank 's liberal prejudices . It is not enough for Vietnam 's government to develop infrastructure and build schools . Vietnam should also decide what kinds of factories the country needs , then prod firms to build them . 
 The report argues that strong state leadership is especially necessary in a country like Vietnam , where market forces are too rudimentary to be trusted . Many commodities are produced by a handful of firms , so competition is weak . The biggest market failure lies in the financial system . Commercial banks are a novelty in Vietnam ; the consultants doubt whether they can be relied upon to lend soundly . They can not even be trusted to raise capital , since many Vietnamese reckon their money is safer under their mattress . For the moment , therefore , the Japanese advisers think that the state will have to play a role both in raising capital and in deciding how to spend it . 
 The consultants also worry that the welcome growth unleashed by market reform will lead to very unwelcome inequalities . Growth is surging in the south and in the cities , and leaving peasants and northerners behind . More holes are appearing in Vietnam 's threadbare welfare net ; medical services are no longer free . The state may have to intervene to limit this lopsidedness .

But even Mr Soliven gets angry about Japan's selective memory of history. To the embarrassment of his hosts in Japan's foreign ministry, his stay in Japan offered fresh cause to be cross. On July 4th the government announced that it would not commemorate the country's surrender in the second world war on August 15th. For the past 49 years, defeat has been marked by a ceremony in Tokyo. The emperor and prime minister have attended; there have been speeches, bowed heads and a minute of silence. Many Japanese had expected the 50th anniversary to be more elaborate, not postponed or cancelled.
This is not the doing of Japan's diplomats, who long to smooth relations with the countries that the imperial army overran. Instead, it reflects the views of vociferous nationalists within Japan's three-party coalition, who hate to draw attention to the humiliation of the past. Last month this group succeeded in watering down a parliamentary resolution apologising for Japan's war record. Now it has struck again.
Instead of a ceremony in Tokyo, the weeks leading up to the 50th anniversary will feature appearances by Japan's reclusive emperor.

This is Japan remembering its own suffering, rather than that of its foes.
In August last year, Japan's government announced a plan to temper this one-sidedness. The prime minister, Tomiichi Murayama, promised to raise money to help Asian ""comfort women"", who were conscripted as sex slaves for Japan's soldiers. A fund has been duly set up; but no money has been raised yet. Rather than apologies for the past, Japan's companies would prefer to forget about it.
Japan long ago paid official reparations to Asia. Most Japanese feel that anything more would imply too deep an admission of guilt; some think any admission too much. On July 5th, 62 nationalists went to court to claim damages from the government for the supposed mental suffering they had to undergo as a result of last month's watery expression of regret about the war. The nationalists put about the view that Japan fought the war to defend itself against westerners' colonial encroachment in Asia. They argue that, despite Japan's surrender, the war led to the end of colonial rule in Asia, and laid the basis for the region's economic success.
Such views lend significance to the new date set for commemorating the war's 50th anniversary. The government now says it may hold a ceremony in November, when it will also be host to this year's APEC summit. Amid the inevitable talk of prospering Asia, the memory of defeat in 1945 will be sweetened by the celebration of Japan's economic victories since then.

HOW times change. Two years ago, a coalition of new reformist parties swept to power in Japan's lower-house election. The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which had ruled Japan for 39 years, was booted out; new electoral laws were passed in the hope of weeding out corruption. These days, however, the reformists are in retreat. According to the polls, they face a drubbing on July 23rd in the upper-house election.
The New Frontier Party, formed last year by the reformists, holds a third of the seats in the more powerful lower house. But its leaders have been tarnished by a financial scandal this year; and several of its younger members have threatened to bolt to the LDP. The party's spokesmen, who once sounded serious about deregulation and other reforms, are now anxious to avoid all opinions lest these prompt defections. As a result, the New Frontiersmen will probably win less than a quarter of the upper-house seats contested in this election.
The LDP, meanwhile, expects to win half of them. Yet its leaders are worried. The LDP's main coalition partner, the Social Democratic Party, is heading for humiliation. This may force the Social Democrats' leader, Tomiichi Murayama, to step down. Since the LDP has installed Mr Murayama as prime minister, this would be awkward. The party would find itself obliged to put its own man into the top job; this might prompt the defection of the coalition's third member, the New Harbinger Party. Besides, the LDP's elders have no agreed candidate.
In recent months, therefore, Liberal and Social Democrats alike have suggested that Mr Murayama should hang on, no matter how badly his party fares in the election. This infuriates most Japanese, who feel that the message from the ballot box deserves better. The political reform enacted last year was supposed to create governments with clear mandates. The Yomiuri Shimbun, a conservative daily which usually has mushy views, fumes that the retention of a defeated Mr Murayama would constitute a ""ridiculous affront"" to Japanese democracy.
The selection of an LDP prime minister might not reflect the popular will either. Its leader is dull; its policies are vague. A poll by the Asahi Shimbun, a left-leaning daily, found that the share of voters loyal to the LDP has fallen by between half and two-thirds since 1993, depending on the area: the new floating voters may abstain or vote for independent candidates.
Many Japanese fear that political apathy and economic gloom will prove a dangerous mix. Crime may rise; discipline may decline; the disillusioned young may join sects. Some even recall what happened before when Japan suffered recession plus un-inspiring party politics. Last month Masamichi Inoki, a newspaper columnist, even fantasised in print about a repetition of the 1930s, when frustration with parliamentary politics drove army officers to take over the government.","TOKYO

NO MATTER who wins, this month's election campaign in Japan will have produced something interesting. Political change is pushing Japan's politicians towards a new assertiveness. Casting about for a way to seize voters' imagination, campaigners from all main parties have denounced France's planned nuclear tests in the South Pacific.
On July 14th Toshiki Kaifu, leader of the opposition New Frontier Party, called for a consumer boycott of French imports. Three days later he was echoed by Masayoshi Takemura, finance minister and leader of one of the coalition's three parties. Yohei Kono, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, another of the coalition partners, lent his support to the idea of a parliamentary resolution criticising France. Tomiichi Murayama, the prime minister and leader of the Social Democrats, announced that Japan will propose a UN resolution calling for an end to all nuclear testing.
Since 1993, when the Liberal Democrats lost their monopoly on power, pluralism has forced politicians to woo voters with exciting notions. Vested interests frustrate bold reform at home, so the easiest way to be exciting is in foreign policy. Until this week, the clearest sign of this had been in trade negotiations. Ryutaro Hashimoto, the trade minister, became a national hero last month by defying American demands that Japan rig its car market in favour of imports.
In the past, Mr Hashimoto's populism might have backfired, since the barons of his party would have resented it. These days, however, all parties want leaders who can win votes: nearly everyone describes Mr Hashimoto as a future prime minister. Another rising Liberal Democratic star is Makiko Tanaka, the science minister. Last month, when France announced it would conduct nuclear tests, she suggested that these should be carried out in Paris. This month's election campaign, together with anti-nuclear emotion aroused by the 50th anniversary next month of the bombing of Hiroshima, has heightened nationalism.
Which issue will be next to reflect this mood? Some Japanese are starting to mutter about their military alliance with America. The latest edition of Aera, a political weekly, carries a letter suggesting that the treaty be scrapped. This was prompted by an article published in the wake of the car talks with America, about the cost to Japan of keeping American troops on its territory. Its author, Shunji Taoka, claims that American troops do little to defend Japan, not least because they are concentrated in Okinawa, miles south of Japan's main islands.
In time, Japan's rising nationalism promises great change. For the moment, however, the French have little to worry about. A consumer boycott might, in theory, discomfort French fashion firms, which are masters at persuading Japanese consumers to surrender ridiculous sums of money. The share price of LVMH, which owns brands such as Louis Vuitton, fell after a Japanese boycott was mooted. And on July 19th an association of 50,000 atom-bomb survivors announced that they would stop bung French goods. Yet the truth is that the vast majority of Japan's consumers have no tradition of boycotts, protests, or other politically correct deeds. It will be a while before Japanese ladies stamp on their Louis Vuitton handbags.","TOKYO

The first is leadership, something there is invariably too little of, especially if the country's leader is John Major or Bill Clinton. The other, increasingly popular, pick-me-up is a general election, even if the rules do not require one to be held for several years. Calls for early polls can be heard in Spain, where Felipe Gonzalez's Socialist government is under attack, and Italy, where politics is so confusing and confused that even after June's 12 referendum votes there is still a taste for another unscheduled trip to the voting booths. Now, this view has also taken hold in Japan, following the drubbing given to the prime minister's socialist party in elections on July 23rd for parliament's upper house (see page 25). Political weakness, it is thought, is helping to keep Japan's economy in recession; a dose of the polls is just what is needed to clear the blockage.
In Japan, the consensus in favour of an autumn election is remarkable: all the main national newspapers have called for one. It is true that Japan is in the midst of a political realignment that began in 1995 when the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) was thrown out of government for the first time in almost 40 years; it is hard for realignments to occur without elections. And it is plausible to argue that if an early election could have a magical effect anywhere then Japan would seem a prime candidate, for it has severe economic problems to which the government's response has been feeble. But it is also worth sounding some cautionary notes. The call for early polls is not as consensual as it seems; it implies a hasty reading of the upperhouse election results; and it may well involve a hefty slug of wishful thinking.
Divided they stand
As is often the case, the unity of view conceals a disunity of motive. Some of those arguing for a general election in Japan are doing so because they think weak government is causing economic harm. They favour more government borrowing, a more expansionary monetary policy and more use of public money to bail out troubled banks; and they think the present governing coalition, an unwieldy combination of one left-wing party with two conservative ones, is too weak to achieve that. But others who are arguing for a trip to the polling booths is think that government is too strong, not too weak: they believe that bureaucratic interference, excessive regulation and cosy relationships with pressure groups are doing economic harm, and they want the chance to elect a new government dedicated to deregulation.
These views are not necessarily contradictory. You can be in favour of deregulation at the same time as believing that the government should be doing more in fiscal and monetary policy. But the two views need not o together, and in Japan they often do not. Some think government is the problem, not the solution; others still think, in the traditional post-war Japanese way, that strong government is always the best sort. Such a difference of opinion is entirely healthy. But this argument is still in its early states, and is not fully established as a new dividing line between the main political parties.
The upper-house elections confirm this, if the results are studied carefully. Superficially, the polls were clear: a defeat for the prime minister, Tomiichi Murayama, and his socialist party; big gains for the main opposition group, the New Frontier Party, which (more or less) favours deregulation. Yet the biggest party in the governing coalition, the LDP, which (as far as one can tell) opposes most deregulation, also did well, albeit not as well as it boasted that it would. And the most striking figure of all was the low turnout: less than half of those eligible to vote bothered to do so, making this Japan's most apathetic parliamentary election in half a century. If voters wanted to slap the government in the face and strengthen the opposition, they chose a funny way of doing it.
It would be wrong, then, to assume that an early general election would bring a new government with a clear mandate, and that such a government would then bring on the other pick-me-up, leadership. The only budding clarifier, after all, is far from clear itself. The New Frontier Party is neither new (being made up mainly of long-time political hacks); nor is it at any frontier (being still muddled about deregulation); and its fractiousness makes it barely yet a party. Japanese voters remain unimpressed by the choices on offer. Realignment is under way, but it could take several elections before clarity is achieved, not just one. Japan can have an election, by all means. But it should not expect too much of it.","THESE days , when countries feel down in the dumps , it is not long before pundits start to call for two familiar medicines .

LIKE Mike Tyson's comeback fight, it was over before it began. Barring the intervention of a surprise candidate, Ryutaro Hashimoto, the minister for trade and industry, has won by default the contest to lead the Liberal Democratic Party. Since the LDP is the governing coalition's largest member, Mr Hashimoto is, according to every political pundit from boardroom to barroom, prime-minister-in-waiting, The pundits may be right. But he could still be waiting a while.
Mr Hashimoto's victory came on August 28th when Yohei Kono, Japan's foreign minister and the LDP's current leader, threw in the towel without even officially declaring his candidacy. Victory's foundations, however, were laid two months earlier with Japan's trade deal on cars and car parts with America. Then, Mr Hashimoto successfully fended off an American threat to place a huge tariff on imports of luxury cars from Japan, without conceding any quantifiable promises in return. This triumph boosted Mr Hashimoto's already high popularity with the voters in general, and with ordinary members of the LDP in particular. Since those ordinary members command 151 of the 461 votes in the electoral college for the party's presidency, Mr Kono started to look vulnerable.
Mr Hashimoto rode his wave of popularity superbly, using it to break up the existing pattern of factions in the LDP and change it more to his liking. Though the party's five factions were formally abolished last year, they are still very much alive. Mr Kono had the backing of three of them, giving him 164 supposedly safe votes.
Some backbenchers, however, feared Mr Kono might cost them their seats (the latest opinion poll suggests 27% of respondents would like to see Mr Hashimoto as the next prime minister, compared with only 11% wanting Mr Kono); they started to defect. The LDP's indifferent showing in July's election for the Diet's upper house accelerated this trend. Soon nobody wanted to be left behind. On August 22nd, 69 LDP members of the Diet formed a cross-faction group called ""Hashimoto for LDP President"". The two largest Kono-supporting factions lost 28 of their members and a third small one seceded altogether.
Faced with humiliation, Mr Kono pulled out. With his honour intact, he may be able to keep a reasonably senior job in the Hashimoto era. Certainly, Mr Hashimoto might be wise to hold on to him: popular as the new leader is among voters, his coalition partners despise him.
Three's company
The difficulty is that Mr Hashimoto would need the support of all three parties in the governing coalition. He may now be leader-presumptive of the strongest leg of the governing tripod (the other two are the Social Democratic Party and the New Harbinger Party), but he is not strong enough to kick the other legs away.
Mr Hashimoto's problem, at least as far as his coalition partners are concerned, is that he is a nationalist. He thinks, as his confrontation with the Americans showed, that Japan should stop clinging to America's skins and start playing a more active role in the world. He believes in revising the constitution so that the country can formally abandon the pretence of a self-effacing ""Self-Defence Force"". He wants Japan to have a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. And, as chairman of the Japan War Bereaved Families Association, he is not terribly keen on official apologies for Japan's wartime activities.
Such nationalistic sentiments make him an uncomfortable partner for Tomiichi Murayama, the prime minister and leader of the Social Democrats. Mr Murayama is a pacifist who recently made what may or may not have been an unequivocal apology for Japanese misdemeanours before 1945. The third member of the triumvirate, Masayoshi Takemura (finance minister and leader of the New Harbinger Party), does not like Mr Hashimoto much either. Such different partners seem ill-suited. Yet for Mr Hashimoto to ditch his allies and go to the country might be a mistake: the latest Nikkei poll shows only 32% of respondents saying they would vote for the LDP.
In any event, engineering a rapid election to the Diet's lower house (where the power lies) would not look very statesman-like. Though given a breathing-space by the weakening of the yen, Japan's economy still looks exhausted. Any election would have to wait at least until after the second supplementary budget in October, when a fiscal stimulus of more than Y10 trillion is expected (though actual new spending is likely to be Y3 trillion-5 trillion). And by the time that is through the Diet, the summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum, to be held in Japan in November, would be looming. Cabinet ministers will be too busy bathing in reflected glory to campaign.
But waiting until 1996 to assume the prime ministership would be risky. If a week is a long time in politics, six months is an eternity, and there is no guarantee that even if he waits that long Mr Hashimoto's personality would carry the LDP to outright power in a general election. One event in particular could at his calculations: the coalition might collapse of its own accord. The Social Democrats have looked ready to implode for months. They might choose to do so at their convention on September 21st, leaving the prime minister without a party. If so, Mr Hashimoto would have no choice but to step into the breach, possibly patching up a coalition with the opposition New Frontier Party (NFP), the political vehicle of his old rival, Ichiro Ozawa.
If this does not happen, Mr Hashimoto will probably imitate his rival's strategy. Mr Ozawa assembled the NFP by patiently encouraging defections from the LDP. Mr Hashimoto is likely to try to pay him back by offering the possibility of real power as a lure to get some of the defectors to turn their coats again. The realignment of Japanese politics is not over yet.","TOKYO

LIKE Mike Tyson's comeback fight, it was over before it began. Barring the intervention of a surprise candidate, Ryutaro Hashimoto, the minister for trade and industry, has won by default the contest to lead the Liberal Democratic Party. Since the LDP is the governing coalition's largest member, Mr Hashimoto is, according to every political pundit from boardroom to barroom, prime-minister-in-waiting, The pundits may be right. But he could still be waiting a while.
Mr Hashimoto's victory came on August 28th when Yohei Kono, Japan's foreign minister and the LDP's current leader, threw in the towel without even officially declaring his candidacy. Victory's foundations, however, were laid two months earlier with Japan's trade deal on cars and car parts with America. Then, Mr Hashimoto successfully fended off an American threat to place a huge tariff on imports of luxury cars from Japan, without conceding any quantifiable promises in return. This triumph boosted Mr Hashimoto's already high popularity with the voters in general, and with ordinary members of the LDP in particular. Since those ordinary members command 151 of the 461 votes in the electoral college for the party's presidency, Mr Kono started to look vulnerable.
Mr Hashimoto rode his wave of popularity superbly, using it to break up the existing pattern of factions in the LDP and change it more to his liking. Though the party's five factions were formally abolished last year, they are still very much alive. Mr Kono had the backing of three of them, giving him 164 supposedly safe votes.
Some backbenchers, however, feared Mr Kono might cost them their seats (the latest opinion poll suggests 27% of respondents would like to see Mr Hashimoto as the next prime minister, compared with only 11% wanting Mr Kono); they started to defect. The LDP's indifferent showing in July's election for the Diet's upper house accelerated this trend. Soon nobody wanted to be left behind. On August 22nd, 69 LDP members of the Diet formed a cross-faction group called ""Hashimoto for LDP President"". The two largest Kono-supporting factions lost 28 of their members and a third small one seceded altogether.
Faced with humiliation, Mr Kono pulled out. With his honour intact, he may be able to keep a reasonably senior job in the Hashimoto era. Certainly, Mr Hashimoto might be wise to hold on to him: popular as the new leader is among voters, his coalition partners despise him.
Three's company
The difficulty is that Mr Hashimoto would need the support of all three parties in the governing coalition.

RYUTARO HASHIMOTO did not have to fight to launch himself in politics. When his father died in 1963, he inherited a vote-gathering machine that propelled him smoothly into Japan's parliament at the tender age of 26. His marriage, three years later, was brokered by none other than Japan's then prime minister. Powerful friends and an early start are handy assets in Japan's political world, where patronage and patience are the keys to promotion.
Mr Hashimoto held his first cabinet post in 1978. And, at mid-week, it seemed all but certain that he would be elected president of his Liberal Democratic Party on September 22nd. Since the LDP dominates the coalition government, Mr Hashimoto has become more powerful than Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's socialist prime minister. On the wall of Mr Hashimoto's office hangs a photograph of Naples, where last year's G7 summit was held. ""That"", he points out, ""is where Mr Murayama got an upset stomach.""
When he was first elected to parliament, Mr Hashimoto attended some of his first meetings accompanied by his stepmother. These days the mummy's boy has grown up. He teases visitors in a playful way, deflecting questions. As minister of trade, Mr Hashimoto to enjoyed baiting the Americans during this year's row about cars. He appeared at one meeting in a green leather suit. He said that negotiating with Mickey Kantor, his American foe, was as scaly as facing the fury of his wife when he came home late and tipsy.
Provocation, in short, is the trade minister's trademark. He swaggers rather than walks, and frequently loses his temper. Ordinary Japanese, especially women, find him lovably tough, but Mr Hashimoto's style has won him few friends among his parliamentary colleagues, even though they have chosen him as their leader. The choice reflects changes in Japan, both in domestic politics and in foreign policy.
The LDP used to avoid having flamboyant leaders. Power resided with grey faction chiefs; who pulled strings attached to faceless prime ministers. The facelessness did not matter, because the LDP had no particular need to court voters with televisual charm: it could buy support, and its socialist opponents were too extreme to be electable. In 1993, however, the LDP split. The defectors were among the founders of the New Frontier Party, which did better than the LDP in July's election for the upper house of parliament.
The new electoral challenge has shifted power from the LDP's faction chiefs to its charismatic vote-pullers. This change is reinforced by last year's reform of the electoral system for parliament's lower house. In the past, four or five candidates were elected from each constituency, the last of whom often scraped into parliament with a mere 15% of the votes. To muster such modest support, it was enough to distribute cash diligently; and marshalling cash was what the faction chiefs were good at. Under the new electoral system, by contrast, only one candidate will be elected from each constituency. It is impossible to buy that many votes. Poise and charm are necessary.
So, perhaps, are flashy policies. The local elections in April showed that voters like candidates who espouse bold ideas. The new governor of Tokyo, for example, is an independent who promised to cancel the vastly expensive Tokyo Expo, despite the protests of firms that had already poured money into the project. Over the past month Masayoshi Takemura, the finance minister, has doubled the popularity of his small party by protesting loudly against French nuclear tests. Junichiro Koizumi, Mr Hashimoto's rival for the leadership, grabbed the limelight recently by proposing the privatisation of Japan's postal savings system.
In a country renowned for consensus, radical views have become political assets. Mr Hashimoto strikes a nationalist pose. He defies Mr Kantor. He plays down the need to apologise for Japan's belligerent past. He wants to scrap the pacifist clause of Japan's constitution. In a book published two years ago, Mr Hashimoto declared that Japan and the West are separated by a ""gap in national spirit"".
The Japanese are in the mood to support this kind of talk. Demoralised by half a decade of economic loom, they long for strong leadership. Humiliated by the 50th anniversary of their defeat in war, they savour victories of any kindsome real, like the refusal to concede American trade demands; others imaginary, such as the film released in the week of VJ day, which showed samurai in victorious combat against American cowboys.
Mr Hashimoto plays to this feeling, but he is not a dangerous radical. Unprompted, he praises America's military role in Asia. Although prompted several times, he refuses to sound anti-western. Yet, even though he maybe moderate inside, his nationalist cloak is too useful to discard. The prime minister who fell sick in Naples seems likely to be dumped soon, and next year will probably bring a general election. If the voters' nationalism proves strong, the LDP may win enough votes to form a government of its own, with Mr Hashimoto as prime minister. Even if it does not, populism will keep Japanese politics lively.","TOKYO

America's Bill Clinton and Japan's Tomiichi Murayama were supposed to meet in Tokyo next week hot-foot from the Osaka summit of Asia-Pacific leaders. Heading a feeble, faction-ridden coalition, Mr Murayama no doubt sympathises with Mr Clinton's decision to stay at home to deal with budget capers in Washington. All the same, Japan will be irritated: the twin summits were meant to enhance its profile in Asia, and a joint declaration on security was supposed to be signed. Meanwhile, an ugly incident--the rape of a Japanese girl by American soldiers--has shaken the security alliance between America and Japan. That in turn threatens the stability of the wider Pacific region.
In both America and Japan, public opinion is turning against the treaty that still keeps some 47,000 American troops in Japan (out of about 100,000 in the region). Some Japanese officials privately question why Japan should pay 70% of the cost of keeping these Americans on its soil. Might not the money be better spent help in Japan to defend itself? Yes, agree some Americans. Japan is rich enough to look after itself; the only way to get it to do so is to bring America's troops home.
Such voices are still in a minority. Yet the wobble in the American-Japanese alliance is adding to jitters in East Asia. There, as in Europe, the early post-cold-war euphoria has worn off. After a decade or more of boisterous economic growth and unprecedented stability, new worries loom.
Chief among them is China. Already a regional power to be reckoned with, will China throw its weight behind attempts to build a sturdier set of security structures to underpin the prosperity of the region? Or will it choose to remain a truculent, sometimes threatening, outsider? Its reef-grab in the South China Sea earlier this year and its efforts to intimidate Taiwan by blatant missile diplomacy came as a rude wake-up call in a region where many had been lulled into a false sense that economic growth could cure all ills. Meanwhile, the old Soviet threat may have shrivelled, but Russia is looking increasingly unstable and unpredictable. The two Koreas may eventually come together, as Germany did, in peace. But for now the betting around the region's foreign and defence ministries is on a more explosive chain of events.
What can 47,000 American troops in 
Japan do about all this? Clearly, Japan itself does not face the sort of military threat, even from a more assertive China, that it once did from an aggressive Soviet Union. Korea is different. If events turned nasty on the Korean peninsula, America would find it harder to reinforce its troops in South Korea without the soldiers, equipment and bases in Japan. Still, some would say that the problems of Korea and China nowadays affect Japan more directly than America, so it should be Japan's troops rather than America's who should stand in harm's way.
Japan could--and should--do a lot more in its own defence. Yet despite that, and even if Korea were already unified and at peace, there would still be an argument for keeping American soldiers in Japan. If anything, in the foreseeable future that argument is likely to et stronger. That is because, with the end of the cold war, East Asia is struggling to accommodate the rivalries of four big powers-America, China, Japan and Russia--with a united Korea someday making a biggish fifth. Moreover, the inevitable elbow-bashing is largely unconstrained by the sorts of multilateral alliances, treaties and security talking-shops that underpin security in Europe.
By promising to defend Japan and by extending its nuclear umbrella, America not only deterred the Soviet Union, but also prevented the natural competition for influence in East Asia from turning into a destabilising regional arms race. Japan felt secure enough to et on with building democracy and prosperity, and its neighbours, large and small, were reassured that it would not be tempted to strike out alone. Yet, half a century after the end of the second world war, suspicions of Japan liner, fuelled often, as in the recent row with South Korea, by clumsy talk from Japanese politicians. Strip away America's stabilising presence and suspicion could swiftly turn to paranoia. And since Japan's natural rival in the region is now China, a nuclear power, a Japan left to fend for itself would be strongly tempted to o nuclear too.
Partnership, not occupation
For all these reasons and more, America still has a big stake in its alliance with Japan. Yet the critics are right about one thin: if the alliance is to survive, it needs to change. America can no longer be expected to do all of East Asia's military work alone. When it looked to Japan for even minimal support during the recent nuclear crisis in North Korea, Japan waved its ""peace"" constitution and backed away. Yet, like Germany's, Japan's constitutional ban on military action abroad in support of close allies is only as strong as its politicians choose to make it.
Those politicians need to consider that, if Japan is ever to be accepted as a normal country, with a serious claim to leadership in East Asia, it needs to show its neighbours that, in the interests of security in the region, it can do real soldiering for democratic ends. What better way than finding new military ways to co-operate with America: something Mr Clinton and Mr Murayama could usefully talk about when they finally do have a summit, if they have the vision-and the time.","A SUMMIT between Tomiichi Murayama's ought to have been a world - shaping event .

Moreover , the inevitable elbow - bashing is largely unconstrained by the sorts of multilateral alliances , treaties and security talking - shops that underpin security in Europe . 
 By promising to defend Japan and by extending its nuclear umbrella , America not only deterred the Soviet Union , but also prevented the natural competition for influence in East Asia from turning into a destabilising regional arms race . Japan felt secure enough to et on with building democracy and prosperity , and its neighbours , large and small , were reassured that it would not be tempted to strike out alone . Yet , half a century after the end of the second world war , suspicions of Japan liner , fuelled often , as in the recent row with South Korea , by clumsy talk from Japanese politicians . Strip away America 's stabilising presence and suspicion could swiftly turn to paranoia . And since Japan 's natural rival in the region is now China , a nuclear power , a Japan left to fend for itself would be strongly tempted to o nuclear too . 
 Partnership , not occupation 
 For all these reasons and more , America still has a big stake in its alliance with Japan . Yet the critics are right about one thin : if the alliance is to survive , it needs to change . America can no longer be expected to do all of East Asia 's military work alone . When it looked to Japan for even minimal support during the recent nuclear crisis in North Korea , Japan waved its "" peace "" constitution and backed away . Yet , like Germany 's , Japan 's constitutional ban on military action abroad in support of close allies is only as strong as its politicians choose to make it . 
 Those politicians need to consider that , if Japan is ever to be accepted as a normal country , with a serious claim to leadership in East Asia , it needs to show its neighbours that , in the interests of security in the region , it can do real soldiering for democratic ends . What better way than finding new military ways to co - operate with America : something Tomiichi Murayama could usefully talk about when Tomiichi Murayama finally do have a summit , if Tomiichi Murayama have the vision - and the time .",740,Japan,A29-8194,IN TERM,True,America 's Bill Clinton and Japan 's Tomiichi Murayama,5,True

Another woman in Okinawa, the island that plays host to three-quarters of America's military bases in Japan, claims to have been raped by a ""foreigner"", possibly an American. The anger that many Japanese felt in September, when a schoolgirl was raped by American servicemen, may now grow. But the Americans also have fresh cause for irritation. It has emerged that, last year, Japan refused an American request for help in blockading North Korea's near-nuclear dictatorship. Even though Japan is protected by American troops, the Japanese were not prepared to help America face down a dictator whose missiles are aimed at Japanese cities.
Given all this, there could scarcely be a better time for Japan to propose ways of bolstering its alliance with America. An opportunity to do just that arose on November 28th, when the Japanese government unveiled its first review of defence policy since 1976. Suitably, given the importance of the subject, the new defence outline was the subject of much political discussion. Peculiarly, the review and the accompanying debates on defence had little to say about the alliance with America.
Tomiichi Murayama, the left-wing prime minister, saw them instead as an opportunity to strike two traditional gongs. First, he demanded that the defence review should reaffirm Japan's pledge not to export weapons. His rightwing coalition partners, who value the support of arms makers, oppose the export ban, which in any event is not always observed. Next Mr Murayama, to his conservative partners' annoyance, wanted to assert Japan's anti-nuclear feelings. After much disputation, both disagreements were fudged.
More important issues were entirely suppressed. Last year there was talk of creating an army unit devoted to international peacekeeping. This would have helped to bury Japan's image as a military free-rider. The defence review's final text envisages more transport aircraft, a hopeful step. But it goes no further than that. Though it mentions peacekeeping, it also emphasises that the army should be better equipped to deal with earthquakes and terrorist attacks. Japan continues to fret about domestic problems to the near exclusion of foreign ones.
Equally, some had hoped that the defence review might endorse ""collective self-defence"". This would have usefully watered down Japan's pacifist constitution, the current interpretation of which blocked Japan's participation in the blockade of North Korea. The new interpretation could have opened the way for Japan to take part in some new Asian security alliance-or, better, to help create one. Alas, the new defence review ducks this issue.
 Far from showing Japan's determination to contribute more to the American alliance, the review sees cuts in the numbers of troops, ships and fighter aircraft provided by Japan. This will encourage those Americans who say that only the withdrawal of American troops will make Japan do more for its own defence. The more that argument gathers pace, the closer Asia gets to an alarming arms race. Deprived of American protection, and facing a nuclear China, Japan would go nuclear too. So, in turn, might South Korea, Taiwan and who knows else. Japan's defence planners should try again.","JAPAN 'S security alliance with America is looking ever more vulnerable .

Forceful, charismatic and with hair so heavily oiled that a typhoon could not ruffle it, he beamed telegenically when voted into the top job by Japan's ruling coalition on January 11th.
Admired for his detailed grasp of policy and his spirited defiance of the Americans in trade talks last year, Mr Hashimoto offers a pleasing contrast to Tomchi Murayama, the outgoing prime minister, who resigned on January 5th for reasons of incompetence. ""I did my best... but in some ways, I've been working above the limits of my own ability,"" the 71-year-old socialist shrewdly observed as he stepped down.
Mr Hashimoto's rise heralds two changes, both welcome. The first is the death of Japan's socialists, who these days call themselves (in English, though not in Japanese) Social Democrats. The second, and more significant, is the gradual replacement of pork-barrel politics with genuine debate.
First, the epitaph. For almost half a century, Japan's Socialist Party was the world's most pointless opposition grouping, never winning a majority in parliament and exerting negligible influence over policy. Appealing as it did to Marxists, trade unionists, sympathisers with North Korea and other interest groups spurned by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the Socialist Party used to attract a small but dedicated following. But when Mr Murayama ditched virtually all its policies as the price of joining a ruling coalition with the LDP in 1994, he alienated the party's traditional supporters without gaining new ones.
The party will probably continue cynically to back the LDP-led coalition government until the next election, which must be held by July 1997. One of their number, Wataru Kubo, has been appointed finance minister in Mr Hashimoto's new administration. Socialist politicians need, after all, to save up for their dotage, and Japanese MPS are quite well paid. When the polls come, most of the socialists will be forcibly retired.
That much is clear. But who will win the next election is less so. The choice is between Mr Hashimoto's LDP and the New Frontier Party, led by Ichiro Ozawa, a former LDP strategist who defected in 1993.
Mr Ozawa's departure from the LDP brought to an end 38 years of unbroken conservative rule. It also enabled him, as the brains behind a patchwork coalition government, to pass an electoral-reform bill that replaced Japan's corrupt old multimember electoral constituencies with a mixture of single-member, first-past-thepost seats and others filled by proportional representation. Mr Ozawa's coalition fell apart in 1994 when the Socialist Party, then one of his allies, changed sides to team up with the LDP. But his electoral reforms remain in place, forcing would-be MPS to talk policy rather than pork.
 For the first time, the public has a choice between two heavyweight party leaders with clearly different manifestos. Superficially, Messrs Ozawa and Hashimoto have heaps in common. Both are the relatively young (Mr Ozawa is 53, Mr Hashimoto 58) sons of politicians, and both rose to prominence under the tutelage of a former prime minister, Kakuei Tanaka. Both have a reputation for arrogance.
Here the parallels cease. Mr Hashimoto's father was one of the know-all bureaucratic elite before becoming a politician. His son is cosy with the main ministries and sympathetic to their pleas that deregulation should be slow and gentle.
Mr Ozawa's dad was an outsider, a former rickshaw-puller who rose to ministerial office through force of intellect and a talent for raising money. Ozawa junior proved even more adept at attracting funds-he reputedly once collected Y25 billion ($238m now) in a single day. A past spent in smokefilled rooms will not appeal to the electorate, but Mr Ozawa's strength is that, unlike Mr Hashimoto, he has thought long and deep about how Japan needs to change.
 Mr Hashimoto's 1993 book, ""Vision of Japan"", was a limp agglomeration of self-justifying anecdotes and turgidly excessive detail, pushing no platform more radical than that of tinkering with the status quo. Mr Ozawa's ""Blueprint for a New Japan"", on the other hand, calls for nothing less than the demolition of the country's long tradition of bureaucratic control of more or less everything.
Mr Ozawa describes how, on a visit to the Grand Canyon, he noticed with amazement that there were no warning signs at the edge. In Japan, there would have been hundreds of signs, a stout fence and dozens of park keepers counselling caution. The Japanese have not yet learned to take responsibility for themselves, laments Mr Ozawa, and expect the government to coddle them.
""Real democracy"", Mr Ozawa writes, ""begins with...the autonomy of the individual."" For Japan to become a ""normal nation"" (his phrase), it needs an accountable government and a laisser faire economy. He promises to break the rule of the mandarins, with their unignorable ""advice"" to business and their selfserving interpretation of ambiguously drafted regulations. Mr Hashimoto, by contrast, pays lip service to the need for deregulation, but finds horrifying the idea of, say, market forces applied to health care or an end to farm subsidies. Mr Ozawa promises radical tax reform. He would like, he says, a startling 50% reduction in income tax, offset by a rise in consumption tax from 3% to 10% over ten years. He talks of ""aggressively opening Japan's own markets"" and strengthening the post of prime minister to slash the power of unelected bureaucrats.
The run-up to the next election will see charge and counter-charge. The LDP will try to discredit Mr Ozawa by playing up his party's links to the rich, powerful and widely detested Soka Gakkai religious sect, whose 8m members provide the largest chunk of the New Frontier Party's support. Many voters do not like the idea of a government influenced by the Buddhist group's dictatorial leader, Daisaku Ikeda. The LDP hopes to keep Mr Ikeda in the spotlight by summoning him to give evidence in parliament about his finances.
Mr Ozawa's counter-attack will be aimed at the government's plan to use over Y600 billion in taxpayers' money to liquidate seven jusen (housing loan corporations) that were buried in bad debt when property prices collapsed in the early 1990s. The scheme is as popular as cockroach sushi, partly because it will use public funds to rescue speculators who should have known what risks they were facing, and partly because it looks as though the LDP is yet again placing rural interests above urban ones. Many of the creditors to be compensated are farm co-operatives; electorally over-represented farmers are staunch LDP supporters. Mr Hashimoto was finance minister at the time the jusen made their most disastrous loans. Mr Ozawa can be counted upon to make sure that voters remember this.","UNLIKE most of his predecessors as prime minister of Japan , Ryutaro Hashimoto actually looks like a leader .

Both are the relatively young ( Mr Ozawa is 53 , Mr Hashimoto 58 ) sons of politicians , and both rose to prominence under the tutelage of a former prime minister , Kakuei Tanaka . Both have a reputation for arrogance . 
 Here the parallels cease . Mr Hashimoto 's father was one of the know - all bureaucratic elite before becoming a politician . His son is cosy with the main ministries and sympathetic to their pleas that deregulation should be slow and gentle . 
 Mr Ozawa 's dad was an outsider , a former rickshaw - puller who rose to ministerial office through force of intellect and a talent for raising money . Ozawa junior proved even more adept at attracting funds - he reputedly once collected Y25 billion ( $ 238 m now ) in a single day . A past spent in smokefilled rooms will not appeal to the electorate , but Mr Ozawa 's strength is that , unlike Mr Hashimoto , he has thought long and deep about how Japan needs to change . 
  Mr Hashimoto 's 1993 book , "" Vision of Japan "" , was a limp agglomeration of self - justifying anecdotes and turgidly excessive detail , pushing no platform more radical than that of tinkering with the status quo . Mr Ozawa 's "" Blueprint for a New Japan "" , on the other hand , calls for nothing less than the demolition of the country 's long tradition of bureaucratic control of more or less everything . 
 Mr Ozawa describes how , on a visit to the Grand Canyon , he noticed with amazement that there were no warning signs at the edge . In Japan , there would have been hundreds of signs , a stout fence and dozens of park keepers counselling caution . The Japanese have not yet learned to take responsibility for themselves , laments Mr Ozawa , and expect the government to coddle them . 
 "" Real democracy "" , Mr Ozawa writes , "" begins with ... the autonomy of the individual . "" For Japan to become a "" normal nation "" ( his phrase ) , it needs an accountable government and a laisser faire economy . He promises to break the rule of the mandarins , with their unignorable "" advice "" to business and their selfserving interpretation of ambiguously drafted regulations . Mr Hashimoto , by contrast , pays lip service to the need for deregulation , but finds horrifying the idea of , say , market forces applied to health care or an end to farm subsidies . Mr Ozawa promises radical tax reform . He would like , he says , a startling 50 % reduction in income tax , offset by a rise in consumption tax from 3 % to 10 % over ten years . He talks of "" aggressively opening Japan 's own markets "" and strengthening the post of prime minister to slash the power of unelected bureaucrats . 
 The run - up to the next election will see charge and counter - charge . The LDP will try to discredit Mr Ozawa by playing up his party 's links to the rich , powerful and widely detested Soka Gakkai religious sect , whose 8 m members provide the largest chunk of the New Frontier Party 's support . Many voters do not like the idea of a government influenced by the Buddhist group 's dictatorial leader , Daisaku Ikeda . The LDP hopes to keep Mr Ikeda in the spotlight by summoning him to give evidence in parliament about his finances . 
 Mr Ozawa 's counter - attack will be aimed at the government 's plan to use over Y600 billion in taxpayers ' money to liquidate seven jusen ( housing loan corporations ) that were buried in bad debt when property prices collapsed in the early 1990s . The scheme is as popular as cockroach sushi , partly because it will use public funds to rescue speculators who should have known what risks they were facing , and partly because it looks as though the LDP is yet again placing rural interests above urban ones . Many of the creditors to be compensated are farm co - operatives ; electorally over - represented farmers are staunch LDP supporters . Mr Hashimoto was finance minister at the time the jusen made their most disastrous loans . Mr Ozawa can be counted upon to make sure that voters remember this .",740,Japan,A29-8194,IN TERM,True,"Tomchi Murayama , the outgoing prime minister , who resigned on January 5th for reasons of incompetence",9,True

The Nikkei 225 stockmarket average climbed by nearly 3.8% on the first day of trading this year, and, despite a few wobbles, it has looked like holding on to most of those gains. Even the recent resignation of Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's prime minister, did not dent the market. If anything, the departure of a man widely deemed ineffectual could help it rise further.
The new-year performance is no flash in the pan. The Nikkei has been rising for several months, climbing by over 40% since it reached a nadir last July. But although it seems that the market is recovering from a hangover that began in 1991, the recovery will probably be a gradual one. There are several reasons--notably the problems of the banking sector, the timidity of domestic investors and a possible over-supply of new shares--to suspect that this year, at least, stocks will fail to put in a scorching performance.
A principal cause of the jump in share prices at the beginning of the year was the weakening of the yen, which fell to its lowest level in almost two years. This elicited an understandable sigh of relief from Japan's exporters, none of whom, according to the country's Economic Planning Agency, were making any money when the dollar was at Y85. Now that it is at Y105, says the agency, 70% of exporters are turning a profit.
Signs that the economy is stirring and consumption rising slightly after four years of stagnation have also helped. Along with the cheaper yen, this has encouraged economists to revise their GDP projections upwards. Most now expect the economy to grow by about 2.5% this year. The question for equity investors is how much this economic growth will benefit corporate profits.
At a price-earnings (p/e) ratio-the ratio of a firm's share price to its earnings per share-of 80 times last year's earnings, the shares that constitute the Nikkei 225 do not appear mouth-wateringly cheap. On the other hand, they have plenty of ground to make up: from March 1990 to March 1995, corporate profits collapsed by 80%, according to Jason James, an analyst at James Capel, a stockbroking firm.
It is banks that may be the main drag on any recovery of the market as a whole. Nippon Housing Loan and Hyogo bank--the two worst performers in the Nikkei last year--turned in a combined loss of 1 trillion, which dramatically reduced the total profits of the firms that are included in the average. If, as expected, the banks write off some of their mountain of bad debt this year, their profits are unlikely to improve, depressing overall earnings again this year.
Exclude banks, however, and the market's historic p/e ratio halves. Moreover, rapid growth in other corporate earnings should make valuations based on the next fiscal year's profits look less stretched. Goldman Sachs, an American investment bank, reckons that, even including financial stocks, next year's p/e will drop to the mid40s. This is not unreasonable (Japan's average p/e over the past 20 years is 38).
Such valuations, however, may not be attractive enough to lure back domestic investors in force. The recent rally has been driven mainly by foreigners (see chart) who hope that the stockmarket will take off just as growth in western economies-and their stockmarkets-peters out. Local investors, in contrast, remain decidedly lukewarm. Life-insurance companies, which own 18% of the Japanese stockmarket, are still suspicious of it. And individuals and companies continue to redeem investment trusts (mutual funds) at a fair clip.
Share prices may also suffer from a surfeit of new issues. Jesper Koll, an economist at J.P. Morgan, an American bank, points out that shareholder equity accounts for only around a fifth of Japanese firms' total capital, down from an average of 32% before the bubble burst and still far less than a figure of around 50% for American companies. A weak stockmarket has made it hard for Japanese firms to reverse this trend.
This should change. Since the beginning of this year, Japanese firms have at last been permitted to issue equity warrants again. Some are issuing equity by more straightforward means. This week, a Japanese newspaper claimed that a subsidiary of NTT, the country's telecoms provider, plans to offer Yl00 billion of shares. Banks may want to issue equity too, in order to replenish capital lost writing off their bad debts. Waiting in the wings is a government that, given a strong enough market, would still like to sell its remaining shares in various large stateowned companies. All of which means that investors should not expect the rest of the year to be as exciting as the first day.","THESE are strange times for anyone selling Japanese shares , not least because of the novelty of someone wanting to buy them .

In this article, he explains why he finds the prospect exhilarating
NATIONS are nurtured by myths.Japan is no exception. If I mention the ""third opening of Japan"", most Japanese will immediately know what I mean,just as if I were citing the need for a new Magna Carta. Unless outsiders place what is happening in Japan today in the context of our history and our myths, they will find it difficult to understand the particular turningpoint we are facing in our long evolution as a nation.
Our myths arise from the fact that we are a group of narrow islands off the coast of Asia, coming only sporadically into contact with our continental neighbours down through the years. We take comfort in our homogeneity, in our capacity to absorb influences from the mainland at our own pace, in timespans measured by centuries rather than decades. For us, much more than for Britain, ""the jungle begins at Calais""-in our case, the Korea Strait. In essence, we see ourselves as a cosy village society where consensus is the norm and where we all live by unspoken rules to make life tolerable in a green but crowded land with few natural resources.
The first great challenge to these myths came in 1853, when Commodore Matthew Perry and his heavily armed ""black ships"" dropped anchor in Tokyo (then known as Edo) Bay, and sent a message from President Millard Fillmore demanding that Japan open its doors to trade with the world. Until then, the Tokugawa Shoguns who had ruled Japan since 1603 had imposed a near-total ban on travel into or out of the country, the single exception being the port of Nagasaki, in southern Japan, where Dutch and Chinese merchants were allowed to bring in their wares.
The Shogunate officials knew that their antiquated shore batteries were no match for Perry's cannons. They had no recourse but to give way, choosing to do so as little as they could. In so doing, they set in motion a nationwide debate between advocates of continued isolation and reformers who wanted to open up the country. The debate lasted 15 years a period of great turmoil, ending only with the collapse of the Shogunate, the abolition of feudalism, and the establishment of a reform-minded central government under the direct rule of the Emperor Meiji. This series of events is known today as the first opening of Japan.
The Meiji era, which lasted for nearly half a century, was a heady time for Japan. The young reformers gathered around the emperor knew that for Japan's survival, they had to make drastic changes in the political, economic and social institutions of their country. One of the five pledges with which Meiji inaugurated his reign was to ""seek knowledge throughout the world"". His reformers created a modern army and navy, introduced capitalism, universal education, and a limited form of constitutional democracy, including the concept of equality under the law.
But the grafting of Western institutions and values on to traditional patterns of Japanese thought and behaviour was not achieved without great strain. The Meiji reformers were mostly bureaucrats and administrators, and, although they saw the need for elected parliaments, they preferred Bismarck to Gladstone-that is, they limited both the powers of parliament and the numbers of those able to vote for it. It was not until the early 1920s that Takashi Hara, the first commoner to become prime minister, introduced universal adult male suffrage. His reward was assassination. From the late 1920s, Japan became increasingly militaristic and authoritarian, embarking on adventures in China which led to confrontation with the United States and Britain and ended in disastrous defeat in the second world war.
Japan's surrender in 1945 and the sweeping reforms brought about during a six-year occupation by American forces under the command of General Douglas MacArthur constitute what many of us call the second opening of Japan. The second opening, like the first, began as a result of conflict with foreigners but continued differently because most of the changes took place under foreign duress. Yet the main planks of the occupation reforms embodied ideas and programmes begun in the Meiji period and were genuinely popular with voters: land reform, dissolution of the zaibatsu (giant financial and industrial trusts) freedom of speech and assembly, free trade unions and women's suffrage. A new constitution was drafted, including the famous article nine renouncing the right to go to war and banning the use of armed force. At least in form,Japan became a fully-fledged parliamentary democracy, with political power in the hands of the people's elected representatives.
Under the impetus of these reforms, and helped by the cold war which kept Japan firmly within America's orbit and under the protection of the us Japan security treaty, our people concentrated singlemindedly on economic recovery and growth. With no natural resources to speak of beyond the education and talents of our citizens, we imported raw materials from all over the world and exported manufactured goods to all the world. By the late 1960s we had outstripped West Germany as the non-communist world's second largest economy, surpassed in size only by the United States.
Our political progress, however, did not keep pace with the explosive growth of our economy. Conservative political forces quickly came together to form the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP But the opposition Socialists remained ideologically stuck in the rhetoric of the cold war, advocating the dissolution of the alliance with the United States and an unarmed neutrality that could only benefit the Soviet Union. Voters used the Socialists and other opposition parties to express dissatisfaction with the government of the day, but never in such numbers as to deprive the LDP of power. While we remained a parliamentary democracy in form, in practice the LDP was continuously in office, except for a brief period in 1947-48.
That long hold on power bred corruption, enhanced by the cosy village nature of Japanese society. Meanwhile, from outside Japan, and particularly from America and Europe, we began to hear increasingly shrill demands to open up our markets; outsiders also urged us to assume a diplomatic role in the international community commensurate with the size of our economy and its weight in the world.
The new frontier
To my mind, what these pressures building up inside and outside our country amount to is nothing less than a demand for the third opening of Japan-for changes as drastic and far-reaching as the ones brought about by the Meiji reformers and by the American occupation after 1945. That, indeed, is what my party, the New Frontier Party, stands for. If our programme succeeds, we will have brought about a revolution that will complete the work begun by the Meiji reformers more than 100 years ago. It will embody the most far-reaching changes that our country has ever known, and enable us to join the ranks of what I call the world's normal democratic states.
We have in Japan today the institutional forms of parliamentary government, but with a content rather different from what is regarded as normal in American or European democracies. Ours still reflects consensus politics and an isolationist mentality that excludes outsiders. The goal of the New Frontier Party is to break this mould and to bring about alternation in government between two political parties that will compete with each other on the basis of policy, not of factions or of personalities.
The Liberal Democrats' post-war monopoly of power was broken in July 1993, when Tsutomu Hata and I led a group of reform-minded colleagues to rebel against the party leadership and to establish a new party, the Japan Renewal Party. Together with other opposition parties, we won the general election that month and formed the Hosokawa coalition government. The following year, the Liberal Democrats made a deal with their sworn enemies, the Socialists, and returned to power. In reaction to this unholy alliance, all the main opposition parties except the Communists came together in December 1994 to establish the New Frontier Party.
Today, at least in form, we have the beginnings of a two-party system. On one side stands the government-a coalition of the LDP, the Socialists and the Sakigake or Harbingers, a minor party. The coalition was headed first by a Socialist, Tomchi Murayama, and now by a Liberal Democrat, Ryutaro Hashimoto. Despite their differences in ideological outlook, the LDP and the Socialists are essentially status quo parties. They mouth the slogans of reform, but in fact they want to keep their vested interests.
The new agenda
By contrast, our party is dedicated to the cause of reform. We call for thoroughgoing changes in politics, in the economy, in education and in society. In politics, we have been partially successful in that, during our brief year in power, we changed the election system from one of multi-seat districts to one which has 300 single-seat constituencies and 200 seats to be voted for on a proportional-representation list. It is somewhat like the German system. Each voter will have two votes and can cast his ballot both for his local candidate and for the party of his choice.
The world has not yet recognised the revolutionary nature of this change because the first election under the new system has yet to be held. At the latest, however, the next general election must be held in July 1997. It could come much soonerpossibly this summer or autumn. It may not immediately bring about a permanent two-party system but, as voters become used to the system, minor parties will fade away. The Socialist Party, recently renamed the Social Democratic Party, will be the top candidate for extinction.
 In each of the 300 single-seat constituencies, voters will have two clear points of view to choose betweenthat of the ruling coalition and that of the New Frontier Party. Many legislators, even those belonging to our party, are uncomfortable with this prospect. They want to build coalitions based on interests and personalities, as they have been doing till now, and are not sure that voters will respond to policybased appeals. I am convinced, however, that the New Frontier Party must make this sort of appeal to the voters.
Lessons from Iwate
My own constituency in Iwate is largely rural but I have insisted that farmers, like other citizens, must face the fact of international competition and not simply hide behind protective barriers. My recipe for change brings pain to my constituents but so far I have managed to be reelected with substantial majorities. I feel certain that, nationwide, voters will respond to political leadership if that leadership can provide a clear, compelling vision of the future and realistic steps to achieve it.
For us, there is no alternative to the third opening of Japan-to opening our markets wide to the international community, to chopping down the thicket of rules and regulations which are choking initiative, creativity and economic growth. I have no illusions about the difficulty of our task. Japan has been a regulated society for more than 1,000 years. We have a lot of people, little land, and few natural resources. For everyone to share in an economy of scarcity, there have to be regulations, and on the whole people have accepted these regulations. In modern times, the concept of fairness, of equality, has taken precedence over the concept of individual freedom. We are a society without vast gaps between rich and poor, management and workers. We would like to keep it so, but not at the cost of stifling personal freedom and individual initiative.
Despite my experience with voters in Iwate, I know that most Japanese still feel uncomfortable and disoriented by the prospect of living in a society with few regulations and where each person will have to be more self reliant and take greater responsibility for his or her own actions. Nevertheless there is no other way for Japan to move into the 21St century and survive. What we are embarked upon is a revolutionary process, and it will not be completed in a day.
We want lean government at the centre, and more power devolved to local entities. At the moment, Japan has a highly centralised system with no clear division between the central and local governments. Ultimately we will have about 300 local authorities nationwide small enough to be close to the voters, large enough to carry out effective government-to replace the present hodgepodge of prefectures, cities, towns and villages.
Educational reform may be the most important of the reforms we propose. Universal education was one of the great achievements of the Meiji reformers. Japan today is one of the world's most literate nations. But our education system remains stuck in the i9th century, emphasising rote learning and stuffing students with all sorts of relevant and irrelevant information. We need education that will foster self reliance and creativity. Group values like fairness and equality are important, but the primary emphasis must be on allowing the individual to develop. Education is an area in which we may not see results for ten years or more. But we must begin now, for we are already far behind the leaders in this field.
Japan and the world
Internationally, I have long advocated a much more active and participatory stance in world affairs, with the proviso that we remain in close partnership with the United States.
Some Japanese argue that, with the cold war over and with America no longer as overwhelming a military and economic superpower as it used to be, we should form closer ties with Asia, perhaps even play the role of honest broker between China and the United States. I disagree. I hope that China, as its economy grows and its people prosper, will successfully make the transition from authoritarianism to democratic government. I also hope that China and Taiwan will settle their differences peacefully on the basis of their common recognition that Taiwan is part of China. But these are not yet foregone conclusions. North Korea is an even more troubling neighbour than China. Asia needs the American security presence, and the us-Japan security treaty provides the means for America not only to protect Japan but to remain involved with Asia. Furthermore, Japan's own past record in Asia is not forgotten. We will be accepted and considered non-threatening by our Asian neighbours only to the extent that we retain a strong security relationship and economic partnership with the United States.
This does not mean that we will agree with America in all respects nor that we will fail to advance our own point of view. We may have as many disagreements with America as do Britain, France or Germany. But like them, our disagreements should always take place within the context of our basic alliance. Alliance with America is as essential for Japan as it is for Europe-perhaps more so, because in Asia we have nothing like NATO or the European Union.
 We want a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, and pledge to play a leading role in the affairs of that body. The United Nations is far from perfect, but it is the only international forum we have, and we want to make it better. How can we do so unless we participate in all its activities, including peacekeeping? I have proposed that Japan establish a standby force, separate from the present Self Defence Force, that will be available for UN peacekeeping duties whenever called upon by the Security Council and the secretary general.
Our constitution forbids going to war as a sovereign right of the Japanese government, but I submit that it by no means forbids Japan from placing its forces under UN command for peacekeeping duties. In fact, the preamble of the constitution talks of preserving ""our security and existence, trusting in the justice and faith of the peaceloving peoples of the world."" How can we do so, how can we ""occupy an honoured place in an international society striving for the preservation of peace, and the banishment of tyranny and slavery, oppression and intolerance,"" if we do not participate fully in UN peacekeeping?
Ultimately, the idea that underlies the third opening of Japan is the need to change society. We have to move from decisions by consensus, so called, into the essence of democracy, decision-making by the majority, with the minority accepting those decisions in the belief that today's minority will become tomorrow's majority. Our new election system is one means to this end, but I am under no illusions that we can reach our goal without repeated setbacks. Still, the 21st century is less than four years away, and it is urgent not only to get the process started but to make sure that it becomes irreversible.","Ichiro Ozawa believes that Japan, for the third time in little over a century, needs radical reform.

Voters used the Socialists and other opposition parties to express dissatisfaction with the government of the day, but never in such numbers as to deprive the LDP of power. While we remained a parliamentary democracy in form, in practice the LDP was continuously in office, except for a brief period in 1947-48.
That long hold on power bred corruption, enhanced by the cosy village nature of Japanese society. Meanwhile, from outside Japan, and particularly from America and Europe, we began to hear increasingly shrill demands to open up our markets; outsiders also urged us to assume a diplomatic role in the international community commensurate with the size of our economy and its weight in the world.
The new frontier
To my mind, what these pressures building up inside and outside our country amount to is nothing less than a demand for the third opening of Japan-for changes as drastic and far-reaching as the ones brought about by the Meiji reformers and by the American occupation after 1945. That, indeed, is what my party, the New Frontier Party, stands for. If our programme succeeds, we will have brought about a revolution that will complete the work begun by the Meiji reformers more than 100 years ago. It will embody the most far-reaching changes that our country has ever known, and enable us to join the ranks of what I call the world's normal democratic states.
We have in Japan today the institutional forms of parliamentary government, but with a content rather different from what is regarded as normal in American or European democracies. Ours still reflects consensus politics and an isolationist mentality that excludes outsiders. The goal of the New Frontier Party is to break this mould and to bring about alternation in government between two political parties that will compete with each other on the basis of policy, not of factions or of personalities.
The Liberal Democrats' post-war monopoly of power was broken in July 1993, when Tsutomu Hata and I led a group of reform-minded colleagues to rebel against the party leadership and to establish a new party, the Japan Renewal Party. Together with other opposition parties, we won the general election that month and formed the Hosokawa coalition government. The following year, the Liberal Democrats made a deal with their sworn enemies, the Socialists, and returned to power. In reaction to this unholy alliance, all the main opposition parties except the Communists came together in December 1994 to establish the New Frontier Party.
Today, at least in form, we have the beginnings of a two-party system. On one side stands the government-a coalition of the LDP, the Socialists and the Sakigake or Harbingers, a minor party. The coalition was headed first by a Socialist, Tomchi Murayama, and now by a Liberal Democrat, Ryutaro Hashimoto. Despite their differences in ideological outlook, the LDP and the Socialists are essentially status quo parties. They mouth the slogans of reform, but in fact they want to keep their vested interests.
The new agenda
By contrast, our party is dedicated to the cause of reform. We call for thoroughgoing changes in politics, in the economy, in education and in society. In politics, we have been partially successful in that, during our brief year in power, we changed the election system from one of multi-seat districts to one which has 300 single-seat constituencies and 200 seats to be voted for on a proportional-representation list. It is somewhat like the German system. Each voter will have two votes and can cast his ballot both for his local candidate and for the party of his choice.
The world has not yet recognised the revolutionary nature of this change because the first election under the new system has yet to be held. At the latest, however, the next general election must be held in July 1997. It could come much soonerpossibly this summer or autumn. It may not immediately bring about a permanent two-party system but, as voters become used to the system, minor parties will fade away. The Socialist Party, recently renamed the Social Democratic Party, will be the top candidate for extinction.
 In each of the 300 single-seat constituencies, voters will have two clear points of view to choose betweenthat of the ruling coalition and that of the New Frontier Party. Many legislators, even those belonging to our party, are uncomfortable with this prospect. They want to build coalitions based on interests and personalities, as they have been doing till now, and are not sure that voters will respond to policybased appeals. I am convinced, however, that the New Frontier Party must make this sort of appeal to the voters.
Lessons from Iwate
My own constituency in Iwate is largely rural but I have insisted that farmers, like other citizens, must face the fact of international competition and not simply hide behind protective barriers. My recipe for change brings pain to my constituents but so far I have managed to be reelected with substantial majorities. I feel certain that, nationwide, voters will respond to political leadership if that leadership can provide a clear, compelling vision of the future and realistic steps to achieve it.
For us, there is no alternative to the third opening of Japan-to opening our markets wide to the international community, to chopping down the thicket of rules and regulations which are choking initiative, creativity and economic growth. I have no illusions about the difficulty of our task. Japan has been a regulated society for more than 1,000 years. We have a lot of people, little land, and few natural resources. For everyone to share in an economy of scarcity, there have to be regulations, and on the whole people have accepted these regulations. In modern times, the concept of fairness, of equality, has taken precedence over the concept of individual freedom. We are a society without vast gaps between rich and poor, management and workers. We would like to keep it so, but not at the cost of stifling personal freedom and individual initiative.
Despite my experience with voters in Iwate, I know that most Japanese still feel uncomfortable and disoriented by the prospect of living in a society with few regulations and where each person will have to be more self reliant and take greater responsibility for his or her own actions. Nevertheless there is no other way for Japan to move into the 21St century and survive. What we are embarked upon is a revolutionary process, and it will not be completed in a day.
We want lean government at the centre, and more power devolved to local entities. At the moment, Japan has a highly centralised system with no clear division between the central and local governments. Ultimately we will have about 300 local authorities nationwide small enough to be close to the voters, large enough to carry out effective government-to replace the present hodgepodge of prefectures, cities, towns and villages.
Educational reform may be the most important of the reforms we propose. Universal education was one of the great achievements of the Meiji reformers. Japan today is one of the world's most literate nations. But our education system remains stuck in the i9th century, emphasising rote learning and stuffing students with all sorts of relevant and irrelevant information. We need education that will foster self reliance and creativity. Group values like fairness and equality are important, but the primary emphasis must be on allowing the individual to develop. Education is an area in which we may not see results for ten years or more. But we must begin now, for we are already far behind the leaders in this field.
Japan and the world
Internationally, I have long advocated a much more active and participatory stance in world affairs, with the proviso that we remain in close partnership with the United States.
Some Japanese argue that, with the cold war over and with America no longer as overwhelming a military and economic superpower as it used to be, we should form closer ties with Asia, perhaps even play the role of honest broker between China and the United States. I disagree. I hope that China, as its economy grows and its people prosper, will successfully make the transition from authoritarianism to democratic government. I also hope that China and Taiwan will settle their differences peacefully on the basis of their common recognition that Taiwan is part of China. But these are not yet foregone conclusions. North Korea is an even more troubling neighbour than China. Asia needs the American security presence, and the us-Japan security treaty provides the means for America not only to protect Japan but to remain involved with Asia. Furthermore, Japan's own past record in Asia is not forgotten. We will be accepted and considered non-threatening by our Asian neighbours only to the extent that we retain a strong security relationship and economic partnership with the United States.
This does not mean that we will agree with America in all respects nor that we will fail to advance our own point of view. We may have as many disagreements with America as do Britain, France or Germany. But like them, our disagreements should always take place within the context of our basic alliance. Alliance with America is as essential for Japan as it is for Europe-perhaps more so, because in Asia we have nothing like NATO or the European Union.
 We want a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, and pledge to play a leading role in the affairs of that body. The United Nations is far from perfect, but it is the only international forum we have, and we want to make it better. How can we do so unless we participate in all its activities, including peacekeeping? I have proposed that Japan establish a standby force, separate from the present Self Defence Force, that will be available for UN peacekeeping duties whenever called upon by the Security Council and the secretary general.
Our constitution forbids going to war as a sovereign right of the Japanese government, but I submit that it by no means forbids Japan from placing its forces under UN command for peacekeeping duties. In fact, the preamble of the constitution talks of preserving ""our security and existence, trusting in the justice and faith of the peaceloving peoples of the world."" How can we do so, how can we ""occupy an honoured place in an international society striving for the preservation of peace, and the banishment of tyranny and slavery, oppression and intolerance,"" if we do not participate fully in UN peacekeeping?
Ultimately, the idea that underlies the third opening of Japan is the need to change society. We have to move from decisions by consensus, so called, into the essence of democracy, decision-making by the majority, with the minority accepting those decisions in the belief that today's minority will become tomorrow's majority. Our new election system is one means to this end, but I am under no illusions that we can reach our goal without repeated setbacks. Still, the 21st century is less than four years away, and it is urgent not only to get the process started but to make sure that it becomes irreversible.",740,Japan,A29-8194,,False,,0,True

The then prime minister, Tomchi Murayama, started legal proceedings against the governor to force renewal.

He wants American vehicles to carry licence plates so they can be identified immediately if involved in an accident. In January, a car driven by an American marine on Okinawa killed a mother and two children.

More claims may be on the way. Historians reckon that up to 200,000 young women and girls around Asia were put into brothels by the occupying Japanese forces. Many are now dead, but their survivors want compensation and an apology. 
Last July, the previous Japanese prime minister, Tomiichi Murayama, set up an Asian Women's Fund to deal with the problem. Although it has government backing, the fund is formally private. On May 20th, the directors of the fund are to decide how much the compensation should be, and to start making payments soon after. The payouts are expected to amount to 2m ($19,000) apiece, down considerably from the Y3m-4m originally mooted. Mr Hashimoto has been told that, without an accompanying apology from the government, the former sex slaves (euphemistically referred to in Japan as comfort women"") have threatened to hurl the money back. 
Pressure on Mr Hashimoto to apologise owes much to the awe of the Miki family name in the Liberal Democratic Party(LDP). As poor as a shrine-sweeper, Takeo Miki, a prime minister in the 1970s, was one of the cleanest people in Japanese politics. His widow, Mutsuko Miki, is viewed (slightly uncomfortably) by LDP members as the epitome of the political standards they feel they ought to be embracing these days. The redoubtable Mrs Miki, who works widely on behalf of women's groups around Asia, recently resigned her unpaid job as a promoter of the Asian Women's Fund, releasing a broadside against Mr Hashimoto and the government for trying to avoid dealing with the issue directly. 
The government's line on Japan's wartime victims has been that all outstanding claims were settled with the signing of a peace treaty with America in 1951 and subsequent treaties signed with Japan's various Asian neighbours. But pressure has been mounting lately for Japan to show some form of tangible-and official-remorse for its army's wartime behaviour. In the Geneva-based International Commission of Jurists urged Japan to pay each of the former comfort women $40,000 in compensation as an interim measure. Then, last February, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights suggested that, apart from compensating the women directly, Japan ought to consider prosecuting any surviving officials involved in recruiting for the brothels and to make the official records public. 
The socialist Mr Murayama not only or-- ganised the Asian Women's Fund; he offered to send personal letters of apology to each survivor. But, since taking over as head of the coalition government in February, the LDP'S Mr Hashimoto has sought to distance himself from the whole business. 
So far, the private fund has collected only V330m, mostly from big business. Though refusing to chip in, the government has actually spent more than 600m in publicising the scheme and providing ministerial staff to run it. It may now have to spend much more. 
Insiders reckon there is little hope of raising privately the Vi billion needed to give the fund even the barest of international credibility. Meanwhile, plans for providing compensation (and apologies) to all the former comfort women, including those in China, Myanmar, Indonesia and the Netherlands, have had to be shelved. In the process, all hopes of keeping the compensation plan quietly unofficial are dwindling fast.

SHIDZUE KATO began her campaign for cheap contraception in the 1930s, after seeing young girls toiling naked in a sweltering coal mine, and even giving birth below ground. Her activities did not please the authorities. The Japanese empire was at that time rapidly over-reaching itself, and manpower was at a premium. In 1937 Ms Kato was thrown into jail for subversion. 
Japanese imperialism is a distant memory, but Ms Kato, who went on to become Japan's first female member of parliament, is still going strong, lecturing on feminist issues and chairing the Japan Family Planning League. Many of her aims have been fulfilled. Condoms are now sold from vending machines on street corners. Abortion is legal. Japanese women are marrying later, and divorcing unwanted husbands almost a third as often as American women do. The birthrate has plummeted from 4.54 (babies per woman) in 1947 to 1.46 today. 
So enthusiastic are Ms Kato's countrywomen for birth control that scaremongers predict that the Japanese race will be extinct within 100 years. They are wrong, of course, but the Japanese government is worried enough about the baby slump to restrict the availability of oral contraceptives, and to budget Y100 billion ($930m) each year for subsidising day-care centres. The creches Ms Kato approves of, but the ban on the pill makes the sprightly gg-yearold fume: 
The health ministry simply doesn't understand that a woman should be free to choose what she does with her body. Some of those bureaucrats are hopelessly out of step with the times. 
Ms Kato has watched her country rise from grubby poverty to spotless prosperity, and her fellow females abandon fingernailsplitting drudgery for lives of relative ease. The past 50 years have seen a long line of delivery boys carrying fridges, washing machines, air conditioners and microwave ovens through their front doors. Japanese women now account for a mere 2% of the population of Asia, but almost half the sales of French luxury goods in the region. Twenty-year-old Japanese women are on average 11cm (4 inches) taller than their counterparts were in the year Ms Kato was born, and they can bet on reaching the age of 83, the highest life expectancy in the world and an improvement of three decades since 1947. 
Yet few are satisfied. In Japanese politics, the female majority has virtually no say at all. In 1946 the American occupation forces gave them the vote (which they promptly used to put Ms Kato into the Diet). But half a century later, only 6.7% of Japanese lawmakers are women, a proportion well below that of most developing countries. And even this miserable statistic exaggerates their power: most female members of parliament sit in the Diet's weaker upper house; only one serves in the cabinet. 
The Japanese corporate world has hardly been more welcoming. Working women earn 57% of what their male counterparts take home, the lowest proportion among the Group of Seven (G7) nations. Only 0.3% of board members at large Japanese firms are female. 
All this was supposed to change with the passage of the Equal Employment Opportunities Bill in 1985. But the male mandarins who drafted it forgot one vital clause: the punishment for those who break the law. There isn't any. Which means that while the proportion of companies that profess to treat women equally has increased sharply in the past decade, the number that actually obey the law is small. In 1984 two-thirds of the firms answering a government survey admitted to hiring men and women separately--ie, the men were trained for skilled or managerial posts; the women were given dead-end clerical tasks. 
By 1992 this figure had dropped to 40%. But this still leaves two-fifths of companies with a stated policy of placing women in ""jobs for which the female character and sensitivity can best be used"", as several managers put it. ""Office flowers"", as they are known, are expected to serve their male co-workers with green tea ten times a day, and to devote the rest of their energies to photocopying or looking pretty. 
The current recession has hit women hardest. Firms have tied themselves in knots to avoid firing permanent (ie, male) staff, but few have hesitated to lay off temporary (ie, female) workers. Unemployment in Japan as a whole is around 3%, but female graduates face the ""super ice age"" when job-hunting. For every male Japanese university graduate looking for a job there are 1.33 posts available; the corresponding figure for women 0.45. The Togami Electric Manufacturing Co needed in 1995 to cut costs, so directors decided to sack the firm's 68 part-time workers, while sparing its 843 full-timers. All of the latter were men; all of the former were women. 
A government white paper conceded last year that the equal opportunities law has not been an outstanding success. But one or two advances have been made since it was passed. The ratio of female managers at medium to large firms increased from a pathetic 2.5% of the total in 1985 to a slightly less feeble 3.9% last year. In October 1995 a labour-ministry panel proposed abolishing a law that bars women in most jobs from staying in the office after 10pm, an old obstacle to promotion. 
An Osaka court last year ordered a company president to pay Y1.5m in damages to a 19-year-old female employee whom he pestered for sexual favours. This was the first time a Japanese woman won a suit for sexual harassment (sekuhara) that did not involve touching or defamation. The publicity surrounding lawsuits like this has helped male managers to understand that their female colleagues are not playthings. It has also sparked a craze in Japanese brothels for ""sekuhara fantasies"", where the customer pays to molest a prostitute dressed up as a secretary. 
Japanese feminists have a reputation for excessive meekness and patience. In a culture where women are expected to use longer, politer verb forms than men, and young girls are taught never to stop smiling, no matter how angry they are, it is hard to breed Gloria Steinems. 
One highly distasteful testament to Japanese female passivity is the 1994 bestseller ""A Groper's Diary"". The author, Samu Yamamoto, who confesses to having lurked on crowded trains and groped a dozen women every day for 26 years, wrote that most victims were too embarrassed to cry out. He said he would never dare practise his noxious hobby in the United States, because the women there are ""tough"" and would have him thrown in jail. 
Not all Japanese women conform to the submissive stereotype. Female activists protesting against a proposal to restrict abortion rights had to be forcibly evicted from the health ministry in 1975. Another feminist group rose to notoriety in the 1970s by donning pink helmets and storming into workplaces to denounce men suspected of adultery. Housewives in Hiroshima prefecture, furious at their local mayor's decision not to build a new hospital for the old (whose care almost always falls on female shoulders), forced through a referendum, and deposed him in March this year. 
Younger Japanese women are losing their fear of being thought ""un-feminine"" if they speak their minds. Teenage girls are increasingly annexing the curter ""male"" speech patterns for their own use. In 1993, a women's group suggested that condom packets carry an anti-rape warning. (Manufacturers rejected the idea.) 
Following an official finding that the average Japanese husband spends six minutes each day helping with the housework, a Hosei university lecturer, Yoko Tajima, declared: ""A man who can't wash his own underwear isn't an adult."" 
One issue that particularly outrages Japanese feminists is their government's failure to compensate the ""comfort women"", survivors of the government's compulsory prostitution programme during the war in the Pacific. About 200,000 women, mostly Korean but some native Japanese, some as young as 12, were forced at gunpoint to serve in front-line brothels. 
Most died of ill-treatment or committed suicide out of shame, so only a handful remain who might claim damages. But the Japanese government refuses to compensate even these few. Tomiichi Murayama, a former prime minister, set up a fund to collect private contributions to help comfort women pay their medical bills. Hardly any money has been raised. 
Several thousand Japanese women have signed petitions, attended rallies, and handed out fliers protesting at this lack of remorse. But whereas hundreds of Korean former sex slaves have come forward to testify against the government, not a single Japanese victim has revealed herself. 
This, says Chizuko Ueno, a women's studies lecturer at Tokyo university, ""shows the limitations of Japanese feminism"". One of the few victories of the comfort-women campaign involved Okamoto Ltd, a firm that made a fortune by supplying contraceptives to ""comfort stations"". In 1993 activists persuaded the company to stop selling condoms under its wartime brand name, ""Super Military Assault"". 
Japanese women, Ms Kato points out, are now among the best educated and the richest in the world, but ""we need to push ourselves forward more, to elbow our way into more decision-making jobs."" If there is anything she has learned during 60 years of struggle, she adds, it is that men's attitudes will not change unbludgeoned. ","Much has changed since Shidzue Kato, the grandmother of Japanese feminists, first started agitating for easy access to birth control 
SHIDZUE KATO began her campaign for cheap contraception in the 1930s, after seeing young girls toiling naked in a sweltering coal mine, and even giving birth below ground. Her activities did not please the authorities. The Japanese empire was at that time rapidly over-reaching itself, and manpower was at a premium. In 1937 Ms Kato was thrown into jail for subversion. 
Japanese imperialism is a distant memory, but Ms Kato, who went on to become Japan's first female member of parliament, is still going strong, lecturing on feminist issues and chairing the Japan Family Planning League. Many of her aims have been fulfilled. Condoms are now sold from vending machines on street corners. Abortion is legal. Japanese women are marrying later, and divorcing unwanted husbands almost a third as often as American women do. The birthrate has plummeted from 4.54 (babies per woman) in 1947 to 1.46 today. 
So enthusiastic are Ms Kato's countrywomen for birth control that scaremongers predict that the Japanese race will be extinct within 100 years. They are wrong, of course, but the Japanese government is worried enough about the baby slump to restrict the availability of oral contraceptives, and to budget Y100 billion ($930m) each year for subsidising day-care centres. The creches Ms Kato approves of, but the ban on the pill makes the sprightly gg-yearold fume: 
The health ministry simply doesn't understand that a woman should be free to choose what she does with her body. Some of those bureaucrats are hopelessly out of step with the times. 
Ms Kato has watched her country rise from grubby poverty to spotless prosperity, and her fellow females abandon fingernailsplitting drudgery for lives of relative ease. The past 50 years have seen a long line of delivery boys carrying fridges, washing machines, air conditioners and microwave ovens through their front doors. Japanese women now account for a mere 2% of the population of Asia, but almost half the sales of French luxury goods in the region. Twenty-year-old Japanese women are on average 11cm (4 inches) taller than their counterparts were in the year Ms Kato was born, and they can bet on reaching the age of 83, the highest life expectancy in the world and an improvement of three decades since 1947. 
Yet few are satisfied. In Japanese politics, the female majority has virtually no say at all. In 1946 the American occupation forces gave them the vote (which they promptly used to put Ms Kato into the Diet). But half a century later, only 6.7% of Japanese lawmakers are women, a proportion well below that of most developing countries. And even this miserable statistic exaggerates their power: most female members of parliament sit in the Diet's weaker upper house; only one serves in the cabinet. 
The Japanese corporate world has hardly been more welcoming. Working women earn 57% of what their male counterparts take home, the lowest proportion among the Group of Seven (G7) nations. Only 0.3% of board members at large Japanese firms are female. 
All this was supposed to change with the passage of the Equal Employment Opportunities Bill in 1985. But the male mandarins who drafted it forgot one vital clause: the punishment for those who break the law. There isn't any. Which means that while the proportion of companies that profess to treat women equally has increased sharply in the past decade, the number that actually obey the law is small. In 1984 two-thirds of the firms answering a government survey admitted to hiring men and women separately--ie, the men were trained for skilled or managerial posts; the women were given dead-end clerical tasks. 
By 1992 this figure had dropped to 40%. But this still leaves two-fifths of companies with a stated policy of placing women in ""jobs for which the female character and sensitivity can best be used"", as several managers put it. ""Office flowers"", as they are known, are expected to serve their male co-workers with green tea ten times a day, and to devote the rest of their energies to photocopying or looking pretty. 
The current recession has hit women hardest. Firms have tied themselves in knots to avoid firing permanent (ie, male) staff, but few have hesitated to lay off temporary (ie, female) workers. Unemployment in Japan as a whole is around 3%, but female graduates face the ""super ice age"" when job-hunting. For every male Japanese university graduate looking for a job there are 1.33 posts available; the corresponding figure for women 0.45. The Togami Electric Manufacturing Co needed in 1995 to cut costs, so directors decided to sack the firm's 68 part-time workers, while sparing its 843 full-timers. All of the latter were men; all of the former were women. 
A government white paper conceded last year that the equal opportunities law has not been an outstanding success. But one or two advances have been made since it was passed. The ratio of female managers at medium to large firms increased from a pathetic 2.5% of the total in 1985 to a slightly less feeble 3.9% last year. In October 1995 a labour-ministry panel proposed abolishing a law that bars women in most jobs from staying in the office after 10pm, an old obstacle to promotion. 
An Osaka court last year ordered a company president to pay Y1.5m in damages to a 19-year-old female employee whom he pestered for sexual favours. This was the first time a Japanese woman won a suit for sexual harassment (sekuhara) that did not involve touching or defamation. The publicity surrounding lawsuits like this has helped male managers to understand that their female colleagues are not playthings. It has also sparked a craze in Japanese brothels for ""sekuhara fantasies"", where the customer pays to molest a prostitute dressed up as a secretary. 
Japanese feminists have a reputation for excessive meekness and patience. In a culture where women are expected to use longer, politer verb forms than men, and young girls are taught never to stop smiling, no matter how angry they are, it is hard to breed Gloria Steinems. 
One highly distasteful testament to Japanese female passivity is the 1994 bestseller ""A Groper's Diary"". The author, Samu Yamamoto, who confesses to having lurked on crowded trains and groped a dozen women every day for 26 years, wrote that most victims were too embarrassed to cry out. He said he would never dare practise his noxious hobby in the United States, because the women there are ""tough"" and would have him thrown in jail. 
Not all Japanese women conform to the submissive stereotype. Female activists protesting against a proposal to restrict abortion rights had to be forcibly evicted from the health ministry in 1975. Another feminist group rose to notoriety in the 1970s by donning pink helmets and storming into workplaces to denounce men suspected of adultery. Housewives in Hiroshima prefecture, furious at their local mayor's decision not to build a new hospital for the old (whose care almost always falls on female shoulders), forced through a referendum, and deposed him in March this year. 
Younger Japanese women are losing their fear of being thought ""un-feminine"" if they speak their minds. Teenage girls are increasingly annexing the curter ""male"" speech patterns for their own use. In 1993, a women's group suggested that condom packets carry an anti-rape warning. (Manufacturers rejected the idea.) 
Following an official finding that the average Japanese husband spends six minutes each day helping with the housework, a Hosei university lecturer, Yoko Tajima, declared: ""A man who can't wash his own underwear isn't an adult."" 
One issue that particularly outrages Japanese feminists is their government's failure to compensate the ""comfort women"", survivors of the government's compulsory prostitution programme during the war in the Pacific. About 200,000 women, mostly Korean but some native Japanese, some as young as 12, were forced at gunpoint to serve in front-line brothels. 
Most died of ill-treatment or committed suicide out of shame, so only a handful remain who might claim damages. But the Japanese government refuses to compensate even these few. Tomiichi Murayama, a former prime minister, set up a fund to collect private contributions to help comfort women pay their medical bills. Hardly any money has been raised. 
Several thousand Japanese women have signed petitions, attended rallies, and handed out fliers protesting at this lack of remorse. But whereas hundreds of Korean former sex slaves have come forward to testify against the government, not a single Japanese victim has revealed herself. 
This, says Chizuko Ueno, a women's studies lecturer at Tokyo university, ""shows the limitations of Japanese feminism"".

His implication was that the job of a politician is to bring back pork, in the form of new roads, bridges or railways, to his constituents. Kanemaru was disgraced by scandal in 1992 and has since died, but his dictum is still observed: diligent distribution of cash rather than making speeches about national policy is how Japanese politicians get elected. 
The reform of the electoral system for Japan's lower house was supposed to help put a stop to grubby money politics. Under rules passed by the Diet (parliament) in 1994, multi-member constituencies will be abandoned for the next election, due by July 1997. Would-be members of parliament will fight for 300 single-member constituencies plus zoo seats filled by proportional representation. 
Just how these reforms are to reduce the influence of money in politics has always been a bit unclear. Some people have said that the new constituencies, with getting on for half the number of voters of the old ones, will mean that candidates will not have to spend so much money to secure election. Others have claimed that a candidate will find it impossibly expensive to buy the extra number of voters he needs to win a single-seat constituency. So money will play a secondary role. Candidates, runs this optimistic argument, will have to compete on policies. 
It is true that there are a few more political ideas floating around than there were. Ichiro Ozawa, the leader of the New Frontier Party, the largest opposition group, has some good ideas about deregulating the Japanese economy (though they have singularly failed to grab the attention of most Japanese). Ryutaro Hashimoto has something that journalists are supposed to call vision. But, generally, the political debate in Japan has not noticeably moved to a higher plane. 
It is hard to see how it could have done. In parliament both the main opposition group and the government are uneasy coalitions of parties or groups of very different political persuasions. The government itself is a coalition of conservatives and socialists; their only common principles seem to be gleaned from the writings of Machiavelli. 
So it is largely business as usual. In Japan, this means staying in power by distributing goodies to and generally cultivating the local electorate. Politicians send flowers to the bereaved and cards and presents to newly-weds. They try to find jobs for their constituents. Most important, as Kanemaru pointed out, they do their best to distribute largesse from the central government. 
Many in the Diet, especially but not exclusively those in smaller parties, would now rather the reforms had never taken place; among those with second thoughts, it is believed, is Morihiro Hosokawa, who, as prime minister, pushed them through. Tomiichi Murayama, whose Social Democrats face extinction at the next election, and who preceded Mr Hashimoto as prime minister, made an abortive attempt in June to introduce a bill to reverse the electoral reforms. He will probably try again in October, when the Diet reconvenes. Takayoshi Miyagawa, a political pundit, reckons that around four-fifths of the Diet would support a move back to the old electoral system, or a variation of it. 
The problem for many politicians, but especially for newcomers to the Diet, is that money, far from becoming less important, has become more so. Candidates for the new single-member constituencies have some 75% more voters to consider. With three-fifths of the seats elected by simple majority voting, the risks of not having enough of the stuff are higher. Small parties and newcomers are squealing that they do not have the wherewithal. 
Who does? Generally those with inherited seats. Almost a third (163) of the seats in the present Diet are inherited; 20 years ago the proportion was less than lo%. Of today's 163 seats, io8 are held by Liberal Democrats-which, given that the LDP spent 38 years in power, is perhaps unsurprising (many of the rest are ex-LDP as well). The Japanese sum up the advantages of inherited seats in three words:jiban (control of the constituency organisation); kanban (the value of the family name); and kaban (the money bag). 
Diet members who do not belong to the LDP with its legendary grass-roots machinery, and have not inherited their seats, are panicking. Since selection for some singlemember seats means, inevitably, disappointment for the loser, there are thrilling battles in the LDP itself The best known of these is between two heavyweights: Keizo Obuchi, the right-hand man of Noboru Takeshita, who runs the biggest faction in the Liberal Democrats; and Yasuhiro Nakasone, a former prime minister. Both politicians come from Gunma prefecture. Both are desperate to lay their hands on the nomination for the constituency, since neither wants to suffer the indignity of being elected by proportional representation. Serious scraps for Liberal Democratic nominations are going on in zo other singlemember constituencies. 
The electorate should also be worried. Mr Miyagawa points out that Japan has introduced single-member constituencies twice before: for six general elections after the Diet was set up in 189o, and for two in the 192os. Both times single-member constituencies were subsequently abandoned in favour of multiple ones, partly because of an increase in corruption. In an opinion poll published in April, only 4% of people questioned thought that politics would be better as a result of these changes. 
However, the reforms are unlikely to be reversed. The committee in charge of organising the Diet's agenda is controlled by the LDP. More than any other party, it stands to gain if the new system wipes out smaller parties. All of which means that the Japanese will probably have a general election in the autumn, before the reforms can be reversed. And the LDP is likely to walk it.
